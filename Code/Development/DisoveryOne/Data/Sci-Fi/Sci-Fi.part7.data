RED PLANET
 

 
 

 

 


 RED MARS FADE IN: EXT. EARTH - VIEWED FROM SPACE A perfect blue marble - clouds, oceans, continents. A voice begins to speak. An older, wise voice. Bud Chantilas. We'll meet him later. CHANTILAS (V.O.) The Earth. From space. In all its glory, the most perfect, self-regulating organism you could imagine. We went out there; we turned around; we looked back; we saw it. You'd think we'd behold and learn something. (beat) We didn't. The DATE APPEARS in one corner of the screen. 1961. CHANTILAS (V.O.) It was 1961 when we first went into space. There were four billion people in the world. The POPULATION APPEARS in the other. CHANTILAS (V.O.) And at a rate that was scarcely comprehensible, we began to poison and populate our planet. DATE SPINS, the POPULATION as well. The big, sparkling blue marble that is Earth begins to lose its luster and slowly turns gray. By the year 2000, the population is six billion. CHANTILAS (V.O.) We increased by 80 million people a year. Pumped out our toxins beyond measure. Destroyed our resources killed forests, trees, plants, animals...Anything that couldn't be trademarked and sold at a profit we annihilated without a thought. We killed half of what was on the planet. We didn't care. Right about the millennium, we got another warning... DISSOLVE TO: PERFECTLY ROUND LILY PAD in the midst of a pond. Surrounded by hundreds of dead, dying and deformed frogs. CHANTILAS (V.O.) We killed all the frogs. Every frog on the face of the planet. We'd killed species before, sure, even a genus or two. But this time we wiped out an entire phylum. As the frogs breathe through their skin and react to toxins in the environment faster, this should have been a warning, canary in the coal mine kind of thing. The last frog dies. CHANTILAS (V.O.) Nah, we didn't pay any attention to that either. The only people who were really upset were the French. And no one really likes the French. We - DISSOLVE BACK TO: EXT. EARTH - VIEWED FROM SPACE DATE and POPULATION begin to WHIR again. The planet grows dimmer and dimmer. The oceans grayer and grayer. CHANTILAS (V.O.) By 2050 there were 12 billion people. It took us 100 years to go from the Industrial Revolution to putting a man in space. It took us only another 100 to poison and overpopulate the planet so seriously that if we didn't go out and find somewhere else to live, we realized we were gonna die out as a species ourselves in the next two generations. FADE OUT. FADE IN: A billion stars. We PULL BACK THROUGH - EXT. ARES - DAY A spaceship unlike anything you've seen. Thirteen spheres up front, cuboctoahedral packing. The MEV (Mars Entry Vehicle), a large cylinder behind. The whole thing is slowly turning. SUPERIMPOSE: FIRST MANNED MISSION TO MARS (DAY 190) The ship floats by to reveal - EXT. MARS Red, huge, and very close. OVER which we hear - BOWMAN (V.O.) Houston, we are go for Mars orbit acquisition. CAPCOM (V.O.) You are go. Nice flight. Godspeed. Engines light up in the back of the craft. The ship heads down towards Mars. Enters orbit. Disappears around the back side. SUPERIMPOSE: MARS - FOURTH PLANET FROM THE SUN The WORD SUN STARTS TO BLAZE BRIGHTER AND BRIGHTER, FILLING the SCREEN until we are LOOKING AT - EXT. SUN A writhing ball of plasma. The surface roils, waves of energy pass by and a flare starts to grow and expand out from one quadrant like a giant volcanic eruption. INT. SOLAR OBSERVATORY (EARTH) - DAY Two SOLAR ASTRONOMERS stare with mouths agape at the heliostat. Monitors around record the event as well. SOLAR ASTRONOMER Jesus...It's gotta be 800,000 miles long. It's gonna shut down every comm satellite on this side of the planet. ALARMS are starting to BUZZ. SOLAR ASTRONOMER The good news is it's directional, most of it's gonna miss us. INT. MISSION CONTROL (HOUSTON) - DAY More ALARMS. Science Officer, ANDY LOWENTHAL, turns to the Flight Director, MATT RUSSERT. LOWENTHAL The bad news is it's directional, and most of it's going toward Mars. Sub-light speed. It'll take 40 minutes to get there. RUSSERT Let 'em know. He looks to the Capcom, JOHN SKAVLEM. News gets worse. SKAVLEM No comm. They're on backside. They'll be clear in...40 minutes. (NOTE All the crew in mission control wear small Projected Image Monocles (PIMs) over their dominant eye. There are no giant viewscreens dominating the room as in missions past. When so moved, the flight director can throw an image on a large general viewscreen. But unless noted, there are no projected images in the room.) EXT. MARS ORBIT - NIGHT Dark side of Mars. The Ares is a slightly shining speck, moving towards the horizon and light. At 17,000 mph. INT. ARES - FLIGHT DECK - NIGHT Commander KATE BOWMAN is at the helm. She's got a kind of quiet assurance. You'd like her. Mission co-pilot ED SANTEN is beside and behind her. She speaks into a mike to rest of the ship - BOWMAN We have stable orbit. We've got three laps around, ninety minutes each. In four and a half hours, we will launch the Mars Entry Vehicle. ROBBY GALLAGHER floats in through the hatch in the back. He's been waiting 309 million miles for this - GALLAGHER Are we there yet? Kate shakes her head. She's about to respond when - EXT. SPACE They just clear the edge of the planet, lights hit them and... INT. ARES - FLIGHT DECK Wham. One light starts to flicker to red. And then another. Some just go off. BOWMAN What the hell?? Santen reaches for the RADIO as it begins to blare STATIC. SANTEN Comm's out. Bowman begins to rapidly reset states. Some hold, some flip back to red. Things are bad, but she's calm. Decides. BOWMAN Single event upsets. All over the board. Latch up. Free flow. We're gonna lose chips. Shut it down. SANTEN Shut it down? Safety BUZZERS start to go off. BOWMAN Everything. SEP, some kind of massive flare. (then; into the intercom) Gentlemen, correction, we will launch on this pass. In fact...in five. Santen is shutting off every system he can get his hands on. She reaches to finish it off herself. BOWMAN Proton flux. MULTIPLE Event Upsets. Ed, bye. Santen is out of his seat and heading back as fast as he can. Gallagher behind him. ALARMS ring now as he rushes out, the artificial gravity begins to fail. INT. ARES - MULTIPLE DECKS The crew madly scrambling everywhere. On the MEV DECK, BUD CHANTILAS, Chief Science Officer (60s, graying) is pulling himself into a spacesuit. Popping out of his bunk and into the wall, CHIP PETTENGILL (30s, a little dour), grabs a satchel of personal possessions and swims off down an access tube. Gallagher and Santen rush along, careening off the walls. Emerging onto the MEV deck, looking absolutely calm, COOPER BURCHENAL (40s, weathered, unconcerned) stops at an intercom station, presses a toggle - BURCHENAL Katherine, you could probably cut off that caterwauling now. I'm up from my nap. A moment later, the ALARM CEASES. INT. MARS ENTRY VEHICLE 6 High G couches are faceted about the interior walls, crew names stenciled on them. (Bowman's remains conspicuously empty.) Santen straps himself in. Chantilas, Burchenal, Pettengill, and Gallagher stream aboard. Start cinching themselves in as - INT. ARES - FLIGHT DECK - DAY Kate continues to try to shut the ship down. Some circuits do, others flicker/free flow and refuse to stop. One particular circuit will clear, but only as long as she holds it shut manually - MEV Launch Release. Only takes her a moment to decide. She's not happy, but tries not to let her concern show as - BOWMAN Gentlemen, it seems I will not be able to join you and will maintain the manual release for the MEV from the Flight Deck. SANTEN (V.O.) Commander!?! She has no time or inclination to engage in discussion about her decision. BOWMAN You are go for Mars descent, Lieutenant. On my signal. INT. MEV Santen powers up the smaller craft. Seals the door. He can't believe he's doing this, but he has no choice. SANTEN We are green across the board. The last of them finish torquing themselves down. Gallagher toggles his intercom to Bowman - GALLAGHER Promise you won't leave if we don't like it there. INT. ARES - FLIGHT DECK She responds in kind. Keeps her tone as light as she can... BOWMAN I promise. (then) Lieutenant Santen, you have control authority of the MEV. Now. She holds the circuit closed... INT. MEV Lights are starting to flicker off on the board. Waiting is not a good plan. Santen calls out quickly - SANTEN Crew secure??! ALL OF THEM Secure. Secure. Secure. Secure. Santen slams two large buttons on either side of him. EXT. ARES - MEV CYLINDER - DAY Explosive bolts blow the two halves of the cylinder away. The MEV is an icosahedron revealed inside. As this is space, and a vacuum, there is no sound. INT. MEV - DAY However, in here, it's LOUD. EXPLOSION REVERBERATES. Half a moment later, ANOTHER EXPLOSION and - EXT. ARES - DAY The MEV is blown free of the Ares. Again, oddly silent. Small maneuvering MOTORS BURN for a moment, starting the MEV out of orbit and in free fall towards Mars. It drops, drops, drops and disappears, friction blazing as... INT. ARES - FLIGHT DECK - DAY There are still free-flows all over the board. Bowman can't get them to shut down. They flicker, pop on and off. Systems start and shut down and start up again all over the ship. Checks the COMM again. Still STATIC. INT. ARES SPHERE SIX Control panel on the wall. We hear a CLICKING. Inside the panel, we see the switch sputtering on/off. It fails, arcs. Smoke begins to wisp out. INT ARES - FLIGHT DECK - DAY A red light comes on. Soft BUZZ. Kate turns. It's a smoke warning in sphere six. INT. ARES - VARIOUS DECKS - DAY Bowman rushes through A sphere that's a garden. Another with orchids growing on walls. Artwork on huge LCD screens...Pulls open panels and slaps down banks of breakers as she goes. Rooms turn dark, the artwork disappears. Only phosphorescent safety lights remain. More ALARMS. INT. ARES - SPHERE SIX Bowman yanks out a fire extinguisher. Sprays down the offending area. She is, of course, hurled across the room by the force. For a moment, though, it looks like she's succeeded. Smoke begins to wisp out again. She pushes over, anchors her feet and jams the nozzle into a fire port. Empties it. This time it seems as if she's prevailed. And then a gentle voice on the intercom. ANNUNCIATOR (V.O.) Fire. Sphere 5. Fire. Sphere 5. Smoke. Sphere 8. Smoke. Sphere 8. She still doesn't panic. Hurls herself down another access tube and... EXT. MARS - DAY Way up in the sky, we can see the tiny flare of the MEV entering the atmosphere. A moment later, a SONIC BOOM reaches us. INT. ARES Bowman fights a fire in another sphere. Dark now except for the flickering flames. This time we see them otherworldly round and glowing in the zero G. Smoke's in the air it's getting hard to breathe. She puts out the fire, but from the ALARMS, it's clear she's now fighting a losing battle. INT. ARES - MAINTENANCE LEVEL/MEV DECK - DAY Kate rushes in. Starts pulling master breakers. LIGHTS are EXPLODING as the power surges. She's surrounded by a cloud of glittering glass fragments. We can see the fire/smoke panel lit up nearby. The news is bad. Half of the lights are red. She yanks on a spacesuit. Slaps on a small oxygen container. Locks on the waist, wrists. Reaches back to what seems to be a gelatinous hood. Pulls it over her head, locks the front down and the helmet turns rigid and transparent. She throws the last breaker. Life Support. The ship is now dead, but still burning. She clips herself in with a set of safety tethers and...throws open the main hatch. INT. ARES - DAY The venting air crystallizes in a huge white plume. Papers, books, cups, clothing flies forth as well. INT. ARES - MAINTENANCE LEVEL/MEV DOCK Bowman is sucked towards the open hatch. Tethers hold. Watching all her air escape is not a calming moment. INT. ARES MULTIPLE DECKS Without oxygen, the fires subside and die. All of them. The ship is still and dead. INT. MAINTENANCE LEVEL/MEV DOCK Total silence. Fire lights are out. Kate shuts the hatch. Finally she lets herself begin to react. Starts to hyperventilate and shake inside her spacesuit. EXT. MARS SURFACE The MEV has crash-landed. It's a wreck. Air bags deflate. Half have been destroyed. The icosahedron attempts to unfold. A figure struggles out of the shattered craft, collapses on the ground. GALLAGHER It wasn't supposed to be like this. FLASHBACK - EXT. JOHNSON SPACE CENTER - DAY SUPERIMPOSE: LAUNCH MINUS 9 DAYS The air is gray, thick. Stragglers in heavy protective gear struggle through the fetid wind to an airlock on the side of... INT. NASA BRIEFING HALL - DAY ...and join hundreds of journalists in the audience. Lights dim. In front, face lit from below at a podium, Senior Scientist HAROLD ERNEST, 60s, head of the Space Exploration Office. ERNEST As many of you may know, in 2032 the Space Exploration Office began a series of unmanned flights to Mars. The entire wall behind him, 40 feet by 100 feet, is a vid screen. As he speaks the images appear. Not as if he's narrating to the footage, but as if it's voice activated. ERNEST It had been determined by 2020 that Mars harbored no life. Although beginning with the same resources as Earth four billion years ago, Mars didn't support any life beyond the microbial stage in the last 300 million years. Nor did it have an atmosphere or climate supportive of human life. Exactly as he describes it, it occurs. (Icecaps melt, temperature gradients rise, etc.). In the audience are hundreds of journalists watching. ERNEST It was, however, concluded that Mars was receptive to terraforming. If we could raise the temperature of the planet by only four degrees, the resultant melting of the ice caps would increase the density of the atmosphere, thus holding greater heat, melting the icecaps further. We could use the greenhouse effect to our benefit. To do this, we needed to increase the oxygen content of the atmosphere. Resultingly, a series of probes were sent, each releasing further and further genetically manipulated lichen and algaes designed to stand the rigors of the Martian environment while augmenting the oxygen content of the Martian atmosphere. In the last 28 years, we have sent 2200 probes. The terraforming was initially successful. We see the probes launching and bursting in aerosol deployments over the Martian surface. Algae blooms. Red, orange, green, black, burnt sienna. Every color you can imagine. Valleys covered with color. ERNEST The average temperature on Mars has increased two and a half degrees over the last three decades. The oxygen content began to increase as well. And then eleven months ago, the O2 on Mars suddenly began to decline. Soon after, all the remote sensors on the planet ceased functioning. We have no idea what's gone wrong. We need to know why. Man's very destiny may lie in the answer. The color on Mars ebbs away. ERNEST We are about to embark on the greatest mission of human exploration. By using a number of Heavy Lift Launch Vehicles and a modified close lunar cargo ship, we have created a vessel capable of journeying to Mars. We see construction being rushed along and Hab-1 (a kind of big space RV) landing and deploying on Mars as - ERNEST Three months ago, Hab-1, an unmanned living environment, was launched. In nine days Ares-1, our first manned mission, will be sent to Mars. Ladies and gentlemen, I give you the first men and women to travel beyond the reach of Earth to the next planet in the solar system. Light comes up on the crew. ERNEST Lt. Commander Katherine Bowman will supervise the flight component of our mission. Commander Bowman has 2200 hours in space. She will be assisted by Pilot and Mission Specialist Ed Santen. (next) And we're pleased to have Dr. Bud Chantilas come out of retirement as our Chief Science Officer. Bud brings a view as a generalist few can offer, with a Nobel in chemistry and a MacGregor in molecular biology. He was off getting another Ph.D., this time in... (checks) ...theology when we asked him to join us. (next) Dr. Chip Pettengill, who until recently has held the number two position in the Terraforming Office, is an expert in extremophile and cryptoendolithic biology. (then) Dr. Cooper Burchenal, late of Western BioTech has left the private sector to help us. (last) And we are also joined by Robert Gallagher. Santen turns to Kate and quietly mutters. SANTEN The janitor. His MIKE was on. It ECHOES across the room. But Gallagher's too quick to let him try to apologize anyhow. GALLAGHER That's technically space janitor. Crowd likes this. Gallagher continues - GALLAGHER When the toilet breaks 80 million miles from the nearest hardware store, they call me. Actually, they called me now 'cause then would be too late. ERNEST To be more precise, Mr. Gallagher is the Mechanical Systems Engineer. We're glad to have him along. Ernest moves on quickly. ERNEST We stand on the threshold of the most triumphant moment of the millennium. Science has brought us here, and science will take us further. CUT TO: END FLASHBACK EXT. MARS SURFACE - DAY The MEV is horrendously battered. It's a wonder they're alive. Chantilas is propped against a rock, moving a device the size of a hardback book across his abdomen. It's a kind of combination x-ray/sonogram. Doesn't like what he sees. Puts it aside for the moment without discussing it with the others. Gallagher emerges from the MEV dragging some tools and other salvaged gear. (NOTE All communication is via the VOX radios in their spacesuits.) CHANTILAS What've we got? GALLAGHER The radio's dead. Rover's dead. AMEE's dead. You gave me a shop and three months and I could get this thing set for orbital re-entry. Otherwise...it's staying here. Santen's climbed to the top of a nearby outcropping of rock. Surveys the area red sky, blue clouds, rocks. BURCHENAL Anything? SANTEN No. PETTENGILL Great. We put up with your shit for three hundred million miles, so you could crash-land us on Mars. Just fucking great. BURCHENAL By all rights, son, we should be dead. That was a decent piece of flying. SANTEN We have a mission to accomplish, people... PETTENGILL We'll be dead in eight hours anyhow when the air runs out. 'Cause megapilot missed the landing site. There is no more fucking mission. That puts it all into perspective. GALLAGHER So, where the hell are we? SANTEN The G.P.S. was tied to the radios...which are dead. Transponder on the Hab was tied to the nav computer... GALLAGHER ...which is dead. Didn't the boys at NASA pack us a compass? BURCHENAL There's no magnetic core on Mars. Wouldn't do any good. Gallagher considers all this for a moment. GALLAGHER I don't think I like this planet. CHANTILAS Best guess. Where do you think we are? Santen shrugs. As much as you can shrug in a spacesuit. SANTEN Somewhere downrange. Santen pulls his HHC out of a pocket on his thigh. 2050 descendant of a laptop. Mutters at it. It whizzes past all Hab info schematics, the standard 360 degree pan from the landing site, topo map of Mars. Zooms in to show where the Hab was deployed. SANTEN Based on the last uncorrupted nav state, and given that we were in a full manual descent with no computer correction, I'd say...in this 60x120 mile ellipse. Okay. That's big. There's a long moment of resignation. It's a little irrational, but then, re the HHC - BURCHENAL We've got every other mission variable in here, we ought to be able to figure aerobrake friction and the speed and orbit of the Ares when we exited. We should be able to close in on the downrange variables. Tighten up the ellipse. It's about the math. Gallagher can't believe it. GALLAGHER This is it. This is that moment they told us about in high school. Where one day again we'd use algebra. And it would save our lives. And I thought they were fucking kidding. Gallagher turns in frustration and walks away. Chantilas calls to him - CHANTILAS Stay in range. A thousand yards. And your radio's line of sight. GALLAGHER Right, I wouldn't want to get lost. He continues to wander off. We can hear them discussing drag coefficients and whatnot. It just makes him ill. Gallagher stares out at the Martian plain. It would be kinda cool. Except for the fact he's gonna die here. He's pissed and frightened. Yanks his HHC out. Mutters, images appear. All the Hab details. Stares at the map and then the 360 degree panorama. Back at the map. Back at the panorama. Something about it strikes him. Looks at it some more. He gets up, looks around. Looks around some more. Heads back to the guys... GALLAGHER I don't think it's about math. I don't like math, so I'm biased. I think it's about the picture. He holds out the picture of the panorama. Santen dismisses him - he's not a scientist, he's not a pilot, he should leave them alone. SANTEN We're not in that picture. If we were, we'd know where the Hab was. We're trying to figure this out. Robby ignores him, tosses a rock in the sand, wraps the the 360 degree panorama around it. Screen bends and turns translucent as he does. GALLAGHER Look, say that's the lander. At about 30 degrees in the distance, it sees this mountain with the funny top. And at about 180 degrees it sees this funny set of twin peaks. (points) Now I see this mountain over there. And these peaks over there behind me almost on a straight line. And then there's this other peak maybe, which would put us on the line, say here. Which leaves the angle to the Hab at about there... Santen and Chantilas start to manipulate their HHCs faster than you can follow. Muttering to them, hand-gesturing, cross-referencing back and forth to the map, as the ellipse shrinks and their landing location is...determined. BURCHENAL Space Janitor First Class Gallagher, nicely done. SANTEN The good news is it's an eight-hour walk. GALLAGHER There's bad news? Chantilas checks Gallagher's wrist monitor. CHANTILAS You've got seven and a half hours of air. Try not to breathe too deep. BURCHENAL Let's get the hell outta here. Chantilas struggles to his feet. As the five of them tromp away in the giant landscape... FLASHBACK - EXT. SPACE -DAY The Earth FILLS the SCREEN. And then PULLING BACK, BACK, BACK, BACK...It recedes in the distance and disappears. We CATCH UP WITH the Ares as the final launch stage fizzles out and is discarded. SUPERIMPOSE: MISSION TIME: DAY 1 INT. ARES - PRIMARY SPHERE - DAY A large open common space. Empty for the moment. Until Chantilas and Pettengill enter through an access tube. Gravity follows them around as they walk. Floor, ceiling wall...A meter on the wall with a glowing "G" points an arrow the direction of the current gravity. PETTENGILL Chief Science Officer Chantilas. (off his nod) This is trippy. Chantilas grins. He's been up so many times he's forgotten what it's like the first time. CHANTILAS You'll get used to it. When you get home, it feels weird you can't walk on the ceiling. INT. ARES - MEV DECK - DAY Gallagher comes in too fast. Stumbles up. It's just confusing. He resets. Opens up a locker, about three feet by three feet. He calls in to what seems to be a large tangle of silver pipes. GALLAGHER Good morning, AMEE. Step out carefully, we're in multi-directional gravity. AMEE, the Autonomous Mapping Exploration and Evasion unit, unfolds and steps gingerly from the cabinet. About waist high, eight legs, stereo camera eyes. Like a big silver spider. Old attachments have been sawed off and buffed down. She's a piece of off-the-shelf gear that's been modified. When the light hits her at the right angle, we can see a Marine Corps insignia still etched under the refinishing. GALLAGHER How are we after launch? I'd like to run a systems check. (as she nods) Shall we do the hokey-pokey? Just to satisfy me? She rapidly shakes each of her legs in turn. Gallagher flips on a wrist panel display. Built into the fabric of his suit. He sees what AMEE sees. GALLAGHER Take a look around. He flips off the lights. She flicks over to IR, sees just fine in the dark. Turns the lights back on. GALLAGHER And how is your C.P.U. today? A 1000 quick calculations flash by and then - "Good." GALLAGHER Okay, run the occasional self test. Let me know if anything's wrong. And back to storage. AMEE contracts and climbs back into her locker. Gallagher shuts the door. Display reads "Good-bye" and winks out. INT. ARES - KITCHEN/DINING SPHERE - NIGHT All six of them are gathered. First dinner in space. BOWMAN Any Space Adaptation Sickness? Vertigo? No? Liars. You'll wake up all night long thinking you're falling. Promise. I'll hear you scream. Status? BURCHENAL Garden's good. CHANTILAS Didn't lose a plant. BOWMAN Anything else? Gallagher holds back here a little. Not a scientist, not an astronaut. Suddenly feels like the most junior member of the crew. GALLAGHER Ahh, Commander...Bunch of the HVACs jammed from the lift-off. Reset 'em. They're fine now. BOWMAN I'll tell you what, unless we pass a recruiting station on an asteroid and you sign up for the military, you can call me Kate for the next six months, okay? GALLAGHER Okay. (as she waits; he relents) Kate. BOWMAN Why'd you come, Gallagher? Not expecting this one. Takes a sec - GALLAGHER I did two years as a mechanic at NASCAR. A year and a half at McMurdo in the South Pole. Three years on subs. I had the highest military tech ratings you can get. And I went cross-country once with my cousins in a motor home. This didn't seem so bad. BOWMAN That's why they called. Why'd you come? A beat, then - GALLAGHER You ever been to Europe? Europe's horrible. It's full of stodgy people whose ancestors didn't have the balls to go to America and try something new. Earth is gonna be like Europe. You might visit there and admire some old buildings and crap, but you wouldn't want to live there. This was like getting a call to go with Columbus to America the first time. But harder. How could you not go? Damn. Burchenal grins. BURCHENAL I don't like Europe much either, son. Didn't quite figure it the same way, but damnation, you don't turn down a phone call like that, do ya? (to Kate) You? BOWMAN I spent my entire life training to fly the biggest, fastest thing you can fly. This is it. It's the best job in the world. (points to Santen) He's going 'cause he got the second best job in space. He's a little pissed about it, but he still came. She's nailed him so precisely, Santen can only wince and look away. Pettengill just pipes up. Maybe no one's gonna ask and he wants to get it out in the open - PETTENGILL I was never supposed to come. I came 'cause my boss couldn't. He failed the medical. Heart arrhythmia. So here I am. They tapped me on the shoulder, told me I was going to Mars. I was supposed to be second in charge of the Terraforming office till I died. Chantilas's the last. They turn to him. His reason's a little different. CHANTILAS Psalm 107, verse 23 They that go down to the Sea in Ships, that do business in great waters, these see the works of the Lord, and His wonders in the deep.' So I figured how much wonder for those in space? Beat. SANTEN You're going to Mars because of a poem?? Chantilas thinks about it. He could go on about it, but... CHANTILAS Basically. INT. ARES - EXERCISE SPHERE - DAY SUPERIMPOSE: MISSION TIME: DAY 13 There's no up here, equipment is attached to the floor, ceiling and walls. Santen and Bowman are on a large spinning bicycle-driven centrifuge. Santen's pedaling. By keeping up the speed, he's able to provide enough extra gravity for Bowman, on the other side, to lift free-weights. They're both dripping sweat so it must work. TIMER goes off, they slow to a stop. Pettengill comes in. He looks a bit uncomfortable. Certainly out of his element. A little, well, puny. PETTENGILL So...required exercise. Haven't had this since grade school. SANTEN Yeah, you musta been doing some kind of reverse thing where you get small... Santen's got years in the gym. Muscles on muscles. Bowman takes a two-second evaluation of the situation. BOWMAN You're done. You can shower. SANTEN I'm not done. I was gonna... BOWMAN No. You're done. Santen can't believe he's being thrown out. But he's also a product of the military and couldn't argue if he tried. SANTEN Yes, ma'am. He leaves. Pettengill feels stupid. PETTENGILL You didn't have to do that. BOWMAN No. I did. If I didn't nip that in the bud, I wouldn't be doing my job. (then) Flying this beast is only half the job. The whole job's to get the crew in place in shape to do what they have to do. And the funny thing is, flying's the easy part. Pettengill stands abashed for a moment and then his resentment just bubbles out... PETTENGILL I just hate all those fucking guys. I feel like I've spent my entire life being the guy who was hassled in phys ed. I lost the first girl I ever cared about to some thug who could throw a football farther than I could. It's like women are hardwired to think that guys who are proficient at sports are going to be better providers. It's not like we hunt and kill our own food anymore. (then) He sells cars for a living now. Cars. I end up working on a project that may save the existence of mankind and he sells cars. This is impressively obsessive. BOWMAN You kept track of him. What happened to her? (off his look of "who?") The girl. He has no idea. She grins at him - BOWMAN Little competitive? Who's hardwired for what, Cro-Magnon guy? He can't help it, he grins, a little abashed. BOWMAN We're gonna start with the bungees. Try to quit being pissed off you weren't chosen for dodgeball, willya? PETTENGILL I'll try. Twenty years of hating the bullying motherfuckers is a hard habit to break. END OF FLASHBACK. EXT. CRASH SITE (MARS) - DAY It's quiet. And then, a slight METALLIC SOUND. We PUSH TOWARDS the MEV and IN. AMEE lies on the deck beside her storage container. A leg twitches. Then another. Servo WHINE. Gets gingerly to her feet. Eyes turn. Wriggles once as if she was stiff and cautiously makes her way outside. EXT. CRASH SITE (MARS) - DAY Looks around. Analyzes. Turns and heads off into the landscape. EXT. MARTIAN PLAIN - DAY A landscape so huge, it's hard to comprehend. Five tiny figures progress across the bottom of the frame. They've already come a long ways. Beginning to string out. Pause and regather. Pettengill stops to catch his breath. GALLAGHER How you doing? PETTENGILL Little tired. I'm okay. SANTEN You should have put more treadmill time in. PETTENGILL (sotto) Go fuck yourself. SANTEN What'd you say? PETTENGILL Ahhh...Musclehead, go fuck yourself?? They're both getting louder and louder... BURCHENAL Guys... Burchenal reaches out, checks their wrist monitors. BURCHENAL We're doing fine. In point of fact, he's using less O2 than you are. We can stop a minute. Unless you two want to shout at each other and use up your air. PETTENGILL Sorry. SANTEN Fine. I'm sorry, too. No one's sorry. They rest. Use the moment to look around. It's pretty astounding. Chantilas uses the respite to re-scan his abdomen. Puts the device away again. He's in pain but refuses to acknowledge it. GALLAGHER How you doing? CHANTILAS Things are as they are. (then) Lord. Look at it, we're on Mars. Pretty damn amazing. PETTENGILL It' weird. There's nothing here. GALLAGHER It's Mars. PETTENGILL No, I mean there's not even a trace of the algae. He kneels down, examines a rock. Nada. PETTENGILL Even if it all died, there'd be something - a dried algal mat, traces on the lee sides, something. Nothing. Nada. BURCHENAL He's right. We sent up fifty-two varietals. Blue-green, black, orange. Anhydriobiosics, chemotrauphs, even a thibacillus that could grow autotrophically on elemental sulfur. Not only are they dead, they're all just gone. I don't get it. It's like they were scoured off the rock. GALLAGHER Maybe there was never anything in this valley. As they walk, Burchenal checks his HCC. BURCHENAL If we are where we think we are - Map appears on a small screen, he mutters to it, overlays of all the algae and lichen that were on Mars appear. BURCHENAL This valley was covered with blue algae a month ago. Valley back one should have been covered in an orange-red chloroflectic. He's right. It's weird. There should be something. They crest a small rise. Below lies a valley that closes down quickly into an extremely narrow canyon. Burchenal and Santen check their HHC maps. BURCHENAL This, however, makes sense. SANTEN Debris apron. Delineated valley fill. Depositional fan... He double-checks with Chantilas. Seems they're going the right way. Chantilas leans back heavily against a rock. CHANTILAS Good. You gotta keep moving... Chantilas doesn't get up. GALLAGHER And what're you gonna do, sit here and watch? You getting old and lazy? CHANTILAS My spleen's ruptured. There's significant internal bleeding. I'm not going any further. And trying to carry me will slow you down just enough that we can all die. Robby's stunned, frantic. GALLAGHER We'll get you to the Hab. Lock out the spine impulse and you can walk one of us through it. CHANTILAS No. You won't. Santen takes charge. It's his mission now. SANTEN We build a litter. We take him. CHANTILAS (stern) Chain of command once we hit the surface starts with me. And I'm ordering you to go, Lieutenant. Now. (turns to Robby) I've only got about forty minutes. There's really not much pain. Put me around the corner where I've got a view. They lift him to the other side of the rock. Gallagher stays with Chantilas a moment. Stricken, speechless. Inside Gallagher's helmet, we can see as the tears roll down. Then - CHANTILAS It's okay. I'm not sorry I came. Gallagher takes one last look over his shoulder. We are already PULLING BACK, BACK, BACK. Tiny figures in the landscape once again. One left behind. INT. MISSION CONTROL - DAY Tense. Flight Director Russert watches as Skavlem mutters into the mike. SKAVLEM Ares, this Houston, do you read? Ares, this Houston, do you read? Skavlem continues in the b.g. as - LOWENTHAL What do you want to do? RUSSERT Get every dish in the Deep Space Network pointed at Mars. (doesn't like it, but) Declare a spacecraft emergency. EXT. MARS SURFACE - DAY Chantilas has toppled over. Unmoving. We GO WIDE, WIDE, WIDE and... EXT. HILLSIDE (MARS) - DAY The four of them trudge up a long hill. The summit is a dozen steps away. Santen is the first to reach it. He looks out over the horizon. Turns back to the others - SANTEN You're gonna like this. HIS POV We see what he sees, as do the others as they arrive - not that far in the distance, in the valley below, they can see the lab shining in the sun. BACK TO SCENE BURCHENAL Twenty-six months of food, water and air, gentlemen. PETTENGILL We're saved... They run down the hillside. For the first time we get a feeling for the .38 gravity. Bouncing sixteen foot steps. Like little kids as they come bounding down. EXT. VALLEY FLOOR (MARS) - DAY They keep running and leaping and coming. Until the first one begins to slow. It's not from exhaustion. And then the second and the third. It's from horror. The Hab is in tatters. Roof is gone, walls are gone. Nothing but the titanium ribs remain. They approach. The insides are not much better. It's destroyed. There's no food. There's no water. There's no air. EXT. MARS - HAB - DAY They search. The news doesn't improve. SANTEN What the fuck happened here? PETTENGILL Jesus... Burchenal continues to look around for a moment. It doesn't matter what happened. It's over. Shakes his head at Gallagher. BURCHENAL How's your air? GALLAGHER (checks) Twenty-two minutes. BURCHENAL I'm not much better. SANTEN What the fuck... He kicks angrily at what's left of the structure. Storms off. It takes Pettengill a moment to process it, but... PETTENGILL We're all gonna die, aren't we? INT. ARES - MAINTENANCE LEVEL - NIGHT Pitch black except for the electroluminescent panels she's stuck around the room. She cracks another one on. They work like glowsticks, but the size of menus. She's jumpered the circuits. Multimeters Velcroed all over the place. Trying to reboot the entire ship. Checks her loads, balances one more jumper, throws a breaker. The SHIP GROANS, FLICKERS TO LIFE, DIES. She checks a meter, changes a jumper, tries again. This time the SHIP GROANS, FLICKERS TO LIFE and STAYS ON-line. The systems begin to come alive around her. Panels light up, turn from red to green. Lights start to come on. Gravity returns. INT. ARES - VARIOUS SPHERES - NIGHT Bowman moves through. The place is a mess. Soot and fire stains in some spheres. Smoke damage in all. Flowers destroyed. The garden is half-wrecked. She manually opens a set of valves in one room. AIR HISSES in from an emergency supply. She checks a meter in her hand, checks again to be sure. Folds back the helmet of her suit. Breathes. INT. ARES - FLIGHT DECK - NIGHT Bowman tries to bring the rest of the ship back to life. Half a dozen systems are just plain dead and have to be locked out. Things are not good. Light's beginning to come up. Moments away from entering front-side orbit. Kate opens a panel marked OBS and throws a series of switches. EXT. ARES - NIGHT Door slides open. A small optical receiver is seen. They clear the dark side and burst into the light. INT. ARES - FLIGHT DECK - NIGHT On a large viewscreen, Bowman can now scan the surface to about a one meter resolution. Searches. Starts wide, scanning the edge of the horizon as it comes into view. Picks up the glint of the MEV. Zooms in. At first there's nothing but the crashed MEV in profile. (Like a spy satellite, we are an an EXTREME ANGLE, SLOWLY REVEALING more as the Ares grows less oblique and tracks overhead.) Then the severity of the damage comes clear. Bowman tries not to react. Nothing else is there. No sign of activity or escape. The footprints are beyond the resolution of the camera. There's no reason to believe anything but they're all dead. EXT. HAB & ENVIRONS (MARS) - DAY Gallagher and Burchenal sit on rocks nearby. Not exerting themselves. Checking their monitors. BURCHENAL Maybe we got what we deserved. We ignored science and truth on one planet and poisoned it beyond repair. Then tried to get science to save us on another. Maybe it's the inconsistency that did us in. Burchenal points at a depression a few hundred yards away. BURCHENAL (then; points) That's what they call the datum. Sea level. If there was a sea. Or when there was a sea, that's where it was. You can tell 'cause the sand was created by what's called the fluvial process where water breaks rocks into smaller and smaller pieces. We're the first men on Mars. Even if it isn't gonna last long. (then) Would you rather I shut up so you can die quietly? GALLAGHER Nah, you can keep talking. It's kinda peaceful. In the b.g., headed towards a ridge of rocks, we can see a lone figure making its way along. It's Pettengill. He steps around the ridge. We can hear his RADIO WHOOOSH TO STATIC as he loses line of sight communication with the others. Up ahead of him, standing on the edge of an enormous drop-off, just staring out into space, is Santen. His back is to us. Pettengill walks towards him. Santen still doesn't hear. Santen's radio is off. BEETHOVEN BLARES in his helmet. A 3000 foot drop at his feet. It is magnificent. As Pettengill approaches and Santen remains unaware, the scene seems less and less innocuous. We fear for him. Until... Pettengill just walks right up beside him and stares out at the chasm as well. Santen LOWERS his MUSIC. They stand there silently for a moment. Santen has some kind of weak-ass epiphany... SANTEN Look, I'm sorry. I owe you an apology. I've been a dick. I pick on people who are weaker than I am. It's way too little, way too late. But Pettengill doesn't let on. Just nods. As if he's forgiven him. Steps away and OUT OF FRAME. We HOLD ON Santen a moment and...Pettengill has picked up what would be a 250-pound rock back on Earth and is heaving it with all his might into Santen from behind. It slams into him, bending him in half, knocking his feet out from under him. For half-a-moment we think Santen might regain his footing. But he doesn't. He starts to fall past the edge of the cliff. Slowly. In .38 grav SLOW MOTION. Flailing. Twisting in the air. As he falls, looking up, he slaps OFF the MUSIC, the RADIO COMES BACK ON. Pettengill leans over the edge. PETTENGILL Fuck you. Fuck you. I'm gonna die. But I'm gonna spend the next five minutes of my life completely satisfied knowing I killed you. SANTEN No, you won't, because... Pettengill shakes his head and steps back out of the line of sight. Santen's last taunt turns to STATIC. PETTENGILL Yes, I will. He turns and walks away. EXT. MARS - HAB - DAY Pettengill returns to the others. He can hear over the RADIO as he approaches - BURCHENAL Johannes Kepler was the first to accurately map the orbit of the planet. In 1609. PETTENGILL Santen's dead. They turn. But not surprised. They just figure he - BURCHENAL Chewed through his air... PETTENGILL He threw himself off the cliff. GALLAGHER Ouch. Burchenal bows his head down for a moment, overcome. But it's not Santen. It's the bigger picture... BURCHENAL It's not often you get to fail when 12 billion people are counting on you. Gallagher's got more pressing problems. Checks his wrist. unnerved. GALLAGHER I'm at under a minute here. You guys know what this is gonna be like? BURCHENAL Hypoxia? Dizzy. Skin'll tingle. Vision narrows. Then anoxia. Shock, convulsions, acidosis. GALLAGHER Gonna hurt? PETTENGILL Yeah. A WARNING TONE GOES OFF on Gallagher's SENSOR. He starts to gasp. Opens his mouth wide. Sucking in and out air that's worth less and less to his body. He begins to claw at the air. It's not pretty to watch. Spins about seeking some release. None forthcoming. Claws some more. Falls to his knees. The others can barely watch. They know they're next. Gallagher's growing more claustrophobic and crazed. Falls the rest of the way to the ground. Still clawing at the air. It's horrible to see. And in one last desperate, angry, trapped-feeling move, reaches up and unhooks the front of his helmet and throws it back. Croaks out a faint epitaph as he collapses. GALLAGHER Fuck this planet. And he's still. Still. And then in a last reflexive shudder. Gasps. Gasps again. Takes in the worthless Mars atmosphere. And right when we think it's entirely over...Takes in some more. Breathes again. And again. Opens his eyes. GALLAGHER I'm not dead. The other two are watching in amazement. GALLAGHER I'm not dead. It's like being at high altitude. There's not much air here. But... Takes him a minute to catch his breath, but... GALLAGHER We're not gonna die. Burchenal's suit ALARM GOES OFF. He doesn't screw with gasping in the suit. Just opens the damn thing up and prays. Breathes. Raggedly. BURCHENAL It ain't much. But it'll do. He looks around, puzzled. BURCHENAL What the hell's going on here?? Pettengill's ALARM GOES OFF as well. Much more tentatively he removes his helmet. Breathes. He's not really rejoicing like the others. PETTENGILL I thought we'd be dead. The enormity of what he's done strikes him. PETTENGILL I thought we'd be dead. They all breathe the thin Martian air for a moment. GALLAGHER God, if Santen had only waited five more minutes. What a waste... OFF Pettengill's completely unsettled face... INT. ARES - FLIGHT DECK STATIC on the comm clears. A brief caesura then - BOWMAN Copy. SKAVLEM (V.O.) Roger, Ares. Good to hear from you. We believe you may have suffered a proton field upset. What is your status? Silence. Silence. Bowman struggles to maintain control. Tear runs down. Takes a deep breath. BOWMAN MEV launched. Radio contact zero. Visual shows crash site, one body, no motion. Believe entire crew to be End of Mission. Ares systems check at below 70 percent. Telemetry to follow. She punches a button. Starts to upload it to them. BOWMAN Air purge in fire control degraded orbital path. Current orbit unstable. Thirty-two hour projected failure. Do you copy, Houston? INT. MISSION CONTROL - DAY The telemetry has come in. Russert puts it up on the common viewscreen. Ship status and all the failures are displayed. It's a disaster. SKAVLEM Roger. We copy that. He lets go of the mike. Can't help himself. SKAVLEM Jesus fucking God. FLASHBACK - INT. ARES - ACCESS TUBE - NIGHT SUPERIMPOSE: MISSION TIME DAY 15 Dark. Someone moves along. And emerges into - INT. ARES - OBSERVATION SPHERE - NIGHT An icosahedronal slice has been removed from one side and replaced with optical glass. A billion stars are brighter and more numerous than you've ever imagined. Gallagher comes in, bumps smack into Chantilas. Thought he was alone. GALLAGHER Sorry CHANTILAS Lotsa room. They lean back against the "floor" for a moment and stare out at a billion and a half stars. CHANTILAS Know the stars at all? GALLAGHER (pointing) Andromeda, Cassiopeia, Cetus, Lepus, Canis Minor. We're looking at what you'd see south around midnight, mid-May if we were on Earth. At about 42 degrees. He's not showing off. He just really does know. Chantilas looks at him, surprised. GALLAGHER My grandfather taught me to sail when I was a kid. (fondly) He made me learn the stars in case all the G.P.S. satellites fell out of the sky at once. He said anyone who put his life in the hands of anything run by batteries was a jackass. CHANTILAS He sounds like quite a guy. GALLAGHER He didn't like what he called the easy answer or the quick fix. He didn't want to own anything he couldn't repair himself. (thinking back) And, oh yeah, everything automatic sooner or later fails automatically, usually during or immediately before a crisis. He had a lotta damn sayings. (then) He wouldn't've approved of this. CHANTILAS Going to Mars? GALLAGHER No. That we killed off half the living things on Earth. That after we all but destroyed one planet with global warming, we're trying to bring another to life the same way. Kinda tricky, don't you think? He woulda said we were asking for trouble. CHANTILAS It looks like we got trouble. That's why they sent us. A beat. They go back to staring at the heavens. Then - GALLAGHER I don't really get it. You quit being a scientist? You went back to school to study God?? CHANTILAS I just realized science couldn't answer any of the really interesting questions. (off Robby's look) There are values that are fundamental to an adequate apprehension of the world in which we live that can't be expressed by equations or experiments. In that, you see the hand of God. (explaining) Acknowledgment of basic values. Love, kindness, joy. Science doesn't have much use for these. Look, ugly theories are wrong. We know it by insight. Science doesn't want to accept that. We live in a moral world and have moral knowledge that tells us that love and truth are better than hatred and lies. But it's modern to think this is little more than genetic imprinting or a tacit communal cultural agreement. That's not a world I cared to live in anymore. Robby stares back into the void. This is not the kind of conversation he's used to, but - GALLAGHER I asked my grandfather once if God existed. He played me Brahms' Third. Then he asked me what good it was? Or was it just vibration. CHANTILAS (following) What good is beauty? GALLAGHER He said if a man could listen to Brahms and not believe in God, he was a fool. CHANTILAS I think I woulda liked your grandfather. Robby turns to him. GALLAGHER You didn't come on this trip because of science at all, did you? That's why they let you come, but you're going to Mars to prove to yourself God exists. Yup. CHANTILAS Maybe I'll pick up a rock and it'll say so on the bottom 'Made by God.' GALLAGHER Maybe God's more subtle than you are. (then) You think we're doing something we shouldn't, Bud, messing with another planet? CHANTILAS (unconcerned) If so, it's because we're supposed to find something out. (then) Let's say we didn't. And we finished poisoning off the Earth and everyone was dead in a hundred years. Then what was the point of any of it? Music, art, beauty, love? All gone. The Greeks, the Romans, the Enlightenment, the Constitution, people dying for freedom, ideas? None of that meant anything? I'd rather go out and make a mistake than live in a world that bleak. GALLAGHER No one said jack to me about the Greeks and Romans. Shit, I just came along to fix stuff. CHANTILAS Fooled ya, didn't we. It's okay. No one told the others either. There's a quiet moment. Robby just came up to stare at the stars. Wasn't expecting all this. Then - CHANTILAS There's a reason the planets go around the stars in exactly the same way electrons go around the nucleus of the atom. It's not an accident. There's a design at the bottom of all this. God's watching over you. GALLAGHER I just wish I didn't think he was chuckling. END OF FLASHBACK. EXT. HAB (MARS) - DAY Gallagher, Burchenal, and Pettengill are still stunned over the fact they're alive. BURCHENAL There shouldn't be enough oxygen on Mars to do this. PETTENGILL We never even got close to a breathable atmosphere. Then the levels started to drop and the sensors all died. I don't understand what's going on here. Gallagher is rummaging through the wreckage of the Hab. It's been devastated. PETTENGILL Wattya lookin' for? Gallagher unearths a tangle of wire and chewed-up circuits. GALLAGHER This. He tosses it aside. It's worthless. GALLAGHER It used to be the radio. I don't mean to piss on the parade, guys, but no one knows we're here. Don't you see? The good news is we can breathe. The bad news is, unless we can tell somebody, now we get to starve to death. The only mission left is rescue. INT. ARES - FLIGHT DECK The schematic she sent back to Earth is on the screen here as well. The ship is fucked-up bad. SKAVLEM (V.O.) The ground crew's dead, your orbit's unstable, and you're gonna burn in less then a day and a half. (beat: then) Let's get you home. EXT. HAB - DAY The three of them rummage through the ravaged structure. News isn't good. BURCHENAL We could head back to the lander, try to make something work there. PETTENGILL (won't make it) It's six hours back. GALLAGHER And it all ran through the main computer which was half-fried and dropped from a great height. Shakes his head no. That ain't gonna help. Then Burchenal, of all things, grins. BURCHENAL Gotta think about this scientifically. There's another radio. Two kilometers from here. GALLAGHER I didn't see any stores on the way over. I miss a Radio Hut? BURCHENAL We sent it here. Twenty years before you were born. In 1997. Think where we are... PETTENGILL (gets it) We're right over the edge from the Ares Vallis. The Sojourner site. The HHCs are yanked out. PETTENGILL There was a high-density ridge ringing the valley. The algae never took there. Gallagher checks his watch. GALLAGHER We still might have a chance this pass. We wait long... They start to run towards a ridge to west. Sun hangs low in the sky. Only an hour or so of day left. CUT TO: GALLAGHER, PETTENGILL AND BURCHENAL with a goofy look on their faces. Like kids at Disneyland the first time. They're standing there looking at - SAGAN/SOJOURNER SITE The little rover. All those damned named rocks. Our first big visit to Mars. The reverie is over quickly. Gallagher tosses down his bag of tools. Walks over, kneels beside Sojourner (the rover). GALLAGHER Sorry about this. He pats it once and starts POWER-SCREWING off the cover. Tosses another tool to Burchenal. Re the Sagan lander - GALLAGHER Rip the panels off everything around the aerial. (then) It's a fifty-year-old off-the-shelf computer radio modem on a frequency that we're not using for this mission. PETTENGILL Then why are we bothering? GALLAGHER Cause I'd rather die doing something than just sitting there. CUT TO: EXT. SOJOURNER SITE - DAY Gallagher has cobbled together a radio from 50-year-old parts. Pettengill holds the solar panels at the sun while Robby carefully removes one of his two suit-radio microphones. Checks with a meter, then solders it onto his jerry-rigged radio. GALLAGHER Testing, testing... He adjusts a tiny pot as he continues to call out. A green LED comes on, flickering with his voice. BURCHENAL Does it work?? GALLAGHER Well, the little green thing lights up. I don't know if it works... (into mike) This is Ares ground crew, come back. This is Ares ground crew, do you copy? We PULL BACK WIDER AND WIDER. They are so damn alone. INT. ARES - FLIGHT DECK - DAY Various return scenarios are flickering on different vid screens. SKAVLEM (V.O.) Okay, scenario three calls for you to lock out systems 17, 22 and 40. Kate tries. 40 freeflows, doesn't lock out. BOWMAN No joy. She resets everything. BOWMAN Maybe we're trying to be way too subtle. Why don't we just jettison the damn tank? SKAVLEM (V.O.) Because the margins for error are so small. There's enough fuel to get you home, then if you don't sneeze. It makes us nervous. BOWMAN You want nervous... INT. MISSION CONTROL Over in the corner, Schlissel is listening to something on his headset that's blowing his mind. He starts waving three fingers frantically at Skavlem and Russert. They don't respond fast enough for him. He reaches over and patches someone into the comm link. A new voice breaks into the conversations. The accent's Australian. OZZIE (V.O.) Right, right. Commander Katherine Bowman? RUSSERT (peeved) This is a restricted, encrypted frequency. Who is this? OZZIE (V.O.) (unperturbed) This is Hank Osterbee in Canberra. Deep Space Network, mate. I've got a call for you. INT. ARES - FLIGHT DECK BOWMAN A call for me? OZZIE (V.O.) Right. From the surface of Mars. I'm routing it through. Direct frequencies follow. There's CRUNCH OF STATIC, then - GALLAGHER (V.O.) Commander Bowman? BOWMAN You're alive?? You're alive?! EXT. SOJOURNER SITE (MARS) - DAY GALLAGHER We're at sixty percent. Lieutenant Santen and Bud are gone. (beat: then) Oh, and by the way, we can breathe. INT. MISSION CONTROL - NIGHT SKAVLEM You can breathe??! GALLAGHER (V.O.) Not real well, but yeah. (then) Hey, Kate...We've changed our mind. Get us outta here. We'd like to come home. If the room was at a standstill before, now it's frozen. Is there hope? SKAVLEM If they can breathe, can we live there? LOWENTHAL No. Ninety percent of the algae's gone. It's some kind of freak anomaly. Mars is a dying planet. Just like Earth. RUSSERT They're breathing. It coulda worked. Dammit, it coulda worked... Then through the cacophony comes one voice. SCHLISSEL It doesn't matter. They're going to die tonight anyhow. In an hour, the sun sets on Mars. It's going to be minus 140. They cannot survive in the open. They're going to die. Yow. Everyone shuts up. It's ugly but true. LOWENTHAL He's right. You can walk across the South Pole, long as you stay moving and you're wearing insulating clothing - the suits'll work - you can stay warm. But once they stop moving, without shelter, they're gonna die. SCHLISSEL Her orbit could degrade at any time. She could auger in and burn while they chat about old times and freeze to death. It's a waste. We should just bring her home. Skavlem doesn't love it, but - SKAVLEM We can get a free return trajectory now. She's got enough food and water to bring one person back. Russert not happy at all, but - RUSSERT You're not wrong. Nods to Skavlem... SKAVLEM Commander, this is Mission Control. INT. ARES - FLIGHT DECK - DAY BOWMAN No. SKAVLEM (V.O.) Ma'am? BOWMAN I'm not stupid, John, I know what the question is. I'd ask it if I was there. And the answer is no. So let's move on. (then) By my calculations, if I ditch my reserve tank now and commit to a three-second apogee burn, I stabilize my orbit for another eighteen hours. I'd like someone to check the numbers as my apogee's in seven minutes. INT. MISSION CONTROL - NIGHT Russert has to grin. It's gonna drive him crazy and it's exactly what he'd do. Before any of them can bitch and whine - RUSSERT Come on, people, you heard the woman, let's get on it. The techs begin calculating madly. EXT. MARS SURFACE - DAY The crew is coming down a rise toward the Hab. Carrying the radio. Walking back quickly. Sun is flat over the horizon. Shadows are long, already getting cold. You can see their breath. BOWMAN (V.O.) There's some concern at Mission Control. About the weather. GALLAGHER (deadpan) It's gonna rain? BOWMAN (V.O.) It's gonna get a little chilly. GALLAGHER I could see that. It's dropped about fifty degrees in the last half hour. We figure a hundred below fairly soon. INT. ARES - FLIGHT DECK - NIGHT Bowman is doing her best to keep the tone light. But she's gotta know whether or not he thinks he's gonna live or die. GALLAGHER (V.O.) It would have been nice to be in the Hab. And there ain't no other motel to check into. BOWMAN You have a plan? Any thoughts on how you might...stay alive? EXT. HAB (MARS) - ALMOST SUNSET They're back at the Hab now. We can't quite tell what's going on, but Burchenal and Pettengill are busy doing something noisy and furious in the b.g. Crashing, bashing, breaking. Burchenal flicks open an entrenching tool. Thumbs a button, edge whizzes by like a tiny chain saw. Chews through something and... GALLAGHER Yeah... Behind Gallagher is a whoooosh of flame as Pettengill gets the debris he's piled in the middle of the Hab to light. He's got stacks of additional fuel nearby. GALLAGHER We're gonna have a 75 million dollar campfire. EXT. HAB (MARS) - 20 MINUTES LATER The sun sets. First sunset on Mars man has seen. Red upon red upon red. Fire burns behind them. Sky turns black. Fast. A billion stars. And then a METEORITE begins to fall. It's huge. It's red. It EXPLODES. GALLAGHER What the hell was that? BURCHENAL She ditched the 'B' tank. She must be figuring there's an even chance we'll live through the night. EXT. SPACE - NIGHT The Ares lights up and burns for three long seconds. And off. INT. ARES - FLIGHT DECK - NIGHT Bowman checks the gauges. Eight liters was burned. BOWMAN Hell, what's eight liters? (answers herself) It'll either save their lives or I've screwed up getting home and I'll spend the next three hundred years circling this planet. EXT. HAB - NIGHT Burchenal pokes at the flames. They're spread out and low. Flickering yellow and blue. BURCHENAL I think we'll make it through. There's so little O2, this is gonna burn real slow. Gallagher picks up a piece of scrap, about to feed it into the flames, then stops, examines it by the light of the fire. It looks like someone took a rasp to it. He gets up, turns on a suit light and looks over the remaining ribs of the structure. GALLAGHER What happened to this place? Everything but the titanium supports were just chewed up. Could a dust storm've done this? BURCHENAL No prevailing pattern to the damage. I don't know what could've done it. Nor does it matter right now. They sit back around the fire and relish the warmth. Out in the darkness, past a rise, something catches Robby's eye. A flash, a reflection. Of the fire? On what? And then it's gone. He doesn't bother to mention it. Writes it off. TWO HUNDRED YARDS AWAY Behind a hill, AMEE crouches in the dark. Pops up again, looks over, sees the three men and the fire. Lowers back down - you'd swear she was thinking - then silently ambles away. BACK AROUND FIRE The weird tableau of three men in spacesuits around a campfire on Mars. A moment then - GALLAGHER You still think we had any business coming to Mars? Screwing with stuff? Trying to spread life? You think maybe God's teaching us some hardass lesson? Pettengill just makes some kind of weird gulping noise and turns away. They let him be. BURCHENAL God? You talked to Chantilas too much on the trip over. I don't mean to burst your bubble, but God's the retreat of the ignorant, the weak and the hopeless. GALLAGHER I bet you don't believe in Santa. And you're no fun at all at Christmas. (then) Not everything gets an explanation you can write down as a formula. BURCHENAL Son, I'm a scientist. A geneticist, as good as they come. I write code, just like a hacker. Four elements, A.G.T.P., in different orders, back the genome. And your kidneys work or you grow a sixth finger. I line up unconscious atoms and they give rise to conscious beings. It's like if I stacked up a bunch of rocks in the right order and they become a dog. I do that. I chose when, I chose where, I chose how many fingers. I just don't hold with mystical explanations for science, with organized religion, buildings with different symbols on 'em. You spot God, you lemme know. Till then, I put my trust in my three Ph.D's. (then) But I think life's an amazing thing. And I believe that when you get it you should grab it with both hands and live as much of it as you can. Which is why I am not happy about losing it on this damn ugly planet. Burchenal shuts his eyes. We PUSH IN ON Gallagher looking rueful and... FLASHBACK - INT. ARES - HYGIENE SPHERE - DAY SUPERIMPOSE: MISSION TIME: DAY 32 Gallagher comes in. His timing, depending how you look at it, is very good or very bad. Bowman steps out of the shower. To dry off. It's too late for Robby to stop or recoup. He has to tough it out and try to act like an adult. Bowman sees his discomfort. She's amused. BOWMAN It's okay. I had brothers. GALLAGHER I have two sisters. (gives up) Neither of them were this fine. Now she colors. BOWMAN The only way this works, is if we both make believe it doesn't matter. GALLAGHER I tried. I really tried. (then) Maybe I should go fix something. BOWMAN (laughing now) Maybe you should. He hesitates, leaves. She starts to vacuum dry her hair. END OF FLASHBACK EXT. CAMPFIRE (MARS) - NIGHT Gallagher's half filled with regret, half annoyed with himself. Sighs, shuts his eyes, tries to get some sleep. INT. MISSION CONTROL - NIGHT Place is ragged coffee on the workstations, techs as unshaven and beat as the crew on Mars. RUSSERT All right, people, we bought ourselves another eighteen hours in orbit. The crew's burning pretty much what we've got on the surface so they don't freeze solid. So whatever we can come up with... LOWENTHAL ...has got to work before the sun sets again tomorrow and they freeze to death anyhow. RUSSERT What else is on Mars? SCHLISSEL Rocks. Sand. RUSSERT The janitor just built a radio out of a fifty-year-old Rover mission. Now, what else is on Mars? Mars maps come up on all their PIMs. There are things on the surface. Marked with various symbols. Leftovers from other missions. SKAVLEM We sent a dozen probes even before the biologics started up. Eight were return missions. LOWENTHAL And they're back. SKAVLEM There's a Viking lander... SCHLISSEL 2,200 kilometers away. Silence. They all stare at the PIMs. And then Schlissel turns to a nearby TECH - SCHLISSEL S.Y.F. TECH Slap your forehead. SCHLISSEL We're not the only people who sent stuff to Mars. Other overlays come up on the maps. New colors. New symbols. SKAVLEM The Twenties were nothing but unmanned sample return missions. Everyone wanted to bring back a bucket of Mars rocks. They find something near the Hab. SCHLISSEL There was Euro-Malaysian sample return mission 2018. TECH Checking... LOWENTHAL (knows) It blew up on attempted return. Looking further afield, they find something else. TECH It ain't close, but there's an Uzbecki S.R.M. that failed to launch. SCHLISSEL (argh) An Uzbecki probe from 2032. RUSSERT Is it viable? Can we get plans? SCHLISSEL It was built at the Cosmos factory in Garagin in 2031. (there's more) The factory closed eight years later. And then it burnt down. All right, that's the end of that. And then Schlissel spots a detail that means something to him. SCHLISSEL It was designed by Aleksandr Ivanovich Borokovski. He was the last of the greats in the Russian space program. RUSSERT Is he still alive?? Schlissel's PIM flickers madly as he mutters at it. SCHLISSEL There's no closing date on his bio. He'd be in his seventies. RUSSERT Find him. Somebody get on the line to Kazakhstan. LOWENTHAL This is insanity. A thirty-year-old lander built in a factory that doesn't exist anymore. TECH Found him! SCHLISSEL He emigrated. He runs a deli in Brooklyn. INT. MISSION CONTROL - NIGHT Low hum of conversation, a bunch of the workstations are vacant, techs sleeping in cots nearby. BOROKOVSKI, in his best suit, 20 years old, comes in led by two NASA flunkies. Unhooks his filtration mask. Vindicated. BOROKOVSKI All right, I am Borokovski. I am here. EXT. HAB (MARS) - PRE-DAWN Sky's beginning to grow light. Last of the fire flickering out. Nothing left of the Hab but a few metal ribs. Gallagher stirs. Stiff from sleeping on the ground. Burchenal and Pettengill follow. They've lived through the night. Gallagher walks off twenty paces. When we see him again, he's unlocked the top and bottom of his suit and dropped the trousers to his knees. GALLAGHER I'm the first man to piss on Mars. Burchenal and Pettengill follow suit on the other side of the Hab. A beat, then - BURCHENAL Damn. PETTENGILL Whoa. BURCHENAL You sure get some arc in this low gravity. The sun's gonna break any minute. Something suddenly hits Burchenal. He yanks up his pants, runs to remains of the Hab. Looks around desperately. Pulls free a metal rib. Turns to Gallagher. BURCHENAL Run. Towards the sun. Robby understands or doesn't bother to ask why. Takes off. Burchenal yanks free a shard of metal. Pounds it into the sand a dozen feet from the Hab. The sun is just breaking the horizon. Robby is fifty yards away. BURCHENAL Stop! Left. Left. A little more. Right. Mark it. He adjusts his own peg a tad. Robby comes loping back. PETTENGILL What'd we do? GALLAGHER (approvingly) Built a directional. Now at least we know where something is. The RADIO CRACKLES. BOWMAN (V.O.) Good morning, boys. Martian weather today's clear and cold. Warming to a high today of around sixty. INT. ARES - FLIGHT DECK - DAY She hasn't slept. There's notes and charts and additional HHC's all over the place. BOWMAN So...Houston has an idea. CUT TO: EXT. HAB (MARS) - MOMENTS LATER Gallagher, Burchenal and Pettengill have heard the plan. It doesn't impress them. GALLAGHER That's it? We walk a hundred kilometers in one day to find a twelve-by-twelve object that's been sitting there for 30 years. (are you kidding) That's the best plan they could come up with? BOWMAN (V.O.) It's the only plan they could come up with. GALLAGHER (reconsiders) I guess that makes it best. BOWMAN (V.O.) There's an I.R. maintenance port on the Cosmos. Your H.H.C. should talk to it. You'll have to reprogram the launch sequence. The bad news is... INT. ARES - FLIGHT DECK - DAY GALLAGHER (V.O.) There's bad news? BOWMAN (ignoring him) ...is it's programmed in a forty-year-old dead operating system no one uses anymore. It was something called...Windows. EXT. MARS - DAY None of them have ever heard of it. BOWMAN (V.O.) We're getting a copy of it from the Smithsonian. We're gonna have to download it to you. GALLAGHER Let's worry about it when we get there. Where're we going? BOWMAN (V.O.) I've got coordinates for you. BURCHENAL How 'bout something simpler. Like how many degrees it is off from the direction the sun rose. We marked it. I'm figurin' we're within half a degree. GALLAGHER Heck, we just gotta pack. He picks up a satchel of tools. Everything else's burnt to a cinder. SAME SCENE - FIVE MINUTES LATER Basic trig has been calculated. A triangle of scavenged wire stretches with one side along the directional, the other side points their way across the Martian landscape. They take a last sighting, and stride off into the distance getting smaller and smaller and then - ON the three of them. Pettengill looks doubtful. PETTENGILL A hundred kilometers. Sixty-odd miles. Say two and a half marathons. In twelve hours. Do we really have a chance in hell? GALLAGHER It took us six hours to go 26 kilometers last time. We don't have the rebreathers, we don't have the tanks. BURCHENAL Figure you weigh about fifty pounds in this gravity. We have a chance in hell. But not much more'n that. INT. MISSION CONTROL - NIGHT A messenger is escorted in and taken to Borokovski. He's got a copy of Windows, fifty years old, and still in the shrink wrap. Borokovski rips it open, then peers at tech requirements on the box. BOROKOVSKI I will need a computer with a CD-ROM drive. And a pentium processor. Nobody moves. It's like asking for a steam engine. SCHLISSEL What's a pentium processor? TECH What's a CD-ROM? BOROKOVSKI (a little defensive) It was all state-of-the-art in Kazakhstan. We were cut off. Still nobody moves. RUSSERT We gotta wake up the Director of Dead Technology at the Smithsonian. And quick. Assistants scramble. Schlissel comes over to peer curiously at the shiny silver disk and - FLASHBACK - EXT. SPACE - ARES - NIGHT SUPERIMPOSE: MISSION TIME: DAY 132 The ship floats THROUGH FRAME. We hear the familiar CLINK of POKER CHIPS. CHANTILAS (V.O.) Call. SANTEN (V.O.) Call. GALLAGHER (V.O) Call. INT. KITCHEN/DINING SPHERE - NIGHT Burchenal, Santen, Chantilas and Gallagher are playing poker. Burchenal fans his cards down. Full house. BURCHENAL Kings over queens. CHANTILAS That's it. You're the best poker player in a hundred million miles. BURCHENAL Yep. He rakes in all the chips. BURCHENAL And no one'll play for money. What a waste. SANTEN I'm done. See you all in the morning. Game's over. Santen leaves, Chantilas starts to follow, then turns and asks, three-quarters kidding - CHANTILAS Do you cheat? BURCHENAL Compared to what? Chantilas gives up and leaves. GALLAGHER Do you cheat? BURCHENAL Only Santen. That seems fair. Gallagher's putting away the chips when - BURCHENAL You know what I miss? A drink sometimes at the end of the day...Damned hard-asses at NASA. Gallagher gets a look in his eye. GALLAGHER You got enough gear on board to splice genes, right? Glassware, tubing, Bunsen burners...all that kind of stuff? BURCHENAL Yep, sure do. Why? INT. ARES - MAINTENANCE LEVEL - NIGHT Bowman comes in. Robby moves quickly to intercept her. Blocks her view. BOWMAN I came to apologize. You were uncomfortable with a situation the other day, and I made you more uncomfortable for my own amusement. I'm sorry. It's too small a ship for playground games. GALLAGHER Okay. He's done. She can leave now. BOWMAN Okay? No witty comeback? No gloating? (beat) No explanation for why the temperature in this sphere is up three degrees? She slithers by him before he can stop her to find Burchenal tending a huge contraption of glass tubing, Bunsen burners and filtration tanks. GALLAGHER He's teaching me. About biology. I've developed an interest in... BOWMAN ...fermentation? Even when you make it out of high-tech glassware, a still looks just like a still. BOWMAN (stern) You built a still? GALLAGHER It's a science experiment. Did you know that an ounce of red wine per day actually benefits your heart? BOWMAN (adamant) So does three ounces of grape juice. GALLAGHER Grapes don't grow well hydroponically...So we, ah, used potatoes... BOWMAN You're making moonshine vodka on my ship. BURCHENAL Well, yes, ma'am. But we ran it through the Gas Chromatograph Mass Spectrometer and the impurity levels are very low. BOWMAN How's it taste? Burchenal is the first to realize they're off the hook. BURCHENAL It's a little rough. BOWMAN Are you going to offer me a drink? BURCHENAL Of course. That would be the polite thing to do. He does. She tosses it back. Woooof. BOWMAN That's a little rough. How much have you made? BURCHENAL ...'bout three liters. She considers. Then - BOWMAN You're done. Dismantle the science project. Offer equal rations to the crew. Mr. Santen doesn't drink or approve of those who do. (stern again) Now tell me the truth. How much were you cutting this? GALLAGHER (they're busted again) About three to one. I can't believe you drank that. BOWMAN I learned to fly in the Navy. Wimps. INT. COMMON AREA SPHERE - NIGHT Gallagher, Bowman, and Burchenal are there. They've got half a beaker of vodka left. They're all looped and laughing. BURCHENAL I spent half of my life trying to make a better potato. And the second half trying to stop it. The things were so damn good they killed everything in their path. Corn, wheat, barley... (suddenly melancholy) We fucked up our own back yard, hit the Malthusian wall, and tried to breed our way out of it. Maybe we don't deserve another chance. Then he shakes it off. Laughs. BURCHENAL Don't worry, if we need any help on the surface, I'm allowed to grow us some six-fingered lab assistants. He cracks up again. He's wasted. Knows it. BURCHENAL I gotta go to bed. He heads off drunkenly. Gallagher gets an idea... GALLAGHER I'm in space. I wanna see the stars. He flails off in another direction. She laughs and follows him... BOWMAN Don't go outside. INT. OBSERVATION SPHERE - NIGHT A billion stars, two very drunk people, half a beaker of moonshine vodka. She's talking about Burchenal - BOWMAN He's okay. I bet there's a hell of a girl waiting for him back home. GALLAGHER Three. And a horse. He really likes the horse. BOWMAN You're serious? GALLAGHER He pines for the horse. You? BOWMAN I don't have a horse. GALLAGHER That's too bad. He takes another swig. Offers it to her. She matches him. GALLAGHER Can I ask you something very personal? BOWMAN Okay. GALLAGHER It's about bras and space. She looks at him. BOWMAN I don't wear a bra in space. GALLAGHER I know. BOWMAN Bras are designed to hold your boobs in place on Earth where there's real gravity. Why would I need one in space? GALLAGHER Cause it's really fucking distracting. BOWMAN You want me to wear a bra? GALLAGHER No. Not at all. I'm sorry I ever brought this up. The good news is neither of them will remember in the morning. Much. Another round. Then - BOWMAN Do you have someone waiting for you back home? Or a horse? GALLAGHER With the kind of jobs I've had, it's very hard to maintain any kind of relationship. So...no horses. BOWMAN Or maybe you took those jobs 'cause you didn't want anyone waiting for you. Or maybe... GALLAGHER No, I like horses just fine. They've floated very close. BOWMAN You know, you're not who I thought you were at first. GALLAGHER Is that an insult or a compliment? BOWMAN An observation. They're very, very close. And very drunk. It's when he should kiss her. But he doesn't. The moment passes. They both know it was there and now it's gone. Drift apart. Feel stupid. Damn. END OF FLASHBACK EXT. MARS SURFACE - DAY MOVING ACROSS the landscape. Miles and miles from where they started, we FIND the three men as they move rapidly across a dry wash, across the bank and up and over a hill. And stop dead at the top. Over the next ridge, the landscape is covered with algae. Colors like brush strokes on the terrain. Oxblood brown, burnt orange, cadmium yellow. PETTENGILL Wattya know. Pettengill gets down on one knee to examine it. Half inch to an inch high, vibrantly colored. Healthy. PETTENGILL Maybe it's the longitude. Maybe it's the equatorial belt... GALLAGHER Maybe it doesn't matter 'cause we gotta keep moving or we're gonna die. Pettengill doesn't argue. Just trying to stay alive is the great scientific mystery right now. They bound down far side and... INT. MISSION CONTROL - DAY Borokovski is laboring to install Windows on a 50-year-old computer from the museum. Schlissel and the Tech watch, kibbutz. It crashes. Again. BOROKOVSKI Yob tyvou mot! (Which, by the way, means "fuck your mother.") SCHLISSEL It keeps crashing. BOROKOVSKI That was part of its charm. You had to buy programs to check why the program you had already bought was not working. TECH People installed this on their computers on purpose? It wasn't a virus? BOROKOVSKI The company planned it this way. It was later discovered they owned all the companies that sold you the products to fix the product they had already sold you. SCHLISSEL I remember this. The government had to bomb the factory in the end. Borokovski nods. Windows comes up. BOROKOVSKI Look, there we go... EXT. SURFACE OF MARS - DAY The ANGLE seems odd. In fact it is. It's from orbit. It's Bowman searching on the telescope. INT. ARES - FLIGHT DECK - MONITOR - DAY As the picture skitters along the surface and finds them, tiny figures on a landscape. In extreme profile. EXT. ARES - ORBIT - DAY A few minutes away from plunging onto the night side. INT. ARES - FLIGHT DECK - DAY She marks their location on the viewscreen, zooms out wide. The Hab and the Cosmos are marked with symbols. The computer pauses, analyzes, then spits them out as a little more than 56 kilometers along their way. More calculation is done on the screen. They're more than halfway; they've used up less than half the available daylight; their average speed is looking good. They're on time, on schedule and on the right course. So far, so good. BOWMAN Ground crew, this is Ares. You're a little more than half. You're doing great. GALLAGHER (V.O.) (over radio) Oh yeah, we're doing fabulous. As she plunges into darkness, we hear - BURCHENAL (V.O.) (singing) Rollin', rollin', rollin', keep them doggies rollin'.' EXT. MARS SURFACE - DAY They're all exhausted and a little punchy. BURCHENAL How long can a man go without food or water? GALLAGHER How long can you go without singing that dumb song? Burchenal looks hurt. Walks another few paces. Begins to sing again. Gallagher turns to Pettengill. GALLAGHER There's two of us. And we can stop him from singing. Pettengill considers. Then sings along instead. They only know the one line. It's really annoying. GALLAGHER What is that? BURCHENAL I have no idea. It's old, though. It's classic music. GALLAGHER I don't know the classics. This sets Burchenal off. He sings some more - BURCHENAL Mars ain't a place to raise your kids In fact it's cold as hell And there's no one there to raise them If you dig.' GALLAGHER What the hell is that? BURCHENAL You don't know any of the classics, do you? He was a rocket man. GALLAGHER An astronaut wrote that? BURCHENAL Never mind. GALLAGHER Sing the one about the dogs again. BURCHENAL It's about cows. GALLAGHER Then why does it say doggies? All this time, they've been walking across a landscape pigmented with color - steel blue, alizarin crimson, malachite green - the algae varietals everywhere. And then off to the left, the algae stops. Erased, like it was never there, extirpated in a long crooked line. PETTENGILL What the fuck? GALLAGHER Yeah, what the fuck? You said doggies. Then he sees as well. They all see. Can't help themselves. They're drawn towards it. Gallagher and Burchenal check their course in the distance before veering off. Pettengill is already heading towards it. It's maybe 100 yards away. At 50, something indistinct can be seen. Sort of. It's like the line, and the surrounding terrain is out of focus, blurry. At 30, the blurriness comes into focus. It's alive. It moves slightly. You can see through it. At ten, you can see it undulating. Slowly, TOWARDS us. Erasing the algae, the color slowly spreading outwards behind and diffusing. And then we can see... A billion, a hundred billion...nematodes. Little tiny translucent worms. Eating the algae. Slowly, irrevocably. Advancing. Pettengill pulls out his entrenching tool. Carefully separates one out. Lifts it up to the light to see. Maybe three inches long, skinnier than an earthworm. One end lifts in the air, a tri-part mouth with little crystalline teeth opening and closing, searching for something to eat. It's fucking scary. It gets worse when you realize how many of them there are. The line's moved three or four inches closer as they stand there. They take a step back. No one can really speak yet. GALLAGHER What... PETTENGILL It's a nematode. Or something like one. It's probably this skinny so it defrosts each morning when the sun hits them. Or they'r enot water-based at all. GALLAGHER Is it something we sent up by accident with the probes? PETTENGILL No. GALLAGHER I thought we said there wasn't any life on this planet. PETTENGILL We did. We were wrong. Maybe there wasn't when we checked. I don't know. It's not from Earth. (beat; yow) And it's not from here. BURCHENAL This can't be. This can't be. Burchenal actually seems kind of upset about it. Gallagher looks at him. Say what? Burch is upset. BURCHENAL It can't be here. You don't understand. The odds of there being any other life in the universe are infinitesimally small. The odds that it could survive on something other than its home planet are equally astronomical. The odds that it could travel to another solar system, let alone one where life already existed are...impossible. GALLAGHER But it's here. BURCHENAL Yeah. Burchenal seems almost unhappy about this. It rocks his world. In a bad way. Gallagher turns to Pettengill happily and untroubled.... GALLAGHER Well, it looks like we're not alone in the universe. You just discovered life on another planet, pal. It takes a moment for this to sink in. Then something hits Robby. GALLAGHER Made by God. That's what's stamped on the bottom. That's what Bud would have said. He woulda loved this. Gallagher gets down on one knee and looks at them. They're kinda horrible, but as he turns to Pettengill - GALLAGHER You know what this means? You're gonna be more famous than Darwin. They're gonna name buildings after you. Spacecrafts, cities on Mars... The enormity of how badly Pettengill has screwed up - that in the space of one day, he's committed murder and discovered life on another planet - begins to dawn on him. He doesn't handle it well. He's fucked up like few people can imagine. He tries to reset, it doesn't work. The worm twists about, starts to eat the metal right off the entrenching tool. He flicks it back to its relatives. PETTENGILL Right. Right. Motherfuck. Motherfuck. And then he says something really odd - PETTENGILL Name them after Santen. BURCHENAL You hated Santen. PETTENGILL Yeah. He storms away. They're both confused by this. Pettengill finds a rock, sits down behind it. He's obscured except for his head and shoulders. PETTENGILL I need a minute or two. GALLAGHER You wanna tell Houston? PETTENGILL Go ahead. You do it. Just give me a few minutes. INT. ARES - FLIGHT DECK - DAY BURCHENAL (V.O.) We seem to have come across the, uh, cause of the annihilation of the algae. There's cryptoendolithic life here. Eating it. INTERCUT as needed with Mission Control and Mars surface. LOWENTHAL (concerned) They're hallucinating. BURCHENAL Pettengill's a bit overcome. Or he'd be telling you about it himself. But the discovery goes to him. (baffled; but) Though he wants to name them after Santen... SKAVLEM You're saying there's Martian life. PETTENGILL (calling out from behind the rock) No, that there's life on Mars. We're not saying where it came from. But not Earth. Fuck. They all disregard that last bit. GALLAGHER They're like some kind of translucent worms. SKAVLEM You're all seeing these? BURCHENAL Oh yeah. They're here. What did you think this was, hypoxia? They did. EXT. MARS SURFACE - DAY Conversation's over. Gallagher walks towards the rock - GALLAGHER We should get outta here. Pettengill doesn't respond. BURCHENAL Really. We should get going... Gallagher walks over. We hear a familiar WHINE. Don't recognize what it is at first. Until Gallagher around the rock and sees... Pettengill's flicked on the WHIZZING CUTTING EDGE of the entrenching TOOL. Shreds his left wrist. Lifts it and rips through his carotid arteries. All but cuts off his head as he falls to the ground. Suit's awash with BLOOD. Overflowing onto the ground and him. BURBLING in spurts. Some hits the worms. BURCHENAL Jesus...Jesus God... Burchenal's joined him. There's nothing they could do. Only watch in shock. It gets worse. The worms come. Pulsating and undulating towards Pettengill. As if some secret message the food is here has spread through the billions of them in burst of knowledge. A diaphanous, hungry wave crests onto Pettengill and engulfs him. He's covered in translucence as they devour him. Gallagher and Burchenal stagger backwards in horror as a red aureole grows around him as he's eaten. Color spreads out around him in a perfect ever-growing circle. It's a feast. WIDE The two of them walk along. Can't tell if they're hurrying towards something or away. They've both figured out what's up. A beat, then - GALLAGHER He killed Santen. BURCHENAL Yep. GALLAGHER Probably figured we were gonna die anyhow. BURCHENAL Yep. Figured wrong. For now. GALLAGHER (beat; then) Nobody deserves to die like that. BURCHENAL No. INT. MISSION CONTROL - DAY There's a general buzz of animated scientific debate. One voice cuts through - LOWENTHAL We've thawed out three and four-million-year-old organisms from the permafrost in Siberia and they've come back to life. It's possible. RUSSERT So even if there wasn't life there, there is now. SCHLISSEL And we warmed the place up and sent it something to eat. LOWENTHAL It could have sat there for millions of years since Mars cooled. Waiting. Rode in on a frozen meterorite from anywhere. And waited. A voice chimes in from the corner - BOROKOVSKI Like sea monkeys. But not as friendly. They all consider that. Kinda bizarre but accurate. EXT. MARS SURFACE - DAY Burchenal and Gallagher trudge onward. Burchenal checks his watch. It's time. Gallagher hands him the radio. Walks ahead. Doesn't want to hear. INT. ARES - FLIGHT DECK - DAY Bowman just heard the news. It's like she's been punched. It takes her a moment to recover. BOWMAN Copy that, Ground Crew. Mission Control has heard as well. A beat, then - SKAVLEM (V.O.) Requiescat in Pace. EXT. MARS SURFACE - DAY The sun is way past its zenith. It hangs noticeably lower in the sky. Maybe four or five o'clock. Burchenal and Gallagher plod along. They're beat. There's no singing, there's no banter. They're just trying to keep moving. INT. ARES - FLIGHT DECK - DAY Bowman finds them again with 10m scope. Marks it. Computer analyzes their position. The results aren't encouraging. Their average speed has been steadily dropping. There's only two hours left till dark. They've gone 79 kilometers. And they're projected to get 88.5 kilometers before nightfall. They're gonna miss getting to the Cosmos by about an hour. EXT. MARS SURFACE - DAY It's worse. They're stumbling. Not keeping in all that straight a line. Having to constantly re-check their position. RADIO CRACKLES. BOWMAN (V.O.) Ground Crew, this is Ares. (studiously casual) How's it goin'? They look at each other. Is she kidding? GALLAGHER We've just done a little over two marathons back to back. We haven't had anything to eat or drink in two days. There are these worms that want to eat us and a mad robot who wants to kill us. Why do you ask? He starts to laugh. For some weird reason Burchenal joins him. BOWMAN (V.O.) You're not going to like what I have to say. BURCHENAL You're going home? Bring us some chicken. They crack up anew. BOWMAN (V.O.) You have to pick up the pace. They laugh. It's not funny, but they really laugh. BURCHENAL We're not gonna make it? BOWMAN (V.O.) At this pace, you'll make about ninety kilometers. Burchenal shakes himself. Digs into some deep reserve. Picks up his speed and shouts - BURCHENAL We Sleep Till Brooklyn! He totters off towards the horizon. BOWMAN (V.O.) What was that? GALLAGHER Cooper's been singing classic music. I don't know most of it. BURCHENAL No Sleep Till Brooklyn! GALLAGHER Neither does he. I think he knows one line from each song. We'll try to go faster. We really will... He's trying to convince himself as well as her. But he does pick up the pace and push after Burch and... INT. MISSION CONTROL - NIGHT Borokovski has listened in curiously to this exchange. BOROKOVSKI Why is he speaking of Brooklyn? SCHLISSEL He's singing classic music to keep his spirits up. The tech looks at him curiously. SCHLISSEL I studied it in college. It's the Beastie Guys. Most of the music we listen to today is based on the ground-breaking work they did before the turn of the century. EXT. MARS SURFACE - 40 MINUTES LATER They're stumbling. Literally. Gallagher just stops. GALLAGHER You know, I don't care if I weigh 60 pounds on Mars. I am one tired doggie. Gallagher sits down on a rock. Burchenal collapses nearby. They can't go any further. Burchenal catches his breath. BURCHENAL Ten K short. The sun is a finger above the horizon. Redder than red, breathtakingly beautiful. BURCHENAL It's pretty. GALLAGHER Too bad we're gonna be dead. I can't keep walking in circles. And there's nothing to keep us warm. They look around unhappily. Ugly way to die. GALLAGHER It's gonna be like trying to live on Mount Everest. BURCHENAL What would we do if we were on Mount Everest? Thinks a long time. GALLAGHER I would have brought a tent. BURCHENAL If we didn't have a tent. Robby's so tired he's confused. GALLAGHER We don't have a tent. BURCHENAL Yeah. Yeah, I know. GALLAGHER I'd guess you'd dig a snow cave. Use the snow for insulation. You've seen the 3Ds. There's a funky-looking hillock nearby. Five feet high, as big around. Burchenal totters to his feet. Goes over and kicks it. It's soft volcanic rock. BURCHENAL Let's dig a snow cave. GALLAGHER There's no snow. Burchenal kicks at it again. Gives. He takes out the entrenching tool, hacks at it. Knocks a piece free. BURCHENAL Let's dig a snow cave or we're gonna fucking die. He starts to wail on it. Gallagher staggers over and joins him. The two of them start to flail away like a cross between prehistoric man and giant beavers, desperate as - EXT. MARTIAN HORIZON The sun begins to set. 30 miles away, the terminus, the line where night turns to day, begins to advance across the planet towards them. In the dark of the shadow, the FROST forms a dozen feet behind and follows growing, GROWLING - the cold advancing TOWARDS us with a CRACKLING CRUNCHING FREEZING WHINE. It's as if the cold has a sound... BACK AT HILLOCK Gallagher and Burchenal can see the darkness approaching. Digging madly. Cackling. Losing their minds. Can't tell who is who as they're silhouetted against the sun, one now inside the hillock throwing rock back as the other clears. The sun continues to drop. Terminus continues its pernicious HISSING and freezing approach. Halfway inside now. On his knees, suit light on, Gallagher chops away at the rock. When he's thigh-deep in debris, he backs out, dragging the leavings with him. Burchenal leaps in, replacing him. Dripping in sweat, nutty, but at least they're doing something. The last of the sun disappears. Their breath is in the air. The darkness and frost reaches them now. The sweat begins to freeze, ice in their hair and eyebrows and stubble. But they've dug most of the shelter. They continue to thrash and chop away. The frost is now everywhere. Gallagher climbs inside. Burchenal drags a lava boulder over to seal the entrance. Climbs in, hooks his tool into the rock and seals it shut. INT. CAVE - NIGHT It's not big. The two of them are scrunched into balls. They chop away and pack the debris in the entry tunnel to block the cold. Shaking bitterly. Lips blue... EXT. MARS SURFACE - NIGHT Nothing. Darkness. Rocks. And in the midst of it all, our crazy hillock/snow cave. INT. HILLOCK/CAVE - NIGHT Gallagher looks up to find Burchenal staring at him. Actually, not exactly at him. At his forehead. GALLAGHER What? Is this some kind of cartoon moment where you're imagining I'm a giant chicken and you're going to eat me? BURCHENAL It's melting GALLAGHER It's a Wizard of Oz moment? BURCHENAL The ice on your forehead is melting. The rock's really insulating us. We might not freeze to death. GALLAGHER Oh. Good. And then the enormity of what's gone on hits them. And the exhaustion. Adrenaline is gone. Gallagher physically droops. Burchenal follows. GALLAGHER I've never been this tired. I've never hurt this bad. You think dead is worse than this? BURCHENAL Hell, we'll probably know soon. Shut up. Rest. GALLAGHER We oughta probably tell someone we're not frozen solid. Yet. Burchenal checks his watch. BURCHENAL We're on the nightside, can't reach Houston. Bowman's dayside for another forty-five. INT. MISSION CONTROL - NIGHT Common viewscreen shows ground crew's projected position. Darkside of the planet. Estimated temperature of -20 degrees fahrenheit and falling. The room's downcast. And bewildered... SKAVLEM Not a word before it got dark. -25 degrees. -30 degrees. RUSSERT They're dead. Or dying. Let's get Bowman home. SKAVLEM She's gonna wanna waste a pass trying to get them on the radio. RUSSERT Let her. She's got five and a half hours before the orbit starts to decay. If she has to do this so she can concentrate later on, so be it. Skavlem gets busy on the radio with Bowman - SKAVLEM Ares, this is Houston... INT. CAVE - NIGHT Their breath condenses on the ceiling. Freezes. Then falls down. It's snowing. They've got their own weather system. Gallagher watches it fall. Burchenal seems kinda pissed. BURCHENAL No, I don't know why the worms are here. No, I don't know why we're still alive. GALLAGHER There's gotta be a reason. A moment, then - BURCHENAL You're talking about faith, son. Faith is another way of saying I know something you don't know but I can't tell you 'cause it's a secret. But I don't know why I know it. (agitated) I live in the real world. I've lived there my whole life. I'm comfortable there. GALLAGHER We're not in the real world. We're on Mars. (softly) Nobody gets in a rocket ship to outer space without some kind of faith. Do they? Burchenal doesn't answer. Not directly. But he looks like a third grader busted in some elaborate story he can't keep up. BURCHENAL If you think I'm gonna have some kind of weak-ass epiphany for you right here in this cave, you're wrong. Now, why don't you get that light outta my eyes and let me try to rest. Gallagher's satisfied. Lowers the light to a dull glow, leans back against the rock and... EXT. ARES - DAY/NIGHT The ship slips into darkness. INT. ARES - FLIGHT DECK - NIGHT Bowman reaches for the mike, begins - BOWMAN Ground crew, this is Ares. Do you read? (off no response) Ground crew, this is Ares. Do you read? INT. CAVE - NIGHT The radio lies on the ground. The green light flickers with her transmissions. But little signal seeps through the rock. What there is is MUFFLED and INDISTINCT. BOWMAN (V.O.) Zzzzz zzz, zzz zz, zzzzzz? And Gallagher and Burchenal are fast, fast asleep. INT. ARES - FLIGHT DECK - NIGHT Time's passed. Bowman has searched with the 10m scope. IR, thermal. She picks up the occasional footprint. Tracks their progress. Finds some odd rock configurations. And...nothing. They're just gone. Finally, she gives up. Picks up mic sadly for one last time - BOWMAN Ground crew, this is Ares. It was a pleasure and an honor to serve with you, gentlemen. Sits quietly a moment, then turns off the screen. Brings up a new image. Shows her current fuel status, position and projected path. She begins to work on getting home. EXT. MARS SURFACE - NIGHT Dead quiet. The two small moons shine faintly. A rime of ice covers everything. The hillock shimmers in the feeble light. The rock entrance is sealed over with frost. INT. CAVE - NIGHT Gallagher and Burchenal breathe shallowly. The inside of the cave is covered in white flaking hoarfrost. Lips are blue. Skin is pale. Gallagher's eyes open. Something's wrong. Doesn't know what. And then he realizes the air moving in and out of his lungs isn't doing him any good at all. The door is caked shut with ice. There's no air. He moves badly, uncoordinated, but manages to chop and shove it open. Fresh ice cold air rushes in. Burchenal awakes. Only half-responsive. Gallagher grabs him, drags him out. GALLAGHER Breathe! Breathe! EXT. MARS SURFACE - NIGHT Cognizance returns. Burchenal looks at his watch. It doesn't make any sense. Three hours have passed. Three hours... BURCHENAL Son of a bitch. Son of a bitch. We've been asleep for three hours! Gallagher desperately hauls out the radio. GALLAGHER Ares, this is ground crew. Ares, this is ground crew. BURCHENAL Forget it. She's dayside again. If she's even still here. (then) We gotta get to Cosmos. Burchenal looks around. Oh God...It gets worse. BURCHENAL Can't see the landmarks. Gallagher starts to madly scan the night sky. GALLAGHER We gotta keep moving. He yanks out his HCC. Mutters rapidly into it. We see the map appear. Hab/Cosmos line marked. Then a star chart for Mars on this day and time. He calls for it to change to a horizon projection. The machine freezes, computes. Brings up a horizon. It matches what Robby sees. And highlights a star sitting just above the horizon that will lead them on their way. Canis Minor. They start to run... A beat. AMEE rises up silently from behind a rock and watches them go. EXT. MARS - SURFACE - NIGHT The two men run. Lit by the two moons Phobos and Deimos - Fear and Terror. It's unbelievably cold. Plumes of breath light up around them as they go. Following the star on the horizon. Across a valley, over a ridge. Over a dune. Scrambling. Up and over the next long, long gradient. They lose the star over this false horizon as they climb. There's something odd, however. A faint broad wash of light coming over the lip. They crest the rise to reveal - VALLEY Completely covered in phosphorescent algae. Pale green and glowing. A mile across, a mile wide. If they weren't rushing for their lives, it would be worth stopping to stare. Across the vale Canis Minor sits directly in the center of a small mountain pass. They're about to dash onward when something - intuition, it's hard to say what - hits Burchenal. BURCHENAL Stop. GALLAGHER What? Burchenals' not quite sure at first. But won't enter the algae. Walks left, walks right. Kneels down. The algae glows. Otherworldly. And then movement. In the f.g. a worm, green, glowing and filled with algae, slithers through. And then another. And another, indistinguishable from the plants around them they've imbibed. And then as Burchenal plays his light out across the valley we realize it's entirely full of worms. Gallagher takes an appalled step back. They're fucked. GALLAGHER We're fucked. Burchenal considers for a moment. And yeah, probably has that epiphany. Then- BURCHENAL (re the pass) Get to the closest point you can safely. I'm gonna go down to that end. He starts to run to the far end. GALLAGHER What are you gonna do? Burchenal's far enough away now that his voice comes over the SUIT RADIO. BURCHENAL (V.O.) I'm gonna distract them. GALLAGHER You're gonna distract the worms?? BURCHENAL (V.O.) Yeah. Perhaps Gallagher ought to give this more thought. But he doesn't. Maybe it's the exhaustion. Maybe it just never would have occurred to him. Burchenal disapears into the darkness and the distance. Gallagher waits. Then - BURCHENAL (V.O.) You ready? GALLAGHER Yeah. BURCHENAL (V.O.) Good. Lemme know when it starts to clear. Gallagher doesn't get it. But a moment later, a shiver runs through the worms. And they start to undulate away. Towards Burchenal. Pulsing faster and faster until it's clear in a moment or two, like a giant amoebae withdrawing, he will have clear access to the pass. BURCHENAL at the far end, is five hundred yards into the worms. They know. They've told each other. And they're coming in pulsating waves. Towards him. At the epicenter. He gags. And hears - GALLAGHER (V.O.) (stunned) It's clear. Burchenal tries to turn around. He's mired now. And they're up to his waist. It's a fucking nematode feeding frenzy. BURCHENAL Good. He can't even lift his feet. They're beginning to cover him now. He can see the color of his suit spreading around him as they devour it. BURCHENAL (then; oddly calm) You were right, son. There's gotta be a reason. This can't just be an accident. I don't know what the worms're doing here or how they got here. But science don't explain it. And it pisses me off to no end. Gallagher turns. He can see now what Burchenal has done. A tiny glowing figure can be seen 1000 yards away. Gallagher's speechless at first... BURCHENAL I'm gonna have to turn off my radio in a sec. So you don't have to hear me screaming like a girl. GALLAGHER What have you done?? BURCHENAL Finding out there's things I don't understand. That science don't know squat about. Maybe even the damn Earth's worth saving. Someone's gotta give it a try. Gotta find out about these worms. Go, get off this fucking planet. During which we've CUT TO Gallagher, 'cause you don't want to see this. BURCHENAL (V.O.) There's two women in Missoula, one in Bozeman. Tell them each they were my last words. And make sure my horse gets sold to someone who knows how to ride. (then) Oh, my Lord... RADIO GOES SILENT. Across the distance we can see a figure, now entirely coated in luminous worms, writhing wildly. Gallagher leaves his light on, starts to run. As Robby flees, we PULL BACK, FURTHER and FURTHER until he's just a tiny figure in the landscape - until we are AT what was Burchenal. The frenzy is all but over. The phosphorescence is gone in the center of the circle. The edges are the color of his suit. Then blood red for forty yards. Bits of bone white. And then right in the dead center, as we watch; gray, spreading, spreading as what was once Burchenal's brain is food for worms. EXT. MARS SURFACE - NIGHT Gallagher scrambles up, steeper and steeper, to the edge of the valley and the ridge line. From the top he can see the way below is his prize - the Cosmos. Checks his watch, hopefully, desperately triggers the radio. GALLAGHER Ares, this is ground crew. Ares, this ground crew. Do you copy? EXT. ARES - NIGHT Above him somewhere in the sky. INT. ARES - MAINTENANCE DECK - NIGHT Bowman is locking out parts of the ship to conserve power on the way home. At first she's not sure she really heard that. Rushes across the room to the radio interface. BOWMAN Ground crew?! Status?? GALLAGHER (V.O.) Me. Alone. The worms just ate Burchenal. Thought you might be gone. (shaky) Guess you promised you wouldn't leave... BOWMAN Robby, I'm...still here. They both know he's caught her still here sheerly by happenstance. GALLAGHER (V.O.) I'm about a kilometer from the Cosmos. It's in sight. Call you when I'm there. EXT. RIDGE LINE (MARS) - NIGHT Gallagher heads down. Bounding down the hill. No algae on his side. He leaves a trail of phosphorescent footprints as he goes. They grow fainter and fainter as he descends. INT. ARES - FLIGHT DECK - NIGHT Bowman comes rushing in. Too fast. Slams up into a wall. Resets. Belts herself in. EXT. COSMOS SITE - NIGHT It's been sitting there for 30 years. As he approaches, the solar panels turn and track towards his light. It's still waiting. Sits on six over-built legs. Sample return vehicle launches off the base. Liquid fuel tanks, sample return container the size of a large trash can. We hear - BOWMAN (V.O.) How you doing? GALLAGHER (unsettled) It's really cold. My fingers aren't sure they want to work. BOWMAN (V.O.) You can do this. (then) The maintenance port has a cover. It should be marked. Gallagher looks it over. Minor stumbling block... GALLAGHER Yeah. In Cyrillic. Finds it anyhow. He flexes his unresponsive fingers, and after a try or two, unscrews the cover, reveals an IR port. GALLAGHER Got it. BOWMAN (V.O.) All right, I'm gonna download this to you. Gallagher yanks out his HHC. Dozen adapters in the back. Finds the one that fits the old modem port on the jerry-rigged radio. GALLAGHER Go. Plugs it in. Stuff flashes. On the HHC, Windows comes up, the Cosmos LaunchMaster program, Cyrillic crudely relabeled in English. Unplugs the modem so he can speak again. GALLAGHER It's still got power. BOWMAN (V.O.) You should be able to run diagnostics. There's a diagnostics check and launch check. He hits diagnostics. The two talk, link up, and - a Windows error screen comes up on the HHC: "Warning - your system has become busy or unstable. Press Ctrl-Alt-Delete to exit programs and reboot." GALLAGHER I know now why it didn't launch. (says the magic words) Control alt delete. Reboots in the blink of an eye. Systems check positive. GALLAGHER It's looking good. BOWMAN (V.O.) Okay, this thing only has two settings. On and off. One sends it all the way back to Earth. As you don't have air, food or water, that would be bad. INT. ARES - FLIGHT DECK - NIGHT Bowman is calculating madly as she goes on. Trying to sound calm. She's anything but. BOWMAN We want just enough lift for escape velocity. With the weight you left at and the suit...I peg you at 165. It was designed to take 200 pounds of rocks home. Tanks are seven liters each. You need to take two liters out of each tank. There's a central purge; you're gonna have to be exact. EXT. COSMOS SITE - DAY As she continues - BOWMAN (V.O.) And you better try to find something to put the fuel in and get it the hell away from there, as we don't want it to go up when the rocket goes off. Gallagher considers. Yeah, it all makes sense. But how? CUT TO: EXT. COSMOS SITE - MINUTES LATER Gallagher, using the few tools he has left, has unbolted the sample return container. Measures its width - GALLAGHER I need you to do some math. A cylinder 50 centimeters wide, how deep is six liters? BOWMAN (V.O.) Eleven and three quarters centimeters. He measures and scribes in the line. GALLAGHER Somewhere, Mr. Plummer, my 10th-grade math teacher, is cackling like a son-of-a-bitch. Under which, he slithers underneath, opens the main purge and fills the big steel bucket with rocket fuel. It looks just like the guy at Texaco, working on your car. Lugs it away from the Cosmos. GALLAGHER Now what? BOWMAN (V.O.) Launch diagnostics. Avoid pressing anything that says ignition. He runs it - seals are good, pumps are good, engine's ready. And the ignition power force, all 300 volts of it, is dead as a doornail. The program suggests the replacement part number. And suggests he order it quickly. Checks again. Answer's the same. He slumps down, sits beside SRM. He ain't going nowhere. Just sits there. Can't move. Can't speak. After all this, he's fucked. Stares out into the distance. Finally - BOWMAN (V.O.) Gallagher? GALLAGHER No. No go. There's enough power to run the computer, but not enough to launch. BOWMAN (V.O.) How much do you need? GALLAHER I need 300 volts at six amps. And I've 28 volts running the computer system. Ignition battery's stone cold. Beat. BOWMAN (V.O.) Is there anything you can use? GALLAGHER Let me look around and see if I see a high voltage source....No, just rocks. In fact, everywhere I look, there's just fucking rocks. And more fucking rocks. Then, as he tries not to break down - GALLAGHER I'm gonna die here. INT. ARES - FLIGHT DECK - NIGHT She's shook. She knows he's right. Not a damn thing she can say. Tries to maintain. Barely. Looks up at one of the screens. In four minutes she's back on day side orbit. And then home. INTERCUT WITH: EXT. COSMOS SITE - NIGHT Gallagher steadies himself. Picks the radio back up. He's just babbling to keep himself sane for a little while. GALLAGHER I didn't come here to be a citizen. I came as a tourist. You know, visit Mars, check out the sights. Go home. Bowman tries to do the right thing. Whatever the hell that is...Takes a breath, wipes away an errant tear, tries to be calm for him. BOWMAN Is there anything you want me to do? GALLAGHER (thinks; then) Tell all of Burchenal's women that they were the only one. Sell his horse to somebody nice. BOWMAN For you? GALLAGHER No. Then, burbling up, unplanned... GALLAGHER I shoulda kissed you. There's a long beat. Yeech. He shouldn't have said anything. Then - BOWMAN Yeah. You shoulda kissed me. Gallagher can't believe it. He could kick himself. GALLAGHER (to himself) Okay. This is like all the worst parts of high school math and the beautiful girl you're too stupid to tell you're madly in love with. And then, I get to die. What a shitty day. (into radio) Commander Bowman, I am really sorry I didn't kiss you. Really, really sorry. He pauses. Only half a beat, but... INT. ARES - FLIGHT DECK - NIGHT She bursts from the darkness into the light of day side and is gone. RADIO turns to STATIC... EXT. COSMOS SITE - NIGHT When he goes on - GALLAGHER Loved you madly, shoulda said so. It's too late. She never hears. STATIC. He realizes she's gone. Puts the radio down. He is very, very alone. INT. ARES - FLIGHT DECK - DAY She sits there, just gut-shot for a moment. Picks up the mike. BOWMAN Houston, this is Ares, commencing return sequence. INT. MISSION CONTROL - DAY On all the PIM's her return trajectory is plotted. She's to come all the way across the day side, enter night, begin acceleration and slingshot around the backside of Mars and head home. SKAVLEM Copy. Ares, beginning return She steels herself then reports the rest of the news - BOWMAN (V.O.) Ground crew, reduced to Gallagher, reached Cosmos, failed second diagnostics. No joy, no launch. While crew member is still extant, mission commander declaring him E.O.M. Commencing return. There's silence in Mission Control. Not everyone has followed the circumvention. TECH What was all that? SCHLISSEL Gallagher made it to the Cosmos, won't launch, he's alive, she's gotta leave him. TECH Whoa. BOROKOVSKI Da... EXT. COSMOS SITE - NIGHT Gallagher sits there. And sits there. Alone beyond imagining. Hope gone. Just staring 1000 yards out into the distance. Not looking at anything. Waiting to die. He's given up. And then...he shakes himself out of it. Just feels foolish he's let himself go this far. Gets up. Done with feeling sorry for himself. GALLAGHER Well, this can't get any worse. I guess. Grabs himself to stay warm. Hops up and down. On one of the hops he ends up facing the direction he came from. There's something green and phosphorescent coming over the ridge. They've tracked him. Footprint by footprint. He looks closer. It's not just the ridge. They're down in the valley with him. The ones in the front are back to translucent, not glowing anymore. They're hungry for something new. He gets down low to silhouette them against the sky. There are already four or five hundred thousand on this side of the hill. And they're coming. Faster. GALLAGHER I guess I was wrong. It can get worse. A lot fucking worse. (shouts at them) Forgive me if I don't feel like getting eaten before I die! They don't really respond. Except the ones in the front who rear up, and seem to listen or sniff for him. And gnash their little crystalline teeth. They split now to come at him from two sides. Gallagher gets caught in a dry-heave. GALLAGHER Oh, man... Sees the bucket of rocket fuel. Lot closer to them than it is to him. Gathers his nerve, runs, grabs the bucket. Drags it twenty feet back. Then tilts it, carefully pouring it out in a ring around himself and the Cosmos. Worms closing in as he goes. Leads a fuse of fuel back towards him. Lights it. It burns low and yellow in the oxygen-depleted atmosphere. Doesn't look like much. Certainly not a defence. First worm gets near it. Unsure. Bewildered. Pulls back. But his compatriots are behind him, still coming. No choice. He advances. And...POOF. VAPORIZES in burst of red-orange as he touches the flame. And the next...And the next. Like little sparks. Gallagher watches, puzzled by this...And then it hits. Right as the ring of flame is about to die out. The main wave touches the ring of fire. And...they do burn. And SCREAM. Little WORM SCREAMS that multiplied by tens and hundreds of thousands begin to pierce the air. GALLAGHER That's for eating the Hab! And killing Cooper, you slimy worm fuckers! Rolling waves of flame. Half plasma. Flying blobs of burning worms rain down like napalm. One lands on and torches the cobbled-together radio. It's so damn hot for a moment Gallagher panics, thinking everything might explode. Then it drops to embers and the wave burns over the hill like a wild fire. Gallagher does a dance of triumph. However short-lived. Then it hits him - GALLAGHER How do you burn like that without oxygen?? There's a BLAST of flame from the far side of the ridge that rattles rocks and Cosmos. Knocks him to the ground. GALLAGHER Holy shit...Holy shit! Gallagher stares with wonder over the hill. He figured it out. There's a couple of dozen worms, unburnt and thrown free. He picks one up, looks at it. GALLAGHER You motherfuckers stole all the oxygen. (realizes) And you can give it back. Motherfuckers. I gotta tell someone. It could work. It could work here... He turns, looks - the radio is still burning. He snatches it up, scorches him. Tries to put it out. It's cooked. Deceased. He's devastated. Drops to his knees. GALLAGHER No!! Not after all this. No!!! It ain't gonna work ever again. All the shouting isn't gonna make a difference. He knows the answer, he knows how to save the species and there's no one he can tell. As he stumbles back onto his feet, he's jarred the switch that links to AMEE's display. it comes on, shows: AMEE'S POV The fire on the far side of the ridge. She's approaching it. And fast. BACK TO SCENE Gallagher stares at it for a moment... GALLAGHER My day is not getting better, is it. There's a look on his face somewhere between inspiration and fear. Like he's got an idea. But it might be a really, really bad one... EXT. MARS SURFACE - NIGHT AMEE skitters along. Moving fast. Climbs up and ever so carefully peers over the ridgeline. AMEE'S POV The Cosmos down below. And beneath it, his feet sticking out as he works on something, Gallagher. He messed with her once; she recognizes him. If she could bare her teeth like an angry dog, she would. AMEE considers for a moment. Makes her move. EXT. COSMOS SITE - NIGHT She comes down the hill. Twelve, sixteen, twenty-foot strides. Doing forty or fifty miles an hour easy. And all but silently. Gallagher hasn't yet responded. And then she's all the way to him. She rears up to strike and - And Gallagher, in his skivvies, bursts up from where he's buried himself in the sand, avenging, entrenching tool high over his head, already swinging as AMEE wheels back around and...He chops off both her eyes. Sidesteps as she rushes him blindly and backhands her in her electronic Marine cranium from behind. Whatever he's hit, the jolt stiffens his arm, throws him off. The tool stays embedded. She runs headlong into the Cosmos. Smashes, stumbles, falls. And before she can get back up to her feet...He wraps the sleeve of his shirt around his hand, rescues the entrenching tool and deals a death stroke to the silver arachnid. GALLAGHER Robust real-time response to the environment, my butt. Gallagher grabs his satchel of tools and begins to unbolt her as fast as he can. Checks his watch. Whatever he's racing, there's only minutes to go. Deep within the electronic entrails of AMEE, he dredges up her Esource. Size of a soda can. POWER CELL that runs her for year and a half. HUMS as he removes it from its shielded container. It's 280 volts. GALLAGHER Work. He rips open a panel on the Cosmos, yanks out the dead cell and hooks the new one in. It doesn't fit. He's got nothing left but a couple of wrenches and a tube of epoxy. Glues it in place. Runs the launch Diagnostics on his HCC. It flickers, goes to yellow, flashes on and off to green. He yanks back on his suit. Grabs a handful of the uncharred worms and seals them in the container that held the Esource. Stuffs it in a side pocket. Looks at the top of SRV. Wedges himself under some cables and wiring on the top. GALLAGHER This oughta be interesting. Checks his watch. It's now or never. EXT. ARES - DAY The ship is just about to enter the darkside. INT. ARES - FLIGHT DECK - DAY Bowman's got her suit on. Screens show the apogee launch and a slingshot around the backside. BOWMAN Houston, this is Ares. I am go for return ignition. SKAVLEM (V.O.) Copy that, Ares, you are go for return. She slides into the darkness. EXT. COSMOS SITE - NIGHT Gallagher watches the second hand come around, takes a deep breath, and... GALLAGHER Fuck you, Mars. ...slaps the helmet shut. Hits ignition. Nothing happens. Then the GRINDING of thirty-year-old PUMPS. And then a GIANT flaming ROAR. And it launches. Gallagher, epoxied to the top, is pinned flat. Face squashes, eyes bulge. Ship starts to glow friction. Thirty-year-old paint chips off like tiny shooting stars burning away as this reverse comet leaves the atmosphere. We can hear him roaring at the top of his lungs as the ROCKET BLOWS by and... MARS pulls away in the b.g. Rapidly contracting. FROM FILLING the FRAME, TO a red circle below. Atmosphere thins, the friction and flame decrease and disappear. SKY turns from deep red to maroon to black as he blows through the clouds into the outer reaches of the Mars atmosphere and beyond. The ENGINES STOP. Fuel's expended. And... Quiet. He comes skittering back from the edge of blacking out. He floats silently, orbiting the planet, slowing receding into the distance. Until he's...gone. EXT. ARES - NIGHT We see Bowman THROUGH the front viewport. Unhurried. Making the last of her preparations. Downhearted and slow. Then - INT. ARES - FLIGHT DECK - NIGHT She's strapped in now. Counter on a screen is ticking down. 13, 12, 11...She tries to allay her horror at what she's doing. Reaches for the mike. BOWMAN Robby... (no answer) If you can still hear me...I'm so sorry. And I shoulda just kissed you. EXT. COSMOS SITE Radio, three-quarters cooked, lays there on the still-smoking ground. INT. ARES - FLIGHT DECK - NIGHT Countdown continues. Nine, eight, seven...Then just breaking the horizon way out in front of her, a shiny metallic speck breaches into the light. It's a man, glued to thirty-year-old spacecraft. Four, three...She slams down an abort button, as with the other hand she twists the radio over to the suit-to-suit frequency. BOWMAN Gallagher... No response. EXT. COSMOS Gallagher is sucking on a few useless raspy breaths. He can see her, ten kilometers away. Barely hanging on. GALLAGHER No. Air. INT. MISSION CONTROL - NIGHT They stare up at the screen awaiting her return ignition. SKAVLEM She should be clearing. Starting the burn. She's not showing. Still not showing. And then... SCHLISSEL There's secondary object in orbit. INT. ARES - FLIGHT DECK Bowman has flipped a set of joysticks/collectives out from underneath the dash in front of her. She's shouting at the computer. BOWMAN Reroute. Orbital maneuvering. Power the OMS, power the R.C.S. I need roll, pitch, yaw, X, Y, Z. Now. Goddammit now! INT. MISSION CONTROL - NIGHT They've figured out what's up. Some are thrilled, others are freaked. LOWENTHAL No! No, there's no fuel for maneuvering. Stop her! Skavlem shakes his head. Not a chance. Nor would she listen to him. BOROKOVSKI She is going to burn fuel to rescue this man without enough to come home? (very Russian of her) I like this girl. INT. ARES - FLIGHT DECK Which is exactly what she does. BOWMAN I want ten milliliter bursts. Now! And puff, puff, puff... EXT. MARS ORBIT - NIGHT Ares, bit by bit, dives down into a smaller orbit to catch up with the Cosmos. INT. ARES - FLIGHT DECK Bowman grabs the whole orbital maneuvering assembly, yanks it out of the flight deck, turns and rushes from the sphere. EXT. COSMOS - ORBIT - DAY As he watches it come closer, he's depleted what little air there was in the suit. And starts to die. INT. ARES - MEV DECK - DAY It's now an empty docking port. Bowman careens in. No artificial gravity here. Floats as she shouts at the computer. BOWMAN I want a 180 degree. Now! EXT. ARES - ORBIT - DAY Puff, puff...The ship turns end over end. As... INT ARES - MEV DECK Kate plugs the maneuvering deck in with one hand, slaps an oxygen bottle on and her helmet shut. BOWMAN Seal this level! Open the dock. Clips herself in just in time as the DOORS behind her SLAM shut and the giant doors in front of her open. Air purges. And in front of her, 300 yards away, is the Cosmos. BOWMAN Gallagher! Gallagher! He doesn't respond. EXT. COSMOS - CLOSE ON HIM Because he's unconscious or dead. His head lolls there. INT. ARES - MEV DECK There's no time left for subtlety. Bowman yanks a device off the wall. It looks like a 40mm rifle with a power cable. Points it at him. Triggers it. It's a huge laser pointer. Lights him up. Shouts to the computer. BOWMAN Hard Dock! The ship pauses, like it's thinking. And refuses. ANNUNCIATOR (V.O.) Object out of range. Emergency braking will commence in seven seconds. Ares turns off the pointer. Kate throws it angrily aside. There's a linear acceleration track on the side of the wall with a line thrower attached. She clips in. Grabs something the size of a medicine ball with seventy nozzles sticking out of it in her free hand. And shouts - BOWMAN Last acquisition. Line release. Full velocity. And it does. The linear accelerator wrenches her violently along the track and hurls her into space. REEL and a line behind her WHIR. It's like the world's largest angler has cast her into the void. EXT. ORBIT - DAY Tumbling, she half-regains her bearing, holds out the mini-thrust ball. Shouts something at it. FIRES. Drags her by the arm towards Cosmos. She hits it. Twisting, flailing, way too hard. Half knocks herself out. Recovers, clips in with the tether on her suit. Gallagher is completely insensate. She shouts something in the silence we can't hear. The reel in the ship starts to spin. So damn fast it's smoking. The Cosmos is reeled in, oscillating wildly at the end of the line. The Ares, giant by comparison, is about to swallow up the tiny SRM and its two passengers. At 45 mph. INT./EXT. ARES - MEV DECK Dock comes careening at them. They're both going to be squashed like bugs. Bowman slashes loose the line. And fires everything left in the portable thrust engine at once. Blue plasma flares. Her arm is wrenched wildly, pulled from its socket. But... The Cosmos spins 180 degrees as they plunge through the opening of the port into the Ares. They're on the lee side as the Cosmos hits the far side of the dock like a freight train. BOWMAN Seal! Emergency atmosphere. Now! The DOCKING DOORS SLAM SHUT. The room is buffeted in white mist. She grabs an emergency cutting tool, hooks it into the front of Gallagher's suit. Rips it open from stem to stern. He's limp, unresponsive. BOWMAN No. Not after all that, dammit. No. She checks, he has no pulse. BOWMAN Dammit, no! A first aid station is bolted into the wall. She grabs him by the shirtfront, launches them over there. Takes out a pair of pre-gummed HEART PADDLES, slaps them onto his chest and FIRES them. Gallagher is thrown entirely across the room by the current. Slams into the far wall. Opens his eyes. Starts to breathe. GALLAGHER Hey, I knew you wouldn't leave without me. (beat) You promised. INT. MISSION CONTROL - NIGHT They're all stunned. And freaked. They've got a serious problem now. BOWMAN (V.O.) Mission Control. This is Ares. Recovered ground crew. Request recalc and reconfiguration for return flight. Orbit is stable but diminished. The scientists have been figuring madly. And they don't like what they're coming up with. LOWENTHAL We can get 'em back. Slowly. Fifty extra days. And we're not going to be able to support food and and air for two people. Russert nods. Motions to Skavlem. INT. ARES - FLIGHT DECK - DAY Bowman and Gallagher listen as - SKAVLEM (V.O.) ...that travel has been increased by approximate two months. Concern is that available life support is untenable for duration and current crew strength. Gallagher's unimpressed. Worms tried to eat him, robots tried to kill him and they're worried about this? Feh. GALLAGHER Scientists. Scientists sent us here. Scientists figured the whole thing out with Mars. I hate to bring this up, but they got us into this whole mess in the first place. Hell, they shouldn't be allowed to drive 'cause they miss the turnoff as they consider the ramifications of the internal combustion engine. He picks up the mike. GALLAGHER Hey, guys. How 'bout we come about halfway home and you send a ship with air and food and stuff to meet us? In the middle. And we don't have to get all the way back. Huh? INT. MISSION CONTROL - NIGHT Schlissel nods. That'd work. As Russert, Lowenthal and the big guys start to talk this over, Borokovski motions to Schlissel and his new friend the Tech. BOROKOVSKI I know where there is a rocket in Uzbeckistan. For cheap. A friend of mine has kept it. INT. ARES - FLIGHT DECK - DAY OUT the window, Mars drifts by in the view port. Bowman looks at it kinda sadly. BOWMAN So much for saving humankind and living on Mars. I guess the worms took care of that. GALLAGHER The worms are not our enemy. They're our friends. He's pulled the container out of his pocket. Unscrews it to show her the little slimy monsters. She recoils in horror. BOWMAN You brought them back? Are you insane?? GALLAGHER It's okay, I'm pretty sure they don't like titanium. (then) We're gonna live. On Mars. Hell, maybe even back on Earth. Maybe anywhere we want. And the reason we're gonna live, is the damn worms. Yeah, they ate all the algae, and damn near everything else, but they store and excrete oxygen. She finds this hard to believe. But he explains. GALLAGHER That's why we could breathe. You should have seen these suckers burn when they went up. I had some time to think about this. I was in orbit for six minutes before you found me. I shoulda been dead. But the air locked in the suit was almost pure O2. 'Cause of the worms. We didn't just find a new place to live on, we may have saved our old one. Toxic waste, they'll eat it. Poisonous landfills, they'll eat it. She's still trying to absorb all this. It's been a long couple of days. GALLAGHER God's got a sense of humor. He's giving us another chance. If we can all get along this time. Burchenal knew somewhere that it wasn't the science, it was about having something to believe in. Bud always knew. Wonders of the deep. We just had to go to Mars to remind ourselves of what we should have been able to see back on Earth. It's not all about us. We can't kill everything and survive. Bowman looks back at Mars. Astounded. Believes. BOWMAN You wanna tell them back on Earth the species is saved and we're gonna live? GALLAGHER How should I know, I'm the janitor. (then) Look, Commander...I just fought off half a million screaming nematodes, and a killer robot and glued myself onto a rocket to get offa Mars, and I was wondering... BOWMAN If you could kiss me? GALLAGHER Yeah. BOWMAN Yeah. He does. She kisses him back. They continue for a long damn time. Finally, they break apart and... BOWMAN It's an extra fifty days back. GALLAGHER Gee, wonder what we'll find to do with ourselves. As she starts to laugh... FADE OUT. THE END

               Repo Man theme music now begins playing. Map is shown in background 
               (green text on black background), zoomed in on Los Alamos, New 
               Mexico. While remaining credits are shown, the map travels to 
               Sante Fe, then Albuquerque, then begins following US66 west through 
               Arizona to California, finally ending up a few miles east of 
               Goffs (northwest of Needles).
 
               Green '64 Chevy Malibu

               Malibu is weaving down the highway in the desert, passes billboard 
               with motorcycle cop behind it. Cop pulls out behind Malibu.

                         Oh my darlin, oh my darlin...
 
               Motorcycle cop pulls the car over, gets off motorcycle and raps 
               on car window.

                         Clementine Clemen-

                                     COUNTY SHERIFF
                         Let me see your drivers license.

                                     COUNTY SHERIFF
                         From out of town, hmm? What's you got 
                         in the trunk?
 
                                     J. FRANK PARNELL
                         oah...you don't want to look in there.

                         Give me the keys.

               The motorcycle cop walks around to the back of the car and opens 
               the trunk. The car has New Mexico license plates KBB-283. In 
               every scene after this when the plates are visible, they will 
               be 127-GBH.

                         AHHHHHH!

               The motorcycle cop gets disintegrated, leaving behind a pair 
               of flaming boots (a reference to the movie Timerider, which was 
               co-written and produced by Mike Nesmith). Parnell watches from 
               side mirror, where we see that the left side of his sunglasses 
               have no lens.

                         Oh my darlin Clementine, you are lost 
                         now gone forever, dreadful sorry Clementine.
 
                         
               Otto and Kevin, in the supermarket, facing cans of generic yellow 
               cling sliced peaches.

                         Do De Da Do De Do De Do Feeling seven-up. 
                         I'm feeling seven-up. Feeling seven 
                         up. I'm feeling seven up. It's a crisp 
                         refreshing feeling crystal clear and 
                         light. America's drinking seven-up and 
                         it sure feels right. Feeling lucky seven.
 
                         
               Otto puts price sticker on Kevin's glasses.

                         Hum. I wasn't singing guy.

                                     OTTO
                         I'm standing right next to you and you're 
                         fucking (flippin) singing. Cut it out.
 
                         
                                     KEVIN
                         Jeeze. Why so tense guy?

                                     MR. HUMPHRIES
                         Otto?

                                     KEVIN
                         Mister Humphries!

                                     MR. HUMPHRIES
                         You were late again this morning. Now 
                         normally I'd let it go but it's been 
                         brought to my attention that you're 
                         not paying attention to the way you 
                         space the cans. Many young men of your 
                         age in these uncertain times-
 
                                     MR. HUMPHRIES
                         Otto! Are you paying attention to me?
 
                         
                                     LOUIE
                         Hey! He's talking to you!

               Kevin chuckles

               Otto grabs Kevin by the front of his shirt, steps around him, 
               and pushes him into the stack of cans (this has been described 
               as a goof but it's clearly just a case of awkward staging used 
               to make the shot work).
 
               Louie pulls his gun.

                                     LOUIE
                         (Basta!) 

                                     KEVIN
                         You gotta love getting fired from your 
                         job in a big way, Otto.
 
                                     MR. HUMPHRIES
                         What are you laughing at? Louie, throw 
                         him out too.
 
                                     LOUIE
                         Come on you  worm. Get out of here.
 
                         
               Louie shoves Kevin down aisle where Otto is walking out. Otto 
               takes off his clip-on bow tie and tosses it back towards Louie. 
               Louie twirls his gun and puts it away. Note that the store aisle 
               is lined with nothing but generic products, plain black lettering 
               on white background. All products in movie from now on will have 
               this appearance.

               Otto is there slamdancing and Duke walks up, the two of them 
               swing each other around. Behind them, the graffiti on the wall 
               says "Circle Jerks", a band which will appear later in the movie.

                         out of the slammer man?
 
               Otto enters bedroom where Debbi is waiting in bed.

                         Huh?

               Otto lays back on the bed and puts his hands behind his head.
 
               
                                     OTTO
                         okay

               Debbi pulls back his shirt a little and begins kissing his stomach, 
               then stops.
 
                                     DEBBI

               Otto goes downstairs and there's a party going on. Institutionalized 
               plays in background.

                         be the host here.
 
                                     KEVIN
                         Ow!

                         Debbi honey. I got you a beer.

               Otto turns on light and finds Duke there with Debbi.

               Otto leaves room just as Kevin arrives and looks in the door.

               Jazz music plays on the radio. In almost all scenes inside of 
               Bud's car, Jazz music will be playing on the radio.
 
               In this sequence the background changes from day to night, back 
               to day, and back to night again (during the speed snorting scene) 
               even though the dialog seems continuous. I believe that this 
               was done intentionally to show the passage of time, but the disjointed 
               events are cut so smoothly as to make it seem like they goofed 
               the continuity. It's clearer in the TV version where there truly 
               is a break between the line about speed and the actual snorting.

               it in order to establish a good credit rating. Then they go out 
               and buy nice cars and never make payments on them.

                         People get so hung up on specifics. 
                         They miss out on seeing the whole thing. 
                         Take South America for example. In South 
                         America thousands of people go missing 
                         every year. Nobody knows where they 
                         go. They just like disappear. But if 
                         you think about it for a minute, you 
                         realize something. There had to be a 
                         time when there was no people. Right?

                         But I do want to eat from a machine. 
                         Vended food contains all the necessary 
                         nutrients for survival. Taste damn good 
                         too, by golly. And plus, on any given 
                         evening, the machine that last night 
                         gave you cheetos might dispense instead... 
                         Doritos. Yohos. Oreos. Tosquitos (tostitos?). 
                         Or Lorna Doones.
 
                                     KEVIN
                         Lorna Doones? I love Lorna Doones.
 
                         
               Parnell walks off screen and we hear puking sounds.

                                     KEVIN
                         Oh hey! You want me to check the trunk? 
                         Scuze me.
 
               Lagarto and Napoleon pull up in a car one other side of pumps. 
               Latino music plays on their car radio.
 
                                     KEVIN
                         Hi! I'm Kevin!

                                     NAPOLEON
                         Hey buddy! How you doing? Huh? Hey don't 
                         you remember me? I was here yesterday. 
                         Heh. Listen I think I left a book of 
                         matches over in your office over there. 
                         You want to go and check for me huh?

                         Sure thing.

                                     NAPOLEON
                         Hey thanks a lot buddy.

                                     KEVIN
                         Any thing for you babes.

                                     NAPOLEON
                         All right, you're beautiful. I love 
                         you.
 
                                     KEVIN
                         I'll be right back.

               Lagarto gets in the Malibu and both cars drive off. Kevin returns 
               from inside and sees both cars gone. Two other attendants sit 
               at a table and also look; the attendant on the right is director 
               Alex Cox.
 
                                     KEVIN
                         What??

               Otto and Mrs. Parks in Mrs. Parks' living room

                                     OTTO
                         It's really very simple Mrs. Parks. 
                         You don't want me to take your car and 
                         I don't want to take your car. Now I 
                         said to the boss I said ah Look! I do 
                         not want to repossess this ladys car.
 
                         
               Sound of motorcycles pulling up outside of house.

                                     MRS. PARKS
                         Well I've been in the hospital you see.
 
                         
                                     OTTO
                         Yeah, Yes I understand. My job is really 
                         on the line over this one. I could lose 
                         it right away.
 
                                     MRS. PARKS
                         I'll see if I can borrow some money 
                         from somewhere.
 
                                     OTTO
                         That's terrific. Really terrific.

               Mrs. Park's son and his fellow band members enter

                                     MRS. PARKS
                         Oh how was the rehearsal son?

                                     MRS. PARKS' SON
                         It was O.K. Who's this?

                                     MRS. PARKS
                         Oh this is Mr. Otto. He's from the finance 
                         company. He's been telling me that he 
                         isn't going to take the car this time, 
                         even though he could.
 
                                     OTTO
                         Well, uh, gotta get going here.

               Otto fumbles nervously with his briefcase trying to close it.
 
               
                                     MRS. PARKS

                         Uh excuse me.

               Otto walks outside and gets in car. From outside we hear Mrs. 
               Parks yelling at her son.
 
                                     MRS. PARKS
                         I gave you the money last week to pay 
                         it and you didn't do it. What did you 
                         do with it? I'm so tired of giving you 
                         money and you squandering it. I know 
                         what you done you all went out dancing 
                         some where. That's what you did. Next 
                         time I give you some money I want you 
                         to put it in the car ya hear. You're 
                         working. How come you didn't do it huh? 
                         I don't know what's happened to you. 
                         (continues softly)
 
               Otto starts car and guns engine, but now we clearly see that 
               the rear wheels are up on jacks (that it wasn't up on jacks before 
               has been listed as a goof and even confirmed by Alex Cox, but 
               I think they're wrong. It is hard to tell in the dark, but you 
               can see the base of one of the jacks lit up by a light from the 
               house which goes dark as a band member runs in front of it on 
               the other side of the car, thus confirming that the car actually 
               was up on jacks in all the scenes).
 
               Band members run out of house and pull Otto out of car.

                                     OTTO
                         Hey it's cool. It's cool. I like music 
                         too man, hey
 
               Otto gets beat up. One band member hits him twice over the head 
               with a guitar, making an audible "kabong" noise. Supposedly you 
               can hear one member saying "this one's for Keith Moon", but I've 
               never been able to make it out.
 
               Miller, Plettschner and Otto in the lot.

               Miller is chanting and dancing like a native American as he puts 
               a bandage on Otto's head.

               drinks through straws.

               off with a noticable green glow coming from inside.

                         this dead body. I'm, I'm carrying his 
                         limp torso to the truck. And he feels 
                         like like he has only been dead a little 
                         while but...
 
               Otto sees the Malibu and gives chase. Losing the car, he stops 
               on a bridge to puke. When done, he sees the Malibu emerge from 
               under the bridge. He runs down the stairs and after the Malibu 
               as it goes through a railroad crossing which has red lights blinking 
               and bell ringing. J. Frank Parnell stops and lets him in.

                         I go to Utah every year. Friend of mine, 
                         was a designer of the MX missile race 
                         track basing mode. A hundred thousand 
                         miles of railroad track on a big loop 
                         through Utah, Arizona, and Nevada. Bombs 
                         were going to hide in locomotive sheds. 
                         That way the red team would never know 
                         exactly where they were. I still go 
                         out to Utah, just to think about the 
                         way things might have been.

                         its bad for you. Pernicious nonsense! 
                         Everybody could stand a hundred chest

                         too. When they canceled the project 
                         it almost did me in. One day my mind 
                         was literally a-burst. The next day 
                         nothing. Swept away... But I showed 
                         them. I had a lobotomy in the end.

                         Leaves buildings standing. It fits in 
                         a suit case. It's so small no one knows 
                         it's there until blammo. Eyes melt skin 
                         explodes everybody dead. It's so immoral 
                         working on the thing can drive you mad. 
                         That's what happened to this friend 
                         of mine. So he had a lobotomy. Now he's 
                         well again.

                         Well, what did you tell them? Did you 
                         tell them I was sick?
 
                                     OTTO'S DAD
                         We told them the truth, son. Gave them 
                         your address at work.

               steps through door. Otto steps outside and is immediately captured 
               by agents.

                         I'm going to ask you a few questions. 
                         And since time is short and you may 
                         lie, I'm going to have to torture you. 
                         But I want you to know it isn't personal.

                         the yard.
 
               Otto his hit with electric shock and screams.

                         I don't think he knows.

                         No one is innocent. Proceed.

               Another electric shock and screams. Then Marlene and the Rodiguez 
               brothers enter interrogation room and rescue Otto.

                         nets, those ridiculous trench coats.

                         That's some weird fucking shit (filthy 
                         stuff) Eh Bud? What's going on man?
 
                         
                                     BUD
                         Shit (damn)! Eleven years of repoing 
                         cars and what have I got? Shit (zilch)!
 
                         
                                     OTTO
                         Bud listen to me. You're sitting in 
                         a car worth twenty thousand dollars. 
                         Look look we we turn it in we take the 
                         money and split it sixty forty. You

				     RESIDENT EVIL
	
	PRESENTATION CREDITS appear... then FADE...
	
	Out of BLACK... SHOCK CUT TO:
	
	INT   LAB   "A" LEVEL   TIMELESS
	
	A MAN'S FACE, filling the screen.
	
				MARCUS (filter)
			Stay away from here!
	
	We're watching A VIDEO MONITOR. A pre-recorded tape shows
	a view of what is obviously a pristine-RESEARCH LABORATORY.
	DR. JOHN MARCUS, in a lab coat, faces THE CAMERA, disheveled
	and looking like a madman.
	
				MARCUS (cont. filter)
			This lab must remain sealed!
	
	INT   CONFERENCE ROOM   TIMELESS
	
	Overhead lamps cast pools of LIGHT down onto A CONFERENCE
	TABLE, onto THE HANDS of PEOPLE assembled to observe the
	video. We see NO FACES. But expensive WATCHES, sleeves
	with high-ranking STRIPES, indicate wealth, power, and a
	military presence.
	
	THE VIDEO: On the wall behind MARCUS, we see SHADOWS darting
	frantically. We hear VOICES rising in panic.
	
				MARCUS (cont. Filter)
			For God's sake, don't come in!
	
	The CAMERA is SWATTED by A HAND that lurches suddenly into
	the foreground. We only see it for a few video frames, but
	we might subliminally notice LESIONS on the flesh. The IMAGE
	SWIRLS wildly. The next clear picture we see... is of the
	same laboratory...topsy-turvy. THE CAMERA is lying on its
	side on the floor.
	
				VOICE IN THE ROOM (o.s.)
			Look.  Here.
	
	A LASER POINTER casts a RED DOT on a corner of the video
	screen, indicating A HUNCHED FIGURE, leaning over A HUMAN
	BODY, apparently ...feeding! With a GRUNT, the figure turns.
	and LUNGES, it's face covered with BLOOD, at the CAMERA. The
	image SWIRLS again, and the SCREEN GOES BLACK. With a MUSIC
	STING, a single TITLE appears, full across the blackness...
	
			        RESIDENT EVIL
	
	
	Pg-2
	
	EXT  FOREST LAND   PRE-DAWN
	
	A DARK SKY ...and in the foreground, profiled against a FULL
	MOON, A DARK FACE ...watching the heavens with piercing black
	eyes, alert, though not predatory. This is CHRIS REDFIELD,
	young, handsome. More than simply an outdoor type, he seems
	perfectly in place, almost part of the environment.
	
	A band of purple tints the horizon, outlining the tops of
	magnificent uncorrupted hills that extend for miles. Sitting
	on a ridge, squinting into that band of light, Chris sees ...
	
	...AN EAGLE coasting on a channel of wind that cuts through
	the hilltops. As the bird moves swiftly closer, it becomes
	recognizable. Chris smiles and jots a note on a pad.
	
	The regal bird lands on a high rock where ...unexpectedly...
	a freshwater trout lies flapping, three-thousand feet above
	the highest water.
	
				CHRIS
			Take it, Goliath. It's yours.
	
	"Goliath" snaps up the fish and flies away with it.
	
				CHRIS (cont.)
			See ya next year, guy.
	
	Chris reaches into a water-filled bucket, pulls out another
	trout, climbs efficiently, unerringly, across a precarious
	Cliffside, and deposits the fresh fish on the-same high rock.
	ANOTHER EAGLE, smaller, a female, appears in the sky.
	
				CHRIS (cont.)
			Cleopatra.
	
	Chris scrambles back to his place and jots another note.
	
	"Cleopatra" spots the fish, pumps her wings, and swoops down.
	She's about to snap up the prize, but at the last minute, she
	recoils and climbs again, hovering.
	
				CHRIS (cont.)
			Come on. Come on down.
	
	The eagle circles, its sharp eyes scanning. It makes another
	dive, but stops short again.
	
				CHRIS (cont.)
			What's the matter, beautiful?
	
	The bird seems frightened.  Of what? It makes one more dive.
	Gets very close to the fish... but suddenly SHRIEKS and peels,
	away from the rock. Chris sees its eyes, looking crazed, as
	it soars right past him, its wings brushing his hair.
	
	
	Pg-3
	
	CLOSE ON: CHRIS, concerned, as he watches the eagle disappear
	over the hills.
	
	Over his shoulder, we can see the high rock that holds the
	fish. It's out of focus in the background, but the moonlight
	catches SOMETHING MOVING there. Something that lets out a
	sharp INHUMAN SOUND.
	
	Chris whirls around. There's nothing on the rock. Nothing
	at all. The fish has been taken.
	
	
	INT   JILL'S APARTMENT   DAWN
	
	CHRIS walks into a characterless apartment. He quietly
	sheds his clothes. Even in silhouette, we can see that his
	body is in perfect shape, not pumped, but lean and tight.
	Moving lithely, with the natural grace of a cat, he eases
	himself into a bed where...
	
	...a beautiful young girl, JILL VALENTINE, seems to be fast
	asleep. As Chris nestles in beside her, we see that her
	eyes, facing away, are open. Chris gently drapes an arm
	around her and lets his body relax.
	
				CHRIS
			(A whisper) Glad you're still 
			here, lady
	
				JILL
			It's my apartment.
	
				CHRIS
			(Surprised) You're awake.
	
				JILL
			I've been awake. Since you left.
	
				CHRIS
			Sorry.
	
	His apology goes no further. He's still troubled by what
	happened in the hills.
	
				CHRIS (cont.)
			There was... something wrong.
	
				JILL
			What, with my dinner? I never had
			a mother. I'll learn.
	
	Chris smiles politely. He offers...
	
				CHRIS
			I'll do the cooking.
	
	
	Pg-4
	
	...but he can't switch focus.
	
				CHRIS (cont.)
			On the mountain...there...must
			have been something... prowling
			around up there.
	
				JILL
			There are probably all kinds of
			things prowling around up there.
			In the middle of the night.
	
	Chris apologizes again, this time more sincerely.
	
				CHRIS
			I'm sorry. Really. You...have to
			be there at dawn. They ride the
			wind over the ridge.
	
				JILL
			Dawn? You left at one A.M.
	
				CHRIS
			I had to go fishing. It's the fish
			that bring them down, so I can get
			a close look at them. (Enthused)
			I've tracked a dozen of them, Jill.
			Twelve of those big bruisers. I can
			actually recognize them. I've even
			given them names, over the years.
	
				JILL
			You've been doing this for years?
	
				CHRIS
			Only in the early Autumn. When
			they're' migrating.
	
				JILL
			I'II set the alarm for next. October.
	
	Jill rolls over and faces him.
	
				JILL (cont.)
			I wish I could get excited. Really.
			That's the truth. As excited as you,
			over such... simple things.
	
				CHRIS
			Beauty... isn't simple. If it was...
			I'd be beautiful.
	
				JILL
			You are.
	
	Pg-5
	
				CHRIS
			No, no, no.  I'm simple.  You, on the
			other hand...(nuzzling closer)...have
			all that... stuff... hiding underneath
			somewhere. That's what fascinates me.
	
				JILL
			Fascination. Not love?
	
	Jill is being playful. Chris, taking her question to heart,
	becomes introspective.
	
				CHRIS
			I... honestly don't know. I guess
			I've been... living alone too long.
			You're the first, the only woman I've
			ever thought of as... a real partner.
	
	Now Jill becomes introspective.
	
				JILL
			I've always been...afraid of living
			alone. I've always had... people...
			talking at me... knowing they could
			wind me up and I'd do... (shrug) ...
			whatever they wanted.
	
	Chris looks into her eyes. She kisses him gently.
	
				JILL (cont.)
			We all have... something hidden...
			underneath.  Beauty may not be simple.
			But it's not all that complicated,
			Either.  Most of the time, you find
			It... right in the middle of all the...
			confusion.
	
				CHRIS
			I'm part Mohawk. Indians are never
			confused. At least, they never let
			it show.
	
	They kiss again, this time more passionately. Rolling over,
	they begin to make love.
	
	EXT   FARM   DAWN
	The purple horizon is turning orange, but it's still quite
	dark when a crusty old farm-hand, RAKE, opens the creaking
	door of a stable and, with a flashlight, leads THREE HORSES
	out into the morning breeze.
	
	Two dogs, A LAB and A SPANIEL, romp at his heels as Rake
	opens a log gate.
	
	Pg-6
	-
	Two of the untethered horses trot obediently into a large
	corral. The third, a beautiful stallion, resists, snorting,
	tossing its head in high spirit.
	
				RAKE
			Get in there, Lucky. Quit horsin'
			around. Get in.
	
	"LUCKY" moves into the corral, strutting proudly.
	
				RAKE (cont.)
			Swear. If I didn't know you was
			just an animal, I'd say you was all
			full of yourself. GET IN THERE!
	
	Rake waves his flashlight, not meanly, there is clearly a
	great deal of affection here. Rake shuts the gate behind
	the stallion, who begins to gallop around happily inside
	the fence. All seems lovely, until...
	
	...the dogs suddenly go on point. Their ears perk. They
	sniff the air...and begin to WHINE.
	
				RAKE (cont.)
			What's wrong with you two?
	
	KER-RAAKK! A startling SOUND. Rake turns to find Lucky and
	the other horses, their eyes flaring, trying to KICK their
	way out of the fencing. They seem terrified.
	
	CUT TO :
	
	A WIDE SHOT:  of RAKE, and the frightened ANIMALS, from
	two hundred yards away. THE CAMERA MOVES IN, slowly at
	first, then gaining speed... extraordinary SPEED. We are
	seeing THROUGH THE EYES OF... whatever it is that's running,
	charging, SLATHERING HUNGRILY...
	
	...reaching the corral, DARTING through the fence, past the
	KICKING HORSES, and LEAPING at Rake, who whirls around...and
	CRIES OUT in pain as his flashlight BLINDS us with WHITENESS.
	
	EXT   AIR BASE   DAWN
	
	The WHITENESS becomes the GLARE of HALOGEN LIGHTS. We are
	overwhelmed by the SOUND of AIRCRAFT ENGINES. We see MEN,
	armed SOLDIERS, scrambling into combat HELICOPTERS.
	
	A RADIO MAN runs right toward THE CAMERA, holding out an
	open receiver.
	
				RADIO MAN
			Top brass, sir!
	
	
	Pg-7
	
	ANOTHER MAN, in the foreground, takes the radio-phone. We
	can't see his face. Only his forearm, which bears A TATTOO
	of a grinning SKULL.
	
				MAN WITH TATTOO
			Alpha Leader.
	
				VOICE ON PHONE (o.s. filter)
			How long before you get in there?
	
				MAN WITH TATTOO
			Fifteen minutes.
	
	INT   AN OFFICE   DAWN
	
	A SUIT talks on a red telephone. Once again, we see no face.
	An ostentatious diamond RING kicks light as the man snips off
	the end off a Monte Cristo.
	
				MAN WITH RING
			You're good, soldier. But not that
			good. It's five hundred miles away.
			In the backwoods of Pennsylvania.
	
				MAN WITH TATTOO (o.s. filter)
			We have troopers on site. A first-
			strike force. Under cover.
	
	The flame from a wooden match lights the Monte Cristo.
	
				MAN WITH RING
			Very resourceful.  You have my
			permission activate them.
	
	EXT   AIR BASE   DAWN
	
				MAN WITH TATTOO
			I've already done that. You have my
			permission... to say that you gave me
			permission.
	
	THE TATTOOED MAN runs off to join the other SOLDIERS.
	
	INT   JILL'S APARTMENT   MORNING
	
	CHRIS sleeps. JILL is awake, deep in thought, when...
	
	...BRRRRT! It's not a ring, it's a vibration. Jill reaches
	down and extracts something small and black, the size of a
	box of Tic-Tacs, from one of her shoes. She gets out of bed,
	checking to see that Chris is still asleep, and moves into...
	
	
	Pg-8
	
	INT   JILL'S APARTMENT   BATHROOM   MORNING
	
	...a bathroom. Closing the door behind her, she puts the
	small box to her ear, extracts a wire from it, with a tiny
	microphone on its tip, and...
	
				JILL
			(Softly) Valentine.
	
	We can't hear the voice that speaks to her.
	
				JILL (cont.)
			If this is just another a drill,
			I'll strangle you. (She listens)
			Shit. Give me the activation code.
	
	JILL pulls a small ENVELOPE from a toiletry bag. She breaks
	open a wax seal...and takes out a thick paper on which is
	printed... 29-RC-6735.
	
				JILL (cont.)
			(Gaping, not believing) Th-that's
			a match. (Beat) I'm on my way.
	
	Jill clicks off. She dumps something else from the envelope
	into her hand... A BLUE PLASTIC CARD, the size of a Visa,
	blank except for a mag-stripe. There's a small hole in one
	corner, through which a chain is strung. Jill slings the
	chain over head, wearing the blue card like a pendant.
	
	INT   JILL'S APARTMENT   MORNING
	
	CHRIS is still asleep. JILL comes out of the bathroom and
	looks down at him longingly.  Should she wake him?  Tell him
	what's happening?  She wants to, but duty prevents it.  She
	pulls herself away.
	
	INT   JILL'S APARTMENT   CLOSET   MORNING
	
	TCHIK TCHIK TCHIK...JILL pushes aside hangers which hold her
	clothes. She types numbers into a hidden KEYPAD. A SECRET
	PANEL OPENS, revealing a CLOSET WITHIN THE CLOSET, packed
	with COMBAT UNIFORMS and WEAPONS.
	
	INT   JILL'S APARTMENT   MORNING
	
	The sound... TCHUNG... of the front door closing snaps CHRIS
	awake.  His first thought is for his lover.  He reaches out
	and finds that... she's not in bed.  He jumps up, rushes to
	a window, looks down, from the second story, and sees...
	
	
	Pg-9
	
	EXT   JILL'S APARTMENT   MORNING
	
	...JILL, heavily ARMED, in UNIFORM, wearing a beret that has
	an insignia... S.T.A.R.S. She rushes down the front path and
	jumps into A HUMMER with THREE OTHER TROOPERS on board. The
	vehicle pulls instantly away...
	
	...leaving Chris, looking through the window, puzzled, angry,
	and very much wounded.
	
	
	INT/EXT   HUMMER   MORNING
	
	RUSSO drives. WILLIAMS and DISIMONE sit in the back, all
	tough Special-Forces types. JILL, in the front passenger
	seat, though the only female, ranks the highest.
	
				DISIMONE
			Another practice run, right?
	
				RUSSO
			We been practicin' six months!
			For what?
	
				JILL
			For this. This is the real deal.
	
				WILLIAMS
			Honest to God?
	
				JILL
			Based on my experience, Williams,
			God isn't always honest
	
				DISIMONE
			Where we goin'?
	
				JILL
			In there.
	
	Jill points into THE ARKLEY FOREST which lies ahead. Miles
	of old growth-trees shrouded in a ghostly morning mist.
	
	DISSOLVE TO:
	
	EXT   THE FOREST   MORNING
	
	DEEP IN THE HEART OF THE MIST... THE HUMMER bounces over
	non-roads and stops fifty yards from...
	
	...A PAIR OF IRON GATES, each wrought with the letter "A".
	Beyond, the shifting fog offers momentary glimpses of...
	A MANSION.  Huge.  Like Xandau.  THE TROOPERS, amazed,
	climb out and approach the gates.
	
	Pg-10
	
				RUSSO
			If you had the jing to build a place
			like this, would you build it in the
			middle of fuckin' nowhere?
	
				WILLIAMS
			Paris.
	
				DISIMONE
			Manhattan. Upper west.
	
				JILL
			(Wistfully) Some people prefer...
			a quiet life. (Back to business)
			Our orders are to secure the area.
	
				DISIMONE
			From what? This area's been 'secure'
			since the French and Indian War!
	
	A deep, animal SNARL comes from the woods.  The troopers
	raise their weapons as they peer into the underbrush.  The
	fog keeps sunlight from penetrating.  The forest is a maze
	of dark shadows. Leaves flutter.  Limbs SNAP.  Then...
	
	DARK SHAPES can be seen moving, circling.  A half-dozen
	of them.  Maybe more.  Jill whips out a transmitter and
	quickly types an access code.
	
				JILL
			(Into radio) This is Valentine,
			Bravo Team. We, er... we might be
			in trouble, here.
	
	KRITCH! Something LEAPS out of the brush. Automatic
	WEAPONS SPIT reflexively.
	
	KRITCH KRITCH KRITCH...more lunging SHAES appear. The
	troopers scatter, firing, as they are attacked from all
	sides. Jill dives for the shrubbery, shouting into her
	transmitter.
	
				JILL (cont.)
			WE ARE IN TROUBLE!
	
	CUT TO :
	
	INT   HUEY   MORNING
	
	JILL'S VOICE stutters over a headset which is pressed against
	A MAN'S EAR.
	
				JILL (o.s. filter)
			Under attack... by.. .assailants...
			Unidentifi...
	
	Pg-11
	
	Static. Hissing air. The SHOT WIDENS as the man lowers his
	headset. First we see the TATTOO on his arm... a grinning
	SKULL which we recognize. Then, gradually, we see his face.
	Lean and mean, wearing dark sunglasses, this is ALBERT
	WESKER, a hard-assed career officer.
	
				WESKER
			Can you get a trace?
	
	The pilot, LAGUARDIA, responds.
	
				LAGUARDIA
			Lost the beacon. It just cut out.
			Like it was...swallowed by something.
	
	Oddly, Wesker smiles.
	
				WESKER
			I do believe, gentlemen...that we're
			gonna be earning some combat pay.
	
	There are three other MEN on board. The closest to Wesker
	is BARRY BURTON, a muscular black man, as big as a grizzly,
	with the heart of a Teddy.
	
				BARRY
			Damn, if you don't love a fight.
	
				WESKER
			Hey, if I didn't... you'd be a dead
			man. (To the pilot) Call in a nine-
			nine. I want Raccoon City e-vacked.
	
	Wesker and the men fly from the lens.  THE CAMERA passes
	Out through one of the helicopter's windows as the chopper soars
	away.  When the SHOT WIDENS, we see OTHER HUEYS...black,
	unmarked, keeping formation.  Three... six...ten of them.
	
	EXT   FOREST   MORNING
	
	GUNS BLAZE. THE TROOPERS are under assault by thrashing,
	inhuman SHAPES...GROWLING, SNAPPING. JILL rolls into a
	natural trench.  DISIMONE is behind her, WILLIAMS is
	crawling just ahead, his legs pumping.  Jill scoots past
	him and sees that...
	
	...those legs aren't moving on their own.  They've been
	RIPPED AWAY FROM WILLIAMS' TORSO and are being dragged into
	the underbrush by some... BEAST... concealed in the thick
	brush, so we never get a clear look at it.
	
	OTHER BEASTS attack DiSimone.  Then Russo.  We see only
	details.  Jill fires her pistol, point blank... to no avail.
	RED-RIMMED EYES, SNARLING JAWS, DROOLING TEETH descend on
	her as we CUT TO:
	
	
	Pg-12
	
	EXT   JILL'S APARTMENT BUILDING   MORNING
	
	CHRIS steps out of Jill's building. Suddenly, incongruously,
	camo-painted HUEYS swoop down out of the sky.
	
	EXT   RACCOON CITY   MAIN STREET   MORNING
	
	THE CHOPPERS land where they can. COMMANDOS leap out and
	begin to cordon off the town.  Bullhorns blare.
	
	BULLHORN
	There's been an accident in the
	hills nearby. A military aircraft,
	carrying live weapons, has crashed...
	
	EXT   RACCOON CITY   SIDE STREET   MORNING
	
	CHRIS runs down a side-street into AN ALLEY, where he's
	trapped by COMMANDOS, both in front and behind.
	
				SOLDIER
			Let's go, hayseed. (Aiming his M-16)
			You gonna be a good boy?
	
	Chris swallows his fury. Gritting his teeth, he goes along
	with the soldiers, prodded, by rifle barrels, out onto...
	
	EXT   RACCOON CITY  MAIN STREET   MORNING
	
	...Main Street, where there is CHAOS... an Orwellian sight,
	as CITIZENS find themselves horded into helicopters and
	TRUCKS from the local National Guard Post.
	
	A sweating man, still in his pajamas, rushes up to the
	SOLDIERS that are escorting CHRIS.
	
				MAN
			Look here, I'm the Sheriff of this...
	
				SOLDIER
			Step aside.
	
				SHERIFF
			But, I'm the Sheriff! An ex-Army man, like you.
	
				BULLHORN (o.s.)
			There is no immediate danger, but
			as a precaution, we are evacuating
			the area. You will be provided
			shelter until the weapons have been
			removed from the crash site.
	
	Pg-13
	
				SHERRIFF
			That's a worn-out scenario. If
			a plane crashed nearby, don't you
			think somebody would have heard
			it go down? Tell us the truth,
			guys. What's this really about?
	
				SOLDIER
			I said, STEP ASIDE!
	
	The soldier lifts his rifle. He's about to CLUB the sheriff
	when Chris lunges, grabbing his arm. WHOOMPH! Chris kicks
	the soldier in the balls. The man buckles. Chris bolts.
	
	One of the other commandos FIRES at him, a loud BURST which
	misses Chris but SHATTERS a shop window, setting off wild
	PANIC on the street. Chris ducks into a building...
	
	EXT   RACCOON CITY   BACK STREET   MORNING
	
	...and out a rear door. He runs through a warren of back
	alleyways, arriving at...
	
	...A JEEP SAHARA which is parked behind Jill's apartment
	building. He jumps in without opening the door, jams the key
	into the ignition, and ROARS off.
	
	INT   HUEY   MORNING
	
	Still airborne, in one of the black helicopters that have yet
	to reach the site, WESKER barks orders into a radio.
	
				WESKER
			Charlie, David, Edward, proceed to
			Raccoon City. Assist the e-vack.
			I'm going on target with Alpha Team.
			All forces stand ready to support.
	
	EXT   FARM   MORNING
	
	CHRIS rumbles his jeep onto a picturesque FARM, secluded deep
	in the forest. We don't recognize it immediately. It was
	dark when we last saw the place.
	
	Jumping out, Chris sees three large SHAPES lying in the grass
	of a corral. Rushing over, Chris realizes...
	
	...they're HORSES. One of them is LUCKY, his prize
	stallion... DEAD, in a pool of BLOOD, with its belly torn
	open and a huge chunk out of its neck.
	
				CHRIS
			Aw, no... (Devastated) ...L-Lucky.
	
	
	Pg-14
	
	Chris hears a weak, MOANING SOUND. He turns and sees...
	RAKE, lying near a water pump. Chris rushes to the man's
	side and finds him brutally SLASHED, barely clinging to life.
	
				RAKE
			(Coughing blood) They... they come
			outta the trees, Reddy. Don't... don't
			know what they was. Figure... maybe
			some kinda... wolves, or somethin' ...
	
	Examining the man's wounds, Chris realizes they're fatal.
	
				RAKE
			I... I never seen 'em comin'.
	
				CHRIS
			Don't try to talk, Rake.
	
				RAKE (cont.)
			I... ain't... never left this farm...
			untended... since yer daddy first
			took it over.
	
				CHRIS
			I know. You... kept the place runnin'...
			better than me.
	
				RAKE
			I just...never seen 'em comin', Reddy.
			Never even...had a chance to...turn
			a gun on 'em.
	
	There's a THUNDER in the sky. Chris looks up. Wesker's
	Fleet of black HUEYS appears on the horizon.  They split up,
	Seven banking off toward Raccoon City, the remaining three
	grinding ahead over the forest, slowing down, dropping in
	altitude.
	
				CHRIS
			Where are they going? There's
			nothing in there... except...
	
				RAKE
			Y'oughta... remember it... real good.
			I do.  From... when you was a kid.
	
				CHRIS
			The... the old Arkley place?
	
				RAKE
			I remember them days. I surely do...
			Remember them... them old days.
	
	Chris looks back down at the old man, who is drifting,
	starting to lose it.
	
	Pg-15
	
				CHRIS (cont.)
			I'm not gonna bullshit you, Rake.
			You're...in a bad time. If there's
			any way to save you, I'll find it,
			I swear. You just... hang in there,
			old guy. I'll be right back.
	
	Chris jumps to his feet and runs into...
	
	INT   FARMHOUSE   MORNING
	
	...the great-room of the FARMHOUSE. Rustic. Cozy. CHRIS
	snatches up a telephone. There's no dial-tone. The line
	is dead. Chris rushes to a gun cabinet and pulls out an old
	WINCHESTER rifle. He scoops ammo from a drawer into a
	shoulder bag and runs back outside...
	
	EXT   FARM   MORNING
	
	...where his eyes catch MOVEMENT in the corral. LUCKY,
	entrails spilling, is trying to stand.
	
				CHRIS
			Oh, God, Rake. Oh, Jesus, the poor thing's still alive.
	
	Chris shoulders his ammo bag, reaches inside, and quickly
	reloads the Winchester. Stepping forward, he aims carefully.
	
				CHRIS (cont.)
			Sorry, old hoss.
	
	
	BLAM!  A clean shot to the horse's brain drops the animal.
	
	It takes Chris a long moment to recover... then, he looks into
	the trees. The helicopters are no longer in sight, but their
	THUNDER remains.  They haven't landed yet.
	
	Chris turns and rushes back to Rake's side, only to find...
	...he has died. Chris' jaws tighten, but he has no time
	to mourn. He closes Rake's eyes. Digs through the grass.
	Pulls up a handful of dirt. Stuffs it into the old man's
	hand, and closes his stiffening fingers over it.
	
				CHRIS (cont.)
			The earth keeps us.
	
	Conquering his emotions, Chris runs to his jeep and jumps in.
	He shifts into four-wheel-drive and, ignoring the road, heads
	straight over the field for the trees.
	
	As the jeep disappears, THE CAMERA CRANES DOWN, ZOOMING
	IN ON...
	
	Pg-16
	
	...one of the farm dogs. The SPANIEL. Not the entire
	animal, but one of its three SEPARATE PARTS... it's front
	end... CRUSHED head, BLOODY neck, and a single BROKEN paw...
	
	...which is trying to CRAWL.
	
	Fifty yards away, RAKE'S HAND relaxes. The earth spills out
	through his fingers as the dead man's eyes... POP OPEN.
	
	EXT   ARKLEY FOREST   MORNING
	
	THE FIRST OF THE BLACK HUEYS drops, hazardously, into a
	small clearing with barely enough space. Unable to land
	on the scrub-brush, it hovers ten feet off the ground. Its
	rotors CLIP TREE LEAVES as WESKER, BARRY, and TWO OTHER
	S.T.A.R.S. COMMANDOS jump out, heavily armed. The chopper
	lifts off, placed by HUEY NUMBER TWO.
	
	NOT FAR AWAY, CHRIS navigates through undergrowth until he
	can see THE HELICOPTERS through the trees. The THUNDER from
	their rotors masks the grinding of Chris' jeep. He pulls
	within a hundred yards and, leaving his vehicle in the bush,
	moves closer, cautiously, on foot.
	
	THE THIRD HUEY air-drops TWO MEN and TWO WOMEN in S.T.A.R.S.
	uniforms. There are TWELVE COMMANDOS in all... ALPHA TEAM.
	Wesker looks up at the Huey's PILOT, using his radio to speak
	to the man.
	
				WESKER
			You'll have to rotate or you'll run
			out of fuel, but I want one chopper
			to remain in the air at all times.
			We might need help in a hurry.
	
	A "Roger that", squaks back as the Huey banks away.
	
	Barry looks worried. His instincts are asking... "We might
	need... 'help'".  Against what? We only see this in his eyes,
	he says nothing as...
	
	...Wesker leads the team through the woods, unaware of...
	
	...CHRIS, following behind, crouching around trees and
	bushes, not a trained commando, but comfortable with the
	land, a natural warrior using ancestral instincts.
	
	THE CAMERA TRACKS COMBAT BOOTS as they CRUNCH through the
	low-Lying MIST.. .stopping abruptly when they encounter...
	
	...WEAPONS, AMMO BELTS, bits of SHRDDED UNIFORMS... and
	HUMAN BODY PARTS... strewn all through the surrounding brush,
	remnants of what was obviously a feeding-frenzy.
	
	
	Pg-17
	
				VICKERS
			Holy... Goh... gaah...
	
	BRAD VICKERS vomits. Unarmed, he's Alpha Team's computer-
	techie. Not a combat soldier, he's a bit of a coward.
	
	Another non-combatant, REBECCA CHAMBERS, is the team's
	medical officer. She digs an ammonia capsule from her
	pack and holds it under Vickers' nose.
	
	RICHARD AIKEN and KENNETH SULLIVAN are buddies, regular
	G.I. Joes, right out of every war movie. Aiken stares at
	the carnage, calmly chewing a wad of gum.
	
				AIKEN
			You ever eat road-kill, Sullivan?
	
				SULLIVAN
			Aiken... a guy with a brain your
			size would be better off dead.
	
				RODRIGUEZ (o.s.)
			Want me to shoot ya, Aiken?
	
	ROSIE RODRIGUEZ, a tough, body-built babe steps in.
	
				RODRIGUEZ (cont.)
			I'm ready ta shoot somebody.
	
				ALKEN
			I'll pass. Shoot Sullivan.
	
	FOREST SPEYER, a wiry Willem Defoe type, finds a bloody BERET
	and brings it to Wesker.  There's an I.D. tag on the brim...
	
				WESKER
			(Reading the tag) 'Valentine'. (Beat)
			Radio Washington.  Bravo Team found
			on site. No survivors.
	
	In the bushes, Chris overhears, not wanting to believe. He
	sees Wesker angrily pitch Jill's beret into the brush.
	
				WESKER
			We're goin' in.  Watch your backs.
	
	Wesker advances his troops. When the coast is clear, Chris
	rushes in, picks up the beret, and sees the name tag for
	himself. "Valentine ".
	
	After what happened at the farm... now this... feeling sucker-
	punched, defeated, Chris hangs his head.
	
	One of the HUEYS dips in low.
	
	
	Pg-18
	
	Chris looks up. The sight of the war machine lifts him from
	defeat... to rage.  His eyes are soft, for the last time, as
	he tucks Jill's beret into his pack.  When he looks up again,
	those eyes have become newly predatory.  He ducks out of
	sight as the helicopter swings lower.
	
	Downdraft from the rotors makes the bushes rustle, catching
	Chris' attention.  He realizes that... it's not just the wind.
	The shrubs are being disturbed by...
	
	SOMETHING DARK which is moving through them.  It pokes
	its head out.  A WOLF! Rake was right.  Chris readies his
	Winchester as the animal stalks forward.
	
	It's not a wolf. It's A DOG. Mottled, its flesh gray,
	covered with rotting lesions... and it has three bleeding
	BULLET HOLES in its belly, chest, neck.
	
	GROWRRR!  It LEAPS at Chris... who fires... BLAM!
	
	Up ahead, Wesker and his commandos freeze.
	
				WESKER
			Who fired? WHO FIRED?
	
	Before anyone can answer, the team is ATTACKED by MORE DOGS
	which BURST out of the surrounding woods...DOBERMANS and
	SHEPHERDS... but something is seriously wrong with all of
	them. Their EYES are DEAD, their FLESH decaying.
	
	Automatics piss streams of lead. Hot rounds TEAR through the
	animals, many of the slugs accidentally blowing out brains.
	of his bullets hits its target... one of the dogs' heads.
	
	The commandos are backed up against... the IRON GATES we
	saw earlier. The Arkley Mansion stands beyond.
	
				RODRIGUEZ
			Let's get inside.
	
				WESKER (cont.)
			NO! (Shouting) I WANT 'EM ALL
			DEAD! YOU HEAR ME? STAND FAST...
			UNTIL THEY ARE ALL DEAD !
	
	The dogs don't stand a chance. Alpha Team's firepower is
	overwhelming. But there is a human casualty. JOSEPH FROST
	trips and falls. One of the dogs POUNCES on him, chewing
	out his HEART... through his BACK.
	
	Wesker steps in, RIDDLING the dead man, and the dog, with
	forty rounds from his M-16.
	
	Pg-19
	
	In the next instant, ANOTHER DOG LEAPS at Wesker from behind.
	He hears its snarl... too late.  He dives into the grass...
	too late.  The dog is about to land on him when...
	...it's BLASTED out of mid air by... Barry.
	
				BARRY
			Even-Steven, boss.  You saved my
			ass in the desert.  I saved yours I
			in Pennsylvania.
	
	Wesker stand, straightening his ever-present sunglasses.
	
				WESKER
			I don't believe in being... 'Even-
			Steven' with anybody.  A man saves
			my ass...I pay him back.  Before
			this day is over, I'll pay you back,
			Barry.  Just... stick with me, okay?
	
	Wesker checks his equipment belt. Something is missing.
	He looks to where he rolled in the grass. Using a FLASH-
	LIGHT, he finds...
	
	...a small electronic unit the size of a cell-phone. But
	it's not a cell-phone. Whatever it is... Wesker clips it
	onto his belt.
	
	FROM THE BRUSH, Chris sees all this. The guns have gone
	silent. The attack seems to be over. Chris moves stealthily
	to the body of the animal that he shot. It's wearing a
	COLLAR which reads...
	
				  SPIKE #26
	
	Alongside the I.D., there's a corporate-looking logo... the
	symbol of an UMBRELLA.
	
	GRRROWWWLL! ANOTHER DOG is advancing on Chris. He aims
	his Winchester.  CLICK! The magazine is empty.  No time to
	reload.  The dog is on him.  Chris SCRAMBLES away.  The dog
	BOUNDS after him.
	
	Chris drops to the ground.  Did he trip?  No.  He pushes a
	TREE ROOT, which is FALSE.  It swings open and he dives in,
	pulling the root shut over him.
	
	The dog arrives an instant later.  It lets out an angry
	howl... and is BLOWN AWAY... by RODRIGUEZ, who neither saw
	Chris, nor where he went.
	
	The forest goes dead quiet.  Too quiet.  There's not even
	the chirping of morning birds Wesker is SLAPPED startlingly
	on the back... by Barry.
	
	Pg-20
	
				BARRY
			Look here, man.  I'd follow you
			into any kind of enemy fire.  But
			these things ain't firin' at us.
			They want us for breakfast!  When
			are you gonna tell us what the
			hell is goin' on here?
	
				WESKER
			When you need to know.  Just do
			your job, soldier.  That's what
			I'm doin'.  My job.
	
	Wesker pulls a chain from under his shirt. It holds a card,
	the size of a Visa, like the one Jill found in her secret
	envelope, only Wesker's isn't blue, it's green.
	
	Stepping away from Barry, he slide the card through a slot
	in the iron gate-frame.  BUZZZZ.  The GATES SWING OPEN with
	a rusty SQUEAL.
	
	INT   TUNNEL   MORNING
	
	CHRIS crawls through a long, dark shaft with earthen walls,
	a man-made tunnel.
	
	EXT   ARKLEY FOREST   MANSION   MORNING
	
	AT THE MANSION'S FRONT DOOR, a hand-carved monolith of solid
	oak, WESKER finds another hidden SLOT and swipes his card.
	The giant door CREAKS OPEN.
	
	INT   MANSION   CENTRAL HALL   MORNING
	
	INSIDE, the place looks like a HAUNTED HOUSE, a glorious
	ruin, once spectacular, now mysterious and threatening.
	The chandeliers and furniture are covered with sheets that
	ripple on breezes from a thousand faults in the old walls.
	Indistinct NOISES echo within the ceiling, the floor, as
	ALPHA TEAM enters.
	
				AIKEN
			Old. They probably don't have cable.
	
				SULLIVAN
			They probably don't have radio.
	
				RODRIGUEZ
			Who's they? Who's place is this?
	
	WESKER shuts the front door. The BOOMING SOUND makes us
	wonder if we will ever see it opened again.
	
	
	Pg-21
	
				WESKER
			Guy named Arkley.  Bootlegger.  Built
			this old fortress during prohibition.
			He figured nobody'd ever find him out
			here in the back woods.  Nobody did.
			Till he died.  Feds have had it ever
			since.  Place has been here for eighty
			years... derelict... a safe-house.
	
				BARRY
			A safe-house... for who? For what?
	
				WESKER
			There's a... a secret installation.
			Below.  A network of laboratories.
	
				REBECCA
			What kind of... laboratories?
	
				WESKER
			(Shrugging) They didn't issue us
			gas-masks, so I figure... it's okay
			to breathe.
	
				RODRIGUEZ
			Why send in a strike-force?
	
				SULLIVAN
			Yeah. What are we supposed to do?
			Polish the silver?
	
				WESKER (cont.)
			There's a man downstairs. A top-
			priority man.  It's our job to...
			bring him out.  Hopefully, there
			are others alive, as well. We'll
			Rescue them, too... if we can...but
			Dr. John Marcus... he comes out alive
			at any and all cost.
	
	INT   MANSION   CORRIDOR   MORNING
	
	Though it's still morning, the windows are sealed over.  No
	sunshine can enter. From this point on... there will be no
	indication of time... except as shown on clocks.  A sense of
	dread takes hold of us as...
	
	...dark SHADOWS LURCH...FEET SCRAPE sluggishly... not in
	combat boots, but in Nikes, loafers, Dr. Martens... past an
	accordion GATE of corroded bronze.  A motor HUMS.  Behind
	the gate, an old-fashioned service ELEVATOR rises... but stops
	just below floor level. EYES peer out, waiting for the
	shuffling feet to pass.  Then the car rises the rest of
	the way, revealing its occupant...
	
	Pg-22
	
	...JILL VALENTINE! She's alive! She deactivates the
	elevator by pulling her blue ACCESS CARD out of an incon-
	gruously modern receptacle. Checking to be sure that the
	coast is clear, she slides the accordion gate aside and
	steps out into the corridor.
	
	With a ghostly MOAN, something LUNGES at her out of the
	shadows. It's A MAN in a lab coat. His skin is ROTTING,
	his teeth SNAPPING, like the dogs'. He tries to BITE Jill,
	not merely to do injury. He seems HUNGRY!
	
	Jill leaps aside, lifting her pistol and FIRING... once,
	twice, three times. The man is shot in the stomach, heart,
	neck...but he keeps coming! Finally, Jill shoots him in the
	head...and he falls.
	
	Jill quickly reloads, on instinct. But as she does it, she
	stares at the corpse, frowning, weighing life-long belief
	against the hideous facts of the moment.
	
	INT   MANSION   CENTRAL HALL   MORNING
	
	WESKER and his troopers hear the GUNSHOTS. There are THREE
	DOORS nearby. Wesker selects one that seems to lead to the
	source of the gunshots. Using his card, he unlocks it.
	
				WESKER
			Three men stay here. Chambers...
	
				REBECCA
			I'm not a man.
	
				WESKER
			Rodriguez...
	
				RODRIGUEZ
			I'm better than a man.
	
	Wesker grins, but hardly skips a beat.
	
				WESKER
			Alright. you come with us. Aiken,
			Sullivan, stick here with Chambers.
	
	The troop moves out. Aiken and Sullivan remain in the
	central hall with Rebecca.
	
				AIKEN
			Why us?
	
				SULLIVAN
			I dunno why me. You? I guess the
			C.O. figures you're as worthless
			as a dame, Aiken.
	
	Pg-23
	
	Sullivan catches Rebecca's eye.
	
				SULLIVAN (cont.)
			Er... sorry, ma' am. I... I didn't  ...
			I meant Aiken... Not you.
	
				REBECCA
			Relax. I get it.
	
	INT   MANSION LIBRARY   TIMELESS
	
	WESKER leads his TROOP into an enormous, cobwebbed library
	lined with book shelves, but no books. There are doorways
	on all four walls. Wesker pulls out something that looks
	like a Game-Boy. He types on a keypad. A MAP of the mansion
	appears. Wesker scrolls with the arrow-keys. Barry looks
	on very impressed with the high-tech unit.
	
				BARRY
			That thing...tells you where to go?
	
	Wesker doesn't answer. He pockets the "Game Boy".
	
				WESKER
			One man stays here. Ridley. You're
			it. Shoot to kill. Just make sure
			it's not one of us. The rest of you...
			this way.
	
	Wesker, leads his squad through one of the doorways. RIDLEY,
	a young rookie, remains.
	
	INT   UNDERGROUND CAVERN   TIMELESS
	
	CHRIS reaches the end of the earthen tunnel. There are
	signs that children once played here... TOY SOLDIERS.
	GRAFFITI.  Chris finds his nickname... Christopher Reddy...
	etched in hardened mud.  After a moment of reflection,
	he moves on, into...
	
	
	INT   ENTRY CHAMBER   TIMELESS
	
	...a small, sheet-rock chamber.  CHRIS rushes to a DOOR
	that looks like it's been there since the beginning of time.
	As soon as he touches the knob... AN ALARM SOUNDS!
	
	
	INT   MANSION   KITCHEN   TIMELESS
	
	RIDLEY, standing guard, hears THE ALARM. He hears Chris
	JIGGLING the knob. But he sees NO DOOR. The walls around
	him seem to be solid slabs.
	
	
	Pg-24
	
	INT   ENTRY CHAMBER   TIMELESS
	
	CHRIS can't get the doorknob to turn. Behind him, a dusty
	ORIENTAL CARPET BULGES upward. One corner flops aside.
	
	INT   MANSION   KITCHEN   TIMELESS
	
	RIDLEY is spooked by the sound. Frightened, trembling,
	he un-slings his rifle.
	
				RIDLEY
			Who... who's there?
	
	INT   ENTRY CHAMBER   TIMELESS
	
	CHRIS doesn't hear the trooper. Behind him, A Decomposed
	HAND pokes out of a drainage ditch beneath the carpet. It
	gropes. Finds purchase on the floor.
	
	Chris is unaware of the danger. He HURLS himself against
	the door. He can't break through.
	
	The thing that climbs out of the ditch was once a man, once
	a SCIENTIST. It's wearing a lab coat and a pair of thick
	EYEGLASSES. But it's long dead. It's... A ZOMBIE.
	
	As it pulls itself up, its eyeglasses strike the side of the
	ditch. They fall, CLATTERING, the rims scraping the zombie's
	cheek, which peels away like onion skin.
	
	Chris hears the noise. Turns and sees...
	
	...the dead man, reaching out hungrily.  Chris is trapped.
	He aims his Winchester. CLICK! He forgot. It's empty.
	
	The zombie pulls itself fully up onto the floor. Chris digs
	in his shoulder bag. Pulls out a handful of bullets and with
	them, accidentally, Jill's BERET. Rising emotion stops him
	for a moment.
	
	The dead man crawls toward him. Chris might not have time
	to load. As he tries to jam a bullet into his rifle, the
	zombie SWATS at him.  Catches the beret.  Looks at it.
	Sniffs it.  The bullet pops out of Chris' nervous fingers.
	He tries to load another.
	
	INT   MANSION   KITCHEN   TIMELESS
	
	RIDLEY spots A BLUE ACCESS SLOT in the wall. He levels his
	automatic and CHEWS the thing up with a short burst.
	
	A PANEL SWINGS OPEN! CHRIS dives out... with the ZOMBIE
	inches behind him. Ridley FIRES off another BURST OF ROUNDS.
	
	
	Pg-25
	
	Stray bullets PIERCE the zombie's head. It drops back into
	the chamber...with Ridley never knowing why.
	
	Ridley and Chris look at each other, asking rapid-fire
	questions, none of them answered.
	
				RIDLEY
			Who are you?
	
				CHRIS
			Who are YOU? What the hell is 
			S.T.A.R.S.?
	
				RIDLEY
			How'd you get in here?
	
				CHRIS
			Who sealed the door?
	
				RIDLEY
			Who knew there a door?
	
	WHAM! ANOTHER ZOMBIE appears suddenly behind Ridley, BITING
	out the muscle between his shoulder and neck. The trooper
	stands, stunned, for a moment...
	
				RIDLEY
			Who... who... ?
	
	...then he drops..
	
	The zombie, in a uniform, once a security guard, gazes dully
	at Chris.  A wet sound comes from inside its gullet as it
	calmly chews on Ridley's flesh.  Swallowing, it reaches out.
	Chris grabs its arms, FLINGS it into the chamber. Then
	FIRES his Winchester, once, putting a HOLE in the thing's
	head. Chris slams the door.
	
	
	INT   MANSION   DINING ROOM   TIMELESS
	
	In a Hearst-sized dining room with draped furniture, WESKER
	and the OTHER TROOPERS have heard the new gunfire.
	
				SPEYER
			Where'd that come from?
	
				BARRY
			Back...where we just were.
	
				SPEYER
			Shit, man, we're chasin' our tails!
	
	
	
	Pg-26
	
	INT   MANSION   KITCHEN   TIMELESS
	
	CHRIS hears the CLATTERING of the troopers heading his way.
	What he doesn't hear is... a slight CRACKLING... in the walls.
	
	INT   MANSION   CORRIDOR   TIMELESS
	
	WESKER and his TEAM burst into the corridor with the old-
	fashioned ELEVATOR.  FLASHLIGHTS find... the body of the
	ZOMBIE that was shot by Jill, bullet HOLES allover its body.
	
				SPEYER
			Damn. Surnbitch took a lotta lead.
	
				BARRY
			That's not what killed him. Blood's
			still running. Wounds are fresh.
			But look at his skin. This guy's
			been dead for a couple of days.
	
				RODRIGUEZ
			He was dead... before he was shot?
	
	INT   MANSION   KITCHEN   TIMELESS
	
	CHRIS checks Ridley.  No pulse.  His own rustling movements
	prevent him from hearing... that soft CRACKLING SOUND.
	
	The kitchen is lined with fifty-year-old IVY-PATTERNED
	WALLPAPER.  The printed VINES seem to be MOVING!  Chris
	doesn't notice until the vines begin to WIGGLE furiously...
	and RIP THROUGH the paper.  They're REAL.  Sprouts from
	some sort of exotic plant, that have climbed up the walls...
	with INTELLIGENCE!  They seem aware of Chris' presence.
	
				REBECCA (O.S.)
			Ridley?
	
	REBECCA has appeared in an open doorway. Chris looks at her,
	with the tips of the vines beginning to brush his shoulders.
	
				REBECCA (cont.)
			Who... who are...
	
				CHRIS
			I... I'm one of the good guys, okay
			I'm just trying to...
	
				REBECCA
			(Calling) SULLIVAN! AIKEN!
	
				CHRIS
			Shit.
	
	
	Pg-27
	
	Chris, familiar with the room, opens a SMALL DOOR in the
	wall, barely man-sized, and almost invisible because it's
	covered in matching wallpaper. Chris dives in.
	
	AIKEN and SULLIVAN pop up behind Rebecca, having barely
	caught a glimpse of Chris.
	
				AIKEN
			Who was that?
	
				SULLIVAN
			Forget him. What are they?
	
	Sullivan points at the vines... which are swirling, groping,
	as if alive, making their way toward Ridley's body.
	
	INT  MANSION   CHUTE   TIMELESS
	
	In a LAUNDRY CHUTE, propping himself against the sides,
	CHRIS descends...down...down... as he did as a child...
	and comes out onto...
	
	INT   CRAWL SPACE   TIMELESS
	
	...a DROP-CEILING, newly installed. Iron frames support
	AIR-FILTRATION SYSTEMS and other heavy MACHINERY. Sheet-
	metal walls have replaced the old soffit and fascia. LIGHT,
	from somewhere below, knifes through gridded iron vents.
	
				CHRIS
			Somebody did some major remodeling.
	
	INT   MANSION   KITCHEN   TIMELESS
	
	The VINES continue to advance.
	
				REBECCA
			We gotta get him out!
	
	THE TROOPERS rush to retrieve RIDLEY'S BODY. The VINES hover
	around them, occasionally DARTING, then pulling back, as if
	they were timid animals, hungry, but afraid of anew food-
	dish. When AIKEN brandishing his M-16, the VINES RECOIL and
	RETRACT fully... THWIP THWIP THWIP... behind the wallpaper and
	down... somewhere into the bowels of the house.

			What? Smart fuckin' plants?
	
				SULLIVAN
			No big deal. Most-plants are
			smarter than you, Aiken.

	INT   MANSION   CORRIDOR   TIMELESS
	
	THE OTHERS are still puzzling over the DOWNED ZOMBIE.
	
				SPEYER
			Why would anyone shoot a dead man?
	
				RODRIGUEZ
			Lemme guess. Maybe 'cause he was...
			walkin' around?
	
	Barry steps closer to the corpse, notes its collapsed skull.
	
				BARRY
			Head-shot. We were sprayin' those
			dogs outside... but think about it.
			Were any of 'em brought down without
			a head-shot.
	
	Wesker has been exploring the corridor. Stopping in front
	of the elevator, he shines his light into the car. We expect
	someone... or some-thing... to be lurking inside.
	
	An attack comes from the opposite direction. A FIGURE BURSTS-
	out of the shadows behind Weasker. Another Zombie?  No.  It's
	JILL! In a rage, she holds her pistol to Wesker's head.
	
				JILL
			I lost three me.  You killed them,
			Wesker. You did... and I did. Because
			I didn't know what to expect... because
			you... didn't tell me!
	
				WESKER
			(Calmly) Tell you what?
	
				JILL
			Anything! I wasn't told anything!
	
				WESKER
			Put down the gun.
	
	Instead, Jill CLICKS the hammer back.
	
				WESKER (cont.)
			Put down the gun.
	
				JILL
			Not until...
	
				WESKER
			RELEASE! THAT'S AN ORDER, SOLDIER!
	
	Jill blinks. Slowly, reluctantly, she lowers her gun.
	
	Pg-29
	
	Wesker turns... and recognizes her.
	
				WESKER (cont.)
			How... did you get in here?
	
				JILL
			(Sarcastic) How ya doin' , Valentine?
			Good to see ya. Glad you're still
			alive. Same here, colonel, I'm...
	
				WESKER
			How did you get in here?
	
				JILL
			(Exploding) The same way those fuckin'
			dogs got out! Through their pens!
			(Relaxing some) I... locked them off.
	
				WESKER
			Good thinking.
	
	A VOICE interrupts, from the end of the corridor.
	
				VOICE (o.s.)
			MAN DOWN!
	
	The voice is SULLIVAN'S. The troopers run to join him.
	Last to leave the corridor are Wesker and Jill. Wesker
	gestures gallantly.
	
				WESKER
			Ladies first.
	
				JILL
			Fuck you.
	
	INT   MANSION   KITCHEN   TIMELESS
	
	The TROOPERS trickle into the kitchen to find... REBECCA,
	kneeling over RIDLEY'S CORPSE, examining the ragged bite
	on its neck.
	
				RODRIGUEZ
			Maybe... they're in the house.
			More of them dogs.
	
				REBECCA
			Diameter's too small. It... almost
			looks as if... it was done by a...
	
				JILL
			(Arriving) A human?
	
	Rebecca looks up. The two women make sisterly eye-contact.
	
	
	Pg-30
				REBECCA
			Yes, but... what kind of... human...
			would do something like this?
	
				AIKEN
			Not a vegetarian, that's for sure.
	
				SULLIVAN
			Aiken, you'd be better off...
	
				REBECCA
			There was a guy. Not part of the
			team. And there was... some kind
			of... plant... that seemed... alive.
	
				RODRIGUEZ
			Gimme a fuckin' break.
	
				AIKEN
			No shit. It disappeared... right
			into the wall.
	
	Rodriguez cringes when she finds a ragged hole in the wall-
	paper near where she's standing.
	
				WESKER
			I guess it's... time to spill it.
	
	WESKER pulls off his dark glasses for the first time.
	
				WESKER (cont.)
			I don't know... much more than I
			already told you.  I'll tell you
			the rest now.  The labs hare are...
			were...working on special apps for
			bio-eng1neered materials.
	
				RODRIGUEZ
			Speak English, hombre.
	
				WESKER
			Marcus has been experimenting with
			an artificial... man-made... virus.
			Coded...the 'T'-virus.  Financing
			came from a private corporation, you
			may have heard the name... Umbrella.
	
				JILL
			They're... multi-national. Huge.
	
				WESKER
			So huge that they have... connections...
			in high places.  That's why we're here.
	
	
	Pg-31
	
				BARRY
			This virus... it jumped, right?
	
				SPEYER
			Shit! We're all dead! We got the
			bug, and we're all dead!
	
				WESKER
			It's not airborne. It was spread...
			in the water supply. Lab animals
			and... the researchers themselves...
			passed it on... by...
	
				JILL
			By... biting.
	
	Wesker hangs his head. It's an affirmation.
	
				BARRY
			You catch this virus and... what?
	
				WESKER
			You die. But... not for long. The
			chemical...revives the brain, and...
	
				RODRIGUEZ
			You stand back up... and chew on
			the first guy you see.
	
				SPEYER
			Christ, this is like... Night of the
			Living Dead!
	
				BARRY
			Why, in the name of Jesus, would
			anybody wanna mess with shit...
			that does that shit?
	
				WESKER
			Victory, friend. Civilization has
			come a long way, but we still have...
			war.  Imagine... a soldier who can't
			die.  That... was the concept.
	
				JILL
			But the virus... jumped.
	
				WESKER
			Hopefully... if we got all the dogs...
			we've contained it.
	
				JILL
			Hopefully?  Jesus... why didn't you
			tell us?
	
	
	Pg-32
	
				WESKER
			By telling you NOW, I've put your
			lives in jeopardy. Nobody has this
			information. Except a few high-and-
			mightys. Me. And now, you.
	
	The troopers fall silent as all this sinks in.
	
				WESKER (cont.)
			We have to get Marcus out of here.
			He developed this thing. He's the
			only one who... understands it.
	
				REBECCA
			I don't know, this all sounds pretty
			shaky to me...
	
	With a lightning move, Wesker draws his pistol and...BLAM!
	FIRES... at Rebecca. She flinches. The bullet flies past
	her and SHATTERS the skull of RIDLEY, the dead trooper who,
	having stood up, was about to attack Rebecca from behind.
	Ridley drops... dead again.
	
				RODRIGUEZ
			Guess that proves it. A head-shot
			knocks 'em down.
	
	Rebecca turns and looks at the blood-splattered body.
	
				REBECCA
			Th-that man.. .was dead. (Freaking)
			I... I'm a doctor! I should know!
			That man was dead!
	
	Vickers reaches in Rebecca's bag, pulls out an ammonia
	capsule, cracks it, and holds it under her nose.
	
				VICKERS
			I hope you have a lot of these.
	
	
	INT   CRAWL-SPACE   TIMELESS
	
	CHRIS crawls across the drop-ceiling, into the up-rising
	light from one of the vents. He looks down through the
	grid work and sees...
	
	...the same LABORATORY that was behind Marcus in the opening
	video. No longer pristine, it's wrecked, torn apart. Files
	are scattered everywhere along with smashed fragments of
	furniture and computer hardware.
	
	CAGES that line the walls are filled with LAB ANIMALS making
	NERVOUS CHATTER. Chris watches a MONKEY sip water from a
	dish. Like the other animals, its skin is rotting.
	
	
	Pg-33
	
	Chris is about to move on, when his eye catches...
	
	...MOVEMENT... outside the cages.  There's A MAN, in a
	lab coat, sitting at a desk, writing on a note pad.
	
				CHRIS
			(Calling) Hey.
	
	CLOSE ON: the man's HAND... flaking, decomposing.  The pen
	it holds is making only random, erratic marks.
	
				CHRIS (cont.)
			HEY!
	
	The man turns his head, slowly, to look up toward the voice.
	There's NOTHING left of his FACE. RAW TISSUE seeps odd-
	colored fluids. A single eyeball is nested tenuously in
	the ooze. Something like a mouth, recognizable only because
	of its position, opens... and GROANS.
	
	Chris, pumping his Winchester, hears... KRANG! A NOISE from
	below. He looks down again, just as...
	
	...the lab door BURSTS open. WESKER and ALPHA TEAM stream
	into the lab. The thing with. the destroyed face turns toward
	the invaders, stands, and shuffles toward them.
	
	Without hesitation, Wesker, on point, FIRES a quick burst
	into the thing's brain. It drops like a sack. The lab
	animals SHRIEK.
	
	The team files in, not noticing... ANOTHER ZOMBIE... crawling
	across the floor...heading directly for SPEYER. Chris shouts
	
				CHRIS (cont. )
			HEADS UP!
	
	He punches out the grate with the barrels of his rifle
	and... BLAM!...punches a sure-fire HOLE in the zombie's head.
	
	BRAD VICKERS, his nerves badly frayed, thinks the team is
	being attacked. He SPRAYS the ceiling with his automatic.
	
	Chris ducks and rolls, narrowly escaping the initial barrage,
	but bullets keep coming, punching a dotted line up through
	the ceiling panels.
	
	Chris scrambles, as fast as he can, his feet barely escaping
	the punch holes.
	
	He finds himself on top of an enormous checkerboard of vents
	and Plexiglas panels. Bullets weaken the framework. It
	sags... then CRACKS, dropping away. Chris is plunged into...
	
	
	
	Pg-34
	
	INT   LAB   LEVEL "A" TIMELESS
	
	...WATER! CHRIS kicks, paddles with his rifle, righting
	himself, getting his bearings. He's in a huge AQUARIUM
	that's built into one of the laboratory's walls... and he's
	not alone. There are SIX SHARKS in the tank. ZOMBIE SHARKS,
	their flesh rotting, leaking pus.
	
	The largest of them SNAPS at Chris, but its jaws catch only
	a clump of his swirling hair. Chris kicks with his feet,
	remaining upright, and FIRES his wet Winchester.
	
	The bullet wimps-out, restrained by the water. It penetrates
	the shark, but barely. We can see the casing lodged in the
	animal's flesh.
	
	Chris gets an idea. He kicks forward. Plants the barrel
	of his Winchester directly against the aquarium glass...
	only to find himself aiming directly at...
	
	...JILL, who is aiming back at him with her M-16. They're
	both stunned. They stare at each other for a moment, like
	gunfighters, until...
	
	...another shark circles in for an attack. Chris swings the
	Winchester away from Jill and FIRES underwater. The aquarium
	glass CRACKS... but holds.
	
				JILL (cont.)
			Hang on! We're gonna get wet!
	
	Jill FIRES. More CRACKS, but the glass is resistant.
	Chris out. Water SURGES into the lab, knocking Wesker and
	some of his squad down.
	
	They stand up again, only to find themselves knee-high in a
	dark pool...with SHARK FINS slicing the surface. Everybody
	opens fire. The dead fish keep coming.
	
				AIKEN
			Where the fuck is a shark's brain?
	
				SULLIVAN
			In it's head! I swear, Aiken, you
			would be better off dead.
	
	In a bizarre frenzy, the sharks KICK their tails, making
	startlingly quick turns, darting every which way, SNAPPING
	at the scent of warm flesh. The troopers, hampered by the
	water, SPLASH around wildly, many of them nearly getting
	bitten. The air above thickens with a fog of graphite from
	ten spitting automatics.
	
	
	Pg-35
	
	The water gets darker as it becomes clouded with BLOOD. But
	thankfully, the level is dropping. The water is seeping out
	through GRATES in the floor. The sharks become more visible,
	moving slower as their bellies scrape the floor.
	
	The troopers pick them off, one by one. The immediate threat
	passes...but as the water drains away, the troopers become
	aware of... a KLAXON-LIKE SOUND. ANOTHER ALARM. The entry
	door glides shut with a BOOOMMM!
	
				WESKER
			Nice. Very NICE, Valentine! You
			set off a containment breach!
	
				JILL
			It must have been the water. God,
			the water! (She turns to Chris}
			Did you swallow any?
	
				SPEYER
			I did.
	
				SULLIVAN
			A bunch of us did, man.
	
				WESKER
			Separate systems. Salt water.
			No germs. But.. .it breached!
	
	Wesker, looking crazed, his sunglasses gone, is typing on
	his "Game-Boy"... getting no response.
	
				WESKER (cont.)
			We can go in deeper.  But we can't
			get out.  Not with my card-key.
	
				RODRIGUEZ
			So...we live here now.
	
	Rosie finds Sullivan looking at her curiously.
	
				RODRIGUEZ (cont.}
			Landlords. Shit hills. Kicked my
			family out of six apartments. I
			got use to sayin'...'So...we live
			here now'.
	
				WESKER
			There are override exits... but I
			can't find them without THIS!
	
	Wesker FLINGS his "Game-Boy" angrily against a wall. It
	shatters into bits.
	
	
	Pg-36
	
				CHRIS
			That was a smart move.
	
	Wesker bristles. He's about to confront Chris, but he spots
	his sunglasses where they were deposited on a floor grate by
	the water. He walks over and picks them up, wiping the
	lenses on his shirt. Without looking at Chris, he asks...
	
				WESKER
			And... you are?
	
				CHRIS
			Nobody.  Just a...a local guy...
	
	Chris spots a dry lab-coat hanging on a wall hook. He takes
	it down and uses it to dry his rifle.
	
				CHRIS (cont.)
			...who gets pissed-off when he finds...
			his farm animals... and his father's
			oldest friend... dead. And the only
			woman he ever cared about turns out
			to be a goddam METAL HEAD!
	
	Wesker, while seeming to understand, still doesn't look up.
	
				WESKER
			Valentine...who is this asshole?
	
				JILL
			His name is Chris Redfield. He was...
			part of my cover, sir.
	
				CHRIS
			Cover?
	
	A snappy argument develops, a lover's quarrel, with higher-
	than-normal stakes.
	
				JILL
			This is not the time to mouth off,
			Chris! You're in deep shit here!
	
				CHRIS
			Why didn't you let me in on this?
	
				JILL
			Why did you have to come after me?
			How did you get in here, anyway?
	
				CHRIS
			I used to play here, when this was
			a fucking laundry room!  And what
			makes you think I came after YOU?
	
	
	Pg-37
	
				BARRY
			(Interrupting) Whoa! Look here.
	
	Barry is stooped over the faceless zombie that Wesker shot.
	He rips an I.D. badge from the corpse's coat.  He tosses it
	to Wesker, who reads the I.D... "DR. J. MARCUS"
	
				BARRY (cont.)
			Is this the pile of shit we're
			supposed to bring out of here?
	
				WESKER
			It...it once was.
	
				VICKERS (o.s.)
			I got something here.
	
	BRAD has been quietly working at one of the lab's computers.
	Barry rushes over and looks at the monitor screen.
	
				BARRY
			A map. Same as on your gizmo. Exits
			marked...blue and green.
	
	Wesker steps in for a look.
	
				WESKER
			The greens are the overrides. (To
			Brad) Can you print this out?
	
				VICKERS
			I can try.
	
	Chris calmly retrieves his wet shoulder bag from the floor.
	He wrings out the cloth and, using the lab coat, wipes the
	bullets dry.
	
				VICKERS (cont.)
			(Off the screen) We're on level 'A'.
	
				WESKER
			We have to get down to level 'D'.
	
				BARRY
			Hold on. Marcus is dead. If this
			mission was about bringin' him out,
			we're outta here, right?
	
				WESKER
			I wish we were, but no. We have
			a potential outbreak here. We might
			be the only ones who can stop it.
	
	Pg-38
	
				SPEYER
			Stop it? How?
	
				WESKER
			There's... an antidote.
	
	Everyone's ears perk.
	
				WESKER (cont.)
			We can't bring Marcus out, but we
			can bring out the serum. Maybe
			somebody...can analyze it... and
			figure how to beat the virus.
	
	Jill looks at Chris. Catches him weighing options.
	
				JILL
			(Privately) Not simple.
	
				CHRIS
			(Privately) Not complicated, either.
			We only have to decide... what's right...
			and what's wrong.
	
				JILL
			(Privately) I forgot. You're never
			confused. So...what's right, Mohawk?
			And what's wrong?
	
				VICKERS
			Shit. (At the computer) There are
			no green exits on this level. Why...
			why would that be?
	
				CHRIS
			They don't want anybody up here
			to go snoopin' ...upstairs or down.
	
	Wesker looks at Chris with that odd, confident smile.
	
				WESKER
			Pretty good guess. You must have
			been in the military, son.
	
				CHRIS
			Native American. Exempted.
	
				VICKERS
			(Typing, starting to panic) Fuck!
			There... there's no way out!
	
				CHRIS
			Yes there is.
	
	Chris points at the broken grid above the shattered aquarium.
	
	
	Pg-39
	
	Wesker looks up. Then looks back at Chris.
	
				WESKER
			Not a bad idea. (Turning to
			Vickers) See if you can call
			up... service charts, schematics.
	
	Brad's fingers fly. He scrolls through menus.
	
				VICKERS
			Got it. Ceiling grids, ladders.
			The whole infrastructure.
	
				WESKER
			Print it. Print all of it.
	
	The young man types a command. Wesker rushes over to the
	H. P. and grabs the first chart that rolls out.
	
	Rebecca steps over to Brad. She points at his leg.  Seated
	at the computer, his trousers hiked, BLOOD can be seen on his
	sock, just above his boot.
	
				REBECCA
			What's that from?
	
				VICKERS
			(Nervous) I...snagged it. On the
			desk. When we were scrambling.
	
				REBECCA
			Lemme look at it.
				VICKERS
			(Adamant) No. It's just a scratch!
	
	Chris watches Wesker as he studies the printed charts.
	
				CHRIS
			There's a... part of an old laundry
			chute. It might not show on there.
			It runs up to the kitchen.
	
				WESKER
			I'm not going up. I'm going down.
	
	Wesker, grim-faced, looks at his team.
	
				WESKER (cont.)
			I'd like to let you guys off the
			hook. But I can't. I need back
			up. You're comin' with me. Any
			objections?
	
	The troopers exchange glances. Jill is first to speak.
	
	Pg-40
	
				JILL
			No objections. We'll back you up.
	
				CHRIS
			(Disappointed) You said... people
			wind you up and you do whatever
			they want you to do.
	
				WESKER
			Stay out of this, son. You're the
			only one who doesn't have a choice
			in this. There's no place to lock
			you up. I can't let you go, you're
			a security risk. I could shoot you.
			Legally. But your lady-friend would
			probably get all over my ass. So...
			I'm afraid you're comin' with us...
			whether you like it or not. (To Jill,
			pointedly) He's your responsibility,
			Valentine. See that he doesn't make
			trouble.
	
	Jill looks at Chris.

			You up to the challenge?
	
				JILL
			Try me.
	
				CHRIS
			(Snappy) I already have.

	One by one, the members of ALPHA TEAM wiggle up into the
	crawl space above the ceiling. CHRIS climbs up behind JILL.
	OTHER TROOPERS are already away, following WESKER, who guides
	them with the help of his chart. Jill starts after them.
	Chris grabs her arm.

			Jill, I... I'm sorry. I'm just...

			Stop. Stop!
	
	He pulls her into an embrace. She goes willingly.

				CHRIS (cont.)
			Come with me. We can get out of here.
	
				JILL
			(Tempted) I...I want to. I want...

			There's no "I" in DEAD, either.
	
	Chris pulls away from the embrace and looks at her.

			I should order you to come with me.
			You'd never refuse an order.

			For me, too, brother.
	
				BARRY
			I mean this... (indicating the
			iron that's pressing his belly.)
			It's very uncomfortable.

			Since before that.  We were... kids

	troop on. They start to climb down.

			Who knows what we'll find down there?

	The lead TROOPERS reach another section of the ceiling.
	Clustering around a vent, they look down into...

			The man has balls, I'll say that.
	
	Wesker grabs a desk and pushes it under the vent.  MARINI

	Brad types rapidly, nervously. Flubs. Types again.
	
	
	Pg-44
	
				VICKERS
			Nothing. Wait. I'm into... No.
			No data. Just some kind of video
			feed. Time-coded. Yesterday.
			It's a play-back. (Watching the
			screen) Holy shit!
	
	We HEAR it before we see it. The sound of absolute PANIC.
	People SHOUTING! SCREAMING! THUDS and CRASHES! GLASS
	BREAKING! Then A WOMAN'S VOICE .
	
				WOMAN'S VOICE (o.s.)
			Please...please.. .if anyone is
			receiving this...
	
	Brad limps around the desk and spins the monitor for the
	others to see. The WOMAN is an ORIENTAL. She's standing
	in the foreground, as Marcus was in the opening video.
	Behind her is a lab we haven't seen yet... with white-
	coated FIGURES... RUNNING... FIRING GUNS.
	
				WOMAN (cont.)
			the situation is completely.
			out of control. We...
	W
	HAM ! The woman is pushed out of the way by A MAN who is
	trying to protect her from...
	
	...SOMETHING that BLURS past the lens, like a pendulum,
	from ABOVE.
	
	In the next instant... SPLAT... the lens is COATED WITH BLOOD!
	As it oozes down, we see a partial image of the same MAN.
	His HEAD is OUT OF FRAME at the top of the screen.
	
	The thing above must have a hold on it... because the man is
	DANGLING, his arms witching. His back has three GOUGES in
	it, long and so deep that they might have been made by
	piece of heavy machinery. We only see this for an instant...
	before the man is LIFTED, straight UP, with amazing SPEED.
	
	Wesker clicks off the monitor. The other men instinctively
	look up above their heads.
	
				FOX
			Maybe the ceiling's not such a
			safe place, after all.
	
	CRASH! The door behind Fox BURSTS open. Before he has
	time to react A ZOMBIE is on him, BITING his cheek, neck,
	shoulder. The two figures fall to the floor, grappling.
	Wesker can't get a clean shot.
	
				WESKER
			Scram! SCRAM!
	
	
	Pg-45
	
	Marini is first to reach the desk, but he helps the limping
	Brad up ahead of him. TWO MORE ZOMBIES lurch in through the
	open doorway. Wesker shoots them, but he sees MORE... can't
	tell how many...shambling toward the open doorway from the
	darkness beyond.
	
	Wesker focuses on Fox, who is still being MAULED, BITTEN.
	Fox SCREAMS. Wesker still has no safe shot.
	
	Brad is YANKED up into ceiling by SULLIVAN and AIKEN. CHRIS
	leans out of the opening, reaching for Marini.
	
	Wesker KICKS the mauling zombie in the head. It takes three
	hard BOOTS to attract the thing's attention. When it finally
	looks up at him, Wesker BLOWS out its skull.
	
	Fox is lying on his stomach, writhing, BLEEDING profusely
	from a half-dozen bites. Wesker stoops down, trying to roll
	him over, lift him up. Fox resists. He's gone insane.
	
	Chris pulls Marini up to safety. BARRY leans down through
	the opening.
	
				BARRY
			Haul ass, boss!
	
	The zombies are heading for Wesker. There are three of them.
	Barry shoots at the one in front. Misses. His second shot
	hits the thing's brain.
	
	Wesker again tries to hoist Fox who, this time rolls over on
	his own. He has drawn his pistol. Before Wesker can stop
	him, he eats the barrel and BLOWS out the back of his head.
	
	One zombie is dangerously close. Barry fires two more
	rounds. No head shot, but the zombie staggers and, though
	not dead, FALLS...directly toward Wesker. The colonel rolls
	on his back, kicking himself away, managing to get clear.
	He uses his own pistol to BLAST the zombie.
	
	He scrambles to his feet, darts toward the desk, and jumps
	up. The third zombie grabs his legs. From above, Barry
	risks a dangerous shot. BLAM! Wesker hears the bullet
	WHIZZZ past his head like a mosquito.
	
	The zombie is hit in the skull. It drops. There are MORE
	of them coming out of the darkness. Barry takes hold of
	Wesker and, with a single strong arm, pulls him up into...
	
	INT   CRAWL SPACE   LAB   LEVEL "B"   TIMELESS
	
	...the crawl space, where WESKER breathes heavily for a
	moment... then looks up at his old friend.
	
	
	
	
	Pg-46
	
				WESKER
			That's...two I owe ya.
	
				BARRY
			One. We were all... 'Even-Steven' .
	
				WESKER
			Two. Remember? 'Even-Steven' ...
			is not in my vocabulary.
	
	A horrible MOANING SOUND comes from below, in the lab.
	THREE MORE ZOMBIES can be seen clustering around the desk,
	dumbly trying to climb up, sensing the "food" above.
	
				WESKER (cont.)
			Let's move.
	
	Wesker takes off. SPEYER, RODRIGUEZ, AIKEN and SULLIVAN are
	quick to follow. The others lag behind when CHRIS says...
	
				CHRIS
			Those things could get up here.
			We can't let that happen. This
			is our way out...
	
	Chris swings his legs through the grate and JUMPS down...
	
	INT   LAB   LEVEL "B"   TIMELESS
	
	...ONTO THE DESK. He BOOTS one of the ZOMBIES away and
	tries to LEAP over the others. One of them catches his foot
	in mid air. CHRIS isn't hurt, but he TOPPLES to the floor,
	sprawling, losing his Winchester.
	
	The zombies have him cornered. He crawls toward his rifle.
	Reaches it. Pumps a shell into the firing chamber. Aims
	at the closest of the walking dead...
	
	...which was once a young man, a simple laborer, wearing
	overalls, with a name tag...
	
				CHRIS
			(Reading) Caruso.
	
	Chris looks empathetically into the thing's dead eyes.
	
				CHRIS (cont.)
			Can you hear me?
	
	The zombie lumbers forward hungrily.
	
				CHRIS (cont.)
			Caruso! Can you hear me?
	
	Pg-47
	
	Chris has come late to the realization that these things
	were once human. Now he comes late to the realization...
	that they are human no longer.
	
	The zombie grabs the barrel of the Winchester, pushing it
	aside. Chris can't bring it back to bear on the monster's
	head. He BLASTS a round through the thing's belly. It has
	no effect. The zombie reaches for Chris' throat. Starts to
	lean in to bite him.
	
	BLAM! The thing's skull explodes. JILL has jumped down
	onto the desk. She FIRES another accurate pistol round.
	The SECOND ZOMBIE falls.
	
	Jill leaps to the floor and starts to push the desk. Chris
	gets to his feet, rushing in to help her. Together, they
	shove the desk out from under the open ceiling grate.
	
				CHRIS
			Thank you.
	
				JILL
			Any time. How do we get back UP?
	
				CHRIS
			Shit, if you didn't have a plan, you
			shouldn't have jumped down here.
	
				JILL
			We have a real problem here, Chris.
	
	Jill nods toward the open doorway. There are more stuttering
	FIGURES approaching out of the dark.
	
				CHRIS
			How big is this place? How many
			people were down here? How...
	
				JILL
			HOW DO WE GET UP?
	
	With a startling SOUND, A DARK SHAPE swing down from above
	and GRABS Jill! Is it the thing we saw on the video?
	
	No. It's BARRY! His mighty arms lift Jill. She's caught
	by Aiken and Sullivan and pulled up to safety. Barry grabs
	Chris and lifts him as well.
	
	
	INT   CRAWL SPACE   LAB   LEVEL "B"   TIMELESS
	
	CHRIS grabs the edge of the grate and pulls himself up.
	He reaches back down through the opening. Below, BARRY
	squats... and makes a mighty leap-with his muscular legs.
	Chris grabs his arms... and is nearly pulled back down.
	
	
	
	Pg-48
	
				CHRIS
			(Straining) Big. Heavy.
	
	Jill grabs on, then Sullivan. But one of the ZOMBIES has
	reached Barry. It GRABS his kicking legs. It's TEETH SNAP!
	And CATCH! The commandos lift Barry clear, but the zombie
	ends up with a CHUNK of something in its mouth.
	
				JILL
			It got you!
	
	Barry checks his leg. His trousers are torn, but...
	
				BARRY
			No skin broken. I'm alright.
	
				CHRIS
			We owe you a pair of pants.
	
	They crawl away. The zombies below reach up, their fingers
	clutching, at the ceiling, but with the desk gone, there's
	no way they can get up.
	
	DISSOLVE TO:
	
	INT   STORAGE AREA   TIMELESS
	
	THE COMMANDOS climb down a steel access ladder into a storage
	room stacked with CRATES and CARTONS. There's only one door.
	The place seems secure.
	
	
				WESKER
			Stand down. Five minutes.
	
	WESKER sits on a crate and pulls out his printed charts.
	Gradually the whole troop makes it down into the room.
	They relax. A few light cigarettes. But not SPEYER.
	
				SPEYER
			I'm through, Wesker.
	
				MARINI
			Me too, man. This ain't nothin'
			I signed on for.
	
				WESKER
			(Calm) You want to wait here, fine.
	
				MARINI
			Wait here? No. We're gettin' out!
				
				WESKER
			You can't. (He flashes his access
			card.) Not without this.
	
	
	Pg-49
	
				SPEYER
			Fuck you! And your fancy doors and
			your green key! The choppers have
			rockets. They can blow out a wall
			if they have to. I'm callin' 'em in.
	
	Speyer pulls out his radio and starts to punch a code.
	
				WESKER
			You wanna see a wall blow, I'll
			blow all of 'em for ya.
	
	Wesker reaches down to the electronic unit that he lost and
	retrieved in the woods. He pulls a long wire out of it, with
	a small sensor on the end.
	
				WESKER (cont.)
			I'll put a crater in this forest that
			takes out Racoon City and everything
			else for twenty miles... with this.
	
	He jams the little sensor into his ear and pushes a button
	on the belt unit. Small red LIGHTS blink.
	
				WESKER (cont.)
			It's a radio detonator...to set off
			explosives that are...buried under
			neath us somewhere. The ultimate
			containment measure. Incinerate the
			place. (Smiling again) It has a...

			ear-piece) ...that reads my pulse.
			My heart stops, and... boom.

			You...lunatic! That damn thing can
			slip out of your ear by accident!
	
				WESKER
			That's right. It's your job...all
			of your jobs...to see that it doesn't.
			And to see that my heart... doesn't
			skip any beats.
	
	Wesker looks over the tops of his sunglasses... at Speyer
	
				WESKER (cont.)
			Give me the radio, soldier.
	
	Speyer hesitates. Wesker explodes, for the first time.
	
				WESKER (cont.)
			GIMME THE FUCKIN' RADIO, OR WE
			ALL GO UP!

	The radio man presses his headset to his ear. LaGuardia
	looks on apprehensively.
	
				RADIO MAN (cont.)
			It's Wesker. (Into mike) Yes, sir.
			We got the signal sir. (He clicks
			off) He says it was... a mistake.

	He listens. Once again, we don't see his face. Just his
	free hand, with another Monte Cristo burning.

			Denied. This is Wesker's show.
			If he was in real trouble, we'd

	WESKER has come down off his rampage. He looks exhausted.
	He also looks staunchly heroic as he speaks to his TROOP.
	
				WESKER
			You guys were hand-picked. A Special
			Unit. Most of you have been sitting
			on your asses, drawing pay checks for
			more than two years. Well... it's time
			to repay those... Government loans.
	
				SPEYER
			Bull shit. I'm not...
	
	Wesker lifts his automatic. Speyer flinches. The action
	wasn't meant as a threat. Wesker is just checking his ammo.
	
	
	
	Pg-52
	
				WESKER
			Pitch your empties. Put all your
			loaded clips on that crate there.
			I want a count. Then I want the
			rounds divvied up... evenly.
	
	The troopers deposit their loaded clips, reloading the ones
	that are half-used.
	
				WESKER (cont.)
			Alright. We're on.. .(checking the
			maps) ...level "C"...
	
				AIKEN
			Lingerie. Notions.
	
				WESKER
			GOD DAMMIT, NO MORE JOKES! We have
			men dead upstairs! This hell-hole
			is full of people who died... because
			of this stinkin' ...BUG!
	
	Jill has been counting the ammo clips.
	
				JILL
			Forty two.
	
				SPEYER
			That's all we have?
	
				WESKER
			We weren't expecting a war, Speyer.
			(To Jill) I'll take three. Three
			to your boyfriend...
	
				CHRIS
			Don't need 'em. Got my own loads.
	
	Wesker's eyes dart angrily toward Chris. But he notices
	Jill watching him...and he calms himself.
	
				WESKER
			Good. Then... we all get four clips.
	
				SPEYER
			They must have... weapons down here,
			somewhere. A powder magazine.
	
				WESKER
			No more side trips. It was a mistake
			to go into that lab upstairs. My
			mistake. And I'm not makin' another
			one. From now on it's straight ahead.
			In and out.
	
	Pg-53
	
	Wesker stands and opens the door.  Outside is a SERVICE
	CORRIDOR with unfinished walls. Spaces between raw metal
	beams are stuffed with insulation. Wesker checks the jamb
	outside. It's got a lock mechanism. Blue.
	
				WESKER (cont.)
			Not an override. My key won't work
			here on the way out. Prop the door.
	
	The troopers drag a heavy crate over to hold the door open.
	Wesker moves out. The commandos trickle after him. Chris
	holds Jill behind for a moment.
	
				CHRIS
			Jill...this guy is a Loony-Toon.
	
				JILL
			He's just... trying to get the job
			done. Doing what he has to do.
	
				CHRIS
			Yeah, well...I hope you'll say
			the same about me... when I do...
			what I have to do.
	
	Chris turns and walks off. Jill follows him out into...
	
	
	INT   SERVICE CORRIDOR   TIMELESS
	
	...the corridor. They catch up with the TROOP which is
	clustered at a blind alley which has two doors.
	
				WESKER
			(Checking his map) It's not clear...
			which way to go.
	
				RODRIGUEZ
			Want me to flip a coin?
	
	WESKER is annoyed by the remark. Decisively, he selects one
	of the doors and uses his green key card. With a BZZZZ, the
	lock releases. The troop enters...
	
	INT   SYSTEMS CENTER   TIMELESS
	
	...a vast ROOM, fifty-by-fifty yards. It's filled with
	HEATERS, AIR CONDITIONERS, WATER PUMPS. MAIN FRAMES for
	the internal computer network line one wall, FUSE BOXES
	and SWITCHER PANELS another. This is the systems center
	for the entire facility.
	
	There's an attendant's desk just inside the door. AIKEN
	and SULLIVAN drag it over to prop the door open. It makes
	
	
	
	Pg-54
	
	a frightening SOUND as it scrapes the floor, echoing,
	bouncing around in the large space. It prompts a response...
	another of those animal-like SNARLS from somewhere in the
	distance.
	
				SULLIVAN
			What's that sound like to you?
	
				AlKEN
			A meat-eater.
	
	There are thick columns, floor to ceiling, every ten feet.
	The spaces between them are very dark. It's hard to see.
	WESKER and some of the OTHERS click on their FLASHLIGHTS .
	Beams cut through dust.
	
	There are ELECTRONIC HUMS.. CLICKS and CHATTERS emit from
	the switchers, PINGS from the heaters, all combining to fray
	everyone's nerves. Light beams dance nervously as the
	commandos start out across the dark and frightening space.
	
				CHRIS
			(Softly to Jill) This is the heart
			of the whole place. They've got to
			have it... protected somehow.
	
	Two things happen, almost at once. First.. .CHRIS notices
	ELECTRIC EYES... on all of the columns.
	
				CHRIS (cont.)
			DUCK! HIT THE DECK!
	
	Second. A ZOMBIE lurches around a corner and BITES a chunk
	out of MARINI'S face. JILL whirls around to shoot at the
	zombie, but Chris grabs her and FLATTENS her on the floor.
	
	Marini, staggering, screaming in pain, triggers the first
	electric eye. LASER BEAMS shoot in all directions, forming
	a tight NET. Chris and Jill are barely beneath them.
	Many of the other troopers are hit by the beams... which do
	no immediate harm... but wherever they make contact, small
	CYLINDERS above the electric eyes begin to HISS.
	
				CHRIS (cont.)
			FOR CHRISSAKE, GET DOWN!
	
	The commandos duck under the laser beams... just in time.
	Jets of STEAM spout from the cylinders. It's not just hot
	steam. It's ACIDIC, deadly.
	
	Marini is hit by it. His clothes IGNITE. His flesh BOILS.
	It's a horrible sight, but for the moment, the jets stop.
	
	
	
	Pg-55
	
	Marini is dead on his feet. When he falls, he trips another
	of the laser beams. The steam jets SPOUT again. The troop
	is beneath them, though many are burned by liquid drops that
	spit from the nozzles.
	Amazingly, the zombie has avoided contact. But as it begins
	to stumble after commandos, we realize it's going to activate
	the sensors again.
	
				SULLIVAN
			There's no way outta this mousetrap!
	
				RODRIGUEZ
			So we live here now?
	
				SPEYER
			We gotta run for it.
	
	The zombie hits one of the laser beams. The steam HISSES
	out again. The zombie is MELTED.
	
				AIKEN
			Bad idea, Speyer.
	
				CHRIS
			Down. Through these.
	
	Chris has noticed a series of hinged panels in the floor.
	
				VICKERS
			Where do they go?
	
				SULLIVAN
			Does it matter?
	
	Sullivan whips out a Swiss Army knife and goes to work on
	the screws that hold down one of the panels. Other troopers
	do the same.
	
	Another ZOMBIE lurches out of the darkness. And ANOTHER.
	
	Human hands work furiously, loosening screws. Panels come
	up, Troopers begin to duck through the openings.
	
	A second zombie hits a red beam. STEAM again. Chris and
	Jill are spattered. Burned. But Jill bravely keeps working
	with her own issued knife. She gets a panel open. As she
	drops through, a third zombie triggers a burst of steam.
	Chris ducks and covers.
	
	When the jets stop, Chris begins to climb into the opening,
	but one of his legs is GRABBED from behind by...
	
	...one of the dead things which has already been MELTED!
	
	
	
	
	Pg-56
	
	Its flesh is bubbling. Bone is beginning to show. But
	the acid hasn't reached its brain yet. The creature is
	still alive.
	
	Chris CRIES out. Acid from the zombie's hands is burning
	his leg. The thing's lips have been eaten away, making its
	teeth look frighteningly skeletal as it leans forward for a
	bite of flesh. Chris jams the stock of his Winchester into
	the zombie's mouth. He's able to hold the thing's head back,
	but he's stuck. He can't let go.
	
	Jill pops up out of the floor. She presses the barrel of her
	own weapon into the zombie's forehead.
	
				JILL
			On three...
	
				CHRIS
			One... two...
	
	Chris pulls his rifle away. At the same instant, Jill FIRES.
	The zombie is PROPELLED through the air. One of its flailing
	arms triggers another laser beam. Chris throws himself in on
	top of Jill as STEAM HISSES over them.
	
	Twenty yards away, Wesker crawls under the cloud of acid.
	Just as he climbs down through one of the openings, he feels
	pressure...on his ear.
	
	A groping zombie has accidentally hooked its fingers onto the
	wire that runs from the detonator to Wesker's ear-piece.
	For a breathless moment, it seems like the sensor will be
	popped loose. Holding the pulse-reader in place, Wesker
	twists his body, lifts his hand gun, and PUMPS THREE into
	the dead thing's brain.
	
	The zombie flops over, but its fingers cling, entangled, in
	the wire. Wesker plants his pistol barrel on the knuckles
	of the thing's dead hand. THREE MORE SHOTS cut through bone,
	removing the fingers from the hand. The wire is freed.
	Wesker dives into the opening in the floor.
	
	
	INT   AIR DUCT   TIMELESS
	
	The COMMANDOS find themselves in an AIR DUCT. No room to
	stand. Hardly room to sit.
	
	Chris looks at his rifle stock. It's corroded from the acid
	in the zombie's mouth. Jill notices.
	
				JILL
			God...and it doesn't even stop them...
	
	
	
	Pg-57
	
				CHRIS
			It's not meant to stop them. It's
			meant to stop...something else.
	
	That distant SNARLING SOUND comes again, making Jill shiver.
	The troop is strung out along the metal shaft. REBECCA
	crawls among them, treating the worst burns. WESKER checks
	his maps. SPEYER confronts him again.
	
				SPEYER
			We damn near got turned into Rice
			Krispies by that gizmo of yours.
			If you don't want me to nail that
			fuckin' thing into your ear, you
			deactivate it. Right now.
	
				WESKER
			I can't. They.. .fixed it... so you
			can't chicken out. The system can
			only be turned off at the main panel.
	
				BARRY
			Where the hell is that?
	
				WESKER
			Where the explosives are. Down...
			farther than we need to go. We only
			have to make it down one more level.
			If... when... we make it back up to
			the choppers... we can fly out of
			the detonator's signal range.
	
	Chris calls out from the far end of the shaft
	 
				CHRIS
			I'm not willing to rely on that.
			I live here, this is my town!
	
				WESKER
			The town's been evacuated. Just...
			just in case.
	
				CHRIS
			That explains the lie. About the
			plane crash. An airplane down...
			with weapons on board... would nicely
			explain a big explosion, wouldn't it?
			You figured all along you might have
			to blow this place!
	
				WESKER
			I don't want to do it. I... I hope
			I don't have to.
	
	
	Pg-58
	
	Chris looks down the dim air-shaft, unable to see Wesker's
	eyes, hidden by distance.. .and by his dark glasses.
	
				WESKER (cont.)
			That's the best I can do for you,
			kid. Good faith. Now... let's
			knock on it.
	
	Wesker moves out. The troop follows.
	
				CHRIS
			I...I can't let this happen. I've
			got to find that bomb.
	
				JILL
			I'll help. Once Wesker gets what
			he wants, my obligation is over.
	
	Chris looks at her with appreciative eyes .
	
				CHRIS
			No. I want you out. With the
			rest of them. Wesker won't push
			the button until you're clear.
	
				JILL
			He doesn't want to push the button.
	
				CHRIS
			He has to. Don't you see? He can't
			leave these labs here. And, Jesus...
			walking corpses! He's gotta get rid
			of the evidence.
	
	INT   AIR SHAFT   TIMELESS
	
	The light is dim at its best. Long stretches of the shaft
	are pitch black, and there's a constant stream of air that
	MOANS eerily. This whole mission has been like a descent
	into Hell, darker and more frightening with each level down.
	
	There are turn-offs, "T"s and "Y"s. At one point, when JILL
	looks back, she finds ROSIE behind her. Chris is gone. Did
	he leave to deal with the bomb?
	
	No, but he's about to. He's at the rear of the pack, pressed
	against the side-wall, waving others past.
	
				JILL
			Chris, no!
	
				CHRIS
			I've got to try and stop this.
	
	
	
	Pg-59
	
	Jill starts back toward Chris, but freezes.. .everyone freezes
	when... the duct-work starts to PING.
	
				RODRIGUEZ
			Shit. One thing after another.
	
	BOOM! The air shaft is ROCKED, as if punched by a giant
	fist. Then...the whole structure begins to SHIMMY. What
	is it, an earthquake?
	
				WESKER
			Sit tight. Ride it out.
	
	GRONK! A sheet-metal panel BUCKLES! Others do the same.
	All along the shaft, panels begin to FOLD INWARD. Something
	outside is CRUSHING the duct as if it were a giant tube of
	toothpaste. And the troopers are being SQUEEZED inside.
	
	RIVETS POP! The panels begin to SEPARATE...and large,
	pulsing bits of FLESH appear! Not animal flesh. But the
	flesh of A PLANT! The things that press in through the
	openings are larger versions of the vines we saw in the
	kitchen. Those were its fingertips. These are its ARMS.
	Strong arms that are RIPPING the ductwork apart.
	
	Chris, Rebecca, Aiken and Sullivan end up in one part of the
	shaft. The rest in another... including Jill, who calls out.
	
				JILL
			CHRIS!
	
	The section that holds Chris' group FALLS AWAY... with a
	monstrous, CRUNCHING sound.
	
	INT   ARBORETUM   TIMELESS
	
	CHRIS' GROUP spills out of the dangling metal, with cables
	from the torn ceiling...TZZZZZT...SPARKING around them.
	The troopers drop out of Hell, into...PARADISE.
	
	An enormous HOT HOUSE, a lush, indoor JUNGLE of PLANTS,
	IVIES, GRASSES. It's like a RAIN FOREST, complete with
	a thick, damp MIST that makes it difficult to see. We might
	be on another planet. None of the foliage seems indigenous
	to Earth. There are LEAVES the size of bed sheets, FLOWERS ,
	the size of armchairs. And at the center of it all, is the
	mother of the deadly vines...
	
	...PLANT 42, a monstrous schefflera, twenty times normal
	size. Most of its limbs reach upward, where they have opened
	CRACKS in the ceiling and walls, to stretch on into the
	facility above. There are also dozens of shorter, beefier
	"arms", each of which act independently, like tentacles on
	an octopus... and each has a large, drooling POD at its tip.
	
	
	Pg-60
	
	INT   RUNWAY   TIMELESS
	
	BURSTS OF GUNFIRE from three M-16s shatter our ears... and
	a ceiling VENT. WESKER and THE OTHERS jump down into...
	
	...a very unusual CORRIDOR. It seems to stretch forever, in
	both directions. It has no doors, no visible means of exit
	or entry. The walls are made-up of multi-colored polymer
	TILES, whose irregular shapes fit together like a JIGSAW
	PUZZLE. The floor is HEAVY STEEL, though faceted. It seem
	designed to shift. The whole corridor looks like it might be
	able to bend, to change position, like an airport jet way.
	
	There are disconcerting signs of damage...claw-like GOUGES on
	the tiles, clean cut HOLES punched through the metal ceiling,
	larger in diameter than any that might have been caused by
	bullets.
	
	And there are smears of BLOOD everywhere, as if some terrible
	battle... or battles...took place here.
	
				WESKER
			This way. (He starts off.)
	
				JILL
			No. That way.  Chris and the others...
	
				WESKER
			If they're dead, they're dead. If
			they're alive, they'll still be alive
			in twenty minutes. When we get back.
	
				JILL
			Maybe not. And how do we know it's
			only going to be twenty minutes?
			How do we know we'll be able to come
			back this way?
	
				WESKER
			We don't. But we'll do our damndest
			to try. This is it, guys. The home
			stretch. Let's go.
	
	Wesker trots off. Vickers and Rodriguez follow. Speyer and
	Barry hang back... with Jill, who remains torn.
	
				WESKER (cont.)
			(Looking back) Valentine. You're
			on the clock! Fall in!
	
	Jill wrestles with her emotions but, in the end, dutifully,
	she "falls in".
	
	As the troopers move off, we hear odd SCRATCHING SOUNDS...
	with the high-pitched SQUEAL of metal-on-metal.
	
	
	Pg-61
	
	
	INT   ARBORETUM  TIMELESS
	
	The beefy "ARMS" of PLANT 42 undulate overhead as CHRIS and
	his COMPANIONS look for an exit.
	
				REBECCA
			Th-this thing was no accident.
			It was cultivated!
	
				CHRIS
			And it didn't rip out the ceiling
			for the fun of it. Stay alert.
	
	The plant seems to behave intelligently, with caution. The
	pods on its "arms" dart, almost as if sniffing... then pull
	back...like the vines in the kitchen, like timid animals.
	
	Chris spots A DOORWAY.
	
				CHRIS (cont.)
			Here.
	
	As the others follow him, one of the pods swoops down in
	front of REBECCA, and doesn't withdraw. It hovers there.
	Its follicle's open like jaws, which display serrated daggers
	of cartilage that look like teeth. Inside, a pulsing calyx
	emits a pistil that twitches and swells.
	
				AIKEN
			My mother made me eat vegetables.
			I know 'em all. This ain't one
			of 'em.
	
				SULLIVAN
			Aiken...
	
	
	ANOTHER POD swoops down on Sullivan's back. Its BEAK clamps
	onto the flesh between his shoulder blades. It's PISTIL
	shoots out like a hypodermic needle, stabs him and, within
	the blink of an eye, SUCKS out every ounce of the man's
	blood. His skin turns the color of PARCHMENT, FLAKING OFF
	HIM like powder, as he dies.
	
				AIKEN
			Sullivan! JESUS, SULLIVAN!
	
	Aiken rushes to his buddy's side.
	
				CHRIS
			Get out of the away!
	
	Chris launches himself off a stone retaining wall around one
	of the gardens. Leaping up, he grabs one of the SPARKING
	CONDUITS and pulls it down.
	
	
	Pg-62
	
				CHRIS (cont.)
			Get OUTA THERE, AIKEN!
	
	Chris ends up having to shoulder Aiken out of the way.
	Tendrils from the plant very nearly get both of them, but
	Chris manages to JAM the semi-rigid conduit into a pool of
	sprinkler-fed WATER around the plant's roots.
	
	A BRIGHT CURRENT stutters through every vine. The plant
	SHRIEKS, hideously, as electricity causes fluids to SQUIRT
	from boils that develop on its flesh, down along its "arms",
	and into its blood-sucking pods...which FLOP, lifeless, to
	the floor, with the same sort of liquid SMACKS that human
	skulls might make.
	
				AIKEN
			They.. .they killed Sullivan. The
			bastards... whoever did this shit...
			they KILLED SULLIVAN!
	
	Enraged, Aiken draws a long-bladed KNIFE and wildly attacks
	the remains of Plant 42, slashing at the thing's dead limbs,
	not stopping until he cuts into...
	
	...something that looks like a vine...but BLEEDS RED!
	Aiken traces the thing with his eyes, up to where it's
	coiled in high tree branches. It's the oversized body...
	...of A COPPERHEAD, with a belly SIX FEET in diameter.
	As Aiken gasps, spellbound, he's STUCK from behind.
	
	The snake is so long, its body is draped on one side of the
	greenhouse, but its head is on the other. With the power
	of a dozer-shovel..JAWS like the open hood of a Cadillac...
	TEETH the size of windows...CLAMP onto Aiken's mid-section,
	instantly CRUSHING his ribs.
	
	Chris finds a skein of ROPE. He throws the long end over a
	ceiling beam, then instantly makes a LASSO out of the piece
	in _is hand and tosses the loop at the snake's head .
	
	Aiken's body, in the serpent's jaws, makes the rope miss.
	Chris throws again. In the seconds between tosses, the snake
	has SLURPED Aiken into its mouth. The rope encircles the
	beast's head. Chris pulls. The noose slips down over the
	snake's maxillaries and tightens around its neck. Chris uses
	all his strength. With the ceiling beam as a pulley, the
	snake's head is SLAMMED against the rafters.
	
				CHRIS
			(To Rebecca) Hold this.
	
	Rebecca is, understandably, not quick to respond.
	
	
	
	Pg-63
	
				CHRIS (cont.)
			GET IN HERE, SOLDIER!
	
	In this crisis, Chris finds himself sounding a lot like
	Wesker. It sobers him. It sobers Rebecca, as well. She
	rushes in and takes hold of the rope.
	
	Moving fast, Chris rushes to where Aiken's knife dropped
	on the floor. He grabs it, turns back, and sees...
	
	...something MOVING inside the snake's beaded torso. It's
	Aiken... still alive.
	
	Chris charges, PLUNGES the knife into the beast, hacking
	through layers of fat until he reaches a bloody CAVITY.
	
	Aiken is curled within, like Jonah in the Whale. His chest
	has been crushed to half its normal size. Acids from the
	monster's intestine have begun to eat through flesh on his hands,
	his face, but he's still conscious, able to wheeze-out words.
	
				AIKEN
			K-kill me. S-Sullvan said...I'd
			be.. .better off dead. That...ain't
			never been truer than now. Kill me!
	
	The snake uses all its strength to lower its head from the
	ceiling. Rebecca hangs bravely onto the rope, but she's
	LIFTED, bodily, off the floor.
	
	The rope SNAPS, cut by the steel beam. Rebecca falls. The
	trailing edge of the noose catches on twisted debris. It
	delays the snake for two seconds.
	
	Those fragile seconds give Chris just enough time to reach
	into the open belly of the monster...and pull the PINS on
	TWO GRENADES that dangle from Aiken's vest.
	
	The giant copperhead SNAPS at Chris from behind, missing him
	by inches. He dives, like a wide-receiver reaching for a
	pass. What he catches is...
	
	...Rebecca's arm. His momentum carries her down to the
	floor. They roll behind another STONE WALL that contains
	tons of earth, which protects them from...
	
	...BOO-BOOOOOM!... the explosions of the grenades... which blow
	Aiken... and yards of the snake's mid-section...into eternity.
	
	
	INT   CONFERENCE ROOM   TIMELESS
	
	The same nervous HANDS that we saw in the opening fidget on
	the polished surface of the conference table. A distorted
	VOICE scratches over a speaker-phone.
	
	
	
	Pg-64
				VOICE ON THE PHONE (o.s. filter)
			We're close. I think I'll be able
			to get the package. It's been...
			very interesting.
	
				VOICE IN THE ROOM
			Anything you can't handle?
	
				VOICE ON THE PHONE (o.s. filter)
			(Chuckling) There's nothing I
			can't handle.
	
	A hand with an ostentatious RING flicks cigar ash.
	
				HOLDEN
			Keep us appraised.
	
	Holden's hand clicks off the speaker-phone.
	
				HOLDEN (cont.)
			(To the others in the room) I'm
			reassured, gentlemen...that every-
			thing is...under control.
	
	INT   RUNWAY   TIMELESS
	
	WESKER, alone in the strange, faceted corridor, packs away
	his radio. He hears... FOOTSTEPS. JILL appears.
	
				WESKER
			Where are the others?
	
				JILL
			Right behind me. Were you...
			talking to someone?
	
				WESKER
			To Washington. To my... superiors.
			They're your superiors too, Valentine.
			Don't forget that.
	
	Jill wonders. Should she challenge Wesker? She has no time
	to think. More FOOTSTEPS come CLACKING at her back. It's
	RODRIGUEZ and SPEYER. A moment later, BARRY and VICKERS
	appear from the opposite direction.
	
				BARRY
			Nothin'. man. No doors. Nothin'.
			We hit a dead end.
	
				SPEYER
			Us too. Cement wall.
	
				VICKERS
			We're never gonna get to that lab.

	TCHUNG TCHUNG TCHUNG... a sound like a rivet gun resounds
	in the corridor, repetitive, but random, not rhythmic.
	
	
	INT   ELECTRIC TUNNEL   TIMELESS
	
	CHRIS and REBECCA are crawling through a two-foot high
	feeder-passage for electric cables, their bellies scraping
	the floor, their backs the ceiling. They hear the sound...
	
	...TCHUNG TCHUNG TCHUNG! Then suddenly...it stops.
	
				REBECCA
			(Crying quietly) I... can't take
			this any more.
	
				CHRIS
			We take what comes. That's the
			secret of our genius.
	
	He looks back. Rebecca sniffles.
	
	
				CHRIS (cont.)
			How old are you?
	
				REBECCA
			Not very old at all. Not nearly
			old enough to...to...
	
				CHRIS
			None of us is old enough for that.
	
	Rebecca nods, forcing a smile meant to be appreciative.
	
				REBECCA
			Jill... told me... you were nice .
	
				CHRIS
			She did? She never told me.
	
	That sound returns... TCHUNG TCHUNG TCHUNG...getting louder.
	
	
	INT   RUNWAY   TIMELESS
	
	Down in the corridor, the other TROOPERS see...
	...faintly in the dusty reaches of the dark... AGILE SHAPES
	advancing... not along the floor, but along the CEILING!
	They look like apes, swinging from... What could they be
	swinging from? The ceiling is solid metal.
	
	CLOSE ON: A MONSTROUS HAND, both hairy, and scaly. It's
	fingers have ten-inch claws.. .more like horns... which PUNCH
	upward, penetrating the ceiling metal, and clamping on.
	
	
	
	Pg-66
	
	THE SHOT WIDENS to reveal A BEAST, unlike any we've seen,
	dangling from the ceiling. It is ape-like... and lizard-
	like. With ferocious eyes that glare from beneath an insect-
	like carapace. This thing is an amalgam of all the nasty
	creatures that have pursued us in our nightmares. It's
	called... A HUNTER.
	
	There are SIX OF THEM... as far as we can see, there might be
	more coming from behind. Their three-toed feet also have
	claws that can pierce the ceiling, enabling them to move
	forward... hand over foot, foot over hand.
	
	One of them lets out a GRRROWLLLL! The same sound we've
	been hearing through the walls. Now it echos in the
	corridor, up close and personal. The troopers open fire,
	even before the creatures get in range.
	
	
	INT   ELECTRIC TUNNEL   TIMELESS
	
	CHRIS and REBECCA hear the gunfire.
	
				CHRIS
			Hurry.
	
	Chris crawls on. Rebecca is stopped when... TCHUNNNNGGG !
	One of the HUNTERS' CLAWS PUNCHES up through the floor ,
	almost stabbing her. Rebecca SCREAMS. In the tight space,
	Chris is barely able to reach back and take her hand.
	
	TCHUNNNNGG! TGG! More CLAWS penetrate the metal.
	The couple plunge ahead of them, the way Chris plunged
	ahead of the bullets on Level "A".
	
	INT   RUNWAY   TIMELESS
	
	WESKER, JILL and the OTHERS spit lead at the advancing
	creatures. Bullets THUNK into their bodies. Blood flows,
	but the creatures seem to feel no pain. Even when they're
	hit squarely in their skulls.
	
				BARRY
			Head shots. Ain't doin' nothin'!
	
				WESKER
			That was the idea.
	
				BARRY
			What idea?
	
				WESKER
			To win. The idea was... to win.
	
	
	Pg-67
	
	Jill aims at one of the hunters, pressing the trigger of
	her M-16, and not letting go until her clip runs out.
	The creature's head is turned RAGGED by the barrage...
	revealing an iron SUPERSTRUCTURE beneath the skin.
	
				VOICE (o.s.)
			Now that... is a metal-head.
	
	Jill looks up. CHRIS jumps out of the open grate in the
	ceiling. REBECCA jumps down after him.
	
				CHRIS (cont.)
			What d'ya think? Should I wait
			for orders, or just wing it?
	
				JILL
			Wing it!
	
				CHRIS
			You know...that just might be
			the ticket. Wing the fuckers.
	
	Chris takes a careful SHOT with-his Winchester. He hits one
	of the Hunters squarely on its WRIST...which SNAPS. The
	creature drops to the floor.
	
				CHRIS (cont.)
			Forget the head shots. They're
			useless. Shoot for the joints.
			The JOINTS!
	
	Rebecca opens FIRE with Aiken's M-16, giving the others time
	to reload. Barry is the first to resume firing...at the
	closest of the Hunters... at its wrists, which are SNAPPED
	by the bullets. The creature drops to the floor.
	
	The troopers fire at KNEES, ANKLES, ELBOWS, which seem to
	be the weakest spots. More of the hunters drop from the
	ceiling...but they continue to advance, crawling, pushing
	themselves forward with whatever limbs remain intact.
	
				SPEYER
			Run! We slowed 'em down. Run!
	
				BARRY
			Where? As far as we'll get, either
			way, is a cement wall.
	
	There are two hunters left on the ceiling. One of them makes
	a mighty, impossible LUNGE... and hits Speyer like a battering
	ram, slashing his CHEST OPEN with its claws.
	
	Two of the hunters on the floor rush forward, not attacking,
	but wanting to feed on Speyer's remains.
	
	
	Pg-68
	
	Brad, trembling, completely crazed, drops his weapon and
	backs away. He sees...one of those jigsaw tiles, a RED
	one, GLOW from within. He thinks he's hallucinating until...
	
	...the floor JERKS, in a tight spasm. Its steel facets
	begin to separate, sliding away from each other. The
	troopers narrowly escape as.. .
	
	...the floor behind them GRINDS, in and out, left and right,
	as if it were CHEWING. Speyer's body, and those of the
	hunters on the floor, are EATEN by the powerful steel blades.
	But one hunter remains above it all. TCHUNG TCHUNG TCHUNG,
	it continues to advance along the ceiling.
	
	An invisible, JIGSAWED DOOR glides open twenty yards down
	the hall. The troopers run for it, and are met by a
	beautiful Asian scientist... the woman we saw on the video
	playback... ADA WONG.
	
				ADA
			You lost a man. If I had only
			been faster. I was unfamiliar
			with the mechanism.

			God. One of them... is still ..
			Quickly. Inside. Quickly!
	
	The troopers rush into...
	
	
	INT   CUBICLE   TIMELESS
	
	...a security cubicle. CHRIS is the last to enter, barely
	making it before the door begins to slide shut.
	KA-TCHUNK! CLAWS penetrate the opening.

			Don't worry, it's mindless. It
			doesn't realize that it's strong
			enough to push the door open.
	
				BARRY (cont.)
			Sometimes the dumb get lucky.
	
				RODRIGUEZ
			Hasn't happened to me, yet.
	
	The Hunter GROWLS. Its snout darkens the space between door
	and wall. Mucous from its nostrils spits through.
	
	
	
	Pg-69
	After a terrifying moment, the claw recedes. The dark
	snout disappears. The snorting fades away. Followed by
	a distant...TCHUNG TCHUNG TCHUNG...as the hunter departs.
	Everyone relaxes, visibly.
	
	The troopers turn and, for the first time, notice two haggard
	SCIENTISTS standing across the room.
	
				ADA
			My... colleagues. Benjamin. Toshiro.
			As far as we know, we are the...only
			ones.. .left alive. We worked on "C"
			level. One of the biologists saved us.
			Brought us down here. He knew that...
			he didn't have long to live. He...
			started the mechanism... out there,
			in the corridor.. .and he let it...
			take him.
	
	Ada stares at a complicated control panel.
	
				ADA (cont.)
			I only saw it used that one time.
			Or perhaps...I could have been
			faster. The man...you lost...
	
				RODRIGUEZ
			You did fine, lady. We're obliged.
	
				ADA
			As are we. (Sighing) We believed...
			we would die here. Believed...the
			bomb would destroy us.
	 
				 JILL
			You knew.. .about the bomb?
	
				ADA
			The end for a place like this, when
			it fails... must be a bomb, yes?
	
	Jill looks at Chris. His point has been proven.
	
				ADA (cont.)
			But now... that you are here... the
			bomb will not come.
	
				CHRIS
			It... already came. ma'am. We
			brought it. The colonel, here...
			he's wearing it.
	
	Ada looks at the detonator on Wesker's belt, at the sequence
	of blinking lights.

				ADA
			(To Wesker) Is it true? Are you
			here to... rescue? Or destroy?
	
				WESKER
			Both. (With that odd smile of his)
			If I have to pick only one... I'll
			pick destroy.
	
				ADA
			You're not S.T.A.R.S. You're Umbrella.
	
				WESKER
			Once again. Both. (Still smiling)
			Two salaries. Three if you count
			combat pay.
	
	Ada looks at him with disgust.
	
				ADA
			The man I loved, John Marcus...
			developed the organism that caused
			all this. He... he did it for
			humanitarian purposes. It was
			taken away from him...for in-human
			purposes...by men like you!
	
				WESKER
			No, ma'am. Men like me... are just
			errand boys. Sent in to do the
			wet-work. All of the glory. None
			of the benefits.
	
				ADA
			After what you've seen down here,
			do you think any of it could be
			turned into... benefit?
	
				WESKER
			Yes. I think it could be turned
			into five or ten million dollars.
			How do we get into "D" lab?
	
				ADA
			Death lab. (She slumps) John
			was killed...never even knowing it
			existed. They kept him... isolated,
			upstairs, while a separate team was

	Ada is about to answer, but Wesker interrupts.
	
				WESKER
			HOW DO WE GET INTO "D" LAB?
	
				ADA
			You don't.
	
	Ada glances at an innocuous wall panel. Wesker notices a
	key-slot. Green.
	
				ADA (cont.)
			It can't be opened. Thank God.
			None of us is cleared for that
			level of security.
	
				WESKER
			How fortunate... that I am.
	
	Wesker steps over to the wall and inserts his green card into
	the slot. The panel slides open. Beyond it is a steel door
	with another green slot. Wesker uses his card again. A lock
	CLICKS. Wesker pushes the door open.
	
				WESKER (cont.)
			Barry. Come with me. The rest of
			you.. .make sure this door doesn't
			close. Remember...
	
	Wesker taps his ear-piece. Everyone gets his meaning. He
	and Barry disappear through the opening. The steel door
	begins to close. Rodriguez lunges, and catches it.
	
				ADA
			Have...you been leaving doors open?
	
				JILL
			Yes.
	
				ADA
			This place is going to be overrun by...
	
				REBECCA
			Brad's in really bad shape.
	
	Brad is leaning against a wall, sweating, shivering. Rebecca
	looks at his wounded leg.
	
				REBECCA (cont.)
			That's not just a scrape. You
			were bitten, weren't you?
	
	
	
	Pg-73
	
				VICKERS
			One...of the sharks. Its teeth.
			I Just...brushed up against its
			teeth...after it was dead.
	
				ADA
			(Alert) Shoot him. Somebody,
			shoot him!
	
				JILL
			No! We're so close. The antidote.
	
	
	INT   STAIRWELL   TIMELESS
	
	WESKER and BARRY trot down a flight of metal stairs.
	
				BARRY
			What's got into you man? This...
			this isn't like you.
	
				WESKER
			Oh, yes, this is exactly like me.
	
	Until now, Wesker has been steadfast. He suddenly seems
	nervous, anxious. Some of it is fear. Most of it is
	anticipation of the goal which is suddenly within reach.
	
				WESKER (cont.)
			This is...what I've been all my life.
			A guy... suckin' up to the honchos.
			Wipin' the shit off their asses...
			all the while lookin' for a break.
			A way to get some of my own! Well
			this it, friend. I'm myself,
			alright. And I know exactly what
			I'm doing. I told you...before this
			day was over... I'd pay you back.
	
	INT   CUBICLE   TIMELESS
	
	CHRIS and JILL step past RODRIGUEZ. They take off down the
	stairs.
	
	As they leave, ADA opens a desk drawer and pulls out a .45.
	
				RODRIGUEZ
			(Looking at the gun) You know
			how to use that thing, chica?
	
				ADA
			Of course I do. I'm a scientist.
	
	Pg-74
	
	Ada CLICKS back the bolt, whips up the .45, and aims it at
	BRAD'S head. REBECCA dives in front of the man.
	
				REBECCA
			No! You can't! Not while there's
			still a chance to save him!
	
	
	INT   SAFETY CHAMBER   "D" LAB   TIMELESS
	
	WESKER and BARRY arrive at a set of PLEXIGLASS DOORS. They
	can't see through them, they're FOGGED. Wesker finds a key
	slot, inserts his access card, and...
	
	...WHOOSH... the doors open. A CLOUD OF HYPER-COLD MIST
	rushes out, instantly coating the men in FROST. Wesker
	doesn't feel the cold. He doesn't feel anything, except
	a surge of triumph. He steps through the opening into...
	
	
	INT "D" LAB TIMELESS
	
	...a laboratory that looks like-the cockpit of a Concorde...
	only a hundred times larger.. Nothing is, recognizable, except
	desks that hold futuristic-Ibokin computers. A befuddling
	array of BUTTONS, SWITCHES, stuttering LIGHTS, covers every
	inch of wall space.
	
	And at the center of it all stands a tall, cylindrical TANK,
	a stasis tube, filled with ICE. It's mounted on a six-foot
	tall platform, like an altar, with cables and flexible tubes
	running out of it. Wesker squints, and through the freeze,
	sees the thing that stands sedated within the cylinder...
	
	...THE TYRANT. It's nine feet tall. Like the hunters, it
	has more or less human form, though it's musculature is more
	defined than Superman's. One of its arms is scaled to size,
	but the other is much longer. Its hand dangles at knee-
	level. Monstrous steel CLAWS depend from its fingers,
	nearly touching the floor.
	
				WESKER
			(In awe) It's called... the Tyrant.
			Nobody knows it exists. Except us...
			and Holden.
	
				BARRY
			Holden?
	
				WESKER
			Umbrella's man in D.C. We need him.
			He signs the checks. (Excited) We've
			got it, Barry! Our fortune!
	
	
	Pg-75
	
				BARRY
			You're not gonna try to get this
			big mother outta here ?
	
				WESKER
			Don't have to. All we need is the
			data. Then.. .these things can be
			cranked out on an assembly line!
	
	Laying down his automatic, WESKER hits computer keys until
	a DISK pops out of a master-feed.
	
				WESKER (cont.)
			YES! This is it!
	
				BARRY
			What about the antidote?
	
				WESKER
			Antidote? (Laughing) There is no
			antidote. That was just happy horse
			shit, to keep the team going.
	
	Neither man notices... that the removal of the master disk has
	caused certain systems to fail... indicated by red lights, and
	by the fact that... the walls of the Tyrant's cylinder are
	beginning to run liquid sweat. The ice... is MELTING.
	
				BARRY
			You're gonna give this to Umbrella?
	
				WESKER
			No. I'm gonna sell it to them. Then
			I'm gonna open a Swiss bank account...
			right next to yours.
	
				JILL (o.s.)
			God...damn!
	
	JILL has appeared in the doorway with CHRIS. They both
	at the monster with awe...and terror.
	
				JILL (cont.)
			That thing... can't be real!
	
				WESKER
			It's real, alright. And it's worth...
			more than gold. More than uranium!
	
				RODRIGUEZ
			Do we get a piece of that action?
	
	ROSIE has arrived. So have REBECCA, ADA, and the two
	surviving SCIENTISTS.
	
	Pg-76
	
				WESKER
			All of you do. Anyone who comes out
			of this alive... gets a taste.
	
				RODRIGUEZ (o.s.)
			I'm in. I been eatin' shit all my
			life. I'm happy to eat some more...
			as long as it's got some gravy on it.
	
	Rosie steps into the lab, her weapon ready.
	
				WESKER
			Anybody else see it my way?
	
	One of the scientists, TOSHIRO, rushes to join.
	
				ADA
			(To Toshiro) You disgrace yourself!
	
				TOSHIRO
			I...I want to live.
	
				WESKER
			Smart. Anyone else? Valentine?
	
	Jill looks at Chris. Then she steps through the doorway and
	takes a defensive post beside her c.o.
	
				CHRIS
			And I was gonna try to disarm the
			bomb. This place should be destroyed!
			It needs to be destroyed!
	
	Chris lifts his rifle. Wesker is faster with his pistol,
	aiming it at Chris' belly.
	
				WESKER
			Gotcha, son. It's only because
			of Valentine, here, that I didn't
			squeeze the trigger.
	
	Chris and Jill exchange dagger eyes.
	
				CHRIS
			If she's on your side... she doesn't
			mean shit to me. And I don't mean
			shit to her.
	
				JILL
			Chris, please. There's only... one
			way to go, here .
	
				WESKER
			That's right. My way!
	
	
	Pg-77
	
	
				JILL
			Yes, sir. Your way!
	
	Jill presses in close to Wesker, as if completely allied.
	
				JILL (cont.)
			I...can't yell you, Chris...how much
			I wanted...things to have turned out
			differently. (Beat) Goodbye.
	
	Swiftly, unexpectedly, Jill snatches the detonator wire and
	pulls the sensor out of Wesker's ear.
	
	Everyone shuts their eyes, expecting to be blown sky-high.
	
	Nothing happens.
	
	Jill pulls the detonator off Wesker's belt. She stares
	small LED screen which reads... 14:42:16... 15... 14...
	
				JILL (cont.)
			Shit. I got all my courage up...
			and we still have fifteen minutes!
	
	Jill tosses the detonator to Chris. Wesker turns on her,
	lifting his M-16...
	
				BARRY
			You shoot. I shoot, boss.
	
	Wesker turns to find Barry's weapon aiming at his belly.
	
				BARRY (cont.)
			Shit.. here I am still callin'
			you 'boss'.
	
	Wesker is holding the data-disk. Suddenly, he feels it
	snatched away...by Ada, who has rushed into the room.
	
	He aims his weapon at her back as she darts away. Before
	he can fire, he's KICKED in the head... by Jill. Buckling,
	dazed, he looks up at her.
	
				JILL
			We believed in you. I believed
			in you. Boy, was I a sucker.
	
	She kicks him again, just for the hell of it. He flops on
	the floor, his eye-socket swollen. He's dropped his gun.
	
	He gropes for it. Barry steps in and boots it away.
	
	A KLAXON SOUNDS! Emergency!
	
	The ice in the Tyrant's tank has melted down to a critical
	level. The monster... is beginning to MOVE.
	
	
	Pg-78
	
	Reaching the doorway, Ada hears a mechanism TRIP in the jamb.
	The Plexiglas doors begin to slide shut. Ada strains to
	hold them back.
	
				ADA
			Get out! Now! Or you never will!
	
				RODRIGUEZ
			So... we'll live here! (Glancing at
			the Tyrant) No. The landlord looks
			like a sonuvabitch.
	
	Rosie rushes in to help Ada hold the doors. So does
	BENJAMIN, the second of the surviving scientists, who is...
	...MAULED from behind by a ZOMBIE. It's not just any zombie.
	It's BRAD VICKERS, back from death, who BITES out the artery
	in Benjamin's neck.
	
				ADA
			I TOLD YOU... TO SHOOT HIM!
	
	Ada lifts her .45 and blows Vickers way. She looks down
	at Benjamin, writhing on the floor, aims at his head... and
	FIRES again.
	
	Rodriguez is the only one holding the doors. Jill rushes
	to help her.
	
				JILL
			Everybody! OUT!
	
				CHRIS
			(Off the LED) Thirteen minutes.
	
	Inside the lab, Barry turns to Toshiro, the other scientist.
	
				BARRY
			Go.
	
	Toshiro hesitates... a second too long. KRAAASSSH! The
	stasis tube BURSTS open. WATER and bits of ICE fly out...
	along with an enormous, bionic HAND. Big-enough to grab
	Toshiro's head as if it were a cantaloupe. Powerful enough
	to CRUSH that head as if it were... well, a cantaloupe.
	
	Wesker, still searching for his pistol, sees all this.
	
	The Tyrant is not completely free. Much of the cylinder
	wall has cracked away, but sections of it cling to a now
	misshapen mass of ice that still holds the monster bound.
	Though it won1t for much longer.
	
	Wesker starts toward the door. Barry grabs the back of his
	shirt and pitches him across the lab.
	
	
	Pg-79
	
				BARRY (cont.)
			You and me... we ain't goin' nowhere.
			Not just now, boss.
	
	Barry turns to the others clustered at the doorway.
	
				BARRY (cont.)
			This thing gets loose, it's gonna
			be pissed. Somebody's gotta hold it
			back. Give you guys a fair chance.
	
				JILL
			LOOK OUT!
	
	Wesker has found his pistol. He FIRES at Barry who, ducking,
	is only GRAZED. Wesker aims at the group in the doorway.
	Barry pops out from behind a desk and shoots back at him.
	
	Ada and Rebecca duck away from the doors, pulling Rodriguez
	and a reluctant Jill after them. The doors begin to slide
	closed. Chris valiantly tries to prevent them from shutting.
	
	Wesker CRAWLS lke a dog. He manages to fling an arm
	out through the opening. Steel bumpers press on the meat
	of his forearm. Wesker looks up. Through the Plexiglas,
	his eyes meet Chris'.
	
				WESKER
			Get me outta here, Redfield. Or so
			help me God, you're a dead man.
	
	With his free hand, Wesker aims his pistol at Chris. The gun
	barrel is an intimidating sight, even though it's on the other
	side of the plexi. Chris glances at the others.
	
				CHRIS
			Get going.
	
				JILL
			Not without...
	
				CHRIS
			MOVE!
	
	Ada, Rebecca and Rodriguez wrestle Jill away bodily, and
	start up the metal stairway.
	
				WESKER
			COME BACK! RODRIGUEZ! VALENTINE!
			THAT'S AN ORDER !
	
				CHRIS
			Orders don't mean shit any more,
			Wesker. Especially when they come
			from sell-out bastards like you.
	
	
	
	Pg-80
	
	Chris lets go. The doors squeeze tighter. Wesker SCREAMS.
	
	Through the plexi, Chris catches a glimpse of Barry, who
	stands and gives him a military salute. Chris salutes back.
	
	BLAM BLAM BLAM... Wesker FIRES three rounds. Dusty blemishes
	appear on the bulletproof glass. The slugs ricochet back
	into the lab.
	
	One of them CHIPS away at the ICE which is less and less
	able to contain the Tyrant.
	
	Chris makes a break for the stairs. Wesker twists his body
	in an attempt to push his pistol through the opening, but his
	fist, around the stock, is too thick. Nonetheless, Wesker
	FIRES .BLAM BLAM BLAM... bullets SCREAM off the banister
	rails, but none of them contact Chris' legs which disappear
	up the stairs.
	
	The ice in the stasis tube is turning to slush. The Tyrant
	is about to break loose. Wesker looks pleadingly at Barry.
	
				WESKER
			B-buddy. You gotta get us out.
	
				BARRY
			Not sure I know how, boss. Do you?
			Is there some other...'need-to-know'
			secret for shutting down the Big
			Bopper, here?
	
				WESKER
			No. It.. it can't be shut down.
	 
				BARRY
			The ultimate warrior. The ultimate
			soldier. We'll see. How it does
			against a couple of hard-ass career
			guys, like you and me.
	
	WESKER swings his free arm and aims his pistol at BARRY.
	CLICK! The gun is empty.
	
	
	INT   CUBICLE   TIMELESS
	
	The ESCAPEES arrive in the security cubicle.
	
				ADA
			The corridor outside... can be moved.
	
	Ada rushes over to the instrument panel. Her hands go to
	work on an array of buttons and switches.
	
	
	
	
	Pg-81
	
	
	INT   RUNWAY   TIMELESS
	
	The multi-faceted CORRIDOR TWISTS into a new configuration
	with the RUMBLE of an "eight" on the Richter.
	
	
	INT   CUBICLE   TIMELESS
	
				ADA
			You won't come out in the same place.
			But you'll find a freight loader that
			can be accessed with...
	
				JILL
			...a blue key. I hope.
	
				ADA
			No. Pot blue or green. Red.
	
	Ada pulls a RED KEY from under her lab coat, snaps the chain
	on her neck, and holds it out to Chris.
	
				ADA (cont.)
			I took it from an Umbrella agent
			assigned to us here. He died...
			like all the rest.
	
				CHRIS
			Red... overrides green.
	
				ADA
			Yes.
	
				CHRIS
			So... you could have unlocked "D" lab.
	
				ADA
			I was hoping it would never be un-
			locked again. Go. I will see that
			this.. .(she holds up the data disk) ...
			is destroyed.
	
	Chris grabs Ada's arm and holds it tight while he wrenches
	the disk away from her.
	
	He folds it over onto itself, drops it to the floor, and
	pumps three Winchester rounds into it.
	
				CHRIS
			It's destroyed. It's worthless
			But you're not.
	
				ADA
			I helped develop it!
	
	
	
	Pg-82
	
				CHRIS
			Unwittingly. They lied to you.
			They lied to Marcus. They made
			you believe you were doing a good
			thing when it wasn't good at all.
			It was evil!
	
	Ada looks deeply into Chris' eyes.
	
				CHRIS (cont.)
			The kind of evil that... resides
			in all of us. Makes us... greedy,
			uncaring. The kind of evil that
			will... wipe us out, in the end.
			Unless we stand up against it.
	
				ADA
			Stand up? Against powers that have...
			ruled the world since before we were
			born? We will only be...eliminated.
			Or locked away someplace else. I'd
			rather die here. Knowing that the
			virus has died with me .
	
	Jill takes a step toward Ada.
	
				JILL
			What if it's already spread? You're
			the only one...who knew anything
			about it.
	
				ADA
			(The thought penetrating) But, I...
			know so little.
	 
				 CHRIS
			More than anyone else. You have...
			a responsibility.
	
				JILL
			To a higher command. The highest.
	
	She and Chris touch eyes again, this time with understanding.
	
	
	INT   "D" LAB   TIMELESS
	
	THE TYRANT flexes its monumental muscles. The ice around
	it CRACKS... but clings. The giant HEART dangling outside
	its chest PUMPS rapidly...sending fluids through exposed
	synthetic veins that run to the creature's brain.
	
				BARRY
			That's one helluva big pump.
	
	
	
	Pg-83
	
				WESKER
			An implant.
	
				BARRY
			From what? A fuckin' elephant?
	
				WESKER
			Rhinoceros.
	
				BARRY
			Shit. I figured you knew more than
			you were telling.
	
	Barry FIRES at the encased organ. His bullets bounce off the
	shielding with no effect.
	
				BARRY (cont.)
			How do we kill this thing?
	
				WESKER
			I told you, we don't. W-we can't.
			It's unstoppable!
	
	More ICE pops off the monster's pectorals.
	
	
	INT   RUNWAY   TIMELESS
	
	CLOSE ON: ADA'S face.
	
				ADA
			I don't know if I can face this.
	
	She and the ESCAPEES are no longer in the Cubicle. They're
	in the runway.
	
				CHRIS
			Just get us upstairs. I'll take
			care of it from there.
	
				ADA
			Alright. (With a sigh) Come.
	
	They break out, at the run, klacking along the faceted steel
	floor of the movable... and still moving.. .corridor.
	
	KRUNNNGGG! They're nearly knocked off their feet when the
	system suddenly STOPS DEAD.
	
	Ada slams her fist into one of those JIGSAW TILES on the
	wall. Another RED one, which glows from within.
	
	A PANEL grinds open, revealing...
	
	
	
	Pg-84
	
	INT   FREIGHT CORRIDOR   TIMELESS
	
	...a more natural-looking corridor. Half-way along, there
	are STEEL PRONGS that protrude from a wall. The group starts
	toward them...but stops when a soul-shriveling SOUND fills
	the passageway...the hungry MOANING of things that are dead.
	
				ADA
			Doors... were left open.
	
	INT   "D" LAB   TIMELESS
	
	The TYRANT BREAKS free of the last bit of restricting ice.
	WESKER FREAKS. Whimpering, he gropes with his hand that's
	outside the Plexiglas doors. He grabs something. A BOOT.
	Brad Vickers' boot. Wesker tugs on it.
	
	BARRY opens fire on the Tyrant, full bore, with his M-16.
	The stream of bullets does nothing except make the monster
	notice the big man.
	
	
	INT   FREIGHT CORRIDOR   TIMELESS
	
	THE ESCAPEES run down the corridor. SHAPES appear at the
	far end. ZOMBIES! Twenty. Thirty. Forty. More. The
	walking remains of humans who were infected in the labs,
	crawling over each other, hungry for living flesh.
	
	The humans reach the FREIGHT LOADER. Prongs, like those on
	a fork lift, extend from a heavy chain-drive that runs up
	and down through openings in the floor and ceiling.
	ADA swipes her red key through a slot and pushes a button.
	The chain-drive Grinds upward, hoisting the prongs.
	
				ADA
			Step on.
	
	Ada pushes REBECCA onto the next set of prongs that come up
	out of the floor. The footing is precarious. Rebecca has
	to hold on to the chain as she is hoisted.
	
	The lift moves slowly, eight feet separating each set of
	prongs.
	
	The ghouls continue to press in.
	
				JILL
			I don't know if it's gonna happen.
	
				RODRIGUEZ
			Come on. I been waitin' all day
			for somthin. like this.
	
	
	Pg-85
	
	Rosie opens FIRE. Chris and Jill follow suit as Ada steps
	onto the next set of prongs.
	
	Blood FLIES. Skulls SHATTER. Front ranks drop. Zombies
	from behind push their fallen comrades ahead of them. The
	corridor is like a syringe filled with corrupted bodies,
	pushing inexorably forward.
	
	Rosie, teeth gritted, keeps firing while Chris forces Jill
	onto the next set of prongs. As she rises, she hands her
	M-16 to Chris. He slings it on his arm while levering his
	old Winchester, making each of his shots count, until the
	next set of prongs rises out of the floor.
	
				CHRIS
			(To Rosie) You're up.
	
				RODRIGUEZ
			I'm havin' too much fun. You got
			a lady. I just got me. Anyway...
			I ain't gonna die in this rat hole.
			I'll make it. Get outta here.
	
	Chris hands Jill's rifle to Rosie, who fires with both hands
	as Chris jumps onto the lift.
	
	Zombies are MOWED DOWN. But more come. The syringe keeps
	pressing.
	
	The next prongs rise. Rosie steps on, still blasting..
	The first zombies reach her. Shooting down, she blows them
	away. But more come, grabbing her legs, grabbing the chains,
	ROCKING the prongs. Rosie nearly falls. She drops one of
	the rifles in order to hold on. She carefully picks off the
	most threatening zombies. Miraculously, she rises out of
	their reach, and into...
	
	
	INT   FREIGHT SHAFT   TIMELESS
	
	...a very tight, very dark SPACE with sheet metal walls that
	have been bruised by loads of freight. The rumble of the
	chain-drive ECHOES frighteningly.
	
	ABOVE ROSIE, THE OTHERS rise slowly... very slowly... feeling
	apprehensive, vulnerable. REBECCA, at the top, looks up and
	sees LIGHT spilling through an opening through which she is
	about to pass.
	
				ADA
			(Calling up to her) Level "C".
			Have your weapons ready.
	
				RODRIGUEZ
			(From below) Whoop-de-doo.
	
	
	Pg-86
	
	Rebecca's eyes rise above the floor of Level "C". All seems
	quiet... but who knows what might be lurking.
	
	
	INT "D" LAB TIMELESS
	
	THE TYRANT, still a bit sluggish, steps down from the
	platform that supported its tank. BARRY jams in a fresh
	clip and keeps firing at the thing. The Tyrant, impervious,
	stalks after the big trooper.
	
	Wesker is still on the floor, his arm through the doors,
	tugging on Vickers' boot.
	
	The flesh on Wesker's forearm is PEELED by the bumpers as
	he uses all his strength to drag Vickers' body closer...
	until the boot winds up in the opening, preventing the doors
	from closing.
	Wesker manages to pull his bloody arm free. He rushes to
	a computer console and types a request for the "T"-virus.
	
				BARRY
			Get under a desk, man. I'm gonna
			feed this thing a pineapple.
	
	Barry pulls a GRENADE from his belt.
	
				WESKER
			NO! It might damage the system!
			I've got to get this data!
	
	Wesker's M-16 has been lying, where he left it, on the
	console. He picks it up.
	
				BARRY
			Forget it. Bullets don't work!
	
	Barry is about to pull the pin on the grenade when Wesker
	triggers off A BURST...into BARRY'S GUT!
	
				WESKER
			They seem to work just fine.
	
	Barry is BLASTED across the lab.
	
	The Tyrant makes its first quick move... making us appreciate
	how fast and powerful it really is. It swipes at Barry's
	body as it flies through the air, catching it in it's steel
	claw. We hears BONES SNAP as Barry goes limp.
	
				WESKER (cont.)
			That's it. Take a little lunch
			break, Mr. "T". I just need a few
			more seconds.
	
	Pg-87
	
	The Tyrant lifts Barry's body, as if it were as light as a
	feather, up to its snout. Recognizing that the man is dead,
	the monster FLINGS him aside like so much garbage... and
	begins to lumber toward Wesker.
	
				WESKER (cont.)
			(To the computer) Come on, come on.. .
	
	A monitor reads: 90% COMPLETE...95%...98%. Wesker rests
	a finger on the button to eject a floppy.
	
	The Tyrant is getting closer by the second. Wesker FIRES
	a burst at it which only slows it for a heartbeat.
	
	100%.. .TRANSFER COMPLETED. Wesker ejects the floppy, jams
	it into his flack-jacket, and, FIRING another burst, runs
	for the door. The Tyrant has to move around desks and
	computer consoles to catch him.
	
	Wesker shoves his M-16 through the space that's being held
	open by Vickers' boot. He begins to pry the opening wider.
	A WARNING BUZZER goes off. The Tyrant dimly registers
	the sound. Its eyes dilate, like camera shutters, with
	a CLI-CLICK. It strides forward at top peed, PITCHING
	DESKS easily aside, SMASHING through a CONSOLE as if it
	were made of balsa.
	
	Wesker has pried the doors wide. The Tyrant is coming at
	him FAST. It's going to be very close.
	
	Wesker MAKES IT. He gets outside. The doors begin to glide
	shut. He LAUGHS!
	
				WESKER (cont.)
			EAT SHIT, YOU...
	
	THLANNG! The Tyrant's long, bionic CLAWS SHOOT, with the
	speed of switch-blades, through the opening, just before the
	doors meet. FOUR of the claws SKEWER WESKER, passing clean
	through him.
	
	He doesn't die instantly. He's still alive and SCREAMING
	when the Tyrant uses the same hand, with Wesker impaled on
	it, to PUSH the doors open wide again. The action causes
	WESKER'S HEAD to be SLICED OFF by one of the steel bumpers.
	The Tyrant steps out of the lab. As the doors glide shut,
	the monster holds the remainder of Wesker's body inside
	their path.
	
	The bumpers are stopped by the Tyrant's iron hand... which
	it extracts, letting the doors scrape the dead meat from
	its claws.

	INT   FREIGHT SHAFT   TIMELESS
	
	REBECCA is approaching another OPENING.
	
				ADA
			Level "B".
	
	
	INT   FREIGHT CORRIDOR   LEVEL "B"   TIMELESS
	
	THE CORRIDOR on Level "B" is long and narrow, with only
	occasional pools of LIGHT from bare, overhanging bulbs.
	REBECCA rises, like a spirit, out of the floor. She lifts
	her weapon. Her eyes dart, looking for dangers. There are
	none. The corridor, while very spooky, is quiet.
	
				REBECCA
			Don't see anything.
	
				ADA
			Good.
	
	
	INT   FREIGHT SHAFT   TIMELESS
	
	REBECCA rises through the ceiling.
	
				ADA
			We're almost there. You'll have
			to jump off. The belt won't stop.
	
	As the ECHO of Ada's voice rings off, Rebecca looks up and...
	...SCREEEE... SOMETHING dives down on her out of the darkness.
	She ducks, almost losing her balance. She clings to the
	chain as OTHER THINGS...black, relatively small.. .WHIP past
	her head.
	
				REBECCA
			Bats! There are bats in here!
	
				ADA
			No. They're crows! Infected!
			Don't let them bite you!
	
	Rebecca dodges with new urgency as the black birds dive past
	her. Looking up, she sees more coming. She aims her M-16
	and fires up the shaft. TWO BIRDS are HIT. They plummet.
	One hits ADA. She swats it aside. It drops all the way
	down to ROSIE, who JUMPS, gasping, when it hits her.
	
				RODRIGUEZ
			Rats. FLYING RATS!
	
	
	Pg-89
	
	Beneath her, Rosie sees the crows hovering in the light from
	Level "B"... They circle, then start to fly up again.
	Rosie opens fire, filling the shaft with ribbons of lead.
	Another BIRD dives from above and... SKIT... takes a chunk
	out of Rosie's cheek.
	
				RODRIGUEZ (cont.)
			AAAH ! YOU FUCKER !
	
				CHRIS
			(From above) You alright?
	
				RODRIGUEZ
			Yeah. I'm cool. I'm... cool.
	
	Rosie keeps FIRING. The deafening SOUND of her M-16 keeps
	her from hearing a...
	
	...KRATTCH...in the sheet-metal wall. A second later...
	
	...RRRRRIPPP! The metal is torn open like tissue-paper.
	
	SOMETHING dark lunges from the opening. It's the surviving
	HUNTER! One of its steel claws GRABS the chain-drive. The
	mechanism stops dead.
	
	QUICK CUTS: of THE ESCAPEES slipping, nearly falling, as they
	hang on to the chain.
	
				REBECCA
			I thought it wasn't supposed to stop.
	
				ADA
			Climb out. OUT!
	
	Rebecca has nearly reached Level "A"... She's able to hoist
	herself up, and roll to safety.
	
	Ada tries to climb. The chain is GREASY. Her hands slip.
	BELOW, the Hunter lets go of the mechanism. The chain JERKS.
	The escapees nearly lose their balance again.
	
	Rosie, at the bottom, is being lifted toward the Hunter's
	free hand. She JUMPS down. Barely catching the next set
	of prongs beneath her.
	
	AT THE TOP, Ada reaches Level "A". Rebecca catches her and
	pulls her up onto Level "A..
	
	Jill is next, rising slowly. Rebecca and Ada reach down and
	grab her arms just as... TCHUNG... the mechanism stops again.
	The Hunter has grabbed the chain again. Its free hand
	swings, clutching at Rosie, who crouches, avoiding capture.
	
	
	
	Pg-90
	
	Jill is pulled to safety. She turns and reaches down for
	Chris, who starts to climb the chain, his hands slipping on
	the grease.
	
				CHRIS
			ROSIE!?
	
				RODRIGUEZ
			I'M ALRIGHT!
	
	She's not alright. She's trapped. She can't get up past
	the Hunter. She FIRES at the thing. Bullets BOUNCE off its
	protective steel under-hide.
	
	Chris climbs three feet. Slides back two. The others reach
	down from above. Their hands come within inches, but can't
	quite catch hold of him.
	
				RODRIGUEZ (cont.)
			Here! Here, you... lizard. You
			fuckin' cockroach, HERE!
	
	Straining to reach Rosie, the hunter lets go of the chain
	for a second, then latches on again. That second lifts
	Chris to within reach of Jill and the others. They grab
	his arms. Lift him up.
	
	That second has also brought Rosie within reach of the
	Hunter. Its claws COMB her hair as she tries to duck lower
	while keeping her balance on the prongs.
	
	THWAKK! SOMETHING crashes through the wall. A MONSTROUS
	CLAW that IMPALES the Hunter. It's the claw of THE TYRANT!
	
	The chain mechanism begins to rise again. Rosie, cringing,
	is lifted past the monster just as it leans its head and
	shoulders into the shaft to examine what it has caught.
	
	Disappointed, the Tyrant SCRAPES the Hunter off its claw.
	It drops away down the shaft.
	
	The Tyrant turns its CLICKING, dilating eyes up at Rosie,
	and...TCHUNNNGG...purposely STOPS the rising chain.
	
				RODRIGUEZ (cont.)
			(Calling up) BAD NEWS, GUYS. THIS
			THING'S NOT SO STUPID!
	
				CHRIS
			(From above) Climb, Rosie!
	
				ROSIE
			No. I'm finished. I live here now.
	
				CHRIS
			ROSIE, NOOOOO!
	
	
	Pg-91
	
	Rosie DIVES off the prongs...directly at the Tyrant. With
	another lightning move, the monster catches her in its bionic
	claw, crushing her ribs. With BLOOD spurting from her mouth,
	she utters her last words...
	
				ROSIE
			EAT ME, YOU PILE OF SHIT!
	
	
	INT   LEVEL "A"   TIMELESS
	
	ADA is the most pragmatic.
	
				ADA
			Come.
	
				CHRIS
			ROSIE ...
	
				ADA
			COME! You convinced me that there
			were...larger matters. We're at the
			top. You said you'd get us out.
	
	Ada's words snap Chris back into the urgency of their
	situation. He struggles to his feet.
	
				CHRIS
			Th-this way.
	
	They are in the MANSION, which Chris knows well. He leads
	his small troop into...
	
	INT   POWDER ROOM   TIMELESS
	
	...a small powder room, decorated garishly in an East Indian
	motif. A ceramic TIGER'S HEAD sits atop a vanity. CHRIS
	grabs it...and TWISTS it on a pivot. A PANEL spins. The
	COMMODE disappears into the wall, opening a SECRET PASSAGE.
	
				REBECCA
			Hell of a shit-house.
	
				JILL
			The guy was a bootlegger... with
			a sense of humor.
	
	Chris leads the other into...
	
	
	INT   CLOCK ROOM   TIMELESS
	
	...a small, blank CHAMBER. The only thing it holds is a
	GRANDFATHER CLOCK .
	
	
	
	Pg-92
	
				CHRIS
			I hope they haven't disabled this.
	
	CHRIS opens the door that covers the clock face. He quickly
	spins the hands until they hit... HIGH NOON.
	
	GRONNNK! A WALL begins to GRIND open, straining against
	rust, dirt, from years of idleness. Cobwebs are pulled
	apart and...DAYLIGHT APPEARS!
	
				CHRIS (cont.)
			Alright. We made it.
	
	Chris urges the OTHERS out through the opening. At the same
	time he checks the detonator. The LED is down to SIX MINUTES
	and counting.
	
	INT   HUEY   DAY
	
	At the controls of his helicopter, LAGUARDIA spots something.
	
	
	EXT   MANSION   HUEY'S POV   DAY
	
	REBECCA, then ADA, then JILL climbing onto the lawn.
	
	
	INT   HUEY   DAY
	
				LAGUARDIA
			I'm goin' in.
	
				RADIO MAN
			You don't have authority.
	
				LAGUARDIA
			Fuck authority.
	
	
	EXT   MANSION   YARD   DAY
	
	...CHRIS climbs out of the secret exit. THE OTHERS, having
	spotted the incoming chopper, are waving at it. There's a
	sense of relief, of salvation. Only Chris notices...
	
	...a bit of PLASTER falling away from one of the mansion's
	stone walls.
	
				CHRIS
			Watch it. WATCH IIIIT!
	
	KER-AAAASSSSHHH! THE TYRANT BURSTS through the wall. With
	superhuman speed, it ATTACKS the escapees, who run, dodge,
	barely escaping the WHISHING SWIPE of its iron claw.
	
	
	
	Pg-93
	
	INT   HUEY   DAY
	
				RADIO
			What in God's name is that thing!
	
				LAGUARDIA
			Somethin' we weren't supposed to
			see. Drop the ladder. And drop
			the Stinger.
	
	EXT   MANSION   YARD   DAY
	
	THE HUEY swoops down as low as safety will allow. A faceted
	aluminum LADDER unfurls.
	
				CHRIS
			GET UP!
	
	CHRIS pushes JILL toward the ladder. She pulls on Ada's arm
	and sends her up first. ADA begins to climb. Then REBECCA.
	
	The Tyrant closes in, SWIPING at Chris, who just manages to
	avoid the SLICE of its mighty claw.
	
	The RADIO MAN leans out of the door above, holding something.
	
				RADIO MAN
			Catch this!
	
	Chris doesn't hear. Jill does.
	
				JILL
			Toss it to me!
	
	The radio man drops the Stinger...a rocket with a shoulder-
	launcher.. .down into Jill's hands.
	
	Chris hits the dirt. The Tyrant tries to crush him by
	stepping on him. Chris rolls away.
	
	The ladder is too wobbly. Jill can't be sure of launching
	an accurate shot.
	
				JILL (cont.)
			CHRIS!
	
	Chris looks up. Sees Jill holding the rocket launcher. He
	RUNS past the Tyrant, okey-doking, left, right, then dodging
	left again. The monster SWIPES at him with its elongated
	claw. Chris' flack-jacket is caught. Protective fibers fly.
	But Chris escapes without injury.
	
	
	
	
	Pg-94
	
	Jill pitches the weapon. Chris catches it. The Tyrant is
	on him, about to STOMP him with a bionic FOOT when...
	
	...Chris aims at the monster's rhinoceros heart and FIRES!
	
	The rocket CONNECTS, on target. The casing around the animal
	heart EXPLODES... and the Tyrant drops like a giant Redwood...
	
	...on top of Chris's legs.
	
	As Chris tries to free himself, he checks the detonator.
	THREE MINUTES. TWO-FIFTY-NINE. EIGHT. SEVEN. SIX.
	
	LaGuardia drops his chopper a bit lower. The bottom of the
	ladder hits the ground, coming within Chris' reach. He grabs
	on. The helicopter rises again. Chris is pulled out from
	under the Tyrant's steel body and is LIFTED into the air.
	He climbs frantically.
	
	Above him, Jill is still on the ladder as well. Ada and
	Rebecca pull her up. Chris DANGLES as the Huey banks away
	over the forest. The tops of TREES whip his legs, but he
	hangs on, climbing up... up... until the others catch his
	hands and hoist him into the chopper. Chris checks the LED.
	ONE MINUTE, FORTY-FIVE SECONDS.
	
				JILL
			(Reading over Chris' shoulder) We
			have to get out of range.
	
				CHRIS
			No. (To the pilot) Circle around.
			
				LAGUARDIA
			Are there more survivors?
	
				CHRIS
			No. Just...circle, okay? I want
			to...take a last look.
	
	The Huey banks into a circle. Chris looks down at...
	
	
	EXT   AERIAL POV   DAY
	
	...the MANSION. And just over the hills...HIS FARM.
	
	
	INT   HUEY   DAY
	
				JILL
			It's... your home.
	
	CHRIS looks at her, with a resigned smile.
	
	
	
	
	Pg-95
				CHRIS
			I hoped... it would be our home.
	
				JILL
			I guess... we're gonna be moving.
	
	Chris checks the LED. THIRTY-EIGHT SECONDS.
	
				CHRIS
			(To the pilot) Full throttle.
			Out of here, man!
	
	LaGuardia pushes his stick. The Huey LUNGES forward at
	top speed. REBECCA, ADA and JILL are pressed back by
	inertia. Chris holds himself erect. Through the window,
	in the receding sky, he spots...
	
	...AN EAGLE, riding the wind.
	
	CUT TO:
	
	EXT   THE ARKLEY FOREST   THE MANSION   DAY
	
	PLOOOOMMMMM! The GROUND ERUPTS from an enormous under-
	ground explosion. The MANSION is reduced to particulate
	as the shock-wave spreads outward.
	
	
	EXT   FARM   DAY
	
	Chris' farm hand, RAKE, is shambling out of the house, a
	ZOMBIE... when the EXPLOSIVE FORCE HITS, tearing him APART.
	
	
	EXT   RACCOON CITY   DAY
	
	The TOWN is EMPTY...except for NINE LONELY FIGURES, lumbering
	down Main Street. They, too...are ZOMBIES. The hot wave
	HITS. Two are VAPORIZED. FIRE engulfs two more. The BRAINS
	of two others are DESTROYED by flying debris.. .
	
	...which catches the remaining three, as well. Arms are
	torn off. Iron shafts from shattered plumbing, shards of
	window glass, slats from picket fences... PUNCH through
	necks, chests, bellies...
	
	...but the dead things, their skulls undamaged,
	through billows of dust... drooling hungrily.
	
	THE SCREEN GOES BLACK.

	PRESENTATION CREDITS appear... then FADE...
	
	Out of BLACK... SHOCK CUT TO:
	
	INT   LAB   "A" LEVEL   TIMELESS
	
	A MAN'S FACE, filling the screen.
	
				MARCUS (filter)
			Stay away from here!
	
	We're watching A VIDEO MONITOR. A pre-recorded tape shows
	a view of what is obviously a pristine-RESEARCH LABORATORY.
	DR. JOHN MARCUS, in a lab coat, faces THE CAMERA, disheveled
	and looking like a madman.
	
				MARCUS (cont. filter)
			This lab must remain sealed!
	
	INT   CONFERENCE ROOM   TIMELESS
	
	Overhead lamps cast pools of LIGHT down onto A CONFERENCE
	TABLE, onto THE HANDS of PEOPLE assembled to observe the
	video. We see NO FACES. But expensive WATCHES, sleeves
	with high-ranking STRIPES, indicate wealth, power, and a
	military presence.
	
	THE VIDEO: On the wall behind MARCUS, we see SHADOWS darting
	frantically. We hear VOICES rising in panic.
	
				MARCUS (cont. Filter)
			For God's sake, don't come in!
	
	The CAMERA is SWATTED by A HAND that lurches suddenly into
	the foreground. We only see it for a few video frames, but
	we might subliminally notice LESIONS on the flesh. The IMAGE
	SWIRLS wildly. The next clear picture we see... is of the
	same laboratory...topsy-turvy. THE CAMERA is lying on its
	side on the floor.
	
				VOICE IN THE ROOM (o.s.)
			Look.  Here.
	
	A LASER POINTER casts a RED DOT on a corner of the video
	screen, indicating A HUNCHED FIGURE, leaning over A HUMAN
	BODY, apparently ...feeding! With a GRUNT, the figure turns.
	and LUNGES, it's face covered with BLOOD, at the CAMERA. The
	image SWIRLS again, and the SCREEN GOES BLACK. With a MUSIC
	STING, a single TITLE appears, full across the blackness...
	
			        RESIDENT EVIL
	
	
	Pg-2
	
	EXT  FOREST LAND   PRE-DAWN
	
	A DARK SKY ...and in the foreground, profiled against a FULL
	MOON, A DARK FACE ...watching the heavens with piercing black
	eyes, alert, though not predatory. This is CHRIS REDFIELD,
	young, handsome. More than simply an outdoor type, he seems
	perfectly in place, almost part of the environment.
	
	A band of purple tints the horizon, outlining the tops of
	magnificent uncorrupted hills that extend for miles. Sitting
	on a ridge, squinting into that band of light, Chris sees ...
	
	...AN EAGLE coasting on a channel of wind that cuts through
	the hilltops. As the bird moves swiftly closer, it becomes
	recognizable. Chris smiles and jots a note on a pad.
	
	The regal bird lands on a high rock where ...unexpectedly...
	a freshwater trout lies flapping, three-thousand feet above
	the highest water.
	
				CHRIS
			Take it, Goliath. It's yours.
	
	"Goliath" snaps up the fish and flies away with it.
	
				CHRIS (cont.)
			See ya next year, guy.
	
	Chris reaches into a water-filled bucket, pulls out another
	trout, climbs efficiently, unerringly, across a precarious
	Cliffside, and deposits the fresh fish on the-same high rock.
	ANOTHER EAGLE, smaller, a female, appears in the sky.
	
				CHRIS (cont.)
			Cleopatra.
	
	Chris scrambles back to his place and jots another note.
	
	"Cleopatra" spots the fish, pumps her wings, and swoops down.
	She's about to snap up the prize, but at the last minute, she
	recoils and climbs again, hovering.
	
				CHRIS (cont.)
			Come on. Come on down.
	
	The eagle circles, its sharp eyes scanning. It makes another
	dive, but stops short again.
	
				CHRIS (cont.)
			What's the matter, beautiful?
	
	The bird seems frightened.  Of what? It makes one more dive.
	Gets very close to the fish... but suddenly SHRIEKS and peels,
	away from the rock. Chris sees its eyes, looking crazed, as
	it soars right past him, its wings brushing his hair.
	
	
	Pg-3
	
	CLOSE ON: CHRIS, concerned, as he watches the eagle disappear
	over the hills.
	
	Over his shoulder, we can see the high rock that holds the
	fish. It's out of focus in the background, but the moonlight
	catches SOMETHING MOVING there. Something that lets out a
	sharp INHUMAN SOUND.
	
	Chris whirls around. There's nothing on the rock. Nothing
	at all. The fish has been taken.
	
	
	INT   JILL'S APARTMENT   DAWN
	
	CHRIS walks into a characterless apartment. He quietly
	sheds his clothes. Even in silhouette, we can see that his
	body is in perfect shape, not pumped, but lean and tight.
	Moving lithely, with the natural grace of a cat, he eases
	himself into a bed where...
	
	...a beautiful young girl, JILL VALENTINE, seems to be fast
	asleep. As Chris nestles in beside her, we see that her
	eyes, facing away, are open. Chris gently drapes an arm
	around her and lets his body relax.
	
				CHRIS
			(A whisper) Glad you're still 
			here, lady
	
				JILL
			It's my apartment.
	
				CHRIS
			(Surprised) You're awake.
	
				JILL
			I've been awake. Since you left.
	
				CHRIS
			Sorry.
	
	His apology goes no further. He's still troubled by what
	happened in the hills.
	
				CHRIS (cont.)
			There was... something wrong.
	
				JILL
			What, with my dinner? I never had
			a mother. I'll learn.
	
	Chris smiles politely. He offers...
	
				CHRIS
			I'll do the cooking.
	
	
	Pg-4
	
	...but he can't switch focus.
	
				CHRIS (cont.)
			On the mountain...there...must
			have been something... prowling
			around up there.
	
				JILL
			There are probably all kinds of
			things prowling around up there.
			In the middle of the night.
	
	Chris apologizes again, this time more sincerely.
	
				CHRIS
			I'm sorry. Really. You...have to
			be there at dawn. They ride the
			wind over the ridge.
	
				JILL
			Dawn? You left at one A.M.
	
				CHRIS
			I had to go fishing. It's the fish
			that bring them down, so I can get
			a close look at them. (Enthused)
			I've tracked a dozen of them, Jill.
			Twelve of those big bruisers. I can
			actually recognize them. I've even
			given them names, over the years.
	
				JILL
			You've been doing this for years?
	
				CHRIS
			Only in the early Autumn. When
			they're' migrating.
	
				JILL
			I'II set the alarm for next. October.
	
	Jill rolls over and faces him.
	
				JILL (cont.)
			I wish I could get excited. Really.
			That's the truth. As excited as you,
			over such... simple things.
	
				CHRIS
			Beauty... isn't simple. If it was...
			I'd be beautiful.
	
				JILL
			You are.
	
	Pg-5
	
				CHRIS
			No, no, no.  I'm simple.  You, on the
			other hand...(nuzzling closer)...have
			all that... stuff... hiding underneath
			somewhere. That's what fascinates me.
	
				JILL
			Fascination. Not love?
	
	Jill is being playful. Chris, taking her question to heart,
	becomes introspective.
	
				CHRIS
			I... honestly don't know. I guess
			I've been... living alone too long.
			You're the first, the only woman I've
			ever thought of as... a real partner.
	
	Now Jill becomes introspective.
	
				JILL
			I've always been...afraid of living
			alone. I've always had... people...
			talking at me... knowing they could
			wind me up and I'd do... (shrug) ...
			whatever they wanted.
	
	Chris looks into her eyes. She kisses him gently.
	
				JILL (cont.)
			We all have... something hidden...
			underneath.  Beauty may not be simple.
			But it's not all that complicated,
			Either.  Most of the time, you find
			It... right in the middle of all the...
			confusion.
	
				CHRIS
			I'm part Mohawk. Indians are never
			confused. At least, they never let
			it show.
	
	They kiss again, this time more passionately. Rolling over,
	they begin to make love.
	
	EXT   FARM   DAWN
	The purple horizon is turning orange, but it's still quite
	dark when a crusty old farm-hand, RAKE, opens the creaking
	door of a stable and, with a flashlight, leads THREE HORSES
	out into the morning breeze.
	
	Two dogs, A LAB and A SPANIEL, romp at his heels as Rake
	opens a log gate.
	
	Pg-6
	-
	Two of the untethered horses trot obediently into a large
	corral. The third, a beautiful stallion, resists, snorting,
	tossing its head in high spirit.
	
				RAKE
			Get in there, Lucky. Quit horsin'
			around. Get in.
	
	"LUCKY" moves into the corral, strutting proudly.
	
				RAKE (cont.)
			Swear. If I didn't know you was
			just an animal, I'd say you was all
			full of yourself. GET IN THERE!
	
	Rake waves his flashlight, not meanly, there is clearly a
	great deal of affection here. Rake shuts the gate behind
	the stallion, who begins to gallop around happily inside
	the fence. All seems lovely, until...
	
	...the dogs suddenly go on point. Their ears perk. They
	sniff the air...and begin to WHINE.
	
				RAKE (cont.)
			What's wrong with you two?
	
	KER-RAAKK! A startling SOUND. Rake turns to find Lucky and
	the other horses, their eyes flaring, trying to KICK their
	way out of the fencing. They seem terrified.
	
	CUT TO :
	
	A WIDE SHOT:  of RAKE, and the frightened ANIMALS, from
	two hundred yards away. THE CAMERA MOVES IN, slowly at
	first, then gaining speed... extraordinary SPEED. We are
	seeing THROUGH THE EYES OF... whatever it is that's running,
	charging, SLATHERING HUNGRILY...
	
	...reaching the corral, DARTING through the fence, past the
	KICKING HORSES, and LEAPING at Rake, who whirls around...and
	CRIES OUT in pain as his flashlight BLINDS us with WHITENESS.
	
	EXT   AIR BASE   DAWN
	
	The WHITENESS becomes the GLARE of HALOGEN LIGHTS. We are
	overwhelmed by the SOUND of AIRCRAFT ENGINES. We see MEN,
	armed SOLDIERS, scrambling into combat HELICOPTERS.
	
	A RADIO MAN runs right toward THE CAMERA, holding out an
	open receiver.
	
				RADIO MAN
			Top brass, sir!
	
	
	Pg-7
	
	ANOTHER MAN, in the foreground, takes the radio-phone. We
	can't see his face. Only his forearm, which bears A TATTOO
	of a grinning SKULL.
	
				MAN WITH TATTOO
			Alpha Leader.
	
				VOICE ON PHONE (o.s. filter)
			How long before you get in there?
	
				MAN WITH TATTOO
			Fifteen minutes.
	
	INT   AN OFFICE   DAWN
	
	A SUIT talks on a red telephone. Once again, we see no face.
	An ostentatious diamond RING kicks light as the man snips off
	the end off a Monte Cristo.
	
				MAN WITH RING
			You're good, soldier. But not that
			good. It's five hundred miles away.
			In the backwoods of Pennsylvania.
	
				MAN WITH TATTOO (o.s. filter)
			We have troopers on site. A first-
			strike force. Under cover.
	
	The flame from a wooden match lights the Monte Cristo.
	
				MAN WITH RING
			Very resourceful.  You have my
			permission activate them.
	
	EXT   AIR BASE   DAWN
	
				MAN WITH TATTOO
			I've already done that. You have my
			permission... to say that you gave me
			permission.
	
	THE TATTOOED MAN runs off to join the other SOLDIERS.
	
	INT   JILL'S APARTMENT   MORNING
	
	CHRIS sleeps. JILL is awake, deep in thought, when...
	
	...BRRRRT! It's not a ring, it's a vibration. Jill reaches
	down and extracts something small and black, the size of a
	box of Tic-Tacs, from one of her shoes. She gets out of bed,
	checking to see that Chris is still asleep, and moves into...
	
	
	Pg-8
	
	INT   JILL'S APARTMENT   BATHROOM   MORNING
	
	...a bathroom. Closing the door behind her, she puts the
	small box to her ear, extracts a wire from it, with a tiny
	microphone on its tip, and...
	
				JILL
			(Softly) Valentine.
	
	We can't hear the voice that speaks to her.
	
				JILL (cont.)
			If this is just another a drill,
			I'll strangle you. (She listens)
			Shit. Give me the activation code.
	
	JILL pulls a small ENVELOPE from a toiletry bag. She breaks
	open a wax seal...and takes out a thick paper on which is
	printed... 29-RC-6735.
	
				JILL (cont.)
			(Gaping, not believing) Th-that's
			a match. (Beat) I'm on my way.
	
	Jill clicks off. She dumps something else from the envelope
	into her hand... A BLUE PLASTIC CARD, the size of a Visa,
	blank except for a mag-stripe. There's a small hole in one
	corner, through which a chain is strung. Jill slings the
	chain over head, wearing the blue card like a pendant.
	
	INT   JILL'S APARTMENT   MORNING
	
	CHRIS is still asleep. JILL comes out of the bathroom and
	looks down at him longingly.  Should she wake him?  Tell him
	what's happening?  She wants to, but duty prevents it.  She
	pulls herself away.
	
	INT   JILL'S APARTMENT   CLOSET   MORNING
	
	TCHIK TCHIK TCHIK...JILL pushes aside hangers which hold her
	clothes. She types numbers into a hidden KEYPAD. A SECRET
	PANEL OPENS, revealing a CLOSET WITHIN THE CLOSET, packed
	with COMBAT UNIFORMS and WEAPONS.
	
	INT   JILL'S APARTMENT   MORNING
	
	The sound... TCHUNG... of the front door closing snaps CHRIS
	awake.  His first thought is for his lover.  He reaches out
	and finds that... she's not in bed.  He jumps up, rushes to
	a window, looks down, from the second story, and sees...
	
	
	Pg-9
	
	EXT   JILL'S APARTMENT   MORNING
	
	...JILL, heavily ARMED, in UNIFORM, wearing a beret that has
	an insignia... S.T.A.R.S. She rushes down the front path and
	jumps into A HUMMER with THREE OTHER TROOPERS on board. The
	vehicle pulls instantly away...
	
	...leaving Chris, looking through the window, puzzled, angry,
	and very much wounded.
	
	
	INT/EXT   HUMMER   MORNING
	
	RUSSO drives. WILLIAMS and DISIMONE sit in the back, all
	tough Special-Forces types. JILL, in the front passenger
	seat, though the only female, ranks the highest.
	
				DISIMONE
			Another practice run, right?
	
				RUSSO
			We been practicin' six months!
			For what?
	
				JILL
			For this. This is the real deal.
	
				WILLIAMS
			Honest to God?
	
				JILL
			Based on my experience, Williams,
			God isn't always honest
	
				DISIMONE
			Where we goin'?
	
				JILL
			In there.
	
	Jill points into THE ARKLEY FOREST which lies ahead. Miles
	of old growth-trees shrouded in a ghostly morning mist.
	
	DISSOLVE TO:
	
	EXT   THE FOREST   MORNING
	
	DEEP IN THE HEART OF THE MIST... THE HUMMER bounces over
	non-roads and stops fifty yards from...
	
	...A PAIR OF IRON GATES, each wrought with the letter "A".
	Beyond, the shifting fog offers momentary glimpses of...
	A MANSION.  Huge.  Like Xandau.  THE TROOPERS, amazed,
	climb out and approach the gates.
	
	Pg-10
	
				RUSSO
			If you had the jing to build a place
			like this, would you build it in the
			middle of fuckin' nowhere?
	
				WILLIAMS
			Paris.
	
				DISIMONE
			Manhattan. Upper west.
	
				JILL
			(Wistfully) Some people prefer...
			a quiet life. (Back to business)
			Our orders are to secure the area.
	
				DISIMONE
			From what? This area's been 'secure'
			since the French and Indian War!
	
	A deep, animal SNARL comes from the woods.  The troopers
	raise their weapons as they peer into the underbrush.  The
	fog keeps sunlight from penetrating.  The forest is a maze
	of dark shadows. Leaves flutter.  Limbs SNAP.  Then...
	
	DARK SHAPES can be seen moving, circling.  A half-dozen
	of them.  Maybe more.  Jill whips out a transmitter and
	quickly types an access code.
	
				JILL
			(Into radio) This is Valentine,
			Bravo Team. We, er... we might be
			in trouble, here.
	
	KRITCH! Something LEAPS out of the brush. Automatic
	WEAPONS SPIT reflexively.
	
	KRITCH KRITCH KRITCH...more lunging SHAES appear. The
	troopers scatter, firing, as they are attacked from all
	sides. Jill dives for the shrubbery, shouting into her
	transmitter.
	
				JILL (cont.)
			WE ARE IN TROUBLE!
	
	CUT TO :
	
	INT   HUEY   MORNING
	
	JILL'S VOICE stutters over a headset which is pressed against
	A MAN'S EAR.
	
				JILL (o.s. filter)
			Under attack... by.. .assailants...
			Unidentifi...
	
	Pg-11
	
	Static. Hissing air. The SHOT WIDENS as the man lowers his
	headset. First we see the TATTOO on his arm... a grinning
	SKULL which we recognize. Then, gradually, we see his face.
	Lean and mean, wearing dark sunglasses, this is ALBERT
	WESKER, a hard-assed career officer.
	
				WESKER
			Can you get a trace?
	
	The pilot, LAGUARDIA, responds.
	
				LAGUARDIA
			Lost the beacon. It just cut out.
			Like it was...swallowed by something.
	
	Oddly, Wesker smiles.
	
				WESKER
			I do believe, gentlemen...that we're
			gonna be earning some combat pay.
	
	There are three other MEN on board. The closest to Wesker
	is BARRY BURTON, a muscular black man, as big as a grizzly,
	with the heart of a Teddy.
	
				BARRY
			Damn, if you don't love a fight.
	
				WESKER
			Hey, if I didn't... you'd be a dead
			man. (To the pilot) Call in a nine-
			nine. I want Raccoon City e-vacked.
	
	Wesker and the men fly from the lens.  THE CAMERA passes
	Out through one of the helicopter's windows as the chopper soars
	away.  When the SHOT WIDENS, we see OTHER HUEYS...black,
	unmarked, keeping formation.  Three... six...ten of them.
	
	EXT   FOREST   MORNING
	
	GUNS BLAZE. THE TROOPERS are under assault by thrashing,
	inhuman SHAPES...GROWLING, SNAPPING. JILL rolls into a
	natural trench.  DISIMONE is behind her, WILLIAMS is
	crawling just ahead, his legs pumping.  Jill scoots past
	him and sees that...
	
	...those legs aren't moving on their own.  They've been
	RIPPED AWAY FROM WILLIAMS' TORSO and are being dragged into
	the underbrush by some... BEAST... concealed in the thick
	brush, so we never get a clear look at it.
	
	OTHER BEASTS attack DiSimone.  Then Russo.  We see only
	details.  Jill fires her pistol, point blank... to no avail.
	RED-RIMMED EYES, SNARLING JAWS, DROOLING TEETH descend on
	her as we CUT TO:
	
	
	Pg-12
	
	EXT   JILL'S APARTMENT BUILDING   MORNING
	
	CHRIS steps out of Jill's building. Suddenly, incongruously,
	camo-painted HUEYS swoop down out of the sky.
	
	EXT   RACCOON CITY   MAIN STREET   MORNING
	
	THE CHOPPERS land where they can. COMMANDOS leap out and
	begin to cordon off the town.  Bullhorns blare.
	
	BULLHORN
	There's been an accident in the
	hills nearby. A military aircraft,
	carrying live weapons, has crashed...
	
	EXT   RACCOON CITY   SIDE STREET   MORNING
	
	CHRIS runs down a side-street into AN ALLEY, where he's
	trapped by COMMANDOS, both in front and behind.
	
				SOLDIER
			Let's go, hayseed. (Aiming his M-16)
			You gonna be a good boy?
	
	Chris swallows his fury. Gritting his teeth, he goes along
	with the soldiers, prodded, by rifle barrels, out onto...
	
	EXT   RACCOON CITY  MAIN STREET   MORNING
	
	...Main Street, where there is CHAOS... an Orwellian sight,
	as CITIZENS find themselves horded into helicopters and
	TRUCKS from the local National Guard Post.
	
	A sweating man, still in his pajamas, rushes up to the
	SOLDIERS that are escorting CHRIS.
	
				MAN
			Look here, I'm the Sheriff of this...
	
				SOLDIER
			Step aside.
	
				SHERIFF
			But, I'm the Sheriff! An ex-Army man, like you.
	
				BULLHORN (o.s.)
			There is no immediate danger, but
			as a precaution, we are evacuating
			the area. You will be provided
			shelter until the weapons have been
			removed from the crash site.
	
	Pg-13
	
				SHERRIFF
			That's a worn-out scenario. If
			a plane crashed nearby, don't you
			think somebody would have heard
			it go down? Tell us the truth,
			guys. What's this really about?
	
				SOLDIER
			I said, STEP ASIDE!
	
	The soldier lifts his rifle. He's about to CLUB the sheriff
	when Chris lunges, grabbing his arm. WHOOMPH! Chris kicks
	the soldier in the balls. The man buckles. Chris bolts.
	
	One of the other commandos FIRES at him, a loud BURST which
	misses Chris but SHATTERS a shop window, setting off wild
	PANIC on the street. Chris ducks into a building...
	
	EXT   RACCOON CITY   BACK STREET   MORNING
	
	...and out a rear door. He runs through a warren of back
	alleyways, arriving at...
	
	...A JEEP SAHARA which is parked behind Jill's apartment
	building. He jumps in without opening the door, jams the key
	into the ignition, and ROARS off.
	
	INT   HUEY   MORNING
	
	Still airborne, in one of the black helicopters that have yet
	to reach the site, WESKER barks orders into a radio.
	
				WESKER
			Charlie, David, Edward, proceed to
			Raccoon City. Assist the e-vack.
			I'm going on target with Alpha Team.
			All forces stand ready to support.
	
	EXT   FARM   MORNING
	
	CHRIS rumbles his jeep onto a picturesque FARM, secluded deep
	in the forest. We don't recognize it immediately. It was
	dark when we last saw the place.
	
	Jumping out, Chris sees three large SHAPES lying in the grass
	of a corral. Rushing over, Chris realizes...
	
	...they're HORSES. One of them is LUCKY, his prize
	stallion... DEAD, in a pool of BLOOD, with its belly torn
	open and a huge chunk out of its neck.
	
				CHRIS
			Aw, no... (Devastated) ...L-Lucky.
	
	
	Pg-14
	
	Chris hears a weak, MOANING SOUND. He turns and sees...
	RAKE, lying near a water pump. Chris rushes to the man's
	side and finds him brutally SLASHED, barely clinging to life.
	
				RAKE
			(Coughing blood) They... they come
			outta the trees, Reddy. Don't... don't
			know what they was. Figure... maybe
			some kinda... wolves, or somethin' ...
	
	Examining the man's wounds, Chris realizes they're fatal.
	
				RAKE
			I... I never seen 'em comin'.
	
				CHRIS
			Don't try to talk, Rake.
	
				RAKE (cont.)
			I... ain't... never left this farm...
			untended... since yer daddy first
			took it over.
	
				CHRIS
			I know. You... kept the place runnin'...
			better than me.
	
				RAKE
			I just...never seen 'em comin', Reddy.
			Never even...had a chance to...turn
			a gun on 'em.
	
	There's a THUNDER in the sky. Chris looks up. Wesker's
	Fleet of black HUEYS appears on the horizon.  They split up,
	Seven banking off toward Raccoon City, the remaining three
	grinding ahead over the forest, slowing down, dropping in
	altitude.
	
				CHRIS
			Where are they going? There's
			nothing in there... except...
	
				RAKE
			Y'oughta... remember it... real good.
			I do.  From... when you was a kid.
	
				CHRIS
			The... the old Arkley place?
	
				RAKE
			I remember them days. I surely do...
			Remember them... them old days.
	
	Chris looks back down at the old man, who is drifting,
	starting to lose it.
	
	Pg-15
	
				CHRIS (cont.)
			I'm not gonna bullshit you, Rake.
			You're...in a bad time. If there's
			any way to save you, I'll find it,
			I swear. You just... hang in there,
			old guy. I'll be right back.
	
	Chris jumps to his feet and runs into...
	
	INT   FARMHOUSE   MORNING
	
	...the great-room of the FARMHOUSE. Rustic. Cozy. CHRIS
	snatches up a telephone. There's no dial-tone. The line
	is dead. Chris rushes to a gun cabinet and pulls out an old
	WINCHESTER rifle. He scoops ammo from a drawer into a
	shoulder bag and runs back outside...
	
	EXT   FARM   MORNING
	
	...where his eyes catch MOVEMENT in the corral. LUCKY,
	entrails spilling, is trying to stand.
	
				CHRIS
			Oh, God, Rake. Oh, Jesus, the poor thing's still alive.
	
	Chris shoulders his ammo bag, reaches inside, and quickly
	reloads the Winchester. Stepping forward, he aims carefully.
	
				CHRIS (cont.)
			Sorry, old hoss.
	
	
	BLAM!  A clean shot to the horse's brain drops the animal.
	
	It takes Chris a long moment to recover... then, he looks into
	the trees. The helicopters are no longer in sight, but their
	THUNDER remains.  They haven't landed yet.
	
	Chris turns and rushes back to Rake's side, only to find...
	...he has died. Chris' jaws tighten, but he has no time
	to mourn. He closes Rake's eyes. Digs through the grass.
	Pulls up a handful of dirt. Stuffs it into the old man's
	hand, and closes his stiffening fingers over it.
	
				CHRIS (cont.)
			The earth keeps us.
	
	Conquering his emotions, Chris runs to his jeep and jumps in.
	He shifts into four-wheel-drive and, ignoring the road, heads
	straight over the field for the trees.
	
	As the jeep disappears, THE CAMERA CRANES DOWN, ZOOMING
	IN ON...
	
	Pg-16
	
	...one of the farm dogs. The SPANIEL. Not the entire
	animal, but one of its three SEPARATE PARTS... it's front
	end... CRUSHED head, BLOODY neck, and a single BROKEN paw...
	
	...which is trying to CRAWL.
	
	Fifty yards away, RAKE'S HAND relaxes. The earth spills out
	through his fingers as the dead man's eyes... POP OPEN.
	
	EXT   ARKLEY FOREST   MORNING
	
	THE FIRST OF THE BLACK HUEYS drops, hazardously, into a
	small clearing with barely enough space. Unable to land
	on the scrub-brush, it hovers ten feet off the ground. Its
	rotors CLIP TREE LEAVES as WESKER, BARRY, and TWO OTHER
	S.T.A.R.S. COMMANDOS jump out, heavily armed. The chopper
	lifts off, placed by HUEY NUMBER TWO.
	
	NOT FAR AWAY, CHRIS navigates through undergrowth until he
	can see THE HELICOPTERS through the trees. The THUNDER from
	their rotors masks the grinding of Chris' jeep. He pulls
	within a hundred yards and, leaving his vehicle in the bush,
	moves closer, cautiously, on foot.
	
	THE THIRD HUEY air-drops TWO MEN and TWO WOMEN in S.T.A.R.S.
	uniforms. There are TWELVE COMMANDOS in all... ALPHA TEAM.
	Wesker looks up at the Huey's PILOT, using his radio to speak
	to the man.
	
				WESKER
			You'll have to rotate or you'll run
			out of fuel, but I want one chopper
			to remain in the air at all times.
			We might need help in a hurry.
	
	A "Roger that", squaks back as the Huey banks away.
	
	Barry looks worried. His instincts are asking... "We might
	need... 'help'".  Against what? We only see this in his eyes,
	he says nothing as...
	
	...Wesker leads the team through the woods, unaware of...
	
	...CHRIS, following behind, crouching around trees and
	bushes, not a trained commando, but comfortable with the
	land, a natural warrior using ancestral instincts.
	
	THE CAMERA TRACKS COMBAT BOOTS as they CRUNCH through the
	low-Lying MIST.. .stopping abruptly when they encounter...
	
	...WEAPONS, AMMO BELTS, bits of SHRDDED UNIFORMS... and
	HUMAN BODY PARTS... strewn all through the surrounding brush,
	remnants of what was obviously a feeding-frenzy.
	
	
	Pg-17
	
				VICKERS
			Holy... Goh... gaah...
	
	BRAD VICKERS vomits. Unarmed, he's Alpha Team's computer-
	techie. Not a combat soldier, he's a bit of a coward.
	
	Another non-combatant, REBECCA CHAMBERS, is the team's
	medical officer. She digs an ammonia capsule from her
	pack and holds it under Vickers' nose.
	
	RICHARD AIKEN and KENNETH SULLIVAN are buddies, regular
	G.I. Joes, right out of every war movie. Aiken stares at
	the carnage, calmly chewing a wad of gum.
	
				AIKEN
			You ever eat road-kill, Sullivan?
	
				SULLIVAN
			Aiken... a guy with a brain your
			size would be better off dead.
	
				RODRIGUEZ (o.s.)
			Want me to shoot ya, Aiken?
	
	ROSIE RODRIGUEZ, a tough, body-built babe steps in.
	
				RODRIGUEZ (cont.)
			I'm ready ta shoot somebody.
	
				ALKEN
			I'll pass. Shoot Sullivan.
	
	FOREST SPEYER, a wiry Willem Defoe type, finds a bloody BERET
	and brings it to Wesker.  There's an I.D. tag on the brim...
	
				WESKER
			(Reading the tag) 'Valentine'. (Beat)
			Radio Washington.  Bravo Team found
			on site. No survivors.
	
	In the bushes, Chris overhears, not wanting to believe. He
	sees Wesker angrily pitch Jill's beret into the brush.
	
				WESKER
			We're goin' in.  Watch your backs.
	
	Wesker advances his troops. When the coast is clear, Chris
	rushes in, picks up the beret, and sees the name tag for
	himself. "Valentine ".
	
	After what happened at the farm... now this... feeling sucker-
	punched, defeated, Chris hangs his head.
	
	One of the HUEYS dips in low.
	
	
	Pg-18
	
	Chris looks up. The sight of the war machine lifts him from
	defeat... to rage.  His eyes are soft, for the last time, as
	he tucks Jill's beret into his pack.  When he looks up again,
	those eyes have become newly predatory.  He ducks out of
	sight as the helicopter swings lower.
	
	Downdraft from the rotors makes the bushes rustle, catching
	Chris' attention.  He realizes that... it's not just the wind.
	The shrubs are being disturbed by...
	
	SOMETHING DARK which is moving through them.  It pokes
	its head out.  A WOLF! Rake was right.  Chris readies his
	Winchester as the animal stalks forward.
	
	It's not a wolf. It's A DOG. Mottled, its flesh gray,
	covered with rotting lesions... and it has three bleeding
	BULLET HOLES in its belly, chest, neck.
	
	GROWRRR!  It LEAPS at Chris... who fires... BLAM!
	
	Up ahead, Wesker and his commandos freeze.
	
				WESKER
			Who fired? WHO FIRED?
	
	Before anyone can answer, the team is ATTACKED by MORE DOGS
	which BURST out of the surrounding woods...DOBERMANS and
	SHEPHERDS... but something is seriously wrong with all of
	them. Their EYES are DEAD, their FLESH decaying.
	
	Automatics piss streams of lead. Hot rounds TEAR through the
	animals, many of the slugs accidentally blowing out brains.
	of his bullets hits its target... one of the dogs' heads.
	
	The commandos are backed up against... the IRON GATES we
	saw earlier. The Arkley Mansion stands beyond.
	
				RODRIGUEZ
			Let's get inside.
	
				WESKER (cont.)
			NO! (Shouting) I WANT 'EM ALL
			DEAD! YOU HEAR ME? STAND FAST...
			UNTIL THEY ARE ALL DEAD !
	
	The dogs don't stand a chance. Alpha Team's firepower is
	overwhelming. But there is a human casualty. JOSEPH FROST
	trips and falls. One of the dogs POUNCES on him, chewing
	out his HEART... through his BACK.
	
	Wesker steps in, RIDDLING the dead man, and the dog, with
	forty rounds from his M-16.
	
	Pg-19
	
	In the next instant, ANOTHER DOG LEAPS at Wesker from behind.
	He hears its snarl... too late.  He dives into the grass...
	too late.  The dog is about to land on him when...
	...it's BLASTED out of mid air by... Barry.
	
				BARRY
			Even-Steven, boss.  You saved my
			ass in the desert.  I saved yours I
			in Pennsylvania.
	
	Wesker stand, straightening his ever-present sunglasses.
	
				WESKER
			I don't believe in being... 'Even-
			Steven' with anybody.  A man saves
			my ass...I pay him back.  Before
			this day is over, I'll pay you back,
			Barry.  Just... stick with me, okay?
	
	Wesker checks his equipment belt. Something is missing.
	He looks to where he rolled in the grass. Using a FLASH-
	LIGHT, he finds...
	
	...a small electronic unit the size of a cell-phone. But
	it's not a cell-phone. Whatever it is... Wesker clips it
	onto his belt.
	
	FROM THE BRUSH, Chris sees all this. The guns have gone
	silent. The attack seems to be over. Chris moves stealthily
	to the body of the animal that he shot. It's wearing a
	COLLAR which reads...
	
				  SPIKE #26
	
	Alongside the I.D., there's a corporate-looking logo... the
	symbol of an UMBRELLA.
	
	GRRROWWWLL! ANOTHER DOG is advancing on Chris. He aims
	his Winchester.  CLICK! The magazine is empty.  No time to
	reload.  The dog is on him.  Chris SCRAMBLES away.  The dog
	BOUNDS after him.
	
	Chris drops to the ground.  Did he trip?  No.  He pushes a
	TREE ROOT, which is FALSE.  It swings open and he dives in,
	pulling the root shut over him.
	
	The dog arrives an instant later.  It lets out an angry
	howl... and is BLOWN AWAY... by RODRIGUEZ, who neither saw
	Chris, nor where he went.
	
	The forest goes dead quiet.  Too quiet.  There's not even
	the chirping of morning birds Wesker is SLAPPED startlingly
	on the back... by Barry.
	
	Pg-20
	
				BARRY
			Look here, man.  I'd follow you
			into any kind of enemy fire.  But
			these things ain't firin' at us.
			They want us for breakfast!  When
			are you gonna tell us what the
			hell is goin' on here?
	
				WESKER
			When you need to know.  Just do
			your job, soldier.  That's what
			I'm doin'.  My job.
	
	Wesker pulls a chain from under his shirt. It holds a card,
	the size of a Visa, like the one Jill found in her secret
	envelope, only Wesker's isn't blue, it's green.
	
	Stepping away from Barry, he slide the card through a slot
	in the iron gate-frame.  BUZZZZ.  The GATES SWING OPEN with
	a rusty SQUEAL.
	
	INT   TUNNEL   MORNING
	
	CHRIS crawls through a long, dark shaft with earthen walls,
	a man-made tunnel.
	
	EXT   ARKLEY FOREST   MANSION   MORNING
	
	AT THE MANSION'S FRONT DOOR, a hand-carved monolith of solid
	oak, WESKER finds another hidden SLOT and swipes his card.
	The giant door CREAKS OPEN.
	
	INT   MANSION   CENTRAL HALL   MORNING
	
	INSIDE, the place looks like a HAUNTED HOUSE, a glorious
	ruin, once spectacular, now mysterious and threatening.
	The chandeliers and furniture are covered with sheets that
	ripple on breezes from a thousand faults in the old walls.
	Indistinct NOISES echo within the ceiling, the floor, as
	ALPHA TEAM enters.
	
				AIKEN
			Old. They probably don't have cable.
	
				SULLIVAN
			They probably don't have radio.
	
				RODRIGUEZ
			Who's they? Who's place is this?
	
	WESKER shuts the front door. The BOOMING SOUND makes us
	wonder if we will ever see it opened again.
	
	
	Pg-21
	
				WESKER
			Guy named Arkley.  Bootlegger.  Built
			this old fortress during prohibition.
			He figured nobody'd ever find him out
			here in the back woods.  Nobody did.
			Till he died.  Feds have had it ever
			since.  Place has been here for eighty
			years... derelict... a safe-house.
	
				BARRY
			A safe-house... for who? For what?
	
				WESKER
			There's a... a secret installation.
			Below.  A network of laboratories.
	
				REBECCA
			What kind of... laboratories?
	
				WESKER
			(Shrugging) They didn't issue us
			gas-masks, so I figure... it's okay
			to breathe.
	
				RODRIGUEZ
			Why send in a strike-force?
	
				SULLIVAN
			Yeah. What are we supposed to do?
			Polish the silver?
	
				WESKER (cont.)
			There's a man downstairs. A top-
			priority man.  It's our job to...
			bring him out.  Hopefully, there
			are others alive, as well. We'll
			Rescue them, too... if we can...but
			Dr. John Marcus... he comes out alive
			at any and all cost.
	
	INT   MANSION   CORRIDOR   MORNING
	
	Though it's still morning, the windows are sealed over.  No
	sunshine can enter. From this point on... there will be no
	indication of time... except as shown on clocks.  A sense of
	dread takes hold of us as...
	
	...dark SHADOWS LURCH...FEET SCRAPE sluggishly... not in
	combat boots, but in Nikes, loafers, Dr. Martens... past an
	accordion GATE of corroded bronze.  A motor HUMS.  Behind
	the gate, an old-fashioned service ELEVATOR rises... but stops
	just below floor level. EYES peer out, waiting for the
	shuffling feet to pass.  Then the car rises the rest of
	the way, revealing its occupant...
	
	Pg-22
	
	...JILL VALENTINE! She's alive! She deactivates the
	elevator by pulling her blue ACCESS CARD out of an incon-
	gruously modern receptacle. Checking to be sure that the
	coast is clear, she slides the accordion gate aside and
	steps out into the corridor.
	
	With a ghostly MOAN, something LUNGES at her out of the
	shadows. It's A MAN in a lab coat. His skin is ROTTING,
	his teeth SNAPPING, like the dogs'. He tries to BITE Jill,
	not merely to do injury. He seems HUNGRY!
	
	Jill leaps aside, lifting her pistol and FIRING... once,
	twice, three times. The man is shot in the stomach, heart,
	neck...but he keeps coming! Finally, Jill shoots him in the
	head...and he falls.
	
	Jill quickly reloads, on instinct. But as she does it, she
	stares at the corpse, frowning, weighing life-long belief
	against the hideous facts of the moment.
	
	INT   MANSION   CENTRAL HALL   MORNING
	
	WESKER and his troopers hear the GUNSHOTS. There are THREE
	DOORS nearby. Wesker selects one that seems to lead to the
	source of the gunshots. Using his card, he unlocks it.
	
				WESKER
			Three men stay here. Chambers...
	
				REBECCA
			I'm not a man.
	
				WESKER
			Rodriguez...
	
				RODRIGUEZ
			I'm better than a man.
	
	Wesker grins, but hardly skips a beat.
	
				WESKER
			Alright. you come with us. Aiken,
			Sullivan, stick here with Chambers.
	
	The troop moves out. Aiken and Sullivan remain in the
	central hall with Rebecca.
	
				AIKEN
			Why us?
	
				SULLIVAN
			I dunno why me. You? I guess the
			C.O. figures you're as worthless
			as a dame, Aiken.
	
	Pg-23
	
	Sullivan catches Rebecca's eye.
	
				SULLIVAN (cont.)
			Er... sorry, ma' am. I... I didn't  ...
			I meant Aiken... Not you.
	
				REBECCA
			Relax. I get it.
	
	INT   MANSION LIBRARY   TIMELESS
	
	WESKER leads his TROOP into an enormous, cobwebbed library
	lined with book shelves, but no books. There are doorways
	on all four walls. Wesker pulls out something that looks
	like a Game-Boy. He types on a keypad. A MAP of the mansion
	appears. Wesker scrolls with the arrow-keys. Barry looks
	on very impressed with the high-tech unit.
	
				BARRY
			That thing...tells you where to go?
	
	Wesker doesn't answer. He pockets the "Game Boy".
	
				WESKER
			One man stays here. Ridley. You're
			it. Shoot to kill. Just make sure
			it's not one of us. The rest of you...
			this way.
	
	Wesker, leads his squad through one of the doorways. RIDLEY,
	a young rookie, remains.
	
	INT   UNDERGROUND CAVERN   TIMELESS
	
	CHRIS reaches the end of the earthen tunnel. There are
	signs that children once played here... TOY SOLDIERS.
	GRAFFITI.  Chris finds his nickname... Christopher Reddy...
	etched in hardened mud.  After a moment of reflection,
	he moves on, into...
	
	
	INT   ENTRY CHAMBER   TIMELESS
	
	...a small, sheet-rock chamber.  CHRIS rushes to a DOOR
	that looks like it's been there since the beginning of time.
	As soon as he touches the knob... AN ALARM SOUNDS!
	
	
	INT   MANSION   KITCHEN   TIMELESS
	
	RIDLEY, standing guard, hears THE ALARM. He hears Chris
	JIGGLING the knob. But he sees NO DOOR. The walls around
	him seem to be solid slabs.
	
	
	Pg-24
	
	INT   ENTRY CHAMBER   TIMELESS
	
	CHRIS can't get the doorknob to turn. Behind him, a dusty
	ORIENTAL CARPET BULGES upward. One corner flops aside.
	
	INT   MANSION   KITCHEN   TIMELESS
	
	RIDLEY is spooked by the sound. Frightened, trembling,
	he un-slings his rifle.
	
				RIDLEY
			Who... who's there?
	
	INT   ENTRY CHAMBER   TIMELESS
	
	CHRIS doesn't hear the trooper. Behind him, A Decomposed
	HAND pokes out of a drainage ditch beneath the carpet. It
	gropes. Finds purchase on the floor.
	
	Chris is unaware of the danger. He HURLS himself against
	the door. He can't break through.
	
	The thing that climbs out of the ditch was once a man, once
	a SCIENTIST. It's wearing a lab coat and a pair of thick
	EYEGLASSES. But it's long dead. It's... A ZOMBIE.
	
	As it pulls itself up, its eyeglasses strike the side of the
	ditch. They fall, CLATTERING, the rims scraping the zombie's
	cheek, which peels away like onion skin.
	
	Chris hears the noise. Turns and sees...
	
	...the dead man, reaching out hungrily.  Chris is trapped.
	He aims his Winchester. CLICK! He forgot. It's empty.
	
	The zombie pulls itself fully up onto the floor. Chris digs
	in his shoulder bag. Pulls out a handful of bullets and with
	them, accidentally, Jill's BERET. Rising emotion stops him
	for a moment.
	
	The dead man crawls toward him. Chris might not have time
	to load. As he tries to jam a bullet into his rifle, the
	zombie SWATS at him.  Catches the beret.  Looks at it.
	Sniffs it.  The bullet pops out of Chris' nervous fingers.
	He tries to load another.
	
	INT   MANSION   KITCHEN   TIMELESS
	
	RIDLEY spots A BLUE ACCESS SLOT in the wall. He levels his
	automatic and CHEWS the thing up with a short burst.
	
	A PANEL SWINGS OPEN! CHRIS dives out... with the ZOMBIE
	inches behind him. Ridley FIRES off another BURST OF ROUNDS.
	
	
	Pg-25
	
	Stray bullets PIERCE the zombie's head. It drops back into
	the chamber...with Ridley never knowing why.
	
	Ridley and Chris look at each other, asking rapid-fire
	questions, none of them answered.
	
				RIDLEY
			Who are you?
	
				CHRIS
			Who are YOU? What the hell is 
			S.T.A.R.S.?
	
				RIDLEY
			How'd you get in here?
	
				CHRIS
			Who sealed the door?
	
				RIDLEY
			Who knew there a door?
	
	WHAM! ANOTHER ZOMBIE appears suddenly behind Ridley, BITING
	out the muscle between his shoulder and neck. The trooper
	stands, stunned, for a moment...
	
				RIDLEY
			Who... who... ?
	
	...then he drops..
	
	The zombie, in a uniform, once a security guard, gazes dully
	at Chris.  A wet sound comes from inside its gullet as it
	calmly chews on Ridley's flesh.  Swallowing, it reaches out.
	Chris grabs its arms, FLINGS it into the chamber. Then
	FIRES his Winchester, once, putting a HOLE in the thing's
	head. Chris slams the door.
	
	
	INT   MANSION   DINING ROOM   TIMELESS
	
	In a Hearst-sized dining room with draped furniture, WESKER
	and the OTHER TROOPERS have heard the new gunfire.
	
				SPEYER
			Where'd that come from?
	
				BARRY
			Back...where we just were.
	
				SPEYER
			Shit, man, we're chasin' our tails!
	
	
	
	Pg-26
	
	INT   MANSION   KITCHEN   TIMELESS
	
	CHRIS hears the CLATTERING of the troopers heading his way.
	What he doesn't hear is... a slight CRACKLING... in the walls.
	
	INT   MANSION   CORRIDOR   TIMELESS
	
	WESKER and his TEAM burst into the corridor with the old-
	fashioned ELEVATOR.  FLASHLIGHTS find... the body of the
	ZOMBIE that was shot by Jill, bullet HOLES allover its body.
	
				SPEYER
			Damn. Surnbitch took a lotta lead.
	
				BARRY
			That's not what killed him. Blood's
			still running. Wounds are fresh.
			But look at his skin. This guy's
			been dead for a couple of days.
	
				RODRIGUEZ
			He was dead... before he was shot?
	
	INT   MANSION   KITCHEN   TIMELESS
	
	CHRIS checks Ridley.  No pulse.  His own rustling movements
	prevent him from hearing... that soft CRACKLING SOUND.
	
	The kitchen is lined with fifty-year-old IVY-PATTERNED
	WALLPAPER.  The printed VINES seem to be MOVING!  Chris
	doesn't notice until the vines begin to WIGGLE furiously...
	and RIP THROUGH the paper.  They're REAL.  Sprouts from
	some sort of exotic plant, that have climbed up the walls...
	with INTELLIGENCE!  They seem aware of Chris' presence.
	
				REBECCA (O.S.)
			Ridley?
	
	REBECCA has appeared in an open doorway. Chris looks at her,
	with the tips of the vines beginning to brush his shoulders.
	
				REBECCA (cont.)
			Who... who are...
	
				CHRIS
			I... I'm one of the good guys, okay
			I'm just trying to...
	
				REBECCA
			(Calling) SULLIVAN! AIKEN!
	
				CHRIS
			Shit.
	
	
	Pg-27
	
	Chris, familiar with the room, opens a SMALL DOOR in the
	wall, barely man-sized, and almost invisible because it's
	covered in matching wallpaper. Chris dives in.
	
	AIKEN and SULLIVAN pop up behind Rebecca, having barely
	caught a glimpse of Chris.
	
				AIKEN
			Who was that?
	
				SULLIVAN
			Forget him. What are they?
	
	Sullivan points at the vines... which are swirling, groping,
	as if alive, making their way toward Ridley's body.
	
	INT  MANSION   CHUTE   TIMELESS
	
	In a LAUNDRY CHUTE, propping himself against the sides,
	CHRIS descends...down...down... as he did as a child...
	and comes out onto...
	
	INT   CRAWL SPACE   TIMELESS
	
	...a DROP-CEILING, newly installed. Iron frames support
	AIR-FILTRATION SYSTEMS and other heavy MACHINERY. Sheet-
	metal walls have replaced the old soffit and fascia. LIGHT,
	from somewhere below, knifes through gridded iron vents.
	
				CHRIS
			Somebody did some major remodeling.
	
	INT   MANSION   KITCHEN   TIMELESS
	
	The VINES continue to advance.
	
				REBECCA
			We gotta get him out!
	
	THE TROOPERS rush to retrieve RIDLEY'S BODY. The VINES hover
	around them, occasionally DARTING, then pulling back, as if
	they were timid animals, hungry, but afraid of anew food-
	dish. When AIKEN brandishing his M-16, the VINES RECOIL and
	RETRACT fully... THWIP THWIP THWIP... behind the wallpaper and
	down... somewhere into the bowels of the house.
	
				AIKEN
			What? Smart fuckin' plants?
	
				SULLIVAN
			No big deal. Most-plants are
			smarter than you, Aiken.
	
	
	Pg-28
	
	INT   MANSION   CORRIDOR   TIMELESS
	
	THE OTHERS are still puzzling over the DOWNED ZOMBIE.
	
				SPEYER
			Why would anyone shoot a dead man?
	
				RODRIGUEZ
			Lemme guess. Maybe 'cause he was...
			walkin' around?
	
	Barry steps closer to the corpse, notes its collapsed skull.
	
				BARRY
			Head-shot. We were sprayin' those
			dogs outside... but think about it.
			Were any of 'em brought down without
			a head-shot.
	
	Wesker has been exploring the corridor. Stopping in front
	of the elevator, he shines his light into the car. We expect
	someone... or some-thing... to be lurking inside.
	
	An attack comes from the opposite direction. A FIGURE BURSTS-
	out of the shadows behind Weasker. Another Zombie?  No.  It's
	JILL! In a rage, she holds her pistol to Wesker's head.
	
				JILL
			I lost three me.  You killed them,
			Wesker. You did... and I did. Because
			I didn't know what to expect... because
			you... didn't tell me!
	
				WESKER
			(Calmly) Tell you what?
	
				JILL
			Anything! I wasn't told anything!
	
				WESKER
			Put down the gun.
	
	Instead, Jill CLICKS the hammer back.
	
				WESKER (cont.)
			Put down the gun.
	
				JILL
			Not until...
	
				WESKER
			RELEASE! THAT'S AN ORDER, SOLDIER!
	
	Jill blinks. Slowly, reluctantly, she lowers her gun.
	
	Pg-29
	
	Wesker turns... and recognizes her.
	
				WESKER (cont.)
			How... did you get in here?
	
				JILL
			(Sarcastic) How ya doin' , Valentine?
			Good to see ya. Glad you're still
			alive. Same here, colonel, I'm...
	
				WESKER
			How did you get in here?
	
				JILL
			(Exploding) The same way those fuckin'
			dogs got out! Through their pens!
			(Relaxing some) I... locked them off.
	
				WESKER
			Good thinking.
	
	A VOICE interrupts, from the end of the corridor.
	
				VOICE (o.s.)
			MAN DOWN!
	
	The voice is SULLIVAN'S. The troopers run to join him.
	Last to leave the corridor are Wesker and Jill. Wesker
	gestures gallantly.
	
				WESKER
			Ladies first.
	
				JILL
			Fuck you.
	
	INT   MANSION   KITCHEN   TIMELESS
	
	The TROOPERS trickle into the kitchen to find... REBECCA,
	kneeling over RIDLEY'S CORPSE, examining the ragged bite
	on its neck.
	
				RODRIGUEZ
			Maybe... they're in the house.
			More of them dogs.
	
				REBECCA
			Diameter's too small. It... almost
			looks as if... it was done by a...
	
				JILL
			(Arriving) A human?
	
	Rebecca looks up. The two women make sisterly eye-contact.
	
	
	Pg-30
				REBECCA
			Yes, but... what kind of... human...
			would do something like this?
	
				AIKEN
			Not a vegetarian, that's for sure.
	
				SULLIVAN
			Aiken, you'd be better off...
	
				REBECCA
			There was a guy. Not part of the
			team. And there was... some kind
			of... plant... that seemed... alive.
	
				RODRIGUEZ
			Gimme a fuckin' break.
	
				AIKEN
			No shit. It disappeared... right
			into the wall.
	
	Rodriguez cringes when she finds a ragged hole in the wall-
	paper near where she's standing.
	
				WESKER
			I guess it's... time to spill it.
	
	WESKER pulls off his dark glasses for the first time.
	
				WESKER (cont.)
			I don't know... much more than I
			already told you.  I'll tell you
			the rest now.  The labs hare are...
			were...working on special apps for
			bio-eng1neered materials.
	
				RODRIGUEZ
			Speak English, hombre.
	
				WESKER
			Marcus has been experimenting with
			an artificial... man-made... virus.
			Coded...the 'T'-virus.  Financing
			came from a private corporation, you
			may have heard the name... Umbrella.
	
				JILL
			They're... multi-national. Huge.
	
				WESKER
			So huge that they have... connections...
			in high places.  That's why we're here.
	
	
	Pg-31
	
				BARRY
			This virus... it jumped, right?
	
				SPEYER
			Shit! We're all dead! We got the
			bug, and we're all dead!
	
				WESKER
			It's not airborne. It was spread...
			in the water supply. Lab animals
			and... the researchers themselves...
			passed it on... by...
	
				JILL
			By... biting.
	
	Wesker hangs his head. It's an affirmation.
	
				BARRY
			You catch this virus and... what?
	
				WESKER
			You die. But... not for long. The
			chemical...revives the brain, and...
	
				RODRIGUEZ
			You stand back up... and chew on
			the first guy you see.
	
				SPEYER
			Christ, this is like... Night of the
			Living Dead!
	
				BARRY
			Why, in the name of Jesus, would
			anybody wanna mess with shit...
			that does that shit?
	
				WESKER
			Victory, friend. Civilization has
			come a long way, but we still have...
			war.  Imagine... a soldier who can't
			die.  That... was the concept.
	
				JILL
			But the virus... jumped.
	
				WESKER
			Hopefully... if we got all the dogs...
			we've contained it.
	
				JILL
			Hopefully?  Jesus... why didn't you
			tell us?
	
	
	Pg-32
	
				WESKER
			By telling you NOW, I've put your
			lives in jeopardy. Nobody has this
			information. Except a few high-and-
			mightys. Me. And now, you.
	
	The troopers fall silent as all this sinks in.
	
				WESKER (cont.)
			We have to get Marcus out of here.
			He developed this thing. He's the
			only one who... understands it.
	
				REBECCA
			I don't know, this all sounds pretty
			shaky to me...
	
	With a lightning move, Wesker draws his pistol and...BLAM!
	FIRES... at Rebecca. She flinches. The bullet flies past
	her and SHATTERS the skull of RIDLEY, the dead trooper who,
	having stood up, was about to attack Rebecca from behind.
	Ridley drops... dead again.
	
				RODRIGUEZ
			Guess that proves it. A head-shot
			knocks 'em down.
	
	Rebecca turns and looks at the blood-splattered body.
	
				REBECCA
			Th-that man.. .was dead. (Freaking)
			I... I'm a doctor! I should know!
			That man was dead!
	
	Vickers reaches in Rebecca's bag, pulls out an ammonia
	capsule, cracks it, and holds it under her nose.
	
				VICKERS
			I hope you have a lot of these.
	
	
	INT   CRAWL-SPACE   TIMELESS
	
	CHRIS crawls across the drop-ceiling, into the up-rising
	light from one of the vents. He looks down through the
	grid work and sees...
	
	...the same LABORATORY that was behind Marcus in the opening
	video. No longer pristine, it's wrecked, torn apart. Files
	are scattered everywhere along with smashed fragments of
	furniture and computer hardware.
	
	CAGES that line the walls are filled with LAB ANIMALS making
	NERVOUS CHATTER. Chris watches a MONKEY sip water from a
	dish. Like the other animals, its skin is rotting.
	
	
	Pg-33
	
	Chris is about to move on, when his eye catches...
	
	...MOVEMENT... outside the cages.  There's A MAN, in a
	lab coat, sitting at a desk, writing on a note pad.
	
				CHRIS
			(Calling) Hey.
	
	CLOSE ON: the man's HAND... flaking, decomposing.  The pen
	it holds is making only random, erratic marks.
	
				CHRIS (cont.)
			HEY!
	
	The man turns his head, slowly, to look up toward the voice.
	There's NOTHING left of his FACE. RAW TISSUE seeps odd-
	colored fluids. A single eyeball is nested tenuously in
	the ooze. Something like a mouth, recognizable only because
	of its position, opens... and GROANS.
	
	Chris, pumping his Winchester, hears... KRANG! A NOISE from
	below. He looks down again, just as...
	
	...the lab door BURSTS open. WESKER and ALPHA TEAM stream
	into the lab. The thing with. the destroyed face turns toward
	the invaders, stands, and shuffles toward them.
	
	Without hesitation, Wesker, on point, FIRES a quick burst
	into the thing's brain. It drops like a sack. The lab
	animals SHRIEK.
	
	The team files in, not noticing... ANOTHER ZOMBIE... crawling
	across the floor...heading directly for SPEYER. Chris shouts
	
				CHRIS (cont. )
			HEADS UP!
	
	He punches out the grate with the barrels of his rifle
	and... BLAM!...punches a sure-fire HOLE in the zombie's head.
	
	BRAD VICKERS, his nerves badly frayed, thinks the team is
	being attacked. He SPRAYS the ceiling with his automatic.
	
	Chris ducks and rolls, narrowly escaping the initial barrage,
	but bullets keep coming, punching a dotted line up through
	the ceiling panels.
	
	Chris scrambles, as fast as he can, his feet barely escaping
	the punch holes.
	
	He finds himself on top of an enormous checkerboard of vents
	and Plexiglas panels. Bullets weaken the framework. It
	sags... then CRACKS, dropping away. Chris is plunged into...
	
	
	
	Pg-34
	
	INT   LAB   LEVEL "A" TIMELESS
	
	...WATER! CHRIS kicks, paddles with his rifle, righting
	himself, getting his bearings. He's in a huge AQUARIUM
	that's built into one of the laboratory's walls... and he's
	not alone. There are SIX SHARKS in the tank. ZOMBIE SHARKS,
	their flesh rotting, leaking pus.
	
	The largest of them SNAPS at Chris, but its jaws catch only
	a clump of his swirling hair. Chris kicks with his feet,
	remaining upright, and FIRES his wet Winchester.
	
	The bullet wimps-out, restrained by the water. It penetrates
	the shark, but barely. We can see the casing lodged in the
	animal's flesh.
	
	Chris gets an idea. He kicks forward. Plants the barrel
	of his Winchester directly against the aquarium glass...
	only to find himself aiming directly at...
	
	...JILL, who is aiming back at him with her M-16. They're
	both stunned. They stare at each other for a moment, like
	gunfighters, until...
	
	...another shark circles in for an attack. Chris swings the
	Winchester away from Jill and FIRES underwater. The aquarium
	glass CRACKS... but holds.
	
				JILL (cont.)
			Hang on! We're gonna get wet!
	
	Jill FIRES. More CRACKS, but the glass is resistant.
	Chris out. Water SURGES into the lab, knocking Wesker and
	some of his squad down.
	
	They stand up again, only to find themselves knee-high in a
	dark pool...with SHARK FINS slicing the surface. Everybody
	opens fire. The dead fish keep coming.
	
				AIKEN
			Where the fuck is a shark's brain?
	
				SULLIVAN
			In it's head! I swear, Aiken, you
			would be better off dead.
	
	In a bizarre frenzy, the sharks KICK their tails, making
	startlingly quick turns, darting every which way, SNAPPING
	at the scent of warm flesh. The troopers, hampered by the
	water, SPLASH around wildly, many of them nearly getting
	bitten. The air above thickens with a fog of graphite from
	ten spitting automatics.
	
	
	Pg-35
	
	The water gets darker as it becomes clouded with BLOOD. But
	thankfully, the level is dropping. The water is seeping out
	through GRATES in the floor. The sharks become more visible,
	moving slower as their bellies scrape the floor.
	
	The troopers pick them off, one by one. The immediate threat
	passes...but as the water drains away, the troopers become
	aware of... a KLAXON-LIKE SOUND. ANOTHER ALARM. The entry
	door glides shut with a BOOOMMM!
	
				WESKER
			Nice. Very NICE, Valentine! You
			set off a containment breach!
	
				JILL
			It must have been the water. God,
			the water! (She turns to Chris}
			Did you swallow any?
	
				SPEYER
			I did.
	
				SULLIVAN
			A bunch of us did, man.
	
				WESKER
			Separate systems. Salt water.
			No germs. But.. .it breached!
	
	Wesker, looking crazed, his sunglasses gone, is typing on
	his "Game-Boy"... getting no response.
	
				WESKER (cont.)
			We can go in deeper.  But we can't
			get out.  Not with my card-key.
	
				RODRIGUEZ
			So...we live here now.
	
	Rosie finds Sullivan looking at her curiously.
	
				RODRIGUEZ (cont.}
			Landlords. Shit hills. Kicked my
			family out of six apartments. I
			got use to sayin'...'So...we live
			here now'.
	
				WESKER
			There are override exits... but I
			can't find them without THIS!
	
	Wesker FLINGS his "Game-Boy" angrily against a wall. It
	shatters into bits.
	
	
	Pg-36
	
				CHRIS
			That was a smart move.
	
	Wesker bristles. He's about to confront Chris, but he spots
	his sunglasses where they were deposited on a floor grate by
	the water. He walks over and picks them up, wiping the
	lenses on his shirt. Without looking at Chris, he asks...
	
				WESKER
			And... you are?
	
				CHRIS
			Nobody.  Just a...a local guy...
	
	Chris spots a dry lab-coat hanging on a wall hook. He takes
	it down and uses it to dry his rifle.
	
				CHRIS (cont.)
			...who gets pissed-off when he finds...
			his farm animals... and his father's
			oldest friend... dead. And the only
			woman he ever cared about turns out
			to be a goddam METAL HEAD!
	
	Wesker, while seeming to understand, still doesn't look up.
	
				WESKER
			Valentine...who is this asshole?
	
				JILL
			His name is Chris Redfield. He was...
			part of my cover, sir.
	
				CHRIS
			Cover?
	
	A snappy argument develops, a lover's quarrel, with higher-
	than-normal stakes.
	
				JILL
			This is not the time to mouth off,
			Chris! You're in deep shit here!
	
				CHRIS
			Why didn't you let me in on this?
	
				JILL
			Why did you have to come after me?
			How did you get in here, anyway?
	
				CHRIS
			I used to play here, when this was
			a fucking laundry room!  And what
			makes you think I came after YOU?
	
	
	Pg-37
	
				BARRY
			(Interrupting) Whoa! Look here.
	
	Barry is stooped over the faceless zombie that Wesker shot.
	He rips an I.D. badge from the corpse's coat.  He tosses it
	to Wesker, who reads the I.D... "DR. J. MARCUS"
	
				BARRY (cont.)
			Is this the pile of shit we're
			supposed to bring out of here?
	
				WESKER
			It...it once was.
	
				VICKERS (o.s.)
			I got something here.
	
	BRAD has been quietly working at one of the lab's computers.
	Barry rushes over and looks at the monitor screen.
	
				BARRY
			A map. Same as on your gizmo. Exits
			marked...blue and green.
	
	Wesker steps in for a look.
	
				WESKER
			The greens are the overrides. (To
			Brad) Can you print this out?
	
				VICKERS
			I can try.
	
	Chris calmly retrieves his wet shoulder bag from the floor.
	He wrings out the cloth and, using the lab coat, wipes the
	bullets dry.
	
				VICKERS (cont.)
			(Off the screen) We're on level 'A'.
	
				WESKER
			We have to get down to level 'D'.
	
				BARRY
			Hold on. Marcus is dead. If this
			mission was about bringin' him out,
			we're outta here, right?
	
				WESKER
			I wish we were, but no. We have
			a potential outbreak here. We might
			be the only ones who can stop it.
	
	Pg-38
	
				SPEYER
			Stop it? How?
	
				WESKER
			There's... an antidote.
	
	Everyone's ears perk.
	
				WESKER (cont.)
			We can't bring Marcus out, but we
			can bring out the serum. Maybe
			somebody...can analyze it... and
			figure how to beat the virus.
	
	Jill looks at Chris. Catches him weighing options.
	
				JILL
			(Privately) Not simple.
	
				CHRIS
			(Privately) Not complicated, either.
			We only have to decide... what's right...
			and what's wrong.
	
				JILL
			(Privately) I forgot. You're never
			confused. So...what's right, Mohawk?
			And what's wrong?
	
				VICKERS
			Shit. (At the computer) There are
			no green exits on this level. Why...
			why would that be?
	
				CHRIS
			They don't want anybody up here
			to go snoopin' ...upstairs or down.
	
	Wesker looks at Chris with that odd, confident smile.
	
				WESKER
			Pretty good guess. You must have
			been in the military, son.
	
				CHRIS
			Native American. Exempted.
	
				VICKERS
			(Typing, starting to panic) Fuck!
			There... there's no way out!
	
				CHRIS
			Yes there is.
	
	Chris points at the broken grid above the shattered aquarium.
	
	
	Pg-39
	
	Wesker looks up. Then looks back at Chris.
	
				WESKER
			Not a bad idea. (Turning to
			Vickers) See if you can call
			up... service charts, schematics.
	
	Brad's fingers fly. He scrolls through menus.
	
				VICKERS
			Got it. Ceiling grids, ladders.
			The whole infrastructure.
	
				WESKER
			Print it. Print all of it.
	
	The young man types a command. Wesker rushes over to the
	H. P. and grabs the first chart that rolls out.
	
	Rebecca steps over to Brad. She points at his leg.  Seated
	at the computer, his trousers hiked, BLOOD can be seen on his
	sock, just above his boot.
	
				REBECCA
			What's that from?
	
				VICKERS
			(Nervous) I...snagged it. On the
			desk. When we were scrambling.
	
				REBECCA
			Lemme look at it.
				VICKERS
			(Adamant) No. It's just a scratch!
	
	Chris watches Wesker as he studies the printed charts.
	
				CHRIS
			There's a... part of an old laundry
			chute. It might not show on there.
			It runs up to the kitchen.
	
				WESKER
			I'm not going up. I'm going down.
	
	Wesker, grim-faced, looks at his team.
	
				WESKER (cont.)
			I'd like to let you guys off the
			hook. But I can't. I need back
			up. You're comin' with me. Any
			objections?
	
	The troopers exchange glances. Jill is first to speak.
	
	Pg-40
	
				JILL
			No objections. We'll back you up.
	
				CHRIS
			(Disappointed) You said... people
			wind you up and you do whatever
			they want you to do.
	
				WESKER
			Stay out of this, son. You're the
			only one who doesn't have a choice
			in this. There's no place to lock
			you up. I can't let you go, you're
			a security risk. I could shoot you.
			Legally. But your lady-friend would
			probably get all over my ass. So...
			I'm afraid you're comin' with us...
			whether you like it or not. (To Jill,
			pointedly) He's your responsibility,
			Valentine. See that he doesn't make
			trouble.
	
	Jill looks at Chris.
	
				CHRIS
			You up to the challenge?
	
				JILL
			Try me.
	
				CHRIS
			(Snappy) I already have.
	
	INT   CRAWL-SPACE   TIMELESS
	
	One by one, the members of ALPHA TEAM wiggle up into the
	crawl space above the ceiling. CHRIS climbs up behind JILL.
	OTHER TROOPERS are already away, following WESKER, who guides
	them with the help of his chart. Jill starts after them.
	Chris grabs her arm.
	
				CHRIS
			Jill, I... I'm sorry. I'm just...
			angry. When I... thought you were
			gone, I... Then... when I saw you.
			Alive. I realized that...
	
				JILL
			That you were still... fascinated.
	
				CHRIS
			Stop. Stop!
	
	He pulls her into an embrace. She goes willingly.
	
	
	
	Pg-41
				CHRIS (cont.)
			Come with me. We can get out of here.
	
				JILL
			(Tempted) I...I want to. I want...
			nothing more. But... I can't. When
			I'm in this uniform, I'm more than...
			just me. Try to understand...there's
			no "I" in Team, Chris.
	
				CHRIS
			There's no "I" in DEAD, either.
	
	Chris pulls away from the embrace and looks at her.
	
				CHRIS (cont.)
			I should order you to come with me.
			You'd never refuse an order.
	
				JILL
			You go. You're not part of this.
			
			
				CHRIS
			I'm part of it as. long as you are.
	
				BARRY (o.s.)
				This is very uncomfortable.
	
	Barry, having overheard, is halfway up through the grate.
	
				CHRIS
			For me, too, brother.
	
				BARRY
			I mean this... (indicating the
			iron that's pressing his belly.)
			It's very uncomfortable.
	
	Chris and Jill help Barry up into the crawl space.
	start off after the troop. THE CAMERA TRACKS them.
	
				BARRY (cont.)
			This is gettin' old, Man, I swear.
			I been in this Army eighteen years.
	
				CHRIS
			Eighteen years?
	
				BARRY
			Yep. Two away from the big re-ti.
	
				JILL
			Desk job, right? Nobody lasts that
			long if they've seen action.
	
	
	
	Pg-42
	
				BARRY
			I've seen action in Granada.  And
			Desert Storm.  Would have lost it
			all there... if my buddy didn't bring
			in a team, against orders, to pull
			my ass out.  Buddy named... Wesker.
	
				CHRIS
			You've been with this asshole since... ?
	
				BARRY
			Since before that.  We were... kids
			together.  Macon, Georgia.  He's...
			only an asshole some of the time...
	
	UP AHEAD : WESKER reaches a service ladder. He waves his
	troop on. They start to climb down.
	
				VICKERS
			Who knows what we'll find down there?
	
				AIKEN
			Think positive.  The farther down we
			go, the worse it's gonna get.  So...
			until we hit bottom, we're in good
			shape... relatively speaking.
	
	GRRRAAAAWWWLr.! Distant... but distinct... it sounds like
	the MGM lion.
	
				SPEYER
			What the fuck?
	
	Again .GRRRRRAAAAAWWWWLLLL !
	
				VICKERS
			Whatever it is.. .it can't get us.
			We're in the ceiling!

			Maybe it's like... really tall.

			Aiken...
	
	INT   CRAWL SPACE   LAB   LEVEL "B"   TIMELESS
	
	The lead TROOPERS reach another section of the ceiling.
	Clustering around a vent, they look down into...
	
	...the "B"-level lab, more streamlined, more high-tech than
	the one upstairs. There are large COMPUTERS, linked by
	metal-shielded conduits to jacks in the walls.
	
	
	
	
	Pg-43
	
				WESKER
			Main-frame. Might have some data
			we could use. (A quick decision)
			Fox, Marini, Vickers.  Down.
	
	WESKER kicks out the vent. He jumps first, through the
	opening, down into the lab. CHRIS watches from behind.
	
				CHRIS
			The man has balls, I'll say that.
	
	Wesker grabs a desk and pushes it under the vent.  MARINI
	climbs down, followed by FOX.  BRAD is last.
	
				WESKER
			Hustle it, Vickers.  You're the guy
			we need.  To cut into the network.
	
	INT   LAB   LEVEL "B"   TIMELESS
	
	WESKER looks around. There are THREE Doorways...open wide
	with only darkness beyond. Wesker runs around closing them.
	
				WESKER
			Watch these entrances, guys.
	
	FOX and MARINI take up posts. Brad lowers himself gingerly.
	He drops the last two feet onto the desk, landing on his
	bloody leg.
	
				VICKERS
			AAAAH ! Shit.
	
	He topples, falling to the floor, but pops up instantly.
	
				VICKERS (cont. )
			I'm alright. I'm alright.
	
	He limps over and attacks the computer keys.
	
	GRRRRRAAAAAWWWWWLLLL! Another distant snarl.
	
				WESKER
			Hold tight. It doesn't sound like
			it's on this level.
	
				VICKERS
			(At the computer) Shit. I'm locked
			out. Any clues for a password?
	
				WESKER
			Try... Umbrella.
	
	Brad types rapidly, nervously. Flubs. Types again.
	
	
	Pg-44
	
				VICKERS
			Nothing. Wait. I'm into... No.
			No data. Just some kind of video
			feed. Time-coded. Yesterday.
			It's a play-back. (Watching the
			screen) Holy shit!
	
	We HEAR it before we see it. The sound of absolute PANIC.
	People SHOUTING! SCREAMING! THUDS and CRASHES! GLASS
	BREAKING! Then A WOMAN'S VOICE .
	
				WOMAN'S VOICE (o.s.)
			Please...please.. .if anyone is
			receiving this...
	
	Brad limps around the desk and spins the monitor for the
	others to see. The WOMAN is an ORIENTAL. She's standing
	in the foreground, as Marcus was in the opening video.
	Behind her is a lab we haven't seen yet... with white-
	coated FIGURES... RUNNING... FIRING GUNS.
	
				WOMAN (cont.)
			the situation is completely.
			out of control. We...
	W
	HAM ! The woman is pushed out of the way by A MAN who is
	trying to protect her from...
	
	...SOMETHING that BLURS past the lens, like a pendulum,
	from ABOVE.
	
	In the next instant... SPLAT... the lens is COATED WITH BLOOD!
	As it oozes down, we see a partial image of the same MAN.
	His HEAD is OUT OF FRAME at the top of the screen.
	
	The thing above must have a hold on it... because the man is
	DANGLING, his arms witching. His back has three GOUGES in
	it, long and so deep that they might have been made by
	piece of heavy machinery. We only see this for an instant...
	before the man is LIFTED, straight UP, with amazing SPEED.
	
	Wesker clicks off the monitor. The other men instinctively
	look up above their heads.
	
				FOX
			Maybe the ceiling's not such a
			safe place, after all.
	
	CRASH! The door behind Fox BURSTS open. Before he has
	time to react A ZOMBIE is on him, BITING his cheek, neck,
	shoulder. The two figures fall to the floor, grappling.
	Wesker can't get a clean shot.
	
				WESKER
			Scram! SCRAM!
	
	
	Pg-45
	
	Marini is first to reach the desk, but he helps the limping
	Brad up ahead of him. TWO MORE ZOMBIES lurch in through the
	open doorway. Wesker shoots them, but he sees MORE... can't
	tell how many...shambling toward the open doorway from the
	darkness beyond.
	
	Wesker focuses on Fox, who is still being MAULED, BITTEN.
	Fox SCREAMS. Wesker still has no safe shot.
	
	Brad is YANKED up into ceiling by SULLIVAN and AIKEN. CHRIS
	leans out of the opening, reaching for Marini.
	
	Wesker KICKS the mauling zombie in the head. It takes three
	hard BOOTS to attract the thing's attention. When it finally
	looks up at him, Wesker BLOWS out its skull.
	
	Fox is lying on his stomach, writhing, BLEEDING profusely
	from a half-dozen bites. Wesker stoops down, trying to roll
	him over, lift him up. Fox resists. He's gone insane.
	
	Chris pulls Marini up to safety. BARRY leans down through
	the opening.
	
				BARRY
			Haul ass, boss!
	
	The zombies are heading for Wesker. There are three of them.
	Barry shoots at the one in front. Misses. His second shot
	hits the thing's brain.
	
	Wesker again tries to hoist Fox who, this time rolls over on
	his own. He has drawn his pistol. Before Wesker can stop
	him, he eats the barrel and BLOWS out the back of his head.
	
	One zombie is dangerously close. Barry fires two more
	rounds. No head shot, but the zombie staggers and, though
	not dead, FALLS...directly toward Wesker. The colonel rolls
	on his back, kicking himself away, managing to get clear.
	He uses his own pistol to BLAST the zombie.
	
	He scrambles to his feet, darts toward the desk, and jumps
	up. The third zombie grabs his legs. From above, Barry
	risks a dangerous shot. BLAM! Wesker hears the bullet
	WHIZZZ past his head like a mosquito.
	
	The zombie is hit in the skull. It drops. There are MORE
	of them coming out of the darkness. Barry takes hold of
	Wesker and, with a single strong arm, pulls him up into...
	
	INT   CRAWL SPACE   LAB   LEVEL "B"   TIMELESS
	
	...the crawl space, where WESKER breathes heavily for a
	moment... then looks up at his old friend.
	
	
	
	
	Pg-46
	
				WESKER
			That's...two I owe ya.
	
				BARRY
			One. We were all... 'Even-Steven' .
	
				WESKER
			Two. Remember? 'Even-Steven' ...
			is not in my vocabulary.
	
	A horrible MOANING SOUND comes from below, in the lab.
	THREE MORE ZOMBIES can be seen clustering around the desk,
	dumbly trying to climb up, sensing the "food" above.
	
				WESKER (cont.)
			Let's move.
	
	Wesker takes off. SPEYER, RODRIGUEZ, AIKEN and SULLIVAN are
	quick to follow. The others lag behind when CHRIS says...
	
				CHRIS
			Those things could get up here.
			We can't let that happen. This
			is our way out...
	
	Chris swings his legs through the grate and JUMPS down...
	
	INT   LAB   LEVEL "B"   TIMELESS
	
	...ONTO THE DESK. He BOOTS one of the ZOMBIES away and
	tries to LEAP over the others. One of them catches his foot
	in mid air. CHRIS isn't hurt, but he TOPPLES to the floor,
	sprawling, losing his Winchester.
	
	The zombies have him cornered. He crawls toward his rifle.
	Reaches it. Pumps a shell into the firing chamber. Aims
	at the closest of the walking dead...
	
	...which was once a young man, a simple laborer, wearing
	overalls, with a name tag...
	
				CHRIS
			(Reading) Caruso.
	
	Chris looks empathetically into the thing's dead eyes.
	
				CHRIS (cont.)
			Can you hear me?
	
	The zombie lumbers forward hungrily.
	
				CHRIS (cont.)
			Caruso! Can you hear me?
	
	Pg-47
	
	Chris has come late to the realization that these things
	were once human. Now he comes late to the realization...
	that they are human no longer.
	
	The zombie grabs the barrel of the Winchester, pushing it
	aside. Chris can't bring it back to bear on the monster's
	head. He BLASTS a round through the thing's belly. It has
	no effect. The zombie reaches for Chris' throat. Starts to
	lean in to bite him.
	
	BLAM! The thing's skull explodes. JILL has jumped down
	onto the desk. She FIRES another accurate pistol round.
	The SECOND ZOMBIE falls.
	
	Jill leaps to the floor and starts to push the desk. Chris
	gets to his feet, rushing in to help her. Together, they
	shove the desk out from under the open ceiling grate.
	
				CHRIS
			Thank you.
	
				JILL
			Any time. How do we get back UP?
	
				CHRIS
			Shit, if you didn't have a plan, you
			shouldn't have jumped down here.
	
				JILL
			We have a real problem here, Chris.
	
	Jill nods toward the open doorway. There are more stuttering
	FIGURES approaching out of the dark.
	
				CHRIS
			How big is this place? How many
			people were down here? How...
	
				JILL
			HOW DO WE GET UP?
	
	With a startling SOUND, A DARK SHAPE swing down from above
	and GRABS Jill! Is it the thing we saw on the video?
	
	No. It's BARRY! His mighty arms lift Jill. She's caught
	by Aiken and Sullivan and pulled up to safety. Barry grabs
	Chris and lifts him as well.
	
	
	INT   CRAWL SPACE   LAB   LEVEL "B"   TIMELESS
	
	CHRIS grabs the edge of the grate and pulls himself up.
	He reaches back down through the opening. Below, BARRY
	squats... and makes a mighty leap-with his muscular legs.
	Chris grabs his arms... and is nearly pulled back down.
	
	
	
	Pg-48
	
				CHRIS
			(Straining) Big. Heavy.
	
	Jill grabs on, then Sullivan. But one of the ZOMBIES has
	reached Barry. It GRABS his kicking legs. It's TEETH SNAP!
	And CATCH! The commandos lift Barry clear, but the zombie
	ends up with a CHUNK of something in its mouth.
	
				JILL
			It got you!
	
	Barry checks his leg. His trousers are torn, but...
	
				BARRY
			No skin broken. I'm alright.
	
				CHRIS
			We owe you a pair of pants.
	
	They crawl away. The zombies below reach up, their fingers
	clutching, at the ceiling, but with the desk gone, there's
	no way they can get up.
	
	DISSOLVE TO:
	
	INT   STORAGE AREA   TIMELESS
	
	THE COMMANDOS climb down a steel access ladder into a storage
	room stacked with CRATES and CARTONS. There's only one door.
	The place seems secure.
	
	
				WESKER
			Stand down. Five minutes.
	
	WESKER sits on a crate and pulls out his printed charts.
	Gradually the whole troop makes it down into the room.
	They relax. A few light cigarettes. But not SPEYER.
	
				SPEYER
			I'm through, Wesker.
	
				MARINI
			Me too, man. This ain't nothin'
			I signed on for.
	
				WESKER
			(Calm) You want to wait here, fine.
	
				MARINI
			Wait here? No. We're gettin' out!
				
				WESKER
			You can't. (He flashes his access
			card.) Not without this.
	
	
	Pg-49
	
				SPEYER
			Fuck you! And your fancy doors and
			your green key! The choppers have
			rockets. They can blow out a wall
			if they have to. I'm callin' 'em in.
	
	Speyer pulls out his radio and starts to punch a code.
	
				WESKER
			You wanna see a wall blow, I'll
			blow all of 'em for ya.
	
	Wesker reaches down to the electronic unit that he lost and
	retrieved in the woods. He pulls a long wire out of it, with
	a small sensor on the end.
	
				WESKER (cont.)
			I'll put a crater in this forest that
			takes out Racoon City and everything
			else for twenty miles... with this.
	
	He jams the little sensor into his ear and pushes a button
	on the belt unit. Small red LIGHTS blink.
	
				WESKER (cont.)
			It's a radio detonator...to set off
			explosives that are...buried under

			And to see that my heart... doesn't

	Wesker looks over the tops of his sunglasses... at Speyer
	
				WESKER (cont.)
			Give me the radio, soldier.
	
	Speyer hesitates. Wesker explodes, for the first time.

	The radio man presses his headset to his ear. LaGuardia

				RADIO MAN (cont.)
			It's Wesker. (Into mike) Yes, sir.
			We got the signal sir. (He clicks

	BRRRING! The hand with the ostentatious RING snatches a red

	He listens. Once again, we don't see his face. Just his
	free hand, with another Monte Cristo burning.

			Denied. This is Wesker's show.
			If he was in real trouble, we'd

	INT   STORAGE AREA   TIMELESS
	
	WESKER has come down off his rampage. He looks exhausted.
	He also looks staunchly heroic as he speaks to his TROOP.
	
				WESKER
			You guys were hand-picked. A Special
			Unit. Most of you have been sitting
			on your asses, drawing pay checks for
			more than two years. Well... it's time
			to repay those... Government loans.
	
				SPEYER
			Bull shit. I'm not...
	
	Wesker lifts his automatic. Speyer flinches. The action
	wasn't meant as a threat. Wesker is just checking his ammo.
	
	
	
	Pg-52
	
				WESKER
			Pitch your empties. Put all your
			loaded clips on that crate there.
			I want a count. Then I want the
			rounds divvied up... evenly.
	
	The troopers deposit their loaded clips, reloading the ones
	that are half-used.
	
				WESKER (cont.)
			Alright. We're on.. .(checking the
			maps) ...level "C"...
	
				AIKEN
			Lingerie. Notions.
	
				WESKER
			GOD DAMMIT, NO MORE JOKES! We have
			men dead upstairs! This hell-hole
			is full of people who died... because
			of this stinkin' ...BUG!
	
	Jill has been counting the ammo clips.
	
				JILL
			Forty two.
	
				SPEYER
			That's all we have?
	
				WESKER
			We weren't expecting a war, Speyer.
			(To Jill) I'll take three. Three
			to your boyfriend...
	
				CHRIS
			Don't need 'em. Got my own loads.
	
	Wesker's eyes dart angrily toward Chris. But he notices
	Jill watching him...and he calms himself.
	
				WESKER
			Good. Then... we all get four clips.
	
				SPEYER
			They must have... weapons down here,
			somewhere. A powder magazine.
	
				WESKER
			No more side trips. It was a mistake
			to go into that lab upstairs. My
			mistake. And I'm not makin' another
			one. From now on it's straight ahead.
			In and out.
	
	Pg-53
	
	Wesker stands and opens the door.  Outside is a SERVICE
	CORRIDOR with unfinished walls. Spaces between raw metal
	beams are stuffed with insulation. Wesker checks the jamb
	outside. It's got a lock mechanism. Blue.
	
				WESKER (cont.)
			Not an override. My key won't work
			here on the way out. Prop the door.
	
	The troopers drag a heavy crate over to hold the door open.
	Wesker moves out. The commandos trickle after him. Chris
	holds Jill behind for a moment.
	
				CHRIS
			Jill...this guy is a Loony-Toon.
	
				JILL
			He's just... trying to get the job
			done. Doing what he has to do.
	
				CHRIS
			Yeah, well...I hope you'll say
			the same about me... when I do...
			what I have to do.
	
	Chris turns and walks off. Jill follows him out into...
	
	
	INT   SERVICE CORRIDOR   TIMELESS
	
	...the corridor. They catch up with the TROOP which is
	clustered at a blind alley which has two doors.
	
				WESKER
			(Checking his map) It's not clear...
			which way to go.
	
				RODRIGUEZ
			Want me to flip a coin?
	
	WESKER is annoyed by the remark. Decisively, he selects one
	of the doors and uses his green key card. With a BZZZZ, the
	lock releases. The troop enters...
	
	INT   SYSTEMS CENTER   TIMELESS
	
	...a vast ROOM, fifty-by-fifty yards. It's filled with
	HEATERS, AIR CONDITIONERS, WATER PUMPS. MAIN FRAMES for
	the internal computer network line one wall, FUSE BOXES
	and SWITCHER PANELS another. This is the systems center
	for the entire facility.
	
	There's an attendant's desk just inside the door. AIKEN
	and SULLIVAN drag it over to prop the door open. It makes
	
	
	
	Pg-54
	
	a frightening SOUND as it scrapes the floor, echoing,
	bouncing around in the large space. It prompts a response...
	another of those animal-like SNARLS from somewhere in the
	distance.
	
				SULLIVAN
			What's that sound like to you?
	
				AlKEN
			A meat-eater.
	
	There are thick columns, floor to ceiling, every ten feet.
	The spaces between them are very dark. It's hard to see.
	WESKER and some of the OTHERS click on their FLASHLIGHTS .
	Beams cut through dust.
	
	There are ELECTRONIC HUMS.. CLICKS and CHATTERS emit from
	the switchers, PINGS from the heaters, all combining to fray
	everyone's nerves. Light beams dance nervously as the
	commandos start out across the dark and frightening space.
	
				CHRIS
			(Softly to Jill) This is the heart
			of the whole place. They've got to
			have it... protected somehow.
	
	Two things happen, almost at once. First.. .CHRIS notices
	ELECTRIC EYES... on all of the columns.
	
				CHRIS (cont.)
			DUCK! HIT THE DECK!
	
	Second. A ZOMBIE lurches around a corner and BITES a chunk
	out of MARINI'S face. JILL whirls around to shoot at the
	zombie, but Chris grabs her and FLATTENS her on the floor.
	
	Marini, staggering, screaming in pain, triggers the first
	electric eye. LASER BEAMS shoot in all directions, forming
	a tight NET. Chris and Jill are barely beneath them.
	Many of the other troopers are hit by the beams... which do
	no immediate harm... but wherever they make contact, small
	CYLINDERS above the electric eyes begin to HISS.
	
				CHRIS (cont.)
			FOR CHRISSAKE, GET DOWN!
	
	The commandos duck under the laser beams... just in time.
	Jets of STEAM spout from the cylinders. It's not just hot
	steam. It's ACIDIC, deadly.
	
	Marini is hit by it. His clothes IGNITE. His flesh BOILS.
	It's a horrible sight, but for the moment, the jets stop.
	
	
	
	Pg-55
	
	Marini is dead on his feet. When he falls, he trips another
	of the laser beams. The steam jets SPOUT again. The troop
	is beneath them, though many are burned by liquid drops that
	spit from the nozzles.
	Amazingly, the zombie has avoided contact. But as it begins
	to stumble after commandos, we realize it's going to activate
	the sensors again.
	
				SULLIVAN
			There's no way outta this mousetrap!
	
				RODRIGUEZ
			So we live here now?
	
				SPEYER
			We gotta run for it.
	
	The zombie hits one of the laser beams. The steam HISSES
	out again. The zombie is MELTED.
	
				AIKEN
			Bad idea, Speyer.
	
				CHRIS
			Down. Through these.
	
	Chris has noticed a series of hinged panels in the floor.
	
				VICKERS
			Where do they go?
	
				SULLIVAN
			Does it matter?
	
	Sullivan whips out a Swiss Army knife and goes to work on
	the screws that hold down one of the panels. Other troopers
	do the same.
	
	Another ZOMBIE lurches out of the darkness. And ANOTHER.
	
	Human hands work furiously, loosening screws. Panels come
	up, Troopers begin to duck through the openings.
	
	A second zombie hits a red beam. STEAM again. Chris and
	Jill are spattered. Burned. But Jill bravely keeps working
	with her own issued knife. She gets a panel open. As she
	drops through, a third zombie triggers a burst of steam.
	Chris ducks and covers.
	
	When the jets stop, Chris begins to climb into the opening,
	but one of his legs is GRABBED from behind by...
	
	...one of the dead things which has already been MELTED!
	
	
	
	
	Pg-56
	
	Its flesh is bubbling. Bone is beginning to show. But
	the acid hasn't reached its brain yet. The creature is
	still alive.
	
	Chris CRIES out. Acid from the zombie's hands is burning
	his leg. The thing's lips have been eaten away, making its
	teeth look frighteningly skeletal as it leans forward for a
	bite of flesh. Chris jams the stock of his Winchester into
	the zombie's mouth. He's able to hold the thing's head back,
	but he's stuck. He can't let go.
	
	Jill pops up out of the floor. She presses the barrel of her
	own weapon into the zombie's forehead.
	
				JILL
			On three...
	
				CHRIS
			One... two...
	
	Chris pulls his rifle away. At the same instant, Jill FIRES.
	The zombie is PROPELLED through the air. One of its flailing
	arms triggers another laser beam. Chris throws himself in on
	top of Jill as STEAM HISSES over them.
	
	Twenty yards away, Wesker crawls under the cloud of acid.
	Just as he climbs down through one of the openings, he feels
	pressure...on his ear.
	
	A groping zombie has accidentally hooked its fingers onto the
	wire that runs from the detonator to Wesker's ear-piece.
	For a breathless moment, it seems like the sensor will be
	popped loose. Holding the pulse-reader in place, Wesker
	twists his body, lifts his hand gun, and PUMPS THREE into
	the dead thing's brain.
	
	The zombie flops over, but its fingers cling, entangled, in
	the wire. Wesker plants his pistol barrel on the knuckles
	of the thing's dead hand. THREE MORE SHOTS cut through bone,
	removing the fingers from the hand. The wire is freed.
	Wesker dives into the opening in the floor.
	
	
	INT   AIR DUCT   TIMELESS
	
	The COMMANDOS find themselves in an AIR DUCT. No room to
	stand. Hardly room to sit.
	
	Chris looks at his rifle stock. It's corroded from the acid
	in the zombie's mouth. Jill notices.
	
				JILL
			God...and it doesn't even stop them...
	
	
	
	Pg-57
	
				CHRIS
			It's not meant to stop them. It's
			meant to stop...something else.
	
	That distant SNARLING SOUND comes again, making Jill shiver.
	The troop is strung out along the metal shaft. REBECCA
	crawls among them, treating the worst burns. WESKER checks
	his maps. SPEYER confronts him again.
	
				SPEYER
			We damn near got turned into Rice
			Krispies by that gizmo of yours.
			If you don't want me to nail that
			fuckin' thing into your ear, you
			deactivate it. Right now.
	
				WESKER
			I can't. They.. .fixed it... so you
			can't chicken out. The system can
			only be turned off at the main panel.
	
				BARRY
			Where the hell is that?
	
				WESKER
			Where the explosives are. Down...
			farther than we need to go. We only
			have to make it down one more level.
			If... when... we make it back up to
			the choppers... we can fly out of
			the detonator's signal range.
	
	Chris calls out from the far end of the shaft
	 
				CHRIS
			I'm not willing to rely on that.
			I live here, this is my town!
	
				WESKER
			The town's been evacuated. Just...
			just in case.
	
				CHRIS
			That explains the lie. About the
			plane crash. An airplane down...
			with weapons on board... would nicely
			explain a big explosion, wouldn't it?
			You figured all along you might have
			to blow this place!
	
				WESKER
			I don't want to do it. I... I hope
			I don't have to.
	
	
	Pg-58
	
	Chris looks down the dim air-shaft, unable to see Wesker's
	eyes, hidden by distance.. .and by his dark glasses.
	
				WESKER (cont.)
			That's the best I can do for you,
			kid. Good faith. Now... let's
			knock on it.
	
	Wesker moves out. The troop follows.
	
				CHRIS
			I...I can't let this happen. I've
			got to find that bomb.
	
				JILL
			I'll help. Once Wesker gets what
			he wants, my obligation is over.
	
	Chris looks at her with appreciative eyes .
	
				CHRIS
			No. I want you out. With the
			rest of them. Wesker won't push
			the button until you're clear.
	
				JILL
			He doesn't want to push the button.
	
				CHRIS
			He has to. Don't you see? He can't
			leave these labs here. And, Jesus...
			walking corpses! He's gotta get rid
			of the evidence.
	
	INT   AIR SHAFT   TIMELESS
	
	The light is dim at its best. Long stretches of the shaft
	are pitch black, and there's a constant stream of air that
	MOANS eerily. This whole mission has been like a descent
	into Hell, darker and more frightening with each level down.
	
	There are turn-offs, "T"s and "Y"s. At one point, when JILL
	looks back, she finds ROSIE behind her. Chris is gone. Did
	he leave to deal with the bomb?
	
	No, but he's about to. He's at the rear of the pack, pressed
	against the side-wall, waving others past.
	
				JILL
			Chris, no!
	
				CHRIS
			I've got to try and stop this.
	
	
	
	Pg-59
	
	Jill starts back toward Chris, but freezes.. .everyone freezes
	when... the duct-work starts to PING.
	
				RODRIGUEZ
			Shit. One thing after another.
	
	BOOM! The air shaft is ROCKED, as if punched by a giant
	fist. Then...the whole structure begins to SHIMMY. What
	is it, an earthquake?
	
				WESKER
			Sit tight. Ride it out.
	
	GRONK! A sheet-metal panel BUCKLES! Others do the same.
	All along the shaft, panels begin to FOLD INWARD. Something
	outside is CRUSHING the duct as if it were a giant tube of
	toothpaste. And the troopers are being SQUEEZED inside.
	
	RIVETS POP! The panels begin to SEPARATE...and large,
	pulsing bits of FLESH appear! Not animal flesh. But the
	flesh of A PLANT! The things that press in through the
	openings are larger versions of the vines we saw in the
	kitchen. Those were its fingertips. These are its ARMS.
	Strong arms that are RIPPING the ductwork apart.
	
	Chris, Rebecca, Aiken and Sullivan end up in one part of the
	shaft. The rest in another... including Jill, who calls out.
	
				JILL
			CHRIS!
	
	The section that holds Chris' group FALLS AWAY... with a
	monstrous, CRUNCHING sound.
	
	INT   ARBORETUM   TIMELESS
	
	CHRIS' GROUP spills out of the dangling metal, with cables
	from the torn ceiling...TZZZZZT...SPARKING around them.
	The troopers drop out of Hell, into...PARADISE.
	
	An enormous HOT HOUSE, a lush, indoor JUNGLE of PLANTS,
	IVIES, GRASSES. It's like a RAIN FOREST, complete with
	a thick, damp MIST that makes it difficult to see. We might
	be on another planet. None of the foliage seems indigenous
	to Earth. There are LEAVES the size of bed sheets, FLOWERS ,
	the size of armchairs. And at the center of it all, is the
	mother of the deadly vines...
	
	...PLANT 42, a monstrous schefflera, twenty times normal
	size. Most of its limbs reach upward, where they have opened
	CRACKS in the ceiling and walls, to stretch on into the
	facility above. There are also dozens of shorter, beefier
	"arms", each of which act independently, like tentacles on
	an octopus... and each has a large, drooling POD at its tip.
	
	
	Pg-60
	
	INT   RUNWAY   TIMELESS
	
	BURSTS OF GUNFIRE from three M-16s shatter our ears... and
	a ceiling VENT. WESKER and THE OTHERS jump down into...
	
	...a very unusual CORRIDOR. It seems to stretch forever, in
	both directions. It has no doors, no visible means of exit
	or entry. The walls are made-up of multi-colored polymer
	TILES, whose irregular shapes fit together like a JIGSAW
	PUZZLE. The floor is HEAVY STEEL, though faceted. It seem
	designed to shift. The whole corridor looks like it might be
	able to bend, to change position, like an airport jet way.
	
	There are disconcerting signs of damage...claw-like GOUGES on
	the tiles, clean cut HOLES punched through the metal ceiling,
	larger in diameter than any that might have been caused by
	bullets.
	
	And there are smears of BLOOD everywhere, as if some terrible
	battle... or battles...took place here.
	
				WESKER
			This way. (He starts off.)
	
				JILL
			No. That way.  Chris and the others...
	
				WESKER
			If they're dead, they're dead. If
			they're alive, they'll still be alive
			in twenty minutes. When we get back.
	
				JILL
			Maybe not. And how do we know it's
			only going to be twenty minutes?
			How do we know we'll be able to come
			back this way?
	
				WESKER
			We don't. But we'll do our damndest
			to try. This is it, guys. The home
			stretch. Let's go.
	
	Wesker trots off. Vickers and Rodriguez follow. Speyer and
	Barry hang back... with Jill, who remains torn.
	
				WESKER (cont.)
			(Looking back) Valentine. You're
			on the clock! Fall in!
	
	Jill wrestles with her emotions but, in the end, dutifully,
	she "falls in".
	
	As the troopers move off, we hear odd SCRATCHING SOUNDS...
	with the high-pitched SQUEAL of metal-on-metal.
	
	
	Pg-61
	
	
	INT   ARBORETUM  TIMELESS
	
	The beefy "ARMS" of PLANT 42 undulate overhead as CHRIS and
	his COMPANIONS look for an exit.
	
				REBECCA
			Th-this thing was no accident.
			It was cultivated!
	
				CHRIS
			And it didn't rip out the ceiling
			for the fun of it. Stay alert.
	
	The plant seems to behave intelligently, with caution. The
	pods on its "arms" dart, almost as if sniffing... then pull
	back...like the vines in the kitchen, like timid animals.
	
	Chris spots A DOORWAY.
	
				CHRIS (cont.)
			Here.
	
	As the others follow him, one of the pods swoops down in
	front of REBECCA, and doesn't withdraw. It hovers there.
	Its follicle's open like jaws, which display serrated daggers
	of cartilage that look like teeth. Inside, a pulsing calyx
	emits a pistil that twitches and swells.
	
				AIKEN
			My mother made me eat vegetables.
			I know 'em all. This ain't one
			of 'em.
	
				SULLIVAN
			Aiken...
	
	
	ANOTHER POD swoops down on Sullivan's back. Its BEAK clamps
	onto the flesh between his shoulder blades. It's PISTIL
	shoots out like a hypodermic needle, stabs him and, within
	the blink of an eye, SUCKS out every ounce of the man's
	blood. His skin turns the color of PARCHMENT, FLAKING OFF
	HIM like powder, as he dies.
	
				AIKEN
			Sullivan! JESUS, SULLIVAN!
	
	Aiken rushes to his buddy's side.
	
				CHRIS
			Get out of the away!
	
	Chris launches himself off a stone retaining wall around one
	of the gardens. Leaping up, he grabs one of the SPARKING
	CONDUITS and pulls it down.
	
	
	Pg-62
	
				CHRIS (cont.)
			Get OUTA THERE, AIKEN!
	
	Chris ends up having to shoulder Aiken out of the way.
	Tendrils from the plant very nearly get both of them, but
	Chris manages to JAM the semi-rigid conduit into a pool of
	sprinkler-fed WATER around the plant's roots.
	
	A BRIGHT CURRENT stutters through every vine. The plant
	SHRIEKS, hideously, as electricity causes fluids to SQUIRT
	from boils that develop on its flesh, down along its "arms",
	and into its blood-sucking pods...which FLOP, lifeless, to
	the floor, with the same sort of liquid SMACKS that human
	skulls might make.
	
				AIKEN
			They.. .they killed Sullivan. The
			bastards... whoever did this shit...
			they KILLED SULLIVAN!
	
	Enraged, Aiken draws a long-bladed KNIFE and wildly attacks
	the remains of Plant 42, slashing at the thing's dead limbs,
	not stopping until he cuts into...
	
	...something that looks like a vine...but BLEEDS RED!
	Aiken traces the thing with his eyes, up to where it's
	coiled in high tree branches. It's the oversized body...
	...of A COPPERHEAD, with a belly SIX FEET in diameter.
	As Aiken gasps, spellbound, he's STUCK from behind.
	
	The snake is so long, its body is draped on one side of the
	greenhouse, but its head is on the other. With the power
	of a dozer-shovel..JAWS like the open hood of a Cadillac...
	TEETH the size of windows...CLAMP onto Aiken's mid-section,
	instantly CRUSHING his ribs.
	
	Chris finds a skein of ROPE. He throws the long end over a
	ceiling beam, then instantly makes a LASSO out of the piece
	in _is hand and tosses the loop at the snake's head .
	
	Aiken's body, in the serpent's jaws, makes the rope miss.
	Chris throws again. In the seconds between tosses, the snake
	has SLURPED Aiken into its mouth. The rope encircles the
	beast's head. Chris pulls. The noose slips down over the
	snake's maxillaries and tightens around its neck. Chris uses
	all his strength. With the ceiling beam as a pulley, the
	snake's head is SLAMMED against the rafters.
	
				CHRIS
			(To Rebecca) Hold this.
	
	Rebecca is, understandably, not quick to respond.
	
	
	
	Pg-63
	
				CHRIS (cont.)
			GET IN HERE, SOLDIER!
	
	In this crisis, Chris finds himself sounding a lot like
	Wesker. It sobers him. It sobers Rebecca, as well. She
	rushes in and takes hold of the rope.
	
	Moving fast, Chris rushes to where Aiken's knife dropped
	on the floor. He grabs it, turns back, and sees...
	
	...something MOVING inside the snake's beaded torso. It's
	Aiken... still alive.
	
	Chris charges, PLUNGES the knife into the beast, hacking
	through layers of fat until he reaches a bloody CAVITY.
	
	Aiken is curled within, like Jonah in the Whale. His chest
	has been crushed to half its normal size. Acids from the
	monster's intestine have begun to eat through flesh on his hands,
	his face, but he's still conscious, able to wheeze-out words.
	
				AIKEN
			K-kill me. S-Sullvan said...I'd
			be.. .better off dead. That...ain't
			never been truer than now. Kill me!
	
	The snake uses all its strength to lower its head from the
	ceiling. Rebecca hangs bravely onto the rope, but she's
	LIFTED, bodily, off the floor.
	
	The rope SNAPS, cut by the steel beam. Rebecca falls. The
	trailing edge of the noose catches on twisted debris. It
	delays the snake for two seconds.
	
	Those fragile seconds give Chris just enough time to reach
	into the open belly of the monster...and pull the PINS on
	TWO GRENADES that dangle from Aiken's vest.
	
	The giant copperhead SNAPS at Chris from behind, missing him
	by inches. He dives, like a wide-receiver reaching for a
	pass. What he catches is...
	
	...Rebecca's arm. His momentum carries her down to the
	floor. They roll behind another STONE WALL that contains
	tons of earth, which protects them from...
	
	...BOO-BOOOOOM!... the explosions of the grenades... which blow
	Aiken... and yards of the snake's mid-section...into eternity.
	
	
	INT   CONFERENCE ROOM   TIMELESS

			Right behind me. Were you...
			talking to someone?
	
				WESKER
			To Washington. To my... superiors.
			They're your superiors too, Valentine.
			Don't forget that.
	
	Jill wonders. Should she challenge Wesker? She has no time
	to think. More FOOTSTEPS come CLACKING at her back. It's
	RODRIGUEZ and SPEYER. A moment later, BARRY and VICKERS
	appear from the opposite direction.
	
				BARRY
			Nothin'. man. No doors. Nothin'.
			We hit a dead end.
	
				SPEYER
			Us too. Cement wall.
	
				VICKERS
			We're never gonna get to that lab.
	
	
	Pg-65
	
	TCHUNG TCHUNG TCHUNG... a sound like a rivet gun resounds
	in the corridor, repetitive, but random, not rhythmic.
	
	
	INT   ELECTRIC TUNNEL   TIMELESS
	
	CHRIS and REBECCA are crawling through a two-foot high
	feeder-passage for electric cables, their bellies scraping
	the floor, their backs the ceiling. They hear the sound...
	
	...TCHUNG TCHUNG TCHUNG! Then suddenly...it stops.
	
				REBECCA
			(Crying quietly) I... can't take
			this any more.
	
				CHRIS
			We take what comes. That's the
			secret of our genius.
	
	He looks back. Rebecca sniffles.
	
	
				CHRIS (cont.)
			How old are you?
	
				REBECCA
			Not very old at all. Not nearly
			old enough to...to...
	
				CHRIS
			None of us is old enough for that.
	
	Rebecca nods, forcing a smile meant to be appreciative.
	
				REBECCA
			Jill... told me... you were nice .
	
				CHRIS
			She did? She never told me.
	
	That sound returns... TCHUNG TCHUNG TCHUNG...getting louder.
	
	
	INT   RUNWAY   TIMELESS
	
	Down in the corridor, the other TROOPERS see...
	...faintly in the dusty reaches of the dark... AGILE SHAPES
	advancing... not along the floor, but along the CEILING!
	They look like apes, swinging from... What could they be
	swinging from? The ceiling is solid metal.
	
	CLOSE ON: A MONSTROUS HAND, both hairy, and scaly. It's
	fingers have ten-inch claws.. .more like horns... which PUNCH
	upward, penetrating the ceiling metal, and clamping on.
	
	
	
	Pg-66
	
	THE SHOT WIDENS to reveal A BEAST, unlike any we've seen,
	dangling from the ceiling. It is ape-like... and lizard-
	like. With ferocious eyes that glare from beneath an insect-
	like carapace. This thing is an amalgam of all the nasty
	creatures that have pursued us in our nightmares. It's
	called... A HUNTER.
	
	There are SIX OF THEM... as far as we can see, there might be
	more coming from behind. Their three-toed feet also have
	claws that can pierce the ceiling, enabling them to move
	forward... hand over foot, foot over hand.
	
	One of them lets out a GRRROWLLLL! The same sound we've
	been hearing through the walls. Now it echos in the
	corridor, up close and personal. The troopers open fire,
	even before the creatures get in range.
	
	
	INT   ELECTRIC TUNNEL   TIMELESS
	
	CHRIS and REBECCA hear the gunfire.
	
				CHRIS
			Hurry.
	
	Chris crawls on. Rebecca is stopped when... TCHUNNNNGGG !
	One of the HUNTERS' CLAWS PUNCHES up through the floor ,
	almost stabbing her. Rebecca SCREAMS. In the tight space,
	Chris is barely able to reach back and take her hand.
	
	TCHUNNNNGG! TGG! More CLAWS penetrate the metal.
	The couple plunge ahead of them, the way Chris plunged
	ahead of the bullets on Level "A".
	
	INT   RUNWAY   TIMELESS
	
	WESKER, JILL and the OTHERS spit lead at the advancing
	creatures. Bullets THUNK into their bodies. Blood flows,
	but the creatures seem to feel no pain. Even when they're
	hit squarely in their skulls.
	
				BARRY
			Head shots. Ain't doin' nothin'!
	
				WESKER
			That was the idea.
	
				BARRY
			What idea?
	
				WESKER
			To win. The idea was... to win.
	
	
	Pg-67
	
	Jill aims at one of the hunters, pressing the trigger of
	her M-16, and not letting go until her clip runs out.
	The creature's head is turned RAGGED by the barrage...
	revealing an iron SUPERSTRUCTURE beneath the skin.
	
				VOICE (o.s.)
			Now that... is a metal-head.
	
	Jill looks up. CHRIS jumps out of the open grate in the
	ceiling. REBECCA jumps down after him.
	
				CHRIS (cont.)
			What d'ya think? Should I wait
			for orders, or just wing it?
	
				JILL
			Wing it!
	
				CHRIS
			You know...that just might be
			the ticket. Wing the fuckers.
	
	Chris takes a careful SHOT with-his Winchester. He hits one
	of the Hunters squarely on its WRIST...which SNAPS. The
	creature drops to the floor.
	
				CHRIS (cont.)
			Forget the head shots. They're
			useless. Shoot for the joints.
			The JOINTS!
	
	Rebecca opens FIRE with Aiken's M-16, giving the others time
	to reload. Barry is the first to resume firing...at the
	closest of the Hunters... at its wrists, which are SNAPPED
	by the bullets. The creature drops to the floor.
	
	The troopers fire at KNEES, ANKLES, ELBOWS, which seem to
	be the weakest spots. More of the hunters drop from the
	ceiling...but they continue to advance, crawling, pushing
	themselves forward with whatever limbs remain intact.
	
				SPEYER
			Run! We slowed 'em down. Run!
	
				BARRY
			Where? As far as we'll get, either
			way, is a cement wall.
	
	There are two hunters left on the ceiling. One of them makes
	a mighty, impossible LUNGE... and hits Speyer like a battering
	ram, slashing his CHEST OPEN with its claws.
	
	Two of the hunters on the floor rush forward, not attacking,
	but wanting to feed on Speyer's remains.
	
	
	Pg-68
	
	Brad, trembling, completely crazed, drops his weapon and
	backs away. He sees...one of those jigsaw tiles, a RED
	one, GLOW from within. He thinks he's hallucinating until...
	
	...the floor JERKS, in a tight spasm. Its steel facets
	begin to separate, sliding away from each other. The
	troopers narrowly escape as.. .
	
	...the floor behind them GRINDS, in and out, left and right,
	as if it were CHEWING. Speyer's body, and those of the
	hunters on the floor, are EATEN by the powerful steel blades.
	But one hunter remains above it all. TCHUNG TCHUNG TCHUNG,
	it continues to advance along the ceiling.
	
	An invisible, JIGSAWED DOOR glides open twenty yards down
	the hall. The troopers run for it, and are met by a
	beautiful Asian scientist... the woman we saw on the video
	playback... ADA WONG.
	
				ADA
			You lost a man. If I had only
			been faster. I was unfamiliar
			with the mechanism.
	
	TCHUNG TCHUNG... the Hunter approaches .
	
				ADA (cont.)
			God. One of them... is still ..
			Quickly. Inside. Quickly!
	
	The troopers rush into...
	
	
	INT   CUBICLE   TIMELESS
	
	...a security cubicle. CHRIS is the last to enter, barely
	making it before the door begins to slide shut.
	KA-TCHUNK! CLAWS penetrate the opening.
	
				ADA
			Don't worry, it's mindless. It
			doesn't realize that it's strong
			enough to push the door open.
	
				BARRY (cont.)
			Sometimes the dumb get lucky.
	
				RODRIGUEZ
			Hasn't happened to me, yet.
	
	The Hunter GROWLS. Its snout darkens the space between door
	and wall. Mucous from its nostrils spits through.
	
	
	
	Pg-69
	After a terrifying moment, the claw recedes. The dark
	snout disappears. The snorting fades away. Followed by
	a distant...TCHUNG TCHUNG TCHUNG...as the hunter departs.
	Everyone relaxes, visibly.
	
	The troopers turn and, for the first time, notice two haggard
	SCIENTISTS standing across the room.
	
				ADA
			My... colleagues. Benjamin. Toshiro.
			As far as we know, we are the...only
			ones.. .left alive. We worked on "C"
			level. One of the biologists saved us.
			Brought us down here. He knew that...
			he didn't have long to live. He...
			started the mechanism... out there,
			in the corridor.. .and he let it...
			take him.
	
	Ada stares at a complicated control panel.
	
				ADA (cont.)
			I only saw it used that one time.
			Or perhaps...I could have been
			faster. The man...you lost...
	
				RODRIGUEZ
			You did fine, lady. We're obliged.
	
				ADA
			As are we. (Sighing) We believed...
			we would die here. Believed...the
			bomb would destroy us.
	 
				 JILL
			You knew.. .about the bomb?
	
				ADA
			The end for a place like this, when
			it fails... must be a bomb, yes?
	
	Jill looks at Chris. His point has been proven.
	
				ADA (cont.)
			But now... that you are here... the
			bomb will not come.
	
				CHRIS
			It... already came. ma'am. We
			brought it. The colonel, here...
			he's wearing it.
	
	Ada looks at the detonator on Wesker's belt, at the sequence
	of blinking lights.
	
	
	70
	
				ADA
			(To Wesker) Is it true? Are you
			here to... rescue? Or destroy?
	
				WESKER
			Both. (With that odd smile of his)
			If I have to pick only one... I'll
			pick destroy.
	
				ADA
			You're not S.T.A.R.S. You're Umbrella.
	
				WESKER
			Once again. Both. (Still smiling)
			Two salaries. Three if you count
			combat pay.
	
	Ada looks at him with disgust.
	
				ADA
			The man I loved, John Marcus...
			developed the organism that caused
			all this. He... he did it for
			humanitarian purposes. It was
			taken away from him...for in-human
			purposes...by men like you!
	
				WESKER
			No, ma'am. Men like me... are just
			errand boys. Sent in to do the
			wet-work. All of the glory. None
			of the benefits.
	
				ADA
			After what you've seen down here,
			do you think any of it could be
			turned into... benefit?
	
				WESKER
			Yes. I think it could be turned
			into five or ten million dollars.
			How do we get into "D" lab?
	
				ADA
			Death lab. (She slumps) John
			was killed...never even knowing it
			existed. They kept him... isolated,
			upstairs, while a separate team was
			down here...corrupting his research.
			Using it to build B.O.W.s.
	
				CHRIS
			B.O.W.s?
	
	
	Pg-71
	
				ADA
			Bio-organic weapons.
	
				REBECCA
			The sharks. The plant.
	
				ADA
			Early experiments.
	
				CHRIS
			The snake.
	
				ADA
			A failure. Its behavior remained
			reptilian. All they could ever get
			it to do was... grow in size.
	
				RODRIGUEZ
			Those dogs. They were weapons.
	
				ADA
			No. They... simply became infected.
			As did... everyone else. Janitors.
			The cook. Electricians. Guards.
			People who believed they were serving
			their flag. Scientists. Great minds...
			turned into mindless.. .ghouls!
	
				CHRIS
			Before the outbreak, the experiments
			went further, didn't they? Those...
			ceiling-crawlers out there.. .
	
				ADA
			The product of human DNA spliced
			with the DNA of vicious carnivores...
			animals, even insects. Plated with
			armor, beneath newly cultivated skin.
			Then... injected with poison, so their
			biological components would die.
	
				JILL
			Die.
	
				ADA
			The "T"-virus reactivates them in a
			matter of minutes, but... in battle,
			lost minutes are... inconvenient. So,
			the B.O.W.s had to die... and be allowed
			to revive before they could be used to...
			full advantage. They were murdered...
			by their own people... so they could
			never be murdered again... by the enemy.
	
	
	Pg-72
	
	
				CHRIS
			Were any more of these...weapons...
			developed?
	
	Ada is about to answer, but Wesker interrupts.
	
				WESKER
			HOW DO WE GET INTO "D" LAB?
	
				ADA
			You don't.
	
	Ada glances at an innocuous wall panel. Wesker notices a
	key-slot. Green.
	
				ADA (cont.)
			It can't be opened. Thank God.
			None of us is cleared for that
			level of security.
	
				WESKER
			How fortunate... that I am.
	
	Wesker steps over to the wall and inserts his green card into
	the slot. The panel slides open. Beyond it is a steel door
	with another green slot. Wesker uses his card again. A lock
	CLICKS. Wesker pushes the door open.
	
				WESKER (cont.)
			Barry. Come with me. The rest of
			you.. .make sure this door doesn't
			close. Remember...
	
	Wesker taps his ear-piece. Everyone gets his meaning. He
	and Barry disappear through the opening. The steel door
	begins to close. Rodriguez lunges, and catches it.
	
				ADA
			Have...you been leaving doors open?
	
				JILL
			Yes.
	
				ADA
			This place is going to be overrun by...
	
				REBECCA
			Brad's in really bad shape.
	
	Brad is leaning against a wall, sweating, shivering. Rebecca
	looks at his wounded leg.
	
				REBECCA (cont.)
			That's not just a scrape. You
			were bitten, weren't you?
	
	
	
	Pg-73
	
				VICKERS
			One...of the sharks. Its teeth.
			I Just...brushed up against its
			teeth...after it was dead.
	
				ADA
			(Alert) Shoot him. Somebody,
			shoot him!
	
				JILL
			No! We're so close. The antidote.
	
	
	INT   STAIRWELL   TIMELESS
	
	WESKER and BARRY trot down a flight of metal stairs.
	
				BARRY
			What's got into you man? This...
			this isn't like you.
	
				WESKER
			Oh, yes, this is exactly like me.
	
	Until now, Wesker has been steadfast. He suddenly seems
	nervous, anxious. Some of it is fear. Most of it is
	anticipation of the goal which is suddenly within reach.
	
				WESKER (cont.)
			This is...what I've been all my life.
			A guy... suckin' up to the honchos.
			Wipin' the shit off their asses...
			all the while lookin' for a break.
			A way to get some of my own! Well
			this it, friend. I'm myself,
			alright. And I know exactly what
			I'm doing. I told you...before this
			day was over... I'd pay you back.
	
	INT   CUBICLE   TIMELESS
	
	CHRIS and JILL step past RODRIGUEZ. They take off down the
	stairs.
	
	As they leave, ADA opens a desk drawer and pulls out a .45.
	
				RODRIGUEZ
			(Looking at the gun) You know
			how to use that thing, chica?
	
				ADA
			Of course I do. I'm a scientist.
	
	Pg-74
	
	Ada CLICKS back the bolt, whips up the .45, and aims it at
	BRAD'S head. REBECCA dives in front of the man.
	
				REBECCA
			No! You can't! Not while there's
			still a chance to save him!
	
	
	INT   SAFETY CHAMBER   "D" LAB   TIMELESS
	
	WESKER and BARRY arrive at a set of PLEXIGLASS DOORS. They
	can't see through them, they're FOGGED. Wesker finds a key
	slot, inserts his access card, and...
	
	...WHOOSH... the doors open. A CLOUD OF HYPER-COLD MIST
	rushes out, instantly coating the men in FROST. Wesker
	doesn't feel the cold. He doesn't feel anything, except
	a surge of triumph. He steps through the opening into...
	
	
	INT "D" LAB TIMELESS
	
	...a laboratory that looks like-the cockpit of a Concorde...
	only a hundred times larger.. Nothing is, recognizable, except
	desks that hold futuristic-Ibokin computers. A befuddling
	array of BUTTONS, SWITCHES, stuttering LIGHTS, covers every
	inch of wall space.
	
	And at the center of it all stands a tall, cylindrical TANK,
	a stasis tube, filled with ICE. It's mounted on a six-foot
	tall platform, like an altar, with cables and flexible tubes
	running out of it. Wesker squints, and through the freeze,
	sees the thing that stands sedated within the cylinder...
	
	...THE TYRANT. It's nine feet tall. Like the hunters, it
	has more or less human form, though it's musculature is more
	defined than Superman's. One of its arms is scaled to size,
	but the other is much longer. Its hand dangles at knee-
	level. Monstrous steel CLAWS depend from its fingers,
	nearly touching the floor.
	
				WESKER
			(In awe) It's called... the Tyrant.
			Nobody knows it exists. Except us...
			and Holden.
	
				BARRY
			Holden?
	
				WESKER
			Umbrella's man in D.C. We need him.
			He signs the checks. (Excited) We've
			got it, Barry! Our fortune!
	
	
	Pg-75
	
				BARRY
			You're not gonna try to get this
			big mother outta here ?
	
				WESKER
			Don't have to. All we need is the
			data. Then.. .these things can be
			cranked out on an assembly line!
	
	Laying down his automatic, WESKER hits computer keys until
	a DISK pops out of a master-feed.
	
				WESKER (cont.)
			YES! This is it!
	
				BARRY
			What about the antidote?
	
				WESKER
			Antidote? (Laughing) There is no
			antidote. That was just happy horse
			shit, to keep the team going.
	
	Neither man notices... that the removal of the master disk has
	caused certain systems to fail... indicated by red lights, and
	by the fact that... the walls of the Tyrant's cylinder are
	beginning to run liquid sweat. The ice... is MELTING.
	
				BARRY
			You're gonna give this to Umbrella?
	
				WESKER
			No. I'm gonna sell it to them. Then
			I'm gonna open a Swiss bank account...
			right next to yours.
	
				JILL (o.s.)
			God...damn!
	
	JILL has appeared in the doorway with CHRIS. They both
	at the monster with awe...and terror.
	
				JILL (cont.)
			That thing... can't be real!
	
				WESKER
			It's real, alright. And it's worth...
			more than gold. More than uranium!
	
				RODRIGUEZ
			Do we get a piece of that action?
	
	ROSIE has arrived. So have REBECCA, ADA, and the two
	surviving SCIENTISTS.
	
	Pg-76
	
				WESKER
			All of you do. Anyone who comes out
			of this alive... gets a taste.
	
				RODRIGUEZ (o.s.)
			I'm in. I been eatin' shit all my
			life. I'm happy to eat some more...
			as long as it's got some gravy on it.
	
	Rosie steps into the lab, her weapon ready.
	
				WESKER
			Anybody else see it my way?
	
	One of the scientists, TOSHIRO, rushes to join.
	
				ADA
			(To Toshiro) You disgrace yourself!
	
				TOSHIRO
			I...I want to live.
	
				WESKER
			Smart. Anyone else? Valentine?
	
	Jill looks at Chris. Then she steps through the doorway and
	takes a defensive post beside her c.o.
	
				CHRIS
			And I was gonna try to disarm the
			bomb. This place should be destroyed!
			It needs to be destroyed!
	
	Chris lifts his rifle. Wesker is faster with his pistol,
	aiming it at Chris' belly.
	
				WESKER
			Gotcha, son. It's only because
			of Valentine, here, that I didn't
			squeeze the trigger.
	
	Chris and Jill exchange dagger eyes.
	
				CHRIS
			If she's on your side... she doesn't
			mean shit to me. And I don't mean
			shit to her.
	
				JILL
			Chris, please. There's only... one
			way to go, here .
	
				WESKER
			That's right. My way!
	
	
	Pg-77
	
	
				JILL
			Yes, sir. Your way!
	
	Jill presses in close to Wesker, as if completely allied.
	
				JILL (cont.)
			I...can't yell you, Chris...how much
			I wanted...things to have turned out
			differently. (Beat) Goodbye.
	
	Swiftly, unexpectedly, Jill snatches the detonator wire and
	pulls the sensor out of Wesker's ear.
	
	Everyone shuts their eyes, expecting to be blown sky-high.
	
	Nothing happens.
	
	Jill pulls the detonator off Wesker's belt. She stares
	small LED screen which reads... 14:42:16... 15... 14...
	
				JILL (cont.)
			Shit. I got all my courage up...
			and we still have fifteen minutes!
	
	Jill tosses the detonator to Chris. Wesker turns on her,
	lifting his M-16...
	
				BARRY
			You shoot. I shoot, boss.
	
	Wesker turns to find Barry's weapon aiming at his belly.
	
				BARRY (cont.)
			Shit.. here I am still callin'
			you 'boss'.
	
	Wesker is holding the data-disk. Suddenly, he feels it
	snatched away...by Ada, who has rushed into the room.
	
	He aims his weapon at her back as she darts away. Before
	he can fire, he's KICKED in the head... by Jill. Buckling,
	dazed, he looks up at her.
	
				JILL
			We believed in you. I believed
			in you. Boy, was I a sucker.
	
	She kicks him again, just for the hell of it. He flops on
	the floor, his eye-socket swollen. He's dropped his gun.
	
	He gropes for it. Barry steps in and boots it away.
	
	A KLAXON SOUNDS! Emergency!
	
	The ice in the Tyrant's tank has melted down to a critical
	level. The monster... is beginning to MOVE.
	
	
	Pg-78
	
	Reaching the doorway, Ada hears a mechanism TRIP in the jamb.
	The Plexiglas doors begin to slide shut. Ada strains to
	hold them back.
	
				ADA
			Get out! Now! Or you never will!
	
				RODRIGUEZ
			So... we'll live here! (Glancing at
			the Tyrant) No. The landlord looks
			like a sonuvabitch.
	
	Rosie rushes in to help Ada hold the doors. So does
	BENJAMIN, the second of the surviving scientists, who is...
	...MAULED from behind by a ZOMBIE. It's not just any zombie.
	It's BRAD VICKERS, back from death, who BITES out the artery
	in Benjamin's neck.
	
				ADA
			I TOLD YOU... TO SHOOT HIM!
	
	Ada lifts her .45 and blows Vickers way. She looks down
	at Benjamin, writhing on the floor, aims at his head... and
	FIRES again.
	
	Rodriguez is the only one holding the doors. Jill rushes
	to help her.
	
				JILL
			Everybody! OUT!
	
				CHRIS
			(Off the LED) Thirteen minutes.
	
	Inside the lab, Barry turns to Toshiro, the other scientist.
	
				BARRY
			Go.
	
	Toshiro hesitates... a second too long. KRAAASSSH! The
	stasis tube BURSTS open. WATER and bits of ICE fly out...
	along with an enormous, bionic HAND. Big-enough to grab
	Toshiro's head as if it were a cantaloupe. Powerful enough
	to CRUSH that head as if it were... well, a cantaloupe.
	
	Wesker, still searching for his pistol, sees all this.
	
	The Tyrant is not completely free. Much of the cylinder
	wall has cracked away, but sections of it cling to a now
	misshapen mass of ice that still holds the monster bound.
	Though it won1t for much longer.
	
	Wesker starts toward the door. Barry grabs the back of his
	shirt and pitches him across the lab.
	
	
	Pg-79
	
				BARRY (cont.)
			You and me... we ain't goin' nowhere.
			Not just now, boss.
	
	Barry turns to the others clustered at the doorway.
	
				BARRY (cont.)
			This thing gets loose, it's gonna
			be pissed. Somebody's gotta hold it
			back. Give you guys a fair chance.
	
				JILL
			LOOK OUT!
	
	Wesker has found his pistol. He FIRES at Barry who, ducking,
	is only GRAZED. Wesker aims at the group in the doorway.
	Barry pops out from behind a desk and shoots back at him.
	
	Ada and Rebecca duck away from the doors, pulling Rodriguez
	and a reluctant Jill after them. The doors begin to slide
	closed. Chris valiantly tries to prevent them from shutting.
	
	Wesker CRAWLS lke a dog. He manages to fling an arm
	out through the opening. Steel bumpers press on the meat
	of his forearm. Wesker looks up. Through the Plexiglas,
	his eyes meet Chris'.
	
				WESKER
			Get me outta here, Redfield. Or so
			help me God, you're a dead man.
	
	With his free hand, Wesker aims his pistol at Chris. The gun
	barrel is an intimidating sight, even though it's on the other
	side of the plexi. Chris glances at the others.
	
				CHRIS
			Get going.
	
				JILL
			Not without...
	
				CHRIS
			MOVE!
	
	Ada, Rebecca and Rodriguez wrestle Jill away bodily, and
	start up the metal stairway.
	
				WESKER
			COME BACK! RODRIGUEZ! VALENTINE!
			THAT'S AN ORDER !
	
				CHRIS

	Chris lets go. The doors squeeze tighter. Wesker SCREAMS.
	
	Through the plexi, Chris catches a glimpse of Barry, who
	stands and gives him a military salute. Chris salutes back.
	
	BLAM BLAM BLAM... Wesker FIRES three rounds. Dusty blemishes
	appear on the bulletproof glass. The slugs ricochet back
	into the lab.
	
	One of them CHIPS away at the ICE which is less and less
	able to contain the Tyrant.
	
	Chris makes a break for the stairs. Wesker twists his body
	in an attempt to push his pistol through the opening, but his
	fist, around the stock, is too thick. Nonetheless, Wesker
	FIRES .BLAM BLAM BLAM... bullets SCREAM off the banister
	rails, but none of them contact Chris' legs which disappear
	up the stairs.
	
	The ice in the stasis tube is turning to slush. The Tyrant
	is about to break loose. Wesker looks pleadingly at Barry.
	
				WESKER
			B-buddy. You gotta get us out.
	
				BARRY
			Not sure I know how, boss. Do you?
			Is there some other...'need-to-know'
			secret for shutting down the Big
			Bopper, here?
	
				WESKER
			No. It.. it can't be shut down.
	 
				BARRY
			The ultimate warrior. The ultimate
			soldier. We'll see. How it does
			against a couple of hard-ass career
			guys, like you and me.
	
	WESKER swings his free arm and aims his pistol at BARRY.
	CLICK! The gun is empty.

			You won't come out in the same place.
			But you'll find a freight loader that

				JILL
			...a blue key. I hope.
	
				ADA
			No. Pot blue or green. Red.
	
	Ada pulls a RED KEY from under her lab coat, snaps the chain
	on her neck, and holds it out to Chris.
	
				ADA (cont.)
			I took it from an Umbrella agent
			assigned to us here. He died...

			Yes.

			So... you could have unlocked "D" lab.
	
				ADA
			I was hoping it would never be un-
			locked again. Go. I will see that

			is destroyed.
	
	Chris grabs Ada's arm and holds it tight while he wrenches
	the disk away from her.
	
	He folds it over onto itself, drops it to the floor, and
	pumps three Winchester rounds into it.
	
				CHRIS
			It's destroyed. It's worthless
			But you're not.
	
				ADA
			I helped develop it!

			Unwittingly. They lied to you.

			It was evil!
	
	Ada looks deeply into Chris' eyes.
	
				CHRIS (cont.)
			The kind of evil that... resides

			Unless we stand up against it.

			Stand up? Against powers that have...
			ruled the world since before we were

			Or locked away someplace else. I'd

	Jill takes a step toward Ada.
	
				JILL
			What if it's already spread? You're
			the only one...who knew anything
			about it.
	
				ADA
			(The thought penetrating) But, I...
			know so little.

			More than anyone else. You have...
			a responsibility.
	
				JILL
			To a higher command. The highest.
	
	She and Chris touch eyes again, this time with understanding.
	
	
	INT   "D" LAB   TIMELESS
	
	THE TYRANT flexes its monumental muscles. The ice around
	it CRACKS... but clings. The giant HEART dangling outside
	its chest PUMPS rapidly...sending fluids through exposed
	synthetic veins that run to the creature's brain.
	
				BARRY
			That's one helluva big pump.

				WESKER
			An implant.
	
				BARRY
			From what? A fuckin' elephant?
	
				WESKER
			Rhinoceros.
	
				BARRY
			Shit. I figured you knew more than

	Barry FIRES at the encased organ. His bullets bounce off the
	shielding with no effect.
	
				BARRY (cont.)
			How do we kill this thing?
	
				WESKER
			I told you, we don't. W-we can't.
			It's unstoppable!
	
	More ICE pops off the monster's pectorals.

				CHRIS
			Just get us upstairs. I'll take
			care of it from there.
	
				ADA
			Alright. (With a sigh) Come.
	
	They break out, at the run, klacking along the faceted steel
	floor of the movable... and still moving.. .corridor.
	
	KRUNNNGGG! They're nearly knocked off their feet when the
	system suddenly STOPS DEAD.
	
	Ada slams her fist into one of those JIGSAW TILES on the
	wall. Another RED one, which glows from within.
	
	A PANEL grinds open, revealing...
	
	
	
	Pg-84
	
	INT   FREIGHT CORRIDOR   TIMELESS
	
	...a more natural-looking corridor. Half-way along, there
	are STEEL PRONGS that protrude from a wall. The group starts
	toward them...but stops when a soul-shriveling SOUND fills
	the passageway...the hungry MOANING of things that are dead.
	
				ADA
			Doors... were left open.
	
	INT   "D" LAB   TIMELESS
	
	The TYRANT BREAKS free of the last bit of restricting ice.
	WESKER FREAKS. Whimpering, he gropes with his hand that's
	outside the Plexiglas doors. He grabs something. A BOOT.
	Brad Vickers' boot. Wesker tugs on it.
	
	BARRY opens fire on the Tyrant, full bore, with his M-16.
	The stream of bullets does nothing except make the monster
	notice the big man.
	
	
	INT   FREIGHT CORRIDOR   TIMELESS
	
	THE ESCAPEES run down the corridor. SHAPES appear at the
	far end. ZOMBIES! Twenty. Thirty. Forty. More. The
	walking remains of humans who were infected in the labs,
	crawling over each other, hungry for living flesh.
	
	The humans reach the FREIGHT LOADER. Prongs, like those on
	a fork lift, extend from a heavy chain-drive that runs up
	and down through openings in the floor and ceiling.
	ADA swipes her red key through a slot and pushes a button.
	The chain-drive Grinds upward, hoisting the prongs.
	
				ADA
			Step on.
	
	Ada pushes REBECCA onto the next set of prongs that come up
	out of the floor. The footing is precarious. Rebecca has
	to hold on to the chain as she is hoisted.
	
	The lift moves slowly, eight feet separating each set of
	prongs.
	
	The ghouls continue to press in.
	
				JILL
			I don't know if it's gonna happen.
	
				RODRIGUEZ
			Come on. I been waitin' all day
			for somthin. like this.
	
	
	Pg-85
	
	Rosie opens FIRE. Chris and Jill follow suit as Ada steps
	onto the next set of prongs.
	
	Blood FLIES. Skulls SHATTER. Front ranks drop. Zombies
	from behind push their fallen comrades ahead of them. The
	corridor is like a syringe filled with corrupted bodies,
	pushing inexorably forward.
	
	Rosie, teeth gritted, keeps firing while Chris forces Jill
	onto the next set of prongs. As she rises, she hands her
	M-16 to Chris. He slings it on his arm while levering his
	old Winchester, making each of his shots count, until the
	next set of prongs rises out of the floor.
	
				CHRIS
			(To Rosie) You're up.
	
				RODRIGUEZ
			I'm havin' too much fun. You got
			a lady. I just got me. Anyway...
			I ain't gonna die in this rat hole.
			I'll make it. Get outta here.
	
	Chris hands Jill's rifle to Rosie, who fires with both hands
	as Chris jumps onto the lift.
	
	Zombies are MOWED DOWN. But more come. The syringe keeps
	pressing.
	
	The next prongs rise. Rosie steps on, still blasting..
	The first zombies reach her. Shooting down, she blows them
	away. But more come, grabbing her legs, grabbing the chains,
	ROCKING the prongs. Rosie nearly falls. She drops one of
	the rifles in order to hold on. She carefully picks off the
	most threatening zombies. Miraculously, she rises out of
	their reach, and into...
	
	
	INT   FREIGHT SHAFT   TIMELESS
	
	...a very tight, very dark SPACE with sheet metal walls that
	have been bruised by loads of freight. The rumble of the
	chain-drive ECHOES frighteningly.
	
	ABOVE ROSIE, THE OTHERS rise slowly... very slowly... feeling
	apprehensive, vulnerable. REBECCA, at the top, looks up and
	sees LIGHT spilling through an opening through which she is
	about to pass.
	
				ADA
			(Calling up to her) Level "C".
			Have your weapons ready.
	
				RODRIGUEZ
			(From below) Whoop-de-doo.
	
	
	Pg-86
	
	Rebecca's eyes rise above the floor of Level "C". All seems
	quiet... but who knows what might be lurking.
	
	
	INT "D" LAB TIMELESS
	
	THE TYRANT, still a bit sluggish, steps down from the
	platform that supported its tank. BARRY jams in a fresh
	clip and keeps firing at the thing. The Tyrant, impervious,
	stalks after the big trooper.
	
	Wesker is still on the floor, his arm through the doors,
	tugging on Vickers' boot.
	
	The flesh on Wesker's forearm is PEELED by the bumpers as
	he uses all his strength to drag Vickers' body closer...
	until the boot winds up in the opening, preventing the doors
	from closing.
	Wesker manages to pull his bloody arm free. He rushes to
	a computer console and types a request for the "T"-virus.
	
				BARRY
			Get under a desk, man. I'm gonna
			feed this thing a pineapple.
	
	Barry pulls a GRENADE from his belt.
	
				WESKER
			NO! It might damage the system!
			I've got to get this data!
	
	Wesker's M-16 has been lying, where he left it, on the
	console. He picks it up.
	
				BARRY
			Forget it. Bullets don't work!
	
	Barry is about to pull the pin on the grenade when Wesker
	triggers off A BURST...into BARRY'S GUT!
	
				WESKER
			They seem to work just fine.
	
	Barry is BLASTED across the lab.
	
	The Tyrant makes its first quick move... making us appreciate
	how fast and powerful it really is. It swipes at Barry's
	body as it flies through the air, catching it in it's steel
	claw. We hears BONES SNAP as Barry goes limp.
	
				WESKER (cont.)
			That's it. Take a little lunch
			break, Mr. "T". I just need a few
			more seconds.
	
	Pg-87
	
	The Tyrant lifts Barry's body, as if it were as light as a
	feather, up to its snout. Recognizing that the man is dead,
	the monster FLINGS him aside like so much garbage... and
	begins to lumber toward Wesker.
	
				WESKER (cont.)
			(To the computer) Come on, come on.. .
	
	A monitor reads: 90% COMPLETE...95%...98%. Wesker rests
	a finger on the button to eject a floppy.
	
	The Tyrant is getting closer by the second. Wesker FIRES
	a burst at it which only slows it for a heartbeat.
	
	100%.. .TRANSFER COMPLETED. Wesker ejects the floppy, jams
	it into his flack-jacket, and, FIRING another burst, runs
	for the door. The Tyrant has to move around desks and
	computer consoles to catch him.
	
	Wesker shoves his M-16 through the space that's being held
	open by Vickers' boot. He begins to pry the opening wider.
	A WARNING BUZZER goes off. The Tyrant dimly registers
	the sound. Its eyes dilate, like camera shutters, with
	a CLI-CLICK. It strides forward at top peed, PITCHING
	DESKS easily aside, SMASHING through a CONSOLE as if it
	were made of balsa.
	
	Wesker has pried the doors wide. The Tyrant is coming at
	him FAST. It's going to be very close.
	
	Wesker MAKES IT. He gets outside. The doors begin to glide
	shut. He LAUGHS!
	
				WESKER (cont.)
			EAT SHIT, YOU...
	
	THLANNG! The Tyrant's long, bionic CLAWS SHOOT, with the
	speed of switch-blades, through the opening, just before the
	doors meet. FOUR of the claws SKEWER WESKER, passing clean
	through him.
	
	He doesn't die instantly. He's still alive and SCREAMING
	when the Tyrant uses the same hand, with Wesker impaled on
	it, to PUSH the doors open wide again. The action causes
	WESKER'S HEAD to be SLICED OFF by one of the steel bumpers.
	The Tyrant steps out of the lab. As the doors glide shut,
	the monster holds the remainder of Wesker's body inside
	their path.
	
	The bumpers are stopped by the Tyrant's iron hand... which
	it extracts, letting the doors scrape the dead meat from
	its claws.

	THE CORRIDOR on Level "B" is long and narrow, with only
	occasional pools of LIGHT from bare, overhanging bulbs.
	REBECCA rises, like a spirit, out of the floor. She lifts
	her weapon. Her eyes dart, looking for dangers. There are
	none. The corridor, while very spooky, is quiet.
	
				REBECCA
			Don't see anything.
	
				ADA
			Good.
	
	
	INT   FREIGHT SHAFT   TIMELESS
	
	REBECCA rises through the ceiling.
	
				ADA
			We're almost there. You'll have
			to jump off. The belt won't stop.
	
	As the ECHO of Ada's voice rings off, Rebecca looks up and...
	...SCREEEE... SOMETHING dives down on her out of the darkness.
	She ducks, almost losing her balance. She clings to the
	chain as OTHER THINGS...black, relatively small.. .WHIP past
	her head.
	
				REBECCA
			Bats! There are bats in here!
	
				ADA
			No. They're crows! Infected!
			Don't let them bite you!
	
	Rebecca dodges with new urgency as the black birds dive past
	her. Looking up, she sees more coming. She aims her M-16
	and fires up the shaft. TWO BIRDS are HIT. They plummet.
	One hits ADA. She swats it aside. It drops all the way
	down to ROSIE, who JUMPS, gasping, when it hits her.
	
				RODRIGUEZ
			Rats. FLYING RATS!
	
	
	Pg-89
	
	Beneath her, Rosie sees the crows hovering in the light from
	Level "B"... They circle, then start to fly up again.
	Rosie opens fire, filling the shaft with ribbons of lead.
	Another BIRD dives from above and... SKIT... takes a chunk
	out of Rosie's cheek.
	
				RODRIGUEZ (cont.)
			AAAH ! YOU FUCKER !
	
				CHRIS
			(From above) You alright?
	
				RODRIGUEZ
			Yeah. I'm cool. I'm... cool.
	
	Rosie keeps FIRING. The deafening SOUND of her M-16 keeps
	her from hearing a...
	
	...KRATTCH...in the sheet-metal wall. A second later...
	
	...RRRRRIPPP! The metal is torn open like tissue-paper.
	
	SOMETHING dark lunges from the opening. It's the surviving
	HUNTER! One of its steel claws GRABS the chain-drive. The
	mechanism stops dead.
	
	QUICK CUTS: of THE ESCAPEES slipping, nearly falling, as they
	hang on to the chain.
	
				REBECCA
			I thought it wasn't supposed to stop.
	
				ADA
			Climb out. OUT!
	
	Rebecca has nearly reached Level "A"... She's able to hoist
	herself up, and roll to safety.
	
	Ada tries to climb. The chain is GREASY. Her hands slip.
	BELOW, the Hunter lets go of the mechanism. The chain JERKS.
	The escapees nearly lose their balance again.
	
	Rosie, at the bottom, is being lifted toward the Hunter's
	free hand. She JUMPS down. Barely catching the next set
	of prongs beneath her.
	
	AT THE TOP, Ada reaches Level "A". Rebecca catches her and
	pulls her up onto Level "A..
	
	Jill is next, rising slowly. Rebecca and Ada reach down and
	grab her arms just as... TCHUNG... the mechanism stops again.
	The Hunter has grabbed the chain again. Its free hand
	swings, clutching at Rosie, who crouches, avoiding capture.
	
	
	
	Pg-90
	
	Jill is pulled to safety. She turns and reaches down for
	Chris, who starts to climb the chain, his hands slipping on
	the grease.
	
				CHRIS
			ROSIE!?
	
				RODRIGUEZ
			I'M ALRIGHT!
	
	She's not alright. She's trapped. She can't get up past
	the Hunter. She FIRES at the thing. Bullets BOUNCE off its
	protective steel under-hide.
	
	Chris climbs three feet. Slides back two. The others reach
	down from above. Their hands come within inches, but can't
	quite catch hold of him.
	
				RODRIGUEZ (cont.)
			Here! Here, you... lizard. You
			fuckin' cockroach, HERE!
	
	Straining to reach Rosie, the hunter lets go of the chain
	for a second, then latches on again. That second lifts
	Chris to within reach of Jill and the others. They grab
	his arms. Lift him up.
	
	That second has also brought Rosie within reach of the
	Hunter. Its claws COMB her hair as she tries to duck lower
	while keeping her balance on the prongs.
	
	THWAKK! SOMETHING crashes through the wall. A MONSTROUS
	CLAW that IMPALES the Hunter. It's the claw of THE TYRANT!
	
	The chain mechanism begins to rise again. Rosie, cringing,
	is lifted past the monster just as it leans its head and
	shoulders into the shaft to examine what it has caught.
	
	Disappointed, the Tyrant SCRAPES the Hunter off its claw.
	It drops away down the shaft.
	
	The Tyrant turns its CLICKING, dilating eyes up at Rosie,
	and...TCHUNNNGG...purposely STOPS the rising chain.

	Rosie DIVES off the prongs...directly at the Tyrant. With
	another lightning move, the monster catches her in its bionic

	rust, dirt, from years of idleness. Cobwebs are pulled
	apart and...DAYLIGHT APPEARS!

			GET UP!
	
	CHRIS pushes JILL toward the ladder. She pulls on Ada's arm
	and sends her up first. ADA begins to climb. Then REBECCA.
	
	The Tyrant closes in, SWIPING at Chris, who just manages to
	avoid the SLICE of its mighty claw.
	
	The RADIO MAN leans out of the door above, holding something.

			Toss it to me!
	
	The radio man drops the Stinger...a rocket with a shoulder-

	stepping on him. Chris rolls away.
	
	The ladder is too wobbly. Jill can't be sure of launching
	an accurate shot.
	
				JILL (cont.)
			CHRIS!
	
	Chris looks up. Sees Jill holding the rocket launcher. He
	RUNS past the Tyrant, okey-doking, left, right, then dodging

	claw. Chris' flack-jacket is caught. Protective fibers fly.
	But Chris escapes without injury.

	LaGuardia pushes his stick. The Huey LUNGES forward at

Return of the APes - Terry Hayes - unproduced








 
                            RETURN OF THE APES

                              by Terry Hayes

                                first draft

                                   1996

DEEP SPACE.

No atmosphere, no life, nothing. Just a web of lights- a billion stars hang
in a velvet void. The only sound is the howl of the cosmic wind.

The light of a distant sun strikes a rising planet. We see ragged
continents and oceans wreathed in cloud. This is earth rise. Our world
spins slowly in space, a thing of beauty, of awesome majesty. In all this
nothingness - life.

We push in on the planet - in to the Americas. The wind grows louder -

A PUEBLO VILLAGE.

A broken-down pick-up bumps into a God-forsaken villagea cluster of adobe
houses, blinding flurries of dust and sand. The pick-up stops in front of a
crumbling church. A man in his 60s gets out carrying a medical bag. This is
the DOCTOR. '

A WOMAN'S FACE.

Screaming. She's very young - a South American Indian - lying on a bed in a
corner of one of the houses. She is in the final throes of childbirth, a
sheet draped over her loins. The Doctor works between her legs, encouraging
her in Spanish.

The local PRIEST, not long out of the seminary, crouches at her side
counting off the beads of a rosary. He looks like he is about to pass out.

SUDDENLY THE WOMAN BITES DOWN HARD ON HER LIP. A THIN LINE OF BLOOD COURSES
DOWN HER CHIN. THE BREATH EXPLODES FROM HER LUNGS AS SHE PUSHES REALLY HARD
-

DOCTOR

Arriva!

He lifts the child from her loins, but it makes no sound. We don't see the
baby - just the shock on the Doctor's face. The mother struggles up to see
her child.

The Doctor grabs the sheet from her torso and covers the baby with it. He
thrusts the bundle into the Priest's hands.

DOCTOR (CONT'D)

(in Spanish)

Dead - the child is dead. Now go!

We hold on the mother's anguished face. Dissolve to

A HELICOPTER

Off the roof of a tall hospital building. As it rises up into the night we
see a red cross painted on its side. It's an air ambulance.

The chopper turns away. The Manhattan skyline, every skyscraper a blaze of
lights, opens up behind it. The chopper swoops over the Brooklyn bridge and
into the night.

GROVE OF TREES

Winter's coming on - every leaf is a different shade of amber and gold. The
helicopter drops down between the branches and lands on an immaculately
tended lawn. Surrounding it are the gracious buildings of a great
university. Harvard.

Two paramedics clamber out of the back of the helicopter and load a
stainless steel casket onto a gurney. They wheel it fast towards one of the
buildings. As they go' through the front doors, we hold on a sign etched
into the stone

DEPARTMENT OF BIOLOGY

A PAIR OF MECHANICAL HANDS

slide a long cylindrical "key" into the stainless steel casket. We pull
back to reveal the casket lies in a sealed, uncontaminated room. A group of
people in lab coats -scientists and researchers - stare through the glass
walls.

A young TECHNICIAN, working at a console, keyboards in a series of
commands.

Sswhish. The top of the steel casket swings open. Clouds of white gas
stream out -whatever's inside has been nitrogen cooled.

The gas clears. Lying inside is the body of a newborn child - except that
the baby has the skin, the face and the features of a man of eighty. The
scientists and the researchers react - shocked.

One of the mechanical hands glides towards the baby. In its fingers it
holds a long steel scalpel. This is the highest-tech autopsy you've ever
seen. The scalpel drives down, about to open the chest cavity -

BLOOD SPRAYS

But not from the baby's chest - it's in glass vials, exploding as white-hot
flames consume them. A plastic-gloved lab assistant, silhouetted against
the flames, is emptying hospital waste into a furnace. He slams the door
shut.

He turns we see his face. He's in his 4Os, handsome in a rough-hewn way - a
strong jaw and a muscular body. There's a cool intelligence in his eyes,
but a two-day beard and a worn-out uniform make him look like a man who,
between youth and middle-age, lost his way. And so he has. His name is WILL
ROBINSON.

He takes a steel trolley, wheels it through a set of swing doors and out of
sight.

CLOSED CIRCUIT TV SCREEN

features the image of one of the scientists we recognize from the autopsy.
She's in her 30s - attractive, long hair left loose on her shoulders, an
air of authority about her. Her name is BILLIE RAE DIAMOND. She is a
Professor of Biology.

We tilt down from the screen. It hangs from a wall in a deserted laboratory
-overhead lights, rows and rows of wire animal cages. Moving down death
row, feeding the lab animals, is Will Robinson.

TWO SAD-EYED CHIMPS, CLEANING EACH OTHER IN THEIR TINY CAGE, TURN AND STARE
AT HIM. SUDDENLY WILL STOPS - HE'S HEARD SOMETHING ON THE SCREEN THAT HAS
CAUGHT HIS ATTENTION. HE TURNS AND LOOKS -

DIAMOND

The exact cause of death is still unknown. What is certain - we're dealing
with something we've never seen before. Every organ in the body is
affected...

Superimposed over Diamond's face is a three dimensional, computer-generated
graphic of the baby's body.

Will forgets about what he's doing. He walks towards the screen. We push in
on it. Screeds of new data appear

Vascular System ...............Atrophied

Neurological Function .........Senile dementia

We hold on Will's eyes - he stares at it.

AN AUDITORIUM

Billy Rae Diamond stands on a podium continuing her briefing. About forty
scientists are sitting in front of her in a dimly-lit lecture hall.

Diamond is even more impressive in person - she is tall and gracious but
you don't become a Professor at Harvard' at her age without having an iron
will and a sparkling intelligence. She speaks with great authority -

DIAMOND (CONT'D)

The baby in question, Michael James Flanagan -she points at the
computer-generated graphic on a huge screen

was born at New York Hospital yesterday.

MAP OF THE WORLD ILLUMINATES AN ADJOINING SCREEN -

DIAMOND

But the Center for Disease Control in Atlanta has received similar reports
from a village in Bolivia, two cities in Australia, seven countries in
Europe, a cluster of cases in Namibia and Mexico. Forty-two cases in all.

As she speaks, pinpoints of light on the map identify the exact locations.
They dot their way across the entire globe. Dr Diamond turns to face her
audience-

DIAMOND (CONT'D)

Like Michael Flanagan, they were full-term babies. Two hundred and seventy
eight days since conception and yet, by all reasonable medical standards,
they have completed their entire life cycle. They have gone from conception
to death, not in three score years and ten, but in slightly less than nine
months. Michael Flanagan died of old age.

Silence as Diamond lets the scientists and researchers absorb it. On a
balcony high above, another man is taking notes. He sits alone, almost
hidden in shadow. It's Will Robinson.

SHEETS OF ICE ON A SHUTTER DOOR

Will crouches in front of a row of self-storage units on the edge of town.
It's night, the place is deserted. He slips a rusted key into a padlock.
Snapl The key breaks.

Will curses. He grabs a piece of timber and pulls a nail out of it. He
slides the nail into the padlock and manipulates the tumblers. The padlock
springs open.

SPIDERS

weave a web in a corner of the storage unit. A work light hangs from the
ceiling. Will is ripping open stacks of boxes from long ago. He puts
together a pile of yellowing files and old floppy disks.

PULLS OUT A CASSETTE TAPE AND STARES AT IT, UNSURE WHAT'S ON IT. HE TAKES A
CASSETTE PLAYER FROM OUT OF THE JUNK, SLIDES IT IN AND PRESSES "PLAY"A HUGE
ROUND OF APPLAUSE. AS IT DIES, WE HEAR A MAN'S VOICE. IT'S WILL, SPEAKING
FROM YEARS AGO -

WILL

(on tape)

I would like to thank the faculty and staff for this great honor...

We push in on Will's face as he listens to himself...

WILL (CONT'D)

have had the opportunity to work with three talented colleagues. I'm
privileged to also call them my friends -

A shadow of pain crosses his face. He shuts off the tape and sits
motionless.

LAFAYETTE PARK

Night. Homeless people in the park build cardboard shelters against a
coming storm. Across the road, the first drops of rain splatter against the
White House.

A string of Government cars pass through the huge gates and pull up in
front of the West Portico. From inside, we hear a man's voice -
well-spoken, authoritative

PRESIDENT (O.S.)

There's no mistake - you're sure?

JEFFERSON LIBRARY

Diamond sits in the President's study - book-lined walls, a fire in the
hearth. A group of men sit on the sofasthe Surgeon-General, the Chief of
Staff, the National Security Advisor, the Secretaw of Health. A table is
littered with graphs end files.

DIAMOND

We've got five thousand cases now, Mr President. That's in three weeks. The
number is doubling every hundred and sixty-eight hours.

The President stands near a window, half in shadow, the firelight playing
across his face. He's in his 50's but the strain of office makes him look
older.

DIAMOND (CONT'D)

That's a geometric progression, sir. In three months there'Il be over seven
million cases. After that we hit the wall -

She pushes a thick, bound volume across the table.

DIAMOND (CONT'D)

According to this, there won't be a live birth on the planet.

The President looks at her for a moment. Then he reaches down and picks up
the bound volume. It's hundreds of pages of numbers and projections.

PRESIDENT

These are just computer projections -

species don't disappear that fast.

DIAMOND

Tell that to the dinosaurs, sir.

He looks out the window at the winter storm sweeping down on them.

NATIONAL SECURITY ADVISOR

What date - when exactly do we hit this wall?

DIAMOND

Six months and twenty-one days.

Silence. The President keeps looking out the window.

PRESIDENT

Can't somebody tell me - what exactly are we dealing with. Is it a virus or
what?

DIAMOND

We don't know, sir.

The President turns to the Chief of Staff.

PRESIDENT

Whatever they need, Bob - anything. Harry Truman put together the Manhattan
Project - you understand?

The Chief of Staff nods his head - yes.

PRESIDENT (CONT'D)

(softly)

A world without children -it's inconceivable. And what about the rest of us
- what do we do? Just sit and watch our species die? Will the last person
to leave the planet turn out the lights.

Silence again. Finally a young woman - the White House Press Secretary -
speaks.

PRESS SECRETARY

We're going to have to manage the public. Right now, the truth may be
inoperative -

PRESIDENT

Of course we're going to have to manage itl We're going to have to manage a
whole lot of things. But can't we take at least one moment to be human?

He looks around the room. We hold on their somber faces.

A CHEAP APARTMENT

Through the window - the neon sign of a gas station. This is Will's place,
He lives alone - a bed in the corner, run-down furniture, dishes in the
sink.

The kitchen table has been turned into a desk - Will sits at an old
computer, surrounded by the yellowing stacks of files and floppy disks. He
stares at the screen - the notes and equations are blurred. He's been at
this so long, he can barely focus. He rubs his hand across his eyes.

A small mewing sound. Will turns to an alcove in the corner - a cat lies in
a basket, panting. Will goes to her.

She's giving birth - the first of her new-born kittens lies next to her.
Will strokes the mother's head, looking at the miracle of new life. He puts
his fingers in a water bowl, about to moisten the mother's mouth.

Then he stops. He looks again at the kitten - there's two of them now. A
beat as he just stares -

WILL

(softly)

Jesus Christ... of course!

A LUXURIOUS BATHROOM

Through frosted glass we see the silhouette of a woman taking a shower.
Whoever she is, she's got a great figure. The sound of a doorbell. The
shower door opens -Diamond sticks her head out. She looks at a clock - it's
almost midnight.

VIDEO ENTRY PHONE

A video screen monitors the front door. On it we see Will - his hair
tousled, an old overcoat buttoned to the neck, a battered briefcase under
his arm.

Diamond - a towel around her shoulders, hair dripping - picks up the phone.

DIAMOND

Who is it?

WILL (O.S.)

Will Robinson.

DIAMOND

I think you have the wrong house.

WILL (O.S.)

I work at the department.

He turns and looks straight into the camera. Instinctively, Diamond covers
her breasts. She looks at him - recognition dawns.

AN ELEGANT ROOM

Will and Diamond sit in the living room of a gracious townhouse - wooden
floors and beautiful rugs. Diamond doesn't wear any make-up -just jeans and
an oversized shirt. She looks even more beautiful. It does nothing to ease
Will's nerves. He's got his briefcase open in front of him, speaking from
sheaves of notes and papers.

DIAMOND

(interrupting)

Hold on - how do you know about the case load? The Government's trying to
manage this - they've withheld that information.

WILL

The Internet, Doctor. It's a highway - you can ride it anywhere you want. I
got into 'the Center for Disease Control. I had a look at their raw data.

DIAMOND

Jesus. Do you know what you're doing? This is the White House we're talking
about.

WILL

(Heated))

No, it's a disease and it doesn't come any worse than this - that's what
we're talking about.

HE LOOKS AWAY, CALMING HIMSELF. HE SHUFFLES HIS NOTES. HE SPEAKS AGAIN,
QUIETLY -

WILL

I've listened at the lab - I think I know where you're looking. Bacterias
mostly, but there's a strong push into the retro-viruses. You're wrong,
Doctor.

DIAMOND

Really - and I thought I was arrogant. But then, I'm just a professor.

WILL

No virus or bacteria has ever discriminated on the grounds of sex.

DIAMOND

I can think of one.

WILL

Sure, it can start in pockets but it never stays there. This thing does. It
only affects women of child-bearing age. What - it's so smart it can
recognize motherhood? I don't think so. No, this is into the very heart of
what we are. This is genetic. This is part of the DNA.

DIAMOND

Thank you. A hundred thousand genes make up human DNA - that really narrows
it down.

WILL

As a matter of fact it does. There's only one part of the DNA that's passed
exclusively through women. Thirty-seven genes, the oldest part of the human
organism -

DIAMOND

(realizing)

The mitochondrial DNA.

WILL

Over the years there's been speculation -not all of it crazy either - that
somehow it triggers aging, He slides a sheaf of yellowing extracts from
scientific journals across the table. She doesn't pay them any attention -
she's thinking.

DIAMOND

You realize what you're saying, don't you? A bacteria - I think we'd get it
for sure. A virus -you'd have to say we've got a chance. But say you're
right. The mitochondrial DNA - that's so far out on the frontier, we can
barely see it.

WILL

Like I said - it doesn't get any worse than this.

She keeps staring down at the documents and notes lying on the table. A
beat.

WILL (CONT'D)

Are you okay?

DIAMOND

Sure.

WILL LOOKS AT HER FOR A MOMENT -

WILL

Shit. You're pregnant, aren't you?

DIAMOND

Nine weeks.

THEIR EYES MEET - SHE SHRUGS, TRYING TO PUT A BRAVE FACE ON IT. SHE GETS TO
HER FEET -

DIAMOND

Do you want a drink - coffee, a sandwich or something?

WILL

(Recoiling)

No...no, I'm fine thanks.

Watches as he picks up his papers and puts them back in his battered
briefcase.

AN EMPTY STREET

It's late at night. Will clutches his briefcase under his arm, heading
home. A bitter wind blows out of the north. He looks a lonely and forlorn
figure as he makes his way through the pools of light cast by the
streetlights.

CONVOY OF N.A.S.A. TRUCKS

RUMBLE THROUGH THE EARLY MORNING - THE CITY IS JUST WAKING. THE TRUCKS,
DOZENS OF WHITE EIGHTEEN-WHEELERS, TURN THROUGH THE FRONT GATES OF HARVARD.
THEY STOP IN FRONT OF THE GROVE OF TREES. WE CRANE UP FROM THEM TO A WINDOW
IN THE BIOLOGY BUILDING -

HAND HITS A TABLE

IT'S DIAMOND - SHE'S ANGRY. BREAKFAST TRAYS CLUTTER THE TABLE -SHE'S IN THE
MIDDLE OF A CONFERENCE WITH A GROUP OF SCIENTISTS. SHE GLARES AT AN
ARROGANT YOUNG NEUROLOGIST -

DIAMOND

It's just an idea, Bob. All we're doing is taking it for a walk around the
block.

A man in his 60s - distinguished, diplomatic - intercedes.

DE MAUPASSANT

There was a lot of work done on it in the 7Os. I can't recall the details
but someone had the idea that mitochondriel DNA was like a genetic memory.
If you could unlock it, you could physically travel back down it. Through
evolution - like a time machine.

BOB

Wowl Those 70s, man. I'm really sorry I missed them.

Everyone - Diamond included - laughs.

OLD PHOTOS OF A SAILING BOAT

They hang on the wall of a tiny room - not an office, just a
hole-in-the-wall Will has turned into his own. He sits at a table, making
notes. A knock - Diamond enters.

DIAMOND

I thought you'd like to know - we're looking at mitochondrial DNA,

WILL

Thanks for telling me.

THEY LOOK AT ONE ANOTHER. IT'S AN AWKWARD MOMENT - NEITHER ONE QUITE SURE
WHETHER OR HOW TO CONTINUE THE CONVERSATION. DIAMOND SEES THE PHOTOS -

DIAMOND

Is that you?

She points at a man in his 20s standing on the deck in one of the photos,
Will nods.

DIAMOND (CONT'D)

Seattle. Is that where you went to school?

Will hesitates - we sense that he doesn't really want to answer.

WILL

No. Princeton.

DIAMOND

Expensive.

WILL

A scholarship. Then I did some post-graduate work... I never really
finished.

Something in the way Will says it - some sense of loss - makes Diamond
pause. She recovers and looks in her wallet. She pulls out a photograph and
hands it to Will. It shows a small sailing boatgaff-rigged and a varnished
hull.

WILL (CONT'D)

It's a Kestrel 24 - I haven't seen one of those in years. She's a beautiful
boati

DIAMOND

My grandfather left it to me. I don't sail it much any more - it's too hard
to find a for'etd hand.

WILL

What about your husband - doesn't he sail.

DIAMOND

I don't know - I haven't met him yet.

WILL LOOKS AT HER. HIS EXPRESSION SAYS IT - WHAT? SHE SHRUGS -

DIAMOND

I wanted a baby but I'm thirty-four-years old. Sooner or later you realize
that somewhere along the way you've missed the man you've been waiting for.

WILL

What did you do - ask a friend?

DIAMOND

I thought of it.

WILL

Lucky friend.

DIAMOND

I went to a clinic. Not exactly romantic, but it worked.

(pauses)

Good idea, bad timing.

WILL

How many people have you put on the mDNA?

DIAMOND

Seven.

WILL

That's all?!

DIAMOND

That's all I can spare. It's just a theory -one of dozens of theories.

Will looks away in disgust.

DIAMOND (CONT'D)

What is it with you - it's not just science is it? Why are you so
passionate about this?

WILL

I know I'm right. It's a mutation. A hundred thousand years it's probably
been lying there -shifting, weaving into the mDNA. You either go back and
change evolution or you engineer it out. Seven peopleYou might as well
shoot peas at a dam.

DIAMOND

You haven't answered my question - why so passionate?

WILL

The question's not relevant. The only thing I'm interested in is the
science.

He turns back to his work. We hear the door close as Diamond leaves.

A GEODESIC DOME

White, space-age, is being erected on the lawn. Workmen are unloading the
NASA trucks. We pull back through a high window of the Biology building. A
woman stands there, looking out. Her name is KRIS McQUADE. This is her
office -

MCQUADE

You want to tell me what's going on?

She turns and looks at Diamond, sitting on the other side of the desk,

DIAMOND

Don't ask, Kris, I'd have to lie and I don't want to do that to my best
friend,

MCQUADE

The rumor is, you've done something really big. They say the Defense
Department is taking it over.

Diamond just sits there, staring straight ahead. McQuade waits. Finally -

MCQUADE (CONT'D)

Okay, okay - I'm sorry I asked. So what about this guy - what's he done?

DIAMOND

He hasn't done anything - I'm just interested.

MCQUADE

Ten thousand employment records I've got on file and you want to know about
a lab assisant?

DIAMOND

The smartest assistant I've ever known.

MCQUADE

What - he can mop and fart at the same time?

She picks up pages from a computer printer - including a copy of Will's
photo I.D.

MCQUADE (CONT'D)

He's handsome, at least I'll say -

(a thought strikes her)

Jesus - you're not interested in him like that, are you?

DIAMOND

No, but he's the most unbelievable smelling man.

MCQUADE

Smelling? You're pregnant - obviously your hormones have gone crazy. What
exactly does he smell like?

DIAMOND

You know...

(searching for the right word)

.., wholesome.

MCQUADE

Of course he does - that's the Lysol.

Diamond laughs but McQuade barely notices it. She's leafing through WiU's
file -

MCQUADE (CONT'D)

That's strange - there's supposed to be a background sheet. Family, school
-all that shit. It must have gotten lost.

Before Diamond can say anything, a young man enters. He's McQuada's
assistant.

ASSISTANT

Your secretary's on the line, Dr Diamond. There's a call for you.

DIAMOND

Tell her to take a message.

ASSISTANT

It's the New York Times.

MCQUADE

What do they want?

DIAMOND

I think Washington's news management just went south.

THE WHITE HOUSE

Night. Scores of television news vans are parked outsideDutch, Japanese and
French reporters are doing stand-ups live-to-air. We hear Peter Jennings of
ABC.

JENNINGS (O.S.)

We're standing by to go live to Washington as events continue to unfold on
this remarkable day. I don't think there's a person anywhere who's not
sitting by a radio or television now. I'm told the President is on his way
to the press room -

FIFTH AVENUE

is totally empty - just a young man on rollerblades. He skates effortlessly
down the deserted avenue - past Tiffany's and the Trump Tower, all silent
now.

PRESIDENT (O.S.)

My fellow Americans...

The rollerblader passes the cathedral of St John. The front doors are open.
Someone is playing the organ - Mozart's Requiem. The rollerblader fades
into the night.

STEEL DOOR OPENS

A sharp-faced caretaker - scruffy clothes and a limp - escorts Will into a
vaulted basement. All we can see are silhouettestowers of crates, racks of
equipment...

CARETAKER

This used to be the basement of the Psychology Department. We just sort of
stacked everything around 'em -

He flicks a switch - the storage room floods with light. He points at two
long iron cylinders - like small submarines - rigged up to a series of
valves and pipes.

CARETAKER (CONT'D)

Flotation tanks. They used 'em for experiments in sensory degradation -

WILL

Deprivation - sensory deprivation.

CARETAKER

Yeah, well - whatever.

SHAFT OF LIGHT

WILL OPENS AN IRON HATCH THAT GIVES ACCESS INTO ONE OF THE TANKS. HE DROPS
INTO IT AND WALKS FORWARD, EXAMINING IT. THE DARKNESS CLOSES AROUND HIM. HE
STARES AHEAD. VOICES DRIFT OUT OF MEMORY -

YOUNG MAN (O.S.)

Now I know what a mole feels like -

YOUNG WOMAN (O.S.)

(lightly)

It feels like a fucking coffin, that's what it feels like.

Other voices laugh. They're all young and like the young they think they'll
never die.

CARETAKER (O.S.)

Hey, fella - what are you doing?

HE'S PEERING DOWN THROUGH THE HATCH. WILL DRAGS HIMSELF OUT OF THE PAST. HE
TURNS -

WILL

Just looking. I'll be coming back - I'll need a key.

The caretaker shrugs - sure. Will climbs out of the tank.

WILL (CONT'D)

One other thing - don't tell anyone, huh?

CARETAKER

Who would I tell? They treat me like shit Worse than shit. All work, no
appreciation. The phantom of Harvard. Someone should write a fucking
musical about me.

CIRCLES OF LIGHT

Desk lamps, glowing in an office. Diamond and a team of researchers are
working through piles of old journals and extracts from scientific papers.

RESEARCHER

Here's another one - "Mitochondrial DNAA Map to the Past."

DIAMOND

Who's it by?

RESEARCHER

Same guy - Doctor Robert Plant.

DIAMOND

Jesus, what did this guy do - write the book on it? Who is he?

HUGE BOOK BEING OPENED

It's a scientific directory. The researcher flicks the pages and stops at
"Plant".

RESEARCHER

Wow - I thought your career was impressive.

Diamond looks up from her reading.

RESEARCHER (CONT'D)

Degrees in medicine and microbiology. A PhD at 24, a member of the Academy
of Sciences, published twenty times by 1974...

DIAMOND

And then?

RESEARCHER

Then nothing.

DIAMOND REACTS. SHE GETS TO HER FEET, COMING CLOSER -

DIAMOND

Where did he go as an undergraduate?

RESEARCHER

Princeton.

DIAMOND

On a scholarship?

A CORRIDOR

It's late at night. The scientists and their staff are working around the
clock. Will wheels a trolley laden with bottles, vials, and catheters down
a crowded corridor. Diamond pushes through the people behind, trying to
catch up to him. Scientists turn to speak to her but she ignores them.

DIAMOND (CONT'D)

Robert!

Will keeps walking, heading for an elevator. Diamond skirts around a knot
of people.

DIAMOND (CONT'D)

Doctor Plant!

Will hesitates - one split second - then keeps going. The elevator doors
slide open. Will steps in, turns and hits a button. He watches Diamond
pushing towards him. For a moment their eyes meet. She comes closer.
Sswhish! The doors slide shut.

DIAMOND'S OFFICE

She sits behind her desk, listening to the chief of campus security.

SECURITY OFFICER

The equipment you saw him with was taken from three labs. It includes a
range of genetic material-

(hands her an inventory)

We've checked all the buildings your team is using - he's not in any of
them.

DIAMOND

What about hie house?

SECURITY OFFICER

He asked his landlady to look after his cat. She hasn't seen him for three
days.

IN THE BASEMENT

there's a make-shift bed and a hot-plate with a battered saucepan. Next to
it is a rack of medical equipment and laboratory vials.

Will is sit'ting in front of three computers running in parallel - data and
equations reel across them. The caretaker comes out of the shadows,
carrying two mugs of thick coffee. He puts one down next to Will -

CARETAKER

You wanna tell me what exactly you're doing?

WILL

Looking for a date.

The caretaker stares at the confusion of diagrams and equations on the
screen -

CARETAKER

What's wrong with a calendar?

WILL

These are chemical sequences - they represent human genes. By following a
trail of mutations, I can date them. I'm trying to find out when a major
change occurred in something called the mitochondrial DNA.

CARETAKER

The mitochondrial DNA? Yeah... well that makes sense.

But Will barely hears it. Suddenly he's leaning forward, keyboarding in
complex commands. The caretaker watches him -

CARETAKER (CONT'D)

You've found it?

WILL

Maybe...

He has illustrations of two long-chain molecules on the screen. He moves
them together. Aa they overlap, we see they're not identical - the tail of
one kicks upwarda. Will starel at it -

WILL (CONT'D)

(softly)

Yeah - I've found it.

CARETAKER

So - what's the date?

Will presses a key. Faster than the eye can follow, the first long-chain
molecule starts to shift and mutate. Finally it resolves itself into the
second molecule. Will looks at a graph on the side of the screen -

WILL

The best computer science can do? One hundred and two thousand years ago.

CARETAKER

Sort of what I figured - give or take a day or two.

DIAMOND'S OFFICE

Diamond is poring through scientific articles written by Will. She flicks a
page -there's a photo of Will, 20 years younger, surrounded by three
colleagues. He's got his arm around one of them - an attractive young
woman.

Diamond lifts the photo, looking at it more closely. She starts to read the
caption. We push in on it and hold on the words... "UC Berkeley".

WE ARE FLYING

swooping and soaring - through a weird landscape of towering cliffs,
tumbling streams and primordial forest. There's something unreal about it -
we pull back to reveal they're computer-generated images, playing on the
screens in the basement.

The caretaker has pulled up a chair. He and Will are watching the images
generated by a CD-ROM.

WILL

This is someone's version of the prehistoric world. I'm interested in the
geography, the atmosphere -that sort of stuff.

CARETAKER

Where are we?

WILL

Africa - that's where Mankind started.

Will keeps looking at the strange images. The caretaker gets to his feet -

CARETAKER

I'll see you in the morning.

WILL

Yeah.

The caretaker limps towards the door. Will looks up -

WILL (CONT'D)

Thank you - for helping me, I mean.

CARETAKER

It sounds like you're leaving or something.

WILL

No. I just wanted to say it, that's all.

The caretaker keeps looking at him -

CARETAKER

What exactly are you doing? You're a bit old to try and make your mark,
aren't you? Anyway, nobody listens to people like us.

WILL

Fate can be kind - sometimes a man gets a second chance. Do you know what
it's like to be ridiculed, to have your ideas thrown back in your face? And
that was the easy part. I guess that's what I'm doing - I want to prove
that I was right.

CARETAKER

You're lying to me.

WILL

What do you mean?!

CARETAKER

You are going somewhere. I don't know where it is. I'm not even sure I can
imagine it. Good luck, though. I hope you find whatever it is you're
looking for.

WILL

Thanks.

CARETAKER

No point in getting you breakfast, huh?

Will shakes his head - no. They smile at each other. The caretaker turns
and goes.

DIAMOND'S OFFICE

Diamond looks up from the papers and articles littering her desk. Her
Secretary stands in the doorway -

SECRETARY

I've got Eleanor Wilkins on the phone. She runs the archives at Berkeley.

DIAMOND

(into phone)

Ms Wilkins?

We push in tight on Diamond's face as she listens. Anxiety and alarm
register on it.

OUTER OFFICE

The security officer and several of his men are looking at maps of the
campus. Researchers and scientists have gathered in the office, rumors are
flying. Everyone turns - Diamond stands in the doorway to her office. She
looks at deMaupassant.

DIAMOND (CONT'D)

You were right, Luc. That work you remembered from Berkeley - he was the
one that did it. He said man was the last step on an evolutionary trail.
Within every one of us is the history of our race. It's imprinted on our
genes - like a map. Anyone that can find the chemical key can travel back
down it. Through the womb. Through time and space -

(she looks at them all)

That's what he's doing. He's going back. He's going to try and change
evolution.

SECURITY OFFICER

Is that possible?

DIAMOND

He was the best of his generation. He thinks so. He's got the genetic
material for the key. All he needs are flotation tanks.

THE FLOTATION TANKS

The valves are open - warm water is pouring into the tanks.

Will sits next to the rack of medical equipment, beads of sweat on his
forehead. He slides a syringe into his forearm and inserts a catheter. He
opens a series of tiny valves on the glass vials. A cocktail of fluid -
minutely measured doses - flows down the clear plastic towards his arm. The
fluid hits his blood stream and drains into it.

A LONG CORRIDOR

Diamond and the others run fast through pools of light cast by naked bulbs.
Ahead -a pair of swing doors -

BOB

A theory's one thing - do you really think he'll try it?

DIAMOND

He's spent fifteen years as a lab assistant. He lives in a two room walk-up
with a cat. No family, no friends. What's There's left for him here? Of
course he'll do it.

Smack! They push through the doors, into another corridor.

AN IRON LADDER

Will climbs up the side of the flotation tank. Suddenly he stops - a
tremor, a rippling wave, passes from his feet to his head. It's his muscles
contracting. It wracks him with pain. He gasps at the intensity of it.

Smash! The steel door into the basement shudders as someone tries to get
in. Will looks up - the door twists and moves. His vision is starting to
distort. He grabs the access hatch and swings through -

Splashl He drops into the water. Clang! He closes the hatch.

Barn? The steel door flies open. The security officer lowers a sledge
hammer. Diamond steps in end throws a light switch.

DARKNESS IN THE TANK

Will floats on his back, the only sound is the rapid thump of his
heartbeat. The water sloshes back and forth - his muscles are going into
spasms. We push along his body - up to his face. His eyes roll back into
his headl

All we see are the whites of them. They shatter into a web of capillaries -

WILL'S POV

red mist swirls in front of him. It resolves itself into a web of
interwoven tendrils -the double helix of the DNA molecule. Will starts to
travel through it -

INSIDE THE TANK

Will is morphing, shedding cells - we're losing him in the warm, dark fluid
of the tank. It's like the womb. His body seems to be disintegrating,
dissolving into it. Water flows through the sockets where his eyes once
were.

His hollow mouth opens. From far away we hear him scream - a primal scream.

OUTSIDE THE TANK

Not a sound escapes. The security officer is about to try and open the
hatch.

DIAMOND (O.S.)

NO!

The security officer turns - Diamond is holding the catheter in her hand.

DIAMOND (CONT'D)

If we open the hatch, I think we'll kill him. It's too late - it's his
journey, he's going to have to take it.

INSIDE THE TANK

Will's body is like a shadow, almost one with the water, growing less
distinct by the moment. What is left of his face - a strange, shifting
shape - floats towards us. Closer... closer. It melts completely into the
water -

WILL'S POV

He spirals down a tunnel - into a whirlpool of white light. As he hits, it
shatters into a million fragments of light. It looks like a comet, wheeling
through the heavens. A cosmic wind blows it forward. Will is traveling
through space and time -

OUTSIDE THE TANK

Diamond and the others are gathered around the computers. Bob is working
the keyboard. Diamond is looking.through the piles of papers, notes and
star charts.

DIAMOND

Everything's here - he kept a record of every step. He can even tell the
date -forty hours after he arrives there's a solar eclipse.

BOB

Billie - there's a note for you.

Diamond looks over his shoulder at the computer screen. She reads what is
writ'ten -

DIAMOND

"I won't be here, but if I solve this thing make sure you tell them,
Billie. Tell them it was Robert Plant, Doctor Robert Plant of UC Berkeley."

THE FRAGMENTS OF LIGHT

blaze through the heavens. They draw together, changing and reconstituting
into a shape we recognize - the interwoven strands of DNA molecules. The
strands connect. A blast of light! It's the rays of -

THE SUN

streaming into a cave. Will lies in the fetal position, bleeding from his
nose and ears. The light grows stronger - it's dawn. Will drags himself up
and stumbles towards the entrance. We tilt up from him. He doesn't see it,
but we do - prehistoric cave paintings are etched into the rock.

A CRAGGY PEAK

Will steps out of the cave. Sunrise sweeps over a world born brand new -
plains and jungle and primordial forest. Rising above it is a snow-capped
mountain that looks like Kilamlnjlro. A ragged gash runs across the earth -
a rift valley. Will stares at it. He raises his face to the sun. He did it.
The first step's over - and he did itl He looks down - rising out of the
valley is a tiny pillar of smoke.

A FOREST CLEARING

In the middle are the smoldering remains of a camp-fire. Will moves
cautiously towards it. He stops - several bodies, terribly mangled, lie on
the ground.

Will turns one of them over - he's got matted hair, a heavy brow and a
short, muscular body. As primitive as he is, there's no doubt of his
species. He is a man. A Paleolithic man.

This was a hunting party -scattered weapons and the trussed carcasses of
dead animals lie nearby. For a moment Will thinks the hunters must have
been torn apart by wild animals. Then he looks up into the trees - more
bodies of the hunters. But no animal did this - they hang from iron chains,
left there as some sort of trophy. Or a warning.

CRUSHED LEAVES AND BROKEN PLANTS

Will is following a tiny trail through the forest. He's taken what is
useful from the bodies of the hunters - an otter-skin water bag, two
short-handled spears and a bed-roll made from an animal pelt. He moves on -
deeper into the shadows of the forest.

A SPARKLING STREAM

Will splashes through the crystal water. He looks upstream - a small lake.
A flock of strange birds - like huge flamingos take flight in a blaze of
pink and gold.

He steps out of the stream and along a path beneath a canopy of
over-arching trees. We hold on his feet - whip! He triggers something. A
net of woven vines engulfs him. He drops the spears and bedroll. Suddenly
he's soaring through the air.

He jerks to a halt - he's a netted animal hanging high in the trees. The
faces of two Paleolithic men, crouched on boughs, stare at him.

PLUME OF WATER

cascades a hundred feet into a hidden gorge. Smoke curls up from fires.
Scores of stone-age people - man, women and children - turn and look. Will,
roped and bound, is being hauled into the encampment.

The primitive people - nervous but intrigued - circle around him. They are
dressed in skins and fur. talismans hang from their necks. The warriors
carry not only weapons but ritual scars across their foreheads. It makes
them look even more savage.

Will is led past the haunches of soma massive animal cooking in a pit. A
pile of ivory tusks lie nearby. The two captors jerk on the leash - it
stops Will in front of a cave. Hanging from the roof is the giant pelt and
head of their totema saber-toothed tiger. This is the Tribe of the Tiger.

A man emerges from under its outstretched paws. He's in his late 20's -
proud and strong. His name is Kip-Kena - he is their leader. He and Will
look at one another.

Kip uses his hands to sign to Will in the formal language of his race. Will
stares at him - he has no idea what it means. He shrugs. Kip tries a new
tack - he speaks. The sounds are rough and guttural - but understandable,
KiP Where is your tribe?

Will pauses, searching for an answer- where do you start? He gives up.

WILL

I don't have a tribe.

A rolling murmur of disbelief from the surrounding tribe.

KIP

No man can live without a tribe! How would he hunt the mighty animals? Who
would keep his fire burning?

WILL

I come from far away... I'm a traveler.

KIP

What is traveler? Is that a tribe?

Again Will's at a loss. Something catches Kip's eye. He reaches forward and
rips the water bag out from under Will's coat. The tribe reacts -

KIP (CONT'D)

You carry things taken from our hunters! Kill him.

He turns away. Will throws himself at him -

WILL

NO!

Whackl A blow to the back of Will's neck knocks him to his knees. He looks
up -two warriors have their spears raised, about to plunge them into his
chest.

A sound like thunder - it's hooves. The warriors turn. Will follows their
gaze - half an army, mounted on horseback, surges into the gorge, They are
heavily armed, dressed in armor but it's not their weaponry that astonishes
Will. These are apes!

The tribes-people scream in terror. They turn and run. The two warriors
forget about Will. He dives for cover in a pile of rocks. As he tears
himself free of the ropes that bind him, he looks out -

The apes charge in to the camp. At their head is a huge gorillarippling
muscles and intelligent eyes - deep set and yellow, like pissholes in the
snow. He wears a suit of black armor ribbed in silver. His name is Drak. He
is the Lord of the High Rivers, supreme commander of the ape army. On
either side ride his elite Praetorian Guard.

Woo-woo-woo! Kip swings a hollow piece of wood above his head. It's a
bull-roarer. The warriors of the tribe know its meaning - they rally to
Kip's side. Armed only with spears and primitive bows they stand between
the apes and their panic-driven people, trying to buy them time to get into
the cave.

Sswhish! The sound of arrows. The apes carry triple-barreled iron
crossbows.

Short iron bolts cut several of the tribesmen down. Dust and smoke swirls
across the camp. Kip and his men, fighting all the way, retreat towards the
cave.

A baby's cry! Will turns - a toddler sits at a hearth, left behind in the
confusion. Will half rises to his feet, about to go for him. Too late -
there's a blur of movement irt the trees. A tribe-boy - too young to be a
warrior - has come back for the child.

Out of the dust and smoke - Drak! Foam flies from his horse's mouth. He's
seen the boy and the child. He locks what looks like a Gatling gun tight
under his huge bicep.

Will screams a warning. The boy turns - he sees Drak as he fires. A hail of
iron darts - twenty or more - cut him and the child down.

Rage flashes in Will's eyes. He scrambles over a boulder and rips a
crossbow from a dead ape's hand. He slides bolts into the barrels and grabs
a lever with both hands -you need the strength of an ape to cock it. A
sound behind him - little more than a whisper. He swings -It's an arrow.
Whackl It rips into his shoulder, hurling him to the ground. Ape infantry -
foot soldiers - are coming into the gorge behind him.

In their midst are three huge steam-driven machines - like iron erector
sets. One is the Claw, one is the Balls and the other is the Flame.

THE CAVE ENTRANCE

Kip and his warriors have seen them too. They scramble into the cave. Men
and women are inside, swinging closed two huge stockade doors made from
tree trunks.

Other warriors, caught outside, run for the closing gap. On their heels is
Will - still clutching the crossbow, blood streaming from his wound. The
doors are closing... closing. Will dives through the gap, almost crushed -

INSIDE THE CAVE

Slam! The doors fly shut. Wham! A huge cross-beam drops into place. Will,
sprawled in the dust, looks up - chaos. By torchlight, the medicine man is
tending the wounded, children are screaming, women and old people are
clambering up a series of ledges. High above is a tiny slash of
daylightanother entrance.

From deep in the cave Will hears the roar of some animal but he doesn't
have time to think about it. Smash! The great wooden doors shudder from
some mighty blow.

OUTSIDE THE DOORS

The three machines are in place. The first of them has two huge stone balls
suspended by chains from an overhead jib. An ape sits right on top,
operating it. The balls dance and swing wildly - smash! They hit the door,
opening a hole.

INSIDE THE CAVE

Daylight streams in. Kip and his warriors have ranged themselves high
around the walls, ready to attack when the apes pour in. A pair of huge
iron jaws appear in the hole. This is the second of the apes' machines -
the Claw.

Another roar from the animal. Will watches the Claw reach in and grab the
massive crossbeam. It snaps it like a twig. Will gets to his feet and runs.
He sees Kip signal -

AN OLD WARRIOR

is perched high on a series of wooden bars that seal off a corner of the
cave, turning it into a cage. He opens it.

Crash! The stockade doors at the front of the cave burst open. The first of
the ape cavalry charges in. A roar from the unseen animal. The apes' horses
catch the scent of it. They whinny in terror.

Will stares as a blur of striped fur and muscle flies out of the cage. The
tribe's totem is a living thing - the saber-toothed tiger ia three times
the size of its Bengal cousin, a head the size of an ox and two ten-inch
teeth curved down either side of its jaw.

The horses are bucking and rearing. The tiger leaps towards the door,
heading for freedom. A dismounted ape raises his weapon. The tiger doesn't
even break stride. One lazy swipe from his paw tears open the armor and
flesh of the ape's chest.

Will can smell the animal's breath as it flies past. An ape officer, still
on his horse, turns - another swipe from the.tiger's paw rips out his
throat.

Kip and his warriors hurl their spears and stone tomahawks at the cavalry -
half of them dismounted, all of them in disarray. The tiger runs soars
through the doorway -

OUTSIDE THE CAVE

Drak fights to control his mount as the tiger lands once and bounds into
the forest.

ON THE LEDGES

Kip's men are fighting as they retreat, heading towards the opening at the
roof of the cave. Will, clutching his wounded shoulder, makes his own way
up the wall.

Beneath him, Drak and the apes roll in the third of the machines - a long
iron tube in a rolling superstructure. Feeding it are a series of
oil-filled bladders. One of the apes touches a torch to a firing hole. A
tongue of fire erupts from the end of the tube. It's a flame thrower -The
fiery tongue shoots up towards the roof of the cave. The flame engulfs two
warriors. Skin blazing, they plummet to the ground.

The flame thrower fires again - scorching the rock wall, filling the cave
wit a pall of smoke. It hits the tiny patch of daylight, cutting off
escape.

Will - trapped - runs along a ledge, over a pile of rocks and jumps. Into
mid-air! He lands on the back of a riderless horse and drives his heels
into its flanks.

The apes and the surviving warriors turn. For a moment they just stare -
nobody's ever seen a human ride a horse before. Will flies towards the
entrance. He sees Kip on a ledge just above, battling three huge apes.

WILL

Jump!

Kip sees Will galloping towards him. One of the apes raises a double-bladed
sword. Kip jumps sprawling across the horse's neck, grabbing on to its
flowing mane.

Drak stares at Will - he's never seen anything like him. He wheels his
horse around and spurs it forward in pursuit.

OUTSIDE THE CAVE

Will's horse bursts out of the cave - past the Claw and under the Balls.
The apes turn and look - astonished. They scramble for their horses. Drak
charges through.

Will hurtles towards the trees. Kip, hanging on for life, looks behind -
Drak raises his Gatling gun and aims. Kip wrenches Will's head down - zing!
The arrows skim past.

Drak can't outpace them - and he can't re-load at the gallop either. They
charge out of the camp, into -

THE DAPPLED LIGHT OF THE FOREST

Drak rises up in the stirrups and hauls himself on to the saddlethe huge
ape stands on the back of the charging horse!

He jumps - his rippling arms catch hold of an overhanging bough. He swings
himself up into the tree - he is an ape, after all. He throws himself from
branch to bough, traveling at incredible speed.

Will glances back - he sees Drak's riderless horse. His eyes dart in
confusion -where is he? We crane up - he's in the trees above! Drak jumps -

Wham! Hundreds of pounds of gorilla blast into Will's shoulder, lifting him
out of the saddle and hurling him to the ground.

Kip hauls down on the horse's bridle - wheeling the stallion around.

Will looks up from the dust - Drak towers above him. Will sees Kip coming
back -

WILL (CONT'D)

Run!

A volley of arrows whiz past Kip - other apes are galloping through the
trees. Kip grabs the bridle and kicks - the horse spins and gallops away.

massive, armor-clad paw grabs Will's head. He looks straight into Drak's
face. The ape reaches out and rips a claw down Will's cheek. Will tries to
stifle the scream. Drak touches the wound and tastes the blood -

DRAK

So - it's human, after ell.

He spits the blood out in revulsion. Will stares into the piu-holes in his
face. Never has he seen eyes so cold.

Will tries to rise to hie feet. His wounded shoulder has weakened him - he
staggers. Drak's clenched fist, clad in chain mail, drives straight et
Will's jaw. Smashl Fade to black.

THE WORLD UPSIDE DOWN

It's Will's point of view - he-s lying on his back in a horse-drawn cart.
He's very weak, his shirt drenched in blood. He rolls over and the image
rights itself.

He drags himself on to all fours but he can't get any further - his legs
are chained.

WILL

(fevered, disoriented)

Where the fuck am I?

Will looks up - a huge ape sits guard in the back of the wagon.

GUARD

(smiling)

The end of the road.

Will - confused, panicky - grabs the side of the cart and hauls himself to
his knees. He looks past an escort of ape cavalry - they are traveling down
an avenue of idols -towering statues of apes, sculpted out of stone, old as
ages past. Fires burn somewhere within them giving the eyes a red,
flickering glow.

Will turns away. Behind him he sees humans, rows of them - dead - hanging
upsidl down from long poles like trophies.

Everything comes flooding back - he slumps against the side of the cart,
eyes barely focused. Blood trickles down under his shirt and forms a pool
between his legs. He doesn't even notice it.

MASSIVE IRON AND WOOD BRIDGE

spans a roaring river. Drak and his convoy clatter across it. We crane up -
laid out before is a city. Terraces are cut into both sides of a jagged
ravine. Opening on to them are caves and houses and buildings made out of
stone.

Apes are everywhere - hammering stones to enlarge a house, chattering in
the trees, swinging hand-over-hand along horizontal ladders - crossing from
one side of the ravine to the other.

Will has roused himself. He stares at the city through feverish eyes - to
him, it appears to float. Buildings swim in and out of focus. His shoulders
shake - he starts to laugh, an edge of hysteria to it.

WILL

A city... of course. Ape city! I've destroyed my mind. Or maybe I'm dead
and this is God's last joke - hell is ruled by apes.

Whhish - the end of a whip sails through the air. Crack! It hits Will's
back, doubling him over.

GUARD

Quiet, animal!

RIPPLES OF WATER

run across the surface of a beautiful pool. A black shape glides along
underwater. The head breaks the surface - it's an old gorilla, the fur on
his face gray and balding. This is NAZGUL. He is the Ghan - the President -
of the Council of Elders.

He walks out of the water. Other old apes - all male, their days of warring
and building over - lie around the pool. Several of them, draped only in
rough loin-cloths, groom each other, picking nits out of their fur.

The sound of a gong! Nazgul picks up a loin cloth and walks the end of the
pool. He looks straight down the ravine - at the far end, Drak and his
troop come into view.

NAZGUL

The raiders are home.

OLD APE

(lazily)

Good hunting?

Nazgul squints against the sun. He sees the poles carrying the dead humans.

NAZGUL

By the look of it.

GRAY-BEARDED WARRIOR, HIS CHEST MARKED BY THE SCARS OF MANY BATTLES, GETS
UP -

GRAY BEARD

(proudly)

Not as good as when we rode the high ridges, I'll warrant.

NAZGUL

Times are different now. Back then, a could go out and come back with a
brace of animals. They're far scarcer now -

OLD APE

Not scarce enough, I say.

There's a murmur of agreement from the other apes.

A TINY BOAT

is wreathed in woven leaves. Lying in it is the dead body of a young ape.
The boat drifts down an underground stream. All around it rise the stone
walls of a huge cavern. Torches light up the gloom - this place is a
temple.

A group of apes - mourners - walk along a path, keeping pace with the
funeral boat.

They make a humming sound deep in the back of their throats - a dirge for
the dead.

At the head of the procession, swinging a smoking censer, is an ape wearing
a lion-skin cloak. His face is scarred and twisted - he has one cruel eye,
the other is just an empty socket. Beneath the cloak, one arm and a leg are
withered. The whole effect, rather than diminishing his power, enhances it.
His name is MA-GOG. He is high priest of the apes, defender of the faith,
keeper of the Book of the Lore.

The funeral boat gathers speed in the current. It thrusts towards sunlight
pouring through an arch.

A ROCK PLATFORM

The mourners step through the arch and on to a slab of rock. We pull back
to reveal where they stand - a huge crouching ape has been carved out of
the face of a cliff, Its bowed front legs form the archway, the entrance to
the temple of the ape.

CLOUDS OF MIST AND WIND-BLOWN SPRAY SWEEP OVER MA-GOG AND THE MOURNERS. ALL
AROUND THEM, THE SOUND OF ROARING WATER. THE FUNERAL BOAT FLOATS OUT OF THE
TEMPLE AND INTO A ROARING RIVER. MA-GOG SWINGS THE CENSER OVER THE WATER -

MA -GOG

(intoning)

In the beginning was the word, and the word was the Book of the Lore. It
says God created the ape in His own image. Alone among His creatures, the
ape has a soul. One crosses the river now but death is only a door. He will
dwell in the house of the Lord forever. Amen The mourners beat their chests
with their fists. They repeat the word "Amen".

For a moment the clouds of mist clear. Now we see where the boat is headed
- half an ocean of water pours over a sheer drop. These are the Falls of No
Return. The boat races forward - over the waterfall it goes.

The sound of cheering voices, very faint, drifts towards them. Ma-Gog turns
and looks up the river towards the city -

APES HANG FROM THE 'LADDERS'

looking down on Drak and his troops. The convoy passes along a road cut
into the side of the ridge. Apes have come out of the houses and buildings
to greet them.

Will lies in the back of the cart, unconscious. Faces of apes stare in at
him - they've never seen anything like it. A young ape - a little boy -
stands with his grandfather.

KID

What is it?

GRANDFATHER

Some... sort of human.

KID

But look at the eyes, 'Pa - they're the color of the sea. Where's it from?

GRANDFATHER

I don't know - a traveler, maybe. Nobody knows what lies beyond the Tower
of the Moon.

THE WORD "TRAVELER" IS PICKED UP BY OTHER APES. IT RIPPLES THROUGH THE
CROWD. A WOMAN ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE WAGON CALLS OUT -

WOMAN

No it's not - it's a mutant.

LABORER

Put it in the zoo!

A female ape pushes them aside. She's heavy-set, bright eyes, an air of
authority about her. Over her shoulder she carries a leather satchel with a
series of steel instruments dangling from it. Her name is ZORA - she is a
doctor.

She and her ASSISTANT - a young male - swing themselves on to the cart.
Kneeling beside him, Zora puts her hand down and grabs hold of Will's
crotch.

ZORA

Whatever it is, it's male.

She rips open Will's shirt - his chest is covered in blood from the gaping
wound.

ZORA (CONT'D)

Probe.

The Assistant hands her a steel instrument. She slides it towards the
wound. We hold on Will's face - a strangled cry but he doesn't regain
consciousness. Zore returns the bloodied probe to her Assistant. She calls
out -

ZORA (CONT'D)

Drak!

The leader of the ape warriors, riding close by, turns -

ZORA (CONT'D)

The animal's bleeding to death, my Lord.

Drak rides up to the wagon.

DRAK

I didn't bring him all this way just to have him die.

ZORA

(to the assistant)

Ben-Guri - get a vet. Quicklyl

AN APE IN A LEATHER APRON

uses a grinding wheel to sharpen a gruesome looking knife. This is the VET.
Will lies on a stone slab nearby - it's a sort of medical centersinks along
the walls, racks of equipment, hoses to wash down the blood.

The Vet cuts the clothing away from Will's wound. He turns to Doctor Zora -

VET

We're going to have to give him blood.

PRISONER IN A CELL

He's a tribesman - in his late 40s. Despite his tattered furs and hollow
cheeks, he carries himself with dignity - he's a proud man. His name is
ARAGORN. On a chain around his neck he wears a metal ornament, like
crescent moon. Etched into it are strange markings and the totems of
various tribes.

The sound of a key in lock. Aragorn turns - the cell door is thrown back.
Three ape guards enter. Two of them, armed with spears, drive Aragorn into
a corner. The third ape has a leather collar on the end of a pole. He drops
it over Aragorn's head.

Aragorn struggles but the ape jerks the collar tight. They drag him from
the cell.

TEAM OF HORSES

- their flanks drenched in sweat - walk in a circle. They turn a huge wheel
that controls a series of pulleys and winches. Attached to the end of a
heavy cable is a wooden platform - a primitive elevator. It runs from a
series of impressive house, down the side of the ravine, to the center of
the city.

Standing on the platform are Nazgul and several other elders. They look
down on the central square. It's crowded with apes - soldiers are being
greeted by their kin.

ARAGORN LIES ON HIS BACK

He's strapped to a slab, half-naked, in the medical center. They've put a
gag in his mouth and though he struggles to free himself, he can barely
move.

Will, still unconscious, lies on a table next to him. Nazgul peers down at
him.

NAZGUL

It's human, you say?

Doctor Zora nods - yes.

NAZGUL

It's even uglier than the others.

He pulls a covering aside and looks at Will's naked legs.

NAZGUL (CONT'D)

How can he hunt with legs like those -they're like twigs. Maybe he's
diseased.

Everybody shrugs - who knows?

The Vet heats a steel needle over an open flame. The other end of the
needle is attached to a length of animal intestine. It acts as a tube. The
Vet grabs Will's forearm and slides the red-hot needle into the vein.
Will's body jerks with the pain. Nazgul and the others spring back.

For a moment Will's wrenched back to consciousness - he sees a light-filled
room, a bandage on his chest, a bladder full of blood hanging above him.
His puts it together the only way he knows - he thinks he's in hospital

WILL

(groggy)

Help me. I've got health insurance. Honest...

His eyes close as he slips back into darkness. Nazgul looks at Doctor Zora.

NAZGUL

What is health insurance?

DOCTOR ZORA

Some sort of religion...?

The Vet turns and makes an adjustment to the bladder. Another length of
tubing snakes out of it and is attached by a needle to Aragorn's arm. It's
his blood. Now we realize - this is the ape version of a blood transfusion.

NAZGUL

Do you think this'Il work?

VET

You can never tell with animals. Their bodies aren't as sophisticated as an
ape's. Sometimes their blood fights with each other. Either way, you know
really quick -they get up and walk around, or they're dead.

The Vet turns a little tap - Aragorn's blood flows down the tube. It hits
Will's vein.

WORDS CHISELED INTO STONE

"An Ape without knowledge is a fire without light."

Euripadape III

It stands over the doorway of a building high on a ridge. This is the Hall
of Learning. Ma-Gog - his lion skin cloak billowing behind him - hurries up
the steps.

THE BLADDER OF BLOOD

is empty. Guards are collaring Aragorn, preparing to drag him out. The door
into the room is thrown open. Ma-Gog enters. Nazgul and the others greet
him but he barely acknowledges it *

MA-GOG

Show him to me.

The Vet grabs Will's hair. He lifts up his head so that Ma-Gog can see his
face.

The high priest takes a step back - there's something about Will that fills
him with loathing. Anger flashes in his one good eye. He stares at Will.
His voice is Iow, almost to himself -

MA-GOG (CONT'D)

All my life I've dreaded this day.

(turns to the others)

Kill him.

DOCTOR ZORA

We've just spent an hour trying to save him -

MA-GOG

Kill him!

He grabs the stand holding the bladder and throws it to the ground. Doctor
Zora takes his arm, stopping him -

DOCTOR ZORA

The animal's unique, my lord. At least we should look at his brain. Maybe
it's possible to remove the frontal lobes without killing him. Imagine - a
tame human!

MA-GOG

Man can't be tamed. Alone among God's primates he kills for lust or greed.
He will murder his own brother to possess his brother's land.

NAZGUL

The doctor's only asking for a chance to experiment. The benefits would be
enormous. A tame species of human could double food production, at last we
could dam the rivers.

MA-GOG

You don't know what you're dealing with.

NAZGUL

It's just an animal, Ma-Gog.

MA-GOG

It's not. That's the trouble.

A movement on the stone slab. They turn and look - Will's eyelids are
fluttering. He's starting to come round. itl

He turns to Nazgul In the name of God - summon the Council of Elders.

Will's eyes are open now. Like through a glass - darkly - he sees the ape
guards coming for him. He tries to struggle but he's very weak. They haul
him off.

HEAVY IRON DOOR

set in a rock wall - on one side a key-hole. We tilt up the door to a
narrow set of bars high above it. A face, straining with effort, rises up
to peer through the bars. It is Will - looking like death but forcing
himself to do it, desperate to see where he is.

INSIDE THE CELL

The muscles across his shoulders ripple. His one good hand clutches the
bars. He hangs by it, supporting his weight, staring out at a vaulted
underground cavern. It looks like a cattle-yard, broken down and disused
nowa series of long pens, wooden chutes and a primitive conveyor belt.

Will can't support himself any longer - he tumbles to the ground. He crawls
across the floor and examines the door. It fits tight to the rock. There's
no hope of picking the lock - the key-hole doesn't even come all the way
through.

Suddenly he stops. Nothing for a moment, then he hears it again - a
scraping sound.

He peers under the wooden bed at the stone blocks that form wall. One of
the blocks moves. Will grabs hold of it and hauls it into the cell. Aragorn
squeezes through from the adjoining cell. He looks at Will -

ARAGORN

So you lived, then?

WILL

What did they do?

ARAGORN

They gave you blood.

He holds up his bandaged forearm - Will realizes where it came from.

WILL

I hope you had a medical.

Aragorn looks at him - confused. From a distance, the sound of horses
whinnying.

WILL (CONT'D)

What is this place?

ARAGORN

It was a slaughterhouse.

WILL

For horses?

ARAGORN

They use it for stables now. No - s different kind of animal. For humans.

Will stares, taken aback. Aragorn starts to gather twigs from the corners
of the cell.

ARAGORN (CONT'D)

In my father's time, the apes rounded up tribes and brought them here.
Young apes killed some during their manhood rites, the others were made
sport of in the corrals. At the end, the bodies were thrown onto the belts
and fed to the fire.

Aragorn has made a pyramid of twigs and leaves. From out of his cloak, he
takes two pieces of flint and strikes them. A spark starts the fire -

ARAGORN (CONT'D)

(softly)

Death is stuck to these walls, stranger -sounds not even s thousand winters
can take away. Sometimes of s night they speak to me - I can hear the
screams of my people.

Will looks at him. Firelight plays across their faces.

WILL

Why haven't they killed you?

ARAGORN

They keep me ss bait. My name is Aragorn -

He lifts his hand to Will - palm outwards. It's some form of greeting. Will
returns it.

ARAGORN (CONT'D)

I am the Ranger of the Easterlings, the Leader of the Seven Tribes. They
hope the warriors will come and try to free me.

WILL

And will they?

ARAGORN

Not if they fear my anger. I was taken in summer and now winter's almost
gone. Even the apes grow tired - soon they'll make me walk the Paths of the
Dead.

Will looks at Aragorn's eyes - they're fearless. The ornament glints on his
chest. Will points at it -

WILL

what is it?

ARAGORN

It's called the Crescent of Light - it's the talisman of my rank.

WILL

Silver.

ARAGORN

Mithral is how we name it..

Will reaches his hand towards it -

WILL

Can I borrow it?

Aragorn recoils - this is the most precious thing in the world to him. His
hand closes around the insignia -

ARAGORN

Who are you? What brings you to the valley of the tribes?

WILL

I meant you no harm. I'm looking for woman, one of my own kind. Do you know
of people like me?

ARAGORN

Never.

Will nods his head, accepting it. Slowly he reaches his hand out -

WILL

If you want to get out of hare. I need the talisman. Aragorn.

The two men look at each other. A beat - then Aragorn reaches up and
unfastens it.

THE TEMPLE OF THE APE

Torches burn on the walls. They cast a glow across the temple - the
underground stream, pools of water, shelves of rock hewn out of the walls.
Several apes crouch on them, praying to a golden idol of an ape.

Mist rises off of the pools. Moving through it, we see Nazgul, Drak and e
group of old apes. The Council of Elders is gathering. They pass through a
narrow door -

THE TEMPLE'S INNER CHAMBER

Oil lamps - hidden in alcoves - illuminate Ma-Gog. He stands in front of an
ancient book - strange symbols, like Sanskrit, run across its pages. This
is the Book of the Lore.

Ma-Gog looks at the Council of Elders seated in front of himNazgul, Drak
and five other huge apes - all leaders in their time.

MA-GOG

How many scrolls are there in the Book of the Lore?

Nobody replies - the question is so obvious it needs no answer.

MA-GOG (CONT'D)

One-hundred-and-seventy-six, you say -every child knows that.

(softly)

But every child is wrong. There is one more scroll - the last scroll,
sealed with seven seals, handed down from high priest to high priest...

He slides his hand under the top of the pedestal and releases a hidden
catch. The top - the Book still resting on it - tilts up, revealing a
secret compartment. It is lined with gold leaf. Lying in it is a slim folio
of pages -

MA-GOG (CONT'D)

It is called the Scroll of Revelation.

The Council of Elders stare in awed silence. Ma-Gog takes the pages out and
unfastens the seals. He reads -

MA-GOG (CONT'D)

"And it was given unto me to know the wisdom of ages. A silence fell and I
saw a new heaven and a new earth. Like through a glass, darkly, I saw the
future."

The Council of Elders stare at him. He limps forward and stops in front of
them. He recites from memory -

MA-GOG (CONT'D)

"Behold - there rose out of the earth a pale horse and the name of the
horse is Death. Those that ride on him are beasts, but like no beasts born
before. Their limbs are weak but their eyes are as cold as the sea. They
are given power over the earth to kill with the sword and with famine and
with fire. And let him that hath understanding know the number of these
beasts. It is the number of Man."

He raises his eyes and looks straight at the Councilors.

MA-GOG (CONT'D)

Today we saw that beast. Mark those words, my Lords - "their limbs are weak
but they are given power over the earth". Now will you listen? Kill him!
And if we don't? Then all hope will fail in this bitter winter.

He lays down the secret scroll and closes the secret compartment. Nazgul
looks from one to the other of the elders. Nobody says a word but he can
read their grim expressions. He turns to Drek -

NAZGUL

Kill him. Kill him with the sword and with fire. Kill himl

THE KEYHOLE TO THE CELL

It's a shining bright image, slightly distorted. We pull back to reveal
it's a reflection. Aragorn's silver ornament has been polished to a
brilliant luster. It's fixed to the end of a length of wood sticking
through the bars high above the iron door.

INSIDE THE CELL

The wooden bed has been smashed to pieces.

Both Aragorn and Will have used parts of their clothing to harness
themselves so they can see through the bars. Aragorn controls the pole with
the "mirror" on the end of it.

By looking into it, Will can see the keyhole on the other side of the door.
He has a pole with a nail attached to the end of it. He turns the pole,
guiding the nail towards the keyhole. He's trying to pick the lock.

WILL

Do you understand time.., what time is it?

Aragorn looks at the shadows in the slaughterhouse -

ARAGORN

Seven hours since the rising of the sun.

WILL

Just after noon...

ARAGORN

Shouldn't we wait until night?

WILL

(concentrating)

If I'm right, it's gonna be dark a lot sooner than you think.

The nail is almost in the key-hole. Half an inch to go... a quarter. It
slides off. Will curses and starts again -

THE SUN

beats down from a cloudleu sky. Drak and two huge Praetorian Guards - Max
and Hannibal - come through a huge stone portico. It's another entrance to
the Temple -one that opertl onto a central square. Orak and the two guards
hurry across it. towards the slaughterhouu.

THE NAIL

at the end of the pole slides into the keyhole. Will - barely breathing in
case it breaks his concentration - listens carefully. He moves the end of
the pole. The nail turns.

HUGE SET OF DOORS

are thrown open. Daylight spills into the slaughterhouse. Drak, Max and
Hannibal enter. Drak stops - he listens to the horses whinnying and
stomping their hooves -

DRAK

Something's wrong!

(turns to Max)

Get the dogs.

HANNIBAL

moves cautiously along the side one of the corrals, trying to see what's
wrong with the horses. Behind him - a movement in the shadows.

Sswhish. The sound of something slicing through the air. He turns -

It's the side of Aragorn's hand. It chops hard into the ape's throat,
shattering his larynx and blasting him into unconsciousness. He crumples to
the ground.

Aragorn and Will strip him of his weapons. Will starts to go but Aragorn
tears a strip off both their shirts. He ties the fabric around the ape's
ankles.

WILL

What are you doing?

ARAGORN

Watch - they're going to bring in the dogs.

THE DOGS

aren't really dogs at all - they're a much earlier ancestor. We call them
wolves. There are two of them, on the end of heavy leather leashes. Their
handlers have them in Will's cell, rubbing parts of the abandoned harnesses
in front of their noses. The wolves take the scent.

Drak watches as the handlers unfasten the leashes. The wolves leap out of
the cell.

HANNIBAL

rises groggily to his feet, clutching his injured throat. He takes a few
steps forward -Grrrr! He turns - the two wolves fly towards him. He tries
to yell but the only sound he can make is a squeak.

He runs - the fabric, unseen by him, trails from his ankles. The wolves
pound after him. He glances over his shoulder. First one wolf - then the
other - leaps.

Fangs and claws glistening, they hit him in the back, hurling him to the
ground. He writhes on to his back. One wolf tears at his ankles, the other
goes for his throat. Rip! Blood sprays as the artery breaks.

A STONE PASSAGE-WAY

Will and Aragorn are running, plunging down in to darkness. Arches and
corridors open off of it. It's like a labyrinth -

WILL

This doesn't seem like the way out.

ARAGORN

We're not going out - not yet.

WILL STOPS, GRABBING HOLD OF HIM, TURNING HIM ROUND -

WILL

So what are we doing?

ARAGORN

(softly)

We're going killing.

WILL

Killing?! Don't be stupid -

Will jerks on Aragorn's arm, starting to haul him back. Aragorn throws off
his hand -

ARAGORN

You do what you like! But I'm the Ranger of the Easterlings -I won't leave
here until it's done.

From behind them - the sounds of pursuit.

WILL

Shit!

He starts to run. Together they disappear into the gloom ahead.

ROW OF CAGE-LIKE CELLS

Will and Aragorn glide past them. They're taking it slowly, very carefully.

Now we see why - ahead of them is a set of steel doors. Torches on either
side illuminate a guard post but there's no sign of the sentry.

Will and Aragorn move closer. They pass -

CREVICE IN THE ROCK

We hold on the narrow opening, looking deep into the shadows. A big ape,
heavily armed, stands there. He has his back to us, his legs spread. A
trickle of water runs down the rock and drains away - he's taking a piss. A
shadow flickers on the wall above him. He sees it -THE PASSAGE-WAYMore
shadows -Will and Aragorn are move through the torchlight. The steel doors
are straight ahead.

The sentry slides out of the crevice - he's behind Will. Silently, back
pressed again6t the bars of a cell, he creeps closer to Will. He has a
curved knife in one hand and a short-handled spear in the other. Closer...
closer.

He raises the spear - a rustle of movement. Will spins - he sees the spear
about to thrust. He's a dead man.

An arm? It shoots between the bars of the cell and locks around the
sentry's throat, half choking him.

Will leaps forward and drives the butt of a weapon into the sentry's jaw.
The sentry crumples to the ground, revealing the face of the prisoner. It's
not a man, though -it's an ape. He's in his prime - barrel chested and a
fine head. His name is STRIDER.

He and Will look at each other through the bars.

STRIDER

Two rules in life - never play cards with anyone called Doc and never,
whatever else you do, turn your back on an ape.

Will stares at him. Strider grins. Will smiles back -

WILL

Thanks. I'll remember that.

He starts to search the sentry.

ARAGORN

What are you doing?

WILL

Looking for the keys.

ARAGORN

No!

WILL

He saved our lives.

ARAGORN

He's an ape!

Will shrugs himself free of Aragorn's hand -

WILL

You go and kill as many apes as you like - I'm setting this one free.

Aragorn looks at him. A beat.

ARAGORN

(softly)

It's not apes I'm going to kill.

A PRISON LABORATORY

The heavy steel doors stand open. Inside is a clean and gruesome room -
sinks and instruments along a wall, a series of operating tables and a row
of cages.

Behind the bars are six tribes-people - men, women and a little boy. All of
them carry surgical scars on their heads. It's made two of them blind; the
others stare blankly into space.

Aragorn moves down the cages. Several of them shuffle towards him but
there's no recognition - they're like the walking dead. Aragorn doesn't say
a word. Grim-faced, he loads the crossbow and starts to fire, killing them.

Will and Strider come through the doorway - they see Aragorn going from
cage to cage. Will steps forward, going to stop him. Strider's hand grabs
his shoulder, restraining him.

STRIDER

Leave it. He knows what he's doing.

Will turns and looks at him, questioning.

STRIDER (CONT'D)

The doctors operate on them - up here.

(taps his head)

The tribes think that we steal their souls...

(he pauses - softly)

Maybe they're right.

Aragorn reaches the last cage. A woman - in her 20s - stands in the middle
of the cell, looking at him. Aragorn stares at her face. His lip trembles
with emotion. She tilts her head on one side, as if trying to work
something out. Tears fill Aragorn's eyes. She stumbles a step forward. The
Ranger closes his eyes. He pulls the trigger. A crossbow bolt slams into
her chest and she falls.

Will leans against the doorway, unwilling to watch, staring down the
passageway. He turns at a footfall - Aragorn rejoins them. His voice is
hollow, as if something has died within him -

ARAGORN

It's done. We can go now.

He turns and leads them back down the passageway.

THE WOLVES

There's five of them now, hunting through the slaughter-house in a pack.
All around them we see the torches of the apes as they search the nooks and
crannies. The horses whinny wildly as they catch the scent of the wolves.

Will, Aragorn and Strider are crouched in a corner of the corral, smearing
their bodies with horse manure.

STRIDER

The fresher the better. Cover everything -that's the only way you'll hide
your scent.

The wolves sniff the air, coming closer. Will, staring through the rungs of
the coral, sees their gleaming eyes coming closer. He raises his crossbow,
getting ready.

The wolves stop. They raise their heads and look - the whole cavern is
growing dark. A giant shadow falls across the doorway into the outside
world.

The horses rear and buck. The apes are staring - darkness is falling in the
middle of the day. The wolves hackles rise in fear. They howl.

Aragorn and Strider are cowering back

ARAGORN

What is it?

WILL

Come on! Now!

He drags them forward and grabs hold of one of the horses.

AN UNEARTHLY LIGHT

has fallen on the city. The apes are in confusion - soldiers and workers
are running, children are screaming. A horse has thrown its rider and is
bolting down the terraces.

The darkness grows ever deeper. In the sky, the face of the moon
obliterates the sun - it's a full solar eclipse.

Two horses, flying at a gallop, charge through the doors of the
slaughterhouse. Will is on one, Aragorn clinging to his back. Strider is on
the other. They wheel across an open space, through running apes, and speed
down a terrace.

MA-GOG

steps out on to a rock ledge. He holds a staff in one hand, his cloak
thrown back over his shoulder, magnificent in the eerie light. He stares
down at the chaos. Drak swings across a ladder and lands at his side -

DRAK

What is it?

MA-GOG

(wild)

A sign - the hand of Man passes across the face of God! Lookl He points to
a terrace below - Will leads the other two escapees along a road and on to
the iron bridge. Drak and Ma-Gog stare at them. Darkness engulfs them.

Out of the blackness, an image -

CHRIST ON THE CROSS

It's a stained-glass window in a huge cathedral. A priest is at the altar
conducting Mass for the repose of the dead. We pull back to reveal a tiny
white coffin - just big enough for a baby. Next to it is another coffin.
And another - a row of them.

PRIEST

And even now as sorrow has no end, we find comfort in the words of the Lord
Jesus Christ. Did he not say unto Mark -"suffer the little children to come
unto me, for they are the Kingdom of Heaven. Now and forever." Amen.

The congregation - sad-eyed relatives and weeping parents - fill the pews.

CONGREGATION

Amen.

Pall-bearers lift up the tiny coffins. The organ starts to play. A soloist
- a tenor -steps to the side of the altar. He starts to sing the Latin hymn
"Penis Angelicas". The haunting words of the hymn fill the cathedral. They
carry over to -

THE SPACE DOME

is lit up by banks of lights that turn night into day. The clock tower
above the biology building shows the time2.00am. Even so, the area bustles
with activity.

INSIDE THE DOME

An illuminated chart dominates one wall - just like the strategy map in the
Pentagon's war room. Every research center is identified - next to it is
its function and a list of personnel. We see Princeton, Stanford, Texas
A&M, Los Alamos. Tentacles reach out to Oxford, the Pasteur Institute, the
University of Beijing...

Below the chart are nitrogen-cooled Cray super-computers. We track through
teams of men and women processing data, satellite dishes feeding a
communications network, a video conference taking place in a corner,
technicians routing and re-routing phone calls and faxes.

We come to a glass wall. On the other side is Diamond -

A SMALL OFFICE

Glass doors seal out the electronic hum. Diamond, staring through the
glass, looks exhausted. DeMaupassent sits on a couch. He's in his
shirt-sleeves, dark rings under his eyes. Next to him is Bob, the young
neurologist. He wears jeans and a t-shirt. On the front it says

"I'll sleep when I'm dead."

The coffee table is piled with files, journal extracts and computer
print-outs. A video projector beams a complex molecular structure on to a
screen.

Diamond rubs her eyes, trying to wipe away the fatigue.

DIAMOND

I'm sorry Luc - say that again.

DEMAUPASSANT

DEMAUPASSANT (CONT'D)

(kindly)

My fault, Billie - I rattle on too much. The result is - we've fixed the
time frame.

He hits the projector - the image of a fetus developing normally in the
womb appears on the screen... deMAUPASSANT

The fetus develops normally through the first trimester. Then it happens -
about sixteen weeks and two days, everything falls apart. The whole
chemical structure goes out of control -

He flashes up another image - a fetus that is already aging remarkably.
deMAUPASSANT

Once it starts, it's irreversible. If we're going to stop it, we've got to
intercede here -

He points at the slide of the normally developing fetus.

BOB

(taking over)

There's a trigger - some major fucking switch gets turned. That's what I've
been working on. It's definitely in the mDNA. There's a fragment of one
chromosome I'm looking at -

He flicks a switch on the video projector. A slide of a human gene,
massively magnified, popl on to the screen.

BOB (CONT'D)

It's so different, I call it the alien. How it got there, exactly what it
does - I haven't got the first idea.., no fucking idea at all.

Diamond looks at his grim face. He seems totally defeated.

DIAMOND

(quietly)

Is it that bad?

He stares at the floor. There's not even a hint of the former arrogance.

BOB

Someone's dropped us in the middle of the Louvre. We're blind men and
they've told us to find the Mona Lisa. There's four miles of galleries end
we've got five minutes to do it. That's how I feel -and that's when rm
optimistic.

Diamond turns to deMaupassant.

DIAMOND

Luc?

DEMAUPASSANT

I'm sixty-two years old. I've seen us go from DC3s to landing on the moon.
In my life I've won all the glittering prizes. I've always believed nothing
was beyond the reach of Man, but I'll tell you honestly - this may never be
unraveled. If it is, it won't be in my lifetime.

He looks at them. Silence. There's nothing anyone can say. He starts to
gather up his papers-

DEMAUPASSANT (CONT'D)

So what do we do? I think it's like Gatsby -"so we beat on, boats against
the current, borne back ceaselessly into the past." There's no other way,
ia there?

They nod their hoods - you have to try. DeMaupaasant and Bob start to
leave.

DIAMOND

Luc?

(he turns))

You're certain - about the time, I mean?

DEMAUPASSANT

(Nodding)

Sixteen weeks. How far along are you?

DIAMOND

Twelve weeks.

They look at one another. The old man speaks gently -

DEMAUPASSANT

Good night, Billie.

A TINY FETUS

perfectly formed - floats in the amniotic fluid. It's alive - the large
head sways, the heart beats through the translucent ribs.

Diamond has her shirt pulled up and her jeans down around her thighs. She
lies on a stainless steel table in a hi-tach examination room. A complex
array of equipment -ultra-sounds and scanners - beams down on her exposed
stomach. It projects a , video image onto a screen.

She is alone in the room, manipulating the equipment herself. She stares up
at the child growing in her womb. We see the genitalia.

DIAMOND

So - you're a little boy. It's funny - I think I knew.

She reaches up and gently touches the image of his face.

DIAMOND (CONT'D)

We've got four weeks. The way I see it -there's nothing to lose. I can't
tell you whet'Il happen to us. It's on the edge, mister. The air's so thin
out there, we may not even be able to breathe. But what the hell - it's a
chance.

She takes her hand away and looks at his face.

DIAMOND (CONT'D)

You want to try it? Sure you do. You're my son. We've waited all our lives
for each other.

A STACK OF HAND-WRITTEN NOTEPADS

lie on a table in the basement. We track through them - past computer
print-outs and dog-eared journals. We recognize them - these are Will's
detailed notes.

To the table is the makeshift lab - racks of bottles and syringes. In the
dim light we see Diamond. She removes the catheter from her vein, turns and
climbs up the flotation tank.

INSIDE THE TANK

Water sloshes back and forth. Diamond lowers herself in and floats there.
For a moment, she stares up at the circle of light spilling through the
hatch. We hold on her face.

DIAMOND (CONT'D)

(softly)

So we beat on, boats against the current.

She reaches up and pulls the hatch shut. Clang! Darkness.

THE SUN AND THE MOON

It's one of those strange twilights when both celestial bodies hang in the
sky together. Smoke drifts across them. We tilt down to ape city -

A column of smoke and flame spirals out of a stone chimney on top of the
slaughterhouse.

RED HOT FIRE

burns in a huge furnace at one end of the slaughterhouse. The rickety
conveyor belt is working, clattering away. Several ape workers throw the
bodies of the lab animals - the dead tribes-people - on to the belt.

The body of the young boy is carried forward on the belt. It dumps him into
the furnace. The flames engulf him.

WILL'S EMPTY CELL

The door hangs open. The space is lit by a dozen torches. Drak is alone,
moving around the cell, trying to work out how Will escaped. He looks at
the smashed bed, the hole in the wall, the torn clothing that made the
harness.

He swings the heavy door on its hinges and touches the lock. No answers
there. Lying in the doorway is the length of wood with the nail in the end.
Drak picks it up. He turns it over in his hand, th!nking about it.

He jumps! One handed he catches hold of the bars above the door.
Effortlessly, he hauls himself up and pokes the wood through the bars. The
nail touches the lock.

DRAK

(to himself)

Clever... you clever fucking animal.

DOCTOR ZORA (O.S.)

My lord...

He turns and sees the doctor hurrying towards him.

DOCTOR ZORA (CONT'D)

(urgent)

Could I see you please?

THE HALL OF POWER

is a magnificent room - stone columns and towering trees growing in huge
pots. At one end is a rock shelf - open to the gathering twilight.
Silhouetted against it, commanding a view of the entire city, is the
Council of Elders. They sit around a table made from bone and tusks, deep
in discussion.

Nazgul looks up - he sees Drak approaching through the shadows.

NAZGUL

Drak. I was just saying - maybe it's a blessing.

DRAK

A blessing?

NAZGUL

Where there's one, there must be others. If we'd killed him, we might never
find them.

MA-GOG

But the animal's not stupid - he knows come day-break we'll be tracking
him. Who's to say he'll run for home?

Drak stops in front of them.

DRAK

No - he's not stupid. But even dogs hunt in packs of seven. Every animal
needs its kind. And when we find them - what then?

MA-GOG

What do you think?!

DRAK

Just like the tribes - burn them out of their holes, put them to the sword?
I don't mind doing that - I like it - but it's never enough, is it? No
matter how many we kill, every year they're still here. Why will it be any
different with the Blue Eyes? What we need is a final solution.

NAZGUL And where do we find that?

DRAK (CONT'D)

Doctor Zora's brought back patients from a place called Kismatu. I've been
talking to her about it -

Several of the Council are looking at each other - perplexed.

MA-GOG

What is Kismatu?

NAZGUL

It's a tiny colony farther out than even the northern frontier. Females and
babies have been dying there.

He turns to Drak - his eyes intense, very interested.

NAZGUL (CONT'D)

Go on.

COOL AND LOVELY ROOM

There are iron barn on I series of high windows but in the middle of the
room is a jungle-gym. Underneath it are ape toys. Five baby apes sit on
cots. They must be no more than two or three years old but their faces end
bodies are those of old, old apeswizened and wrinkled, frail with age.

A double set of bars provide a sort of air-lock. Hanging on them is a sign

"Quarantine. No Entry".

Drak and the Council of Elders stare in at the children. Doctor Zora is
with them - she's nervous, twisting her fingers.

DOCTOR ZORA

We don't know what causes it- a virus probably. I'd hoped to complete our
research before I came to you with my proposal. But, given the
circumstances -

NAZGUL I

It's a brilliant idea.

(turns and smiles at her)

Brilliant.

HORSES' HOOVES

paw the ground. They're bound with cloth to stop them leaving a trail. It's
night -the horses are tethered near a fire burning in the lee of a rock.

Will and Strider have made camp - a hare roasts over the fire. Aragorn sits
well apart - a silhouette in the moonlight - staring out into the forest,
lost in his thoughts. Will and Strider look at him.

STRIDER

He's their leader - he can never take his eye from the mountain. He has to
do what he thinks is right.

WILL

(hard)

By killing them?

STRIDER

Don't judge him, Will. I couldn't have done it. I wonder if you could? One
of those women he just killed wes his daughter.

Will reacts. He turns and stares at the silhouette. A long beat.

WILL

(quietly)

We call it a Iobotomy. What other things have you people tried?

He turns to face him. Strider shrugs. There's something about it -
something almost evasive.

WILL (CONT'D)

Fuck you, Strider! Tell me!

He stares at Will - he's never seen him angry.

STRIDER

don't know if it's true.., my sister's mate works in the lab. He says
Doctor Zora's working on some disease -

Will comes towards him -

WILL

What sort of disease?

STRIDER

Of the children, I think - ape children.

WILL

How did they die, Strider? Old in the belly -is that how?!

STRIDER

Some of them. You know this disease?

Will stares at him, taking it in.

WILL

(softly)

So that's how it happened. Fuck you people.

STRIDER

They haven't done it yet. It may not work.

WILL

They will and it does.

He turns end takes step towards the forest. He runs his fingers through his
hair -WILL God help us.

STRIDER

That's funny - that's exactly what an ape would say.

Will turns. He and Strider stare at one another - the ape and the man, both
struck by the sudden commonality.

STRIDER (CONT'D)

I'm sorry...

Will walks slowly back to the fire. Strider starts to strip the meat off a
hare he's roasting over the flames. He offers it to Will. He shakes his
head - he's not hungry anymore. He stares into the flames -

WILL

What about you, Strider - why were you in the cell?

STRIDER

I fought another ape. Nothing very heroic, I'm afraid - I was drunk. He
fell badly, his head hit the branch of a tree going down. It broke his
neck.

He pauses We're not like humans. An ape never kills one of his own. Never.

WILL

What's the punishment?

STRIDER

At the ceremony of summer rites, the high priest would curse me with death.

I would have been left to die in the forest -no journey over the waterfall,
no-one to say the sacred words. Without that, no ape can walk in the next
world. You saved my life, Will and I'm grateful. But there's nothing I can
do about my soul. I'm a dead ape walking.

Strider stripe more meet off the hare. Will picks up a saddle and blanket
and starts to make himself bed.

STRIDER (CONT'D)

You knew, didn't you? You knew the sun was going to swallow the moon.
That's why you weren't afraid.

Will pauses - then he turns to him.

WILL

Yes - I knew.

STRIDER

WHO ARE YOU, WILL?

WILL

I've come a long way, Strider - it's farther then I can explain.

STRIDER

I've heard stories - old apes tell them 'round the fire late at night - of
strange lands where the creatures can tell the future. Is that where you're
from?

WILL

In a way.. yeah, it's something like that.

STRIDER

So what happens to it afl, to the world we've built? Tell me that.

WILL

It passes away.

Strider stares at him through the firelight.

STRIDER

History remembers, though - it's passed on, what we did, I mean?

WILL

No, Strider - there's nothing, not a trace left behind.

Strider thinks for a moment, then he smiles gently.

STRIDER

So it's just vanity then - what we believe, that the works of the ape will
last forever?

WILL

Yes, it's vanity. But not just of apes, Strider -maybe of men, too.

He turns and settles down on his makeshift bed. Strider - the food
forgotten - stares out into the night. A million stars hang on a velvet
sky.

Look down from them - in the vast blackness of the forest, one tiny
lightthe flickering fire.

DUST SWIRLING, HOOVES POUNDING

battalions of ape cavalry sweep out of the stables. Dawn is breaking across
the city. Ma-Gog stands on a ridge, his staff raised, blessing the army as
it rides out.

At its head is Drak. He clatters across the iron and wood bridge and down
the avenue of idols. Votive fires burn in front of every statue.

A RAINBOW

arches across the end of a tiny gorge. Dozens of streams cascade into
pools, spilling over ledges and swirling into ponds. Aragorn leads Will and
Strider along a hidden, path - a rock ledge that runs behind the
waterfalls.

The ledge widens into a large cave. Sunlight streams through a veil of
cascading water. Aragorn looks around - something's worrying him.

ARAGORN

This is the Rainbow Tribe's cave. They should be here.

A STONE FIREPLACE

Aragorn places his hand on the circle of stones, feeling its warmth.

ARAGORN (CONT'D)

They left at the rising of the sun.

He moves deeper into the cave - a maze of limestone caverns and
passage-ways. He stops at sleeping area - weapons lie there, food in
baskets.

ARAGORN

(softly)

Why such hurry?

Suddenly he stops, listening. He looks at Strider -

ARAGORN (CONT'D)

You heard it?

Strider nods his head - yes. Will hasn't heard a thing. He listens hard -
nothing.

ARAGORN (CONT'D)

Animal?

STRIDER

I don't think so.

Strider moves silently to the side of the cave. He picks up a crossbow.

STRIDER (CONT'D)

Is there another entrance?

ARAGORN

From the ridge above. Apes?

STRIDER

Scouts probably.

He cocks the crossbow. Aragorn has picks up a bow and spear. He moves
towards a cavern, signaling Strider to take a passageway.

Will grabs a crossbow. Strider tosses him a chain mail vest - armor. They
move off.

HONEYCOMB OF PASSAGES

eep in the cave. A sound - pebbles falling off a ledge. Then we see a
flicker of light - a torch is moving through a cavern. Whoever holds it,
turns a corner and is lost in darkness.

A CROSSROADS

of arches and stalactites. Will and Strider split apart. Will moves
silently through the darkness, into a cavern. Through an archway he sees a
shadow on the wall! He goes fast towards it -

A HUGE BOULDER

The shadow comes round the boulder. We tilt down and now we see who's
holding the torchDiamondl She's armed with a crossbow - cocked end loaded.
She turns a corner -

Ten feet in front of her is Strider. She stares at the massive ape's back -
a bandoleer of arrows slung over his shoulder. Her eyes widen with fear.
She raises the crossbow -

Strider hears it. He spins, weapon rising -

turns into a passage midway between them. He sees Diamond about to fire. He
screams -

Too late - she pulls the trigger! Will hurls himself forward - in front of
Strider. Whack! The arrow blasts into his chest. He crashes to the ground.

Diamond stares down at him.

DIAMOND

Will!

His eyes open - he's gasping for breath from the impact. He and Diamond
look at one another. Strider reaches down and rips the arrow out of Will's
chain mail armor. Diamond's shoulders sag with relief.

DIAMOND (CONT'D)

(indicates Strider Who's he?

WILL

I'll explain later.

He struggles to his feet and looks at Diamond -

WILL (CONT'D)

What made you come? I thought the mDNA was just a theory. One of dozens of
theories - isn't that what you said?

DIAMOND

We did a lot of work. I guess I was wrong.

WILL

People have been wrong about a lot of things.

THE GREAT VALLEY

stretches out below - primordial forests and cascading streams. Will and
Diamond stand on a rock ledge outside the cave.

WILL (CONT'D)

This is the rift valley in Kenya -

He points at the towering, snow-capped peak.

WILL (CONT'D)

That's Kilamanjaro - ten thousand feet higher but a hundred thousand years
of wind and rain will turn it into the mountain we know. Think of it -
we've come back a hundred thousand years! Everyone told me it couldn't be
done, but we've crossed the frontier now - Man has traveled through space
and time. How long has science dreamed of that?

DIAMOND

How long have you?

WILL

All my life.

DIAMOND

Dream no more. You've done it. Like you said in your note - it was Doctor
Robert Plant of UC Berkeley.

WILL turns and looks out at the valley -

WILL

(softly)

Yeah - I really have, haven't I?

Diamond watches him. There's a shout from inside the cave -

STRIDER (O.S.)

Aragorn - I've found it!

A CAVE PAINTING

Newly-drawn, is hidden in e nook high up in the main cave. Strider, Will
and Diamond watch aa Aregorn looks at it by torchlight.

ARAGORN

I thought they would leave word for their hunters. Kip-Kena has called a
gathering of the Seven Tribes.

WILL

Where?

ARAGORN

Two days' travel - at the Eagle's Nest.

He looks out through the mouth of the cave - twilight is closing in.

ARAGORN (CONT'D)

We'll stay hera tonight. Be ready to leave at first light.

THE EMBERS OF A FIRE

burn in the circle of stones. Aragorn and Strider are sleeping next to it.
Will and Diamond have been awake all night. They sit in the shadows near
the entrance to the cave, speaking quietly.

DIAMOND

An ape civilization? You said there was a city.., what happened to it all?

WILL

You know what we've found of Aragorn's whole race? Seventeen bones, that's
all. Anthropologists have discovered evidence of the apes - we call them
skulls. Bones last a lot longer than civilizations.

DIAMOND

I guess there's a lesson in that.

WILL

Listen, Billie - the apes have discovered a disease.

Diamond reacts. Will crouches down - in the dirt he scratches out a small
chain of circles. It's a molecule.

WILL (CONT'D)

It's really rare and, lucky for them, it's in an isolated area. They're not
stupid - they understand it's potential. They plan to give it to the tribes
-

He draws an arrow from the molecule to a bow-legged stick figure of a man.

WILL (CONT'D)

And maybe they do, but it doesn't matter -Aragorn's people aren't us.
Already evolution's taken another track -

scratches a cross through the bow-legged man. He draws the figure of an
upright human.

WILL (CONT'D)

Somewhere in the rift valley is someone like us - the first man.

DIAMOND

Woman. You said it was in the mitochondrial DNA - it has to be a woman.

She reaches forward and scratches long hair on to the figure's head.

WILL

You're right. Sooner or later the apes find her. She doesn't look like the
tribes but the apes don't care - she's human.

So they give her the disease. She's different though - it doesn't work, or
at least it doesn't seem to. It gets integrated into her. It's passed on,
it mutates, it weaves its way into the mDNA. It lies there - a bomb waiting
to go off. And then one day -

DIAMOND

After a hundred thousand years?

WILL

The planet's five billion years old. What's that to Nature? A blink of the
eye.

Will throws the stick down on the ground.

WILL (CONT'D)

That's the theory, anyway.

DIAMOND

(impressed)

A helluva theory, Doctor Plant.

HE TURNS AND LOOKS IT HER -

DIAMOND (CONT'D)

There's not much time, Will. We have to find her before the apes and we
have to do it within four weeks.

WILL

Jesus, Billie! Four weeks? We've got a theory - that's all. We don't even
know half the problems we're dealing with. You can't put a deadline on
science.

DIAMOND

Science, Will? What about people? Isn't that what this is all about. I'm
sorry - I thought there were children dying.

WILL

Sure. Of course it's about that too.

DIAMOND

But then, you don't care muchabout people do you?

THEY LOOK AT ONE ANOTHER. A BEAT. WILL'S VOICE IS HARD -

WILL

No - I guess I don't. Not for a long time. Ideas and knowledge are what
matter. They're the shining ideals. That's the only way we progress.

DIAMOND

Progress to what? We're both children of our age, aren't we? We've grown up
to believe the more we know, the more advanced we are. But what does that
mean if we've forgotten the things of real value. You know the reason I
came? It's got nothing to do with science or knowledge. I'm going to have a
child -that's why I'm here.

They look at one another.

DIAMOND (CONT'D)

Uke you said, the women's out there somewhere. Why ere we traveling with
them?

(indicates Aragore and Strider)

We should cut ourselves loose.

WILL

We wouldn't last a day. We've got to keep moving, Billie. The apes are like
storm-troopers.

DIAMOND

Where are they now?

WILL

Right behind. I think Strider has some sort of tribal intuition. He says he
can hear their hoof beats in his head.

The first rays of dawn pierce the mist from the waterfall. Will and Diamond
turn at a sound behind them - Aragorn is getting up.

ARAGORN

Ready?

A SPARKLING RIVER

winds through a beautiful valley. The two horses splash along the water's
edge. Strider and Aragorn are mounted on one, Will and Diamond on the
other. They turn a curve - Aragorn leads them out of the shallows and into
the forest.

THE CAVE OF THE RAINBOW

Ape soldiers are swarming over the cave. A TRACKER uses torchlight to study
footprints. He looks up at Orak -

TRACKER

There's four of them, my Lord.

DRAK

Four? The Tracker points It a at of prints -

TRACKER

It's woman. Blue Eyes has a mate.

DRAK

Excellent. I look forward to meeting her.

SOLDIER (O.S.)

My Lord - hoof prints.

Drak turns - the man stands on a path that curves up towards the roof of
the cave. Drak looks up - high above he sees a slash of daylight. It's
another entrance.

DRAK

Malakai! Bolag!

Two heavily-armed officers emerge from among the soldiers. With Drak they
run for the wall. They leap up the rock face - their massive hands grabbing
tiny ledges.

Other apes follow them. They scramble up the wall with amazing speed.

AN EAGLE CIRCLES

Soaring and hovering in the sky. We tilt down a tribesman - dressed in
skins edged with feathers - is perched high on a jagged peak. He's a
LOOKOUT. He tenses -

Four figures on foot appear on a path cut into the side of a cliff. The
Lookout gives a piercing crythe sound of an eagle. It carries down to -

SERIES OF WOODEN PLATFORMS

are built into the rocky crags, opening into caves. They are connected by
ladders and bridges slung across dizzying drops. The inhabitants here live
with their totem -this is the nest of the Tribe of the Eagle.

The platforms and caves are crowded with the gathering tribes. People turn
at the Lookout's cry. A man pushes through, listening - it's Kip-Kena.

THE LOOKOUT POST

Kip follows the direction of the Lookout's pointing finger. Will and
Diamond lead the other two - all on foot now - along the path.

KIP

It's the traveler! With a woman...

The Lookout shields his eyes against the sun - the visitors ere coming
closer.

LOOKOUT

The fool - he's brought an ape with himl He reaches for a bow but Kip's
hand falls on his arm, stopping him.

KIP

Who's the other one, though?

(realizing)

Aragorn!

He turns, yelling down to the platforms -

KIP (CONT'D)

It's the Ranger! The Ranger is free!

ON THE PLATFORMS

The tribes-people burst into action - running for the bridges, scaling the
ladders.

A WOODEN BRIDGE SWINGS THROUGH THE AIR

Whack! It locks into place on the far side of a deep crevasse. It's a
primitive drawbridge. Aragorn steps on to it, leading the others across.

The tribes-people are gathering, eager to greet him. Then they see Strider.
A ripple of fear and anger runs through them.

ARAGORN

The ape travels with me - treat him as a friend.

Nobody argues with the Ranger. He stops in front of Kip. The young warrior
starts to bow his head but Aragorn stops him. He puts out his arms - they
embrace.

Will crosses the bridge. Kip sees him. He grasps Will's arm in greeting -

KIP

You carry part of my spirit with you -I owe you my life. Welcome, Traveler.

INSIDE THE EAGLE'S NEST

A series of caves, connected by vaulted arches, extend in to the mountain.
They're crowded with members of various tribes - children are playing,
flint-knappers are fashioning tools, women ara cooking.

A shaft of sunlight strikes a ledge high up the wall. Kip and Will have
found a quiet place amid the bustle.

WILL

Are the seven tribes here?

KIP

All except the Antelope. They hunt the plains far to the west - they have
the longest journey.

WILL

Will they come?

KIP

Who knows - maybe the apes have found them. Nobody has seen them for many
summers gone. Why?

WILL

I'm searching for someone - a young woman. She looks like us ...

(he indicates Diamond))

I thought she might live with the tribes.

KIP

Is she a relative - was she born to your hearth?

WILL

To all of our hearths. My race reveres her. We think of her as the first
woman. Without her. our lives are nothing.

KIP

(nodding his head)

Women are of the spirit - we believe that. too. Mother Earth mates with the
totems. Only through woman can their children walk the world.

WILL

Have you seen her?

KIP

NO.

WILL

You're sure? Perhaps some of the women have seen something?

KIP

She looks like you, you say? No offense, Traveler, but the women say you're
the ugliest man they've ever seen. A woman that looks like you - I'm sure
they would have talked about it.

WILL

Ugly?

They smile at one another.

KIP

I'm sorry I can't help.

A torch flares below. Kip looks down into an adjoining cave. It's empty
except for a group of men - all warriors - filing in. These are the leaders
of each of the tribes.

ANOTHER TORCH IS LIT

They ring the walls of the small cave. By their light we see the skins, the
feathers and the symbols of each tribe's totem - the eagle, the tiger, the
rainbow...

Beneath each one squats its leader. One place is empty - the Tribe of the
Antelope. Will sits near the entrance. He watches Aragorn - dressed in
ceremonial robes, the Crescent of Light glistening at his neck - rise to
his feet.

ARAGORN

We've traveled without rest - there are soldiers a day behind. The ape says
it's an army.

KIP

And there are more coming from the north. Five squadrons et least, the
runners say. It's led by the old warrior Nazgul.

ARAGORN

Is that why you called the gathering?

KIP

Great things are moving, Ranger -

An old man, battle-scarred and gray, leans forward. He is the leader of the
Rainbow.

A RAINBOW

A stranger walks out of the west, the moon hides the sun, armies are on the
march - come the new moon, nothing in Middle Earth will be the same.

Others nod their heads in agreement.

KIP (CONT'D)

We either fight or flee - the Tribes must decide.

ARAGORN

I know you, Kip - you always were a fighter. What do the others say?

warrior in a feathered cloak speaks -

EAGLE

It doesn't matter what we say - the Ranger has returned. We'll follow
wherever he leads.

Aragorn looks at their faces. Slowly he shakes his head -

ARAGORN

I'll walk the path Mother Earth has laid for me, but I'll walk it no more
as Ranger.

The leaders stare at him. Several start to object but he silences them with
his hand -

ARAGORN

A man leads from his heart and winter has come early to mine.

(softly)

I took the life of my daughter - and some of your kinfolk with it. I did my
duty -nothing more can be asked of I men. But now others must walk in my
place.

He walks forward, unfastening the Crescent of Light. He stops in front of
Kip -

ARAGORN

If I should have had a son, I would have hoped for a man as fine as you.
This is my last act as Ranger of the Easterlings-

He reaches out and slips the Crescent of Light around Kip's neck.

ARAGORN (CONT'D)

Take care of my father's people. Guide them well.

(he looks at the leaders)

You must decide what is best for the Tribes. For me... I was the one that
had to strike the blow, but it was the apes who killed my child. Tomorrow I
will go to fight them. What father could do any less?

He turns away and walks towards the entrance. Only Will sees the tears in
his eyes.

KIDS' FACES, WIDE-EYED

They huddle together - staring at the strange-looking woman and the ape.
Strider is building a small fire at the side of the cave, Diamond lays down
furs for sleeping. , She looks up - the leaders are coming out of the
meeting. Will approaches.

WILL

They're going to war. They leave at dawn.

STRIDER

They'll be slaughtered.

WILL

They think if they leave the valley, their totems won't follow. Without
them, they say they're dead anyway.

DIAMOND

We should go now.

Will looks at her. She meets his gaze. Suddenly she realizes -

DIAMOND

Oh, nol We're not fighting someone else's war -

WILL

Listen to me -

DIAMOND

We've got four weeks, Willl Four weeks to find her. She's not here, so whet
are we waiting for? Let's go!

The tribes-people turn at the raised voices. Will takes Diamond's arm and
guides her to a private corner -

WILL

Listen, Billie! We know the future - but if we beat the apes, they can't
harm the woman.

DIAMOND

Beat the apes?! And say we don't - or say one of us gets captured. What
then? Don't you understand? Four weeksi

WILL

Yeah, I understand - but those things aren't going to happen. We know
things the apes can't even dream of. This is our world, Billie - men won it
with their minds. All we need is knowledge and science. We've got them
both. We can win!

DIAMOND

What are we going to do - dazzle them with calculus? This is an army, Will
- you said it yourself. Storm-trooperst

WILL

Look -

He bends and picks up s rock from the ground. He hands it to Diamond -

WILL (CONT'D)

Taste it. That's saltpeter - the natural form of potassium nitrate. The
caves are littered with the stuff. You've smelt the air - there's sulfur
all around. If we burn timber, that'Il give us charcoal. You're s scientist
- you know what it means.

Sure - she knows what it means. She stares at him.

DIAMOND

It's strange, isn't it? Give s man s problem and the first thing he thinks
about is weapons.

WILL

We're a frail species, Billea. It's only weapons that have made us bigger
than we are.

DIAMOND

Or smaller.

WILL

It's the apes who are going to be a whole lot smaller after this. We can
beat themi No more experiments - no more problem.

DIAMOND

(quietly)

I hope your right, Will.

FIRES BURN

all over the eagle's nest, turning piles of timber into charcoal. The camp
is a hive of activitycolumns of tribes-people make their way up from the
valley carrying piles of sulfur rock; women and children sit in circles,
pounding the saltpeter into dust. Will moves among the tribal leaders,
watching as they measure and combine the elements in bowls.

Strider sits apart, watching, not sure if the humans have lost their minds.

STRAW MAN FLIES TOWARDS US

He looks like a scarecrow except he's dressed in captured ape armor. Rigged
to a flying fox, he speeds past a rock face. All of the tribes-people are
gathered on the side of a crevasse, watching.

The straw men flies closer - towards a rocky outcrop. Will touches a
burning ember to the ground. We see a flash of flame as a fuse ignites but
we lose it among the rocks. A thin trail of smoke marks its passage.

The tribes-people watch - nothing seems to be happening. Suddenly - just as
the straw man reaches the outcrop -

Ka-boom! A huge explosion. Fire and flying rock hit the straw men.

The tribes-people scream. Terrified, they turn and run. Smoke and dust
obscure the flying fox. Will walks forward to examine his handiwork.

Tribes-people peer out from their hiding places - the smoke and dust clear.
They see the tattered shreds of the straw man hanging from the rope.
Several of the women start to cry in fear.

Will stands on the edge of the crevasse. He turns - Kip, Aragorn and the
other leaders are approaching. They look at him with trepidation.

KIP

You make fire from rocks of the earth -what is this thing?

WILL

Gunpowder.

Kip turns to the others. They repeat the word, as if that will unlock its
mystery.

WILL (CONT'D)

We've still got work to do.

He turns and goes. The tribes-people, emboldened by their leaders, come
closer. They draw back from Will as he makes his way through them. He comes
face to face with Strider. The man and the ape look at one another.

STRIDER

Apes believe men are the devil's children. Maybe they're right. What have
you done, Will - what have you unleashed on the world?

WILL

Nothing, Strider. The future, that's all.

STRIDER

I can't fight with you tomorrow, Will. To kill an ape in a brawl is one
thing, but I can't go to war against my people.

WILL

(kindly)

I never expected you to.

Again they look at one another. Will turns and leaves.

WATER FLYING, HOOVES POUNDING

Drak and his cavalry, pennants flying, gallop along the edge of a river.
Ranks of infantry, followed by horse-drawn supply wagons, travel behind.

The river swings around a point thick with trees. We crane up above the
foliage - a tributary flows clown the other side. Marching through the
shallows is another army of apes. At their head, on a stallion, is Nazgul.

The two squadrons converge at the end of the point. The foot soldiers meld
together, the Praetorian Guard splash ahead, Drak and Nazgul ride side by
side. Ahead, the river and its tributary pour over a broad rock ledge. It's
a natural weir -

THE FORD OF THE THREE RIVERS

A jumble of logs and broken branches lie snagged in the middle of the
river. The Praetorian Guard sweep past them and turn on to the weir.

The Guard spur their horses forward, forcing them through the fast-running
current, crossing to the other side -

IN THE TREES

A shadow of movement. Tribesmen glide through the dappled light of the
forest, almost invisible in skins and camouflage.

Will and Kip stand motionless, deep in shadow. They watch as the Guard on
their horses come thundering across the ford, straight towards them. The
infantry are close behind. Will drops his hand -

TRAILS OF FIRE

whip along the ground - out of the forest and on to the flattened rocks
that form part of the ford. The Guards' horses shy away. The apes look down
in puzzlement -

Boom! Boom! Booml Sections of the weir explode in plumes of rock and water.
Apes are cut to pieces, horses are hurled into the fast-flowing water.

On the far side - Orak's horse rears up. He drives his spurs into its
flanks, trying to control it. Clouds of dust and smoke billow across the
weir, the wounded are screaming - the ape cavalry wheel and turn in
confusion.

Drak plunges forward - chaos all around him. He pounds his chest with both
fists and roars -

DRAK

Apes - chargel

The apes still on their horses hear his cry. They spur their mounts
forward. The first of the cavalry reach -

THE SHORE

Boom... boom! More explosions rip the river bank to pieces.

IN THE FOREST

Batteries of cross-bows are mounted on a series of long wooden frames. The
Eagle leader and his warriors run from one to the other, touching flames to
rope fuses. Fire sizzles towards the crossbows, each one loaded with a
charge -

Bam...bam...bamf The scores of crossbows fire.

ON THE FORD

The ape cavalry are plunging through the smoke and debris. Wham! The hail
of arrows cut them to pieces.

Drak is in the middle of a whirling mass of apes and horses. He looks
through the smoke - into the forest. He sees Will, standing on a rock with
Kip, like a general commanding his army.

Drak bellows with rage. He snaps the reins, about to drive his horse
onward. An arrow flies in from the flank. Whackt It slams into Drak's chest
armor, splintering. He turns -

THE JUMBLE OF LOGS

floats in the middle of the river. The leader of the Rainbow Tribe, water
streaming off of him, kneels on the tangle of trees and branches, reloading
his bow. This is no jumble of logs - it's a firing platform they've
anchored therel

dozen Rainbow warriors, hidden in the water, clamber out of the river. They
kneel next to their leader, drlwing their bows -

THE FORD

Drak watches es I flight of arrows slam into the milling ranks of apes.
Right in front of him, an arrow rips through the throat of the leader of
the Praetorian Guard. Drak turns to Nazgul, yelling -

DRAK

The ones in the river - take themi Nazgul spurs his horse back across the
weir.

ON THE SHORE

Ape cavalry and infantry scramble up the river bank. Bam! They hear the
charges go off - the hurl themselves down. Another volley of arrows scythes
through them -

IN THE FOREST

The Eagle leader and his men work feverishly to reload and recharge the
batteries of crossbows. One of the warriors looks up - terror on his face.

Drak, followed by the remnants of his Praetorian Guard, charge through the
blue haze of gunsmoke - straight towards them.

One of the crossbow batteries fires! Arrows hit his horse's armor but Drak
doesn't falter. Crouched Iow in the saddle, he spins the Gatling gun like a
gunslinger. He locks it under his arm.

The eagle warriors start to break and run. The apes' horses sound like
thunder rolling closer. The Eagle leader and several of his warriors stand
their ground, desperately working to reload.

They spin the battery, sighting straight at Drak's chest. They fire! Arrows
fly -

Drak leaps out of the saddle! He catches hold of an overhanging bough. The
arrows whiz underneath, skimming his butt. He leaps again - higher into the
tree.

The Eagle leader looks up - sunlight sparkles on the leaves. It's dazzling
-

Smash! Drak's sword cleaves through one of the warriors. Drak has dropped
to the ground, right behind them. The Eagle leader turns - too latel
Rat-a-tat-tat! The Gatling gun fires. Arrows shred the Eagle leader's
feathered coat. He crumples to the ground like some fallen bird.

THE FORD

The ape infantry pour across the ford, charging over the bodies of their
fallen comrades.

THE FOREST

Riderless horses, part of the ape cavalry, charge wildly through the trees.
We tilt up - their riders have abandoned them and taken to the trees. The
branches are thick with apes firing, cutting down groups of running
tribesmen.

THE ROCK PLATFORM

Will and several tribesmen hurl camouflage aside revealing a long iron
barrel wedged in the rocks. One of the warriors tilts it up, aiming it at
the trees; another stokes pebbles and scraps of metal into the barrel.

Will touches an ember to a fuse. Everyone dives for cover -

Boom! The primitive cannon fires. The shrapnel hits the trees. Shredded
apes, branches and leaves fall to the ground.

Will and the warriors reload. Again they fire - but the charge is too big.
The whole cannon breaks free of the rocks. It flies like a missile and
smashes into the trunk of a tree. Timber!

A ROCKY GORGE

Its rugged walls are lined with piles of huge boulders. Aragorn and a group
of warriors are fighting hand-to-hand, being forced back by scores of ape
infantry.

Aragorn drives his spear at a huge ape. The point plunges into the animal's
belly, up and under his armor. Blood spurts out from the joins in the
metal.

IN THE TREES

An ape sharpshooter sights down his crossbow - straight at Aragorn. He
fires -

AMONG THE BOULDERS

Wham! The crossbow bolt smashes into Aragorn's shoulder, sending him
reeling. One of the tribesmen turns - it's Kip. He sees Aragorn on his
knees.

Kip wields a sword, fighting his way towards Aragorn. Slash! He takes one
ape across the chest. Whaml Another ape in the neck. He grabs Aragorn and
starts to drag him out of the melee.

IN THE TREES

The ape sharpshooter has Kip in his sights. His finger reaches for the
trigger. He starts to squeeze -

Sswhishl The sound of an arrow. Whackl It buries itself in the
sharpshooter's neck. He falls out of the tree -

HIGH AMONG THE BOULDERS

Will. He stands almost at the top of the gorge, lowering a crossbow. He
looks down at Kip's men - the apes, vastly superior in numbers, are
swarming forward, driving the tribesmen back.

On a ridge below him, four tribesmen scramble away from huge boulder. A
flash of fire then - Ka-bam!

ON THEGROUND

Apes are rushing forward. They hear the explosion. Several apes turn - the
huge boulder, split into chunks, flies towards them. The apes scatter.
Smashl The chunks knock apes aside like skittles.

But there's more of them behind, spilling in to the gorge, over-running it
-

THE DUST FROM THE EXPLOSION

swirls past Drak. He looks up - he sees Will on the ridge, silhouetted
against the sky.

Drak snarls deep in his throat. He wheels his horse and gallops hard
towards a trail that winds up among the boulders.

ON THE RIDGE

Will moves fast along the top of the ridge. He stops - looking down on the
river. On the other side, Nazgul and a platoon of apes unload huge leather
bladders from the wagons and empty them into the river.

Will shades hil ayes - the water glistens with iridescent colors. He
realizes - it's oil.

The current carries it straight towards the platform in the river. The
warriors of the Rainbow tribe - unaware - are still aboard, firing at the
apes on the ford.

Will turns fait - wa whip pan along the shoreline. He sees what he feared -
two apes below him with a fire burning. They slot flaming arrows into their
crossbows -

Will unslings his crossbow, steadies himself and fires -

Ks-whack! The arrow rips through one ape's neck. He pitches forward -
heed-first into the fire. The other ape hurls himself aside, diving for
cover.

Will re-loads. The side of the ape's head is just visible behind a rock. If
Will makes this, it's going to be a helluva shot.

His finger curls around the trigger - right behind him, the sound of
hooves. Will spins

it's Drak charging towards him. He raises the Gatling gun -

Will aims at the big ape's throat and fires.

Drak swerves. The arrow misses his throat but slams into his exposed
forearm. The Gatling gun flies from his hand.

There's no time for Will to re-load - he turns and runs.

Drak charges down on him. He draws a harpoon out of its scabbard.

Will scrambles over a crest - nothing but thin air!

Drak has him square in his sights. He draws back his arm, about to hurl the
harpoon. Will throws himself forward -

THE SIDE OF A CLIFF

Will falls down, down, down.

Drak reins his horse to a halt right at the edge. He looks over - Will
plunges towards the river, flowing fast below the ford.

Splash! Will cannonballs into the water and disappears. Drak stares down,
trying to catch sight of him. Nothing.

IN THE RIVER

A tree branch and other flotsam is being carried downstream by the current.
A pair of hands emerge from the water and grab hold of it. Will's head
follows.

Gasping, catching his breath, he looks upstream - the water pours over the
weir. A flaming arrow arcs through the air. The ape on the shore has done
his job -

THE OIL SLICK

erupts in flames as the arrow hits it. The whole surface of the river is
suddenly transformed into a raging blaze.

The Rainbow leader and his men turn. They see a wall of flame racing
towards them. Several warriors dive into the water, swimming for the shore
-

Whoosh! The flames engulf them. A wall of fire sweeps over the wooden
platform. Like macabre shadows - we see the dancing shapes of the dying
warriors.

IN THE RIVER

The current pulls Will down the river. He looks back - the molten fire
spills over the weir. Anguished screams are carried on the wind. A pillar
of black, oily smoke rises up high into the sky -

THE EAGLES' NEST

The platforms and rocky outcrops are crowded with the women, children and
old folks. Diamond and Strider stand together. All of them stare down at
the river valley. The pillar of smoke rises higher.

WOMAN (O.S.)

They're here!

Diamond turns - the woman is standing on the highest platform. Diamond
follows the direction of her outstretched arm.

A group of warriors, followed by their women-folk and children, are coming
round the mountain path. Their leader wears a golden fur and a head-dress
of auroch's horns. It's the Tribe of the Antelope.

OUTSIDE THE MAIN CAVE

A chorus of chattering voices. The new arrivals are surrounded by members
of their sister tribes. The leader of the Antelope stands in the center,
listening to a woman -Kip's wife. Whatever she's saying is lost in the
hubbub.

ANTELOPE

Quiet!

Instantly, the voices die.

ANTELOPE (CONT'D)

(anxious)

Where?

Kip's wife doesn't answer - she walks forward and points to the pillar of
smoke. The Antelope leader turns to his warriors.

ANTELOPE (CONT'D)

We go - now!

DIAMOND AND STRIDER

stand on the platform, watching several old men lower the drawbridge.
Whack! It locks into place. The antelope warriors cross it and disappear
down a narrow trail.

The rest of the Antelope tribe move towards the cave. Diamond turns away -
then she stops. Something has caught her eye. She stares at the crowd of
women and children heading into the cave.

STRIDER

What is it?

Diamond doesn't answer - she tenses. In the milling crowd of brown bodies,
she sees it again - a flash of gold. It*s sunlight on blonde hair.

DIAMOND

She's here.., holy God - she's herel It's not a woman - it's a child!

She grabs a rope ladder, ignores the rungs and slithers down it.

A YOUNG GIRL

helps her mother set up camp. She is about 10 years old, tawny-haired,
taller and straighter-backed'than any of her people. She looks like us.

Diamond pushes through the women and kids gathered around the hearth. She
stops. The young girl turns. For a moment she and Diamond stare at one
another, separated by a hundred thousand years, but so similar they can
both see themselves in the other.

THE YOUNG GIRL SMILES. DIAMOND RETURNS IT -

DIAMOND

What's your name?

The girl's mother stares, amazed to see someone who looks like her child.

MOTHER

Her name is Aiv.

DIAMOND

Ev?

(Realizing)

Of course. My people have a name like that - "Eve" is how we say it.

The mother nods - the sound seems to please her. Diamond puts out her arms
and indicates the young girl. The mother smiles, giving her permission.
Diamond puts her arms around Eve.

DIAMOND (CONT'D)

(softly)

I've come a long way to find you.

Eve looks at her - wide-eyed, innocent.

EVE

Why?

DIAMOND

To keep you safe.

She holds her tight. The mother catches Diamond's eye.

MOTHER

Do you have children?

Diamond shakes her head - no. The mother can't hide her disappointment.

DIAMOND

What's wrong?

MOTHER

I was hoping you had a son. Aiv's a sweet girl. She's the child of my
heart. But the way she looks, nobody will want her as a mate.

Before Diamond can answer there's a commotion outside the cave. She turns
to look - Strider and tribes-people are running out into the daylight.

SWIRLS OF DUST

rise up from I mountain path. Whatever's causing it is hidden from view by
the peaks and crags. The tribal-people gather on vantage points, watching
it come closer. Strider cocks his head - listening. A shadow of fear passes
across his face.

STRIDER

Horses! It's horses!

Horses mean apesi Panic sweeps through the tribes-people. Women grab their
children, young kids start screaming, old men and boys scramble for
weapons.

Diamond weaves through the flying mass of people. She swings up on to a
platform beside Strider. He points -

Coming into view on the mountain path - running and stumbling, dragging
their wounded - are what's left of the Antelope warriors.

Their women-folk cry out as they realize what has happened to their mates.
The warriors race along the path and across the drawbridge. Nobody raised
it when they left -

Several old men and a couple of boys struggle now to do it. They haul on
the ropes and pulleys. It starts to swing upwards -

Here he comes - Drak! He's galloping hard at the head of his cavalry,
battle scarred and bloodied. He sees the drawbridge starting to lift. He
doesn't pause - he whips his horse into a thundering gallop.

The bridge rises higher. Drak's horse leaps! It soars across the crevasse -
the giddylng drop stretches out below - and lands on the lifting bridge.

The men and boys stare in horror. Orak charges down on them. They back away
-all except one boy, not even in his teens, who stands his ground.

Swish! Drak's sword cleaves him from shoulder to waist. The other tribesmen
run. Wham! The drawbridge falls back into place. The ape cavalry charge
across it.

BROAD WOODEN PLATFORM

An ape horseman flies across the platform. He leaps off the edge, on to a
lower platform. Diamond's right in front of him!

She throws herself aside, grabs hold of a rope ladder and drops onto -

A ROCK SHELF

She looks across the broad area in front of the cave - apes everywhere,
weapons flashing, people screaming.

A young boy tries to out-run an ape warrior - it's Gray Beard. The young
boy hasn't got a chance. Gray Beard lashes out at him with a stock-whip.

It curls around the boy's ankle, tripping him. The boy looks up - he tries
to shield his face. Too late! The horse's hooves smash down -

Diamond looks away, unable to watch. She sees Eve. The young girl is at the
front of the cave, spinning in panic. Her mother runs towards her...

The mother doesn't see Gray Beard galloping towards her. Diamond screams a
warning but it's just one more crv in the commotion.

Gray Beard raises a short-handled lance and hurls it like a javelin. It
hits the mother in the small of the back, straight through the spine. She
pitches forward - dead. Eve screams and runs towards her mother.

Diamond leaps off the rock ledge -

IN FRONT OF THE CAVE

Diamond runs faster than she's ever run, sprinting to grab Eva. Drak wheels
his horse - he sees Diamond. His lip curls back and he smiles - one of the
Blue Eyes! And a woman! He leaps his horse forward -

DRAK

Grab the female!

Gray Beard is off his horse. Diamond runs towards him. He raises a
crossbow...

Drak charges down on her from behind. He holds the harpoon at his shoulder.
He aims at her legs.

Diamond races on - her only thought, to save Eve. It'll never happen -
she's as good as deadGray Beard's in front, aiming. Drak's right behind. He
hurls the harpoon.

Whoosh! Strider swings through the air. He clings to one of the rope
ladders - it's like Tarzan, except he's an ape. He grabs Diamond by the
scruff of the neck and yanks her out of the way.

Drak's harpoon skims past them. Gray Beard stares in amazement at the woman
flying through the air. But that's not his big surprise - with Diamond out
of the way, the harpoon is flying straight at him. He screams as it rips
into his throat.

HIGH ROCK LEDGE

Strider - Diamond clutched under his arm - lands on a ledge high above the
fight. Diamond turns fast and looks back -

IN FRONT OF THE CAVE

Eve crouches over the body of her mother. The woman's mouth is frozen in an
anguished scream, her dead eyes stare straight ahead. Eva shakes her,
desperately hoping for some sign of life. Nothing. Eve starts to cry.

A dark shadow falls across her. She looks up - it's Drak. He reaches down
and grabs her by the neck. He beats his chest with his fist and raises her
up above his head like a trophy.

ON THE ROCK LEDGE

Diamond, anguished, tries to go to the little girl but Strider holds her in
an iron grip. He swings Diamond off her feet, and leaps for an overhanging
branch of a tree. He jumpsfrom the tree to a jagged peak and vanishes from
sight.

CHARRED AND SMOKING WRECKAGE

floats at the shore of the river. It is what remains of the firing platform
- the bodies of several of the Rainbow warriors still on board.

Smoke curls away from the platform and drifts through the forest. The only
sound is the whinnying of a horse - it has a broken leg. Again and again it
tries to get to its feet.

A solitary figure makes his way through the shadows. It's Will, soaking wet
from the river. He stops at the entrance to the rocky gorge and looks at
the carnage all around him. So much for knowledge and science. This is
where the warriors of the tribes made their last stand - their bodies lie
huddled together in a jumble.

Will stares at them, anguish on his face.

WILL

(softly, to himself)

I was so sure...

He kneels and turns one of the bodies over. It's Kip - speared through the
chest. A shaft of sunlight hits the Crescent of Light. It glints on his
lifeless throat. Gently, he closes Kip's glassy eyes.

sound behind him. Will hurls himself aside, grabbing for a weapon. He looks
up -it's the Lookout, battle-stained and weary. Their eyes meet -

LOOKOUT

(quietly)

You said we'd win.

Will just nods - he knows.

LOOKOUT (CONT'D)

You gave us hope - that was the cruelest thing.

The Lookout kneels and crosses Kip's hands across his chest. He reaches
down and removes the Crescent of Light. He turns to Will -

LOOKOUT (CONT'D)

Get the weapons you need. The apes'Il be coming back for their dead. Hurry!

Will arms himself with crossbows and arrows from the bodies.

CLOUDS OF SMOKE

rise into the sky - the eagle's nest is on fire. Drak and his apes make
their way along a narrow mountain trail - they've put the humans' camp to
the torch.

With them is a long line of prisonerswomen and children mostly, many of
them in tears. They carry long poles over which are slung their dead and
dying. We crane, up to -

HUGE ROCK OVERHANG

high up the mountain-side. Standing underneath it, hidden in shadow, are
Diamond and Strider. They look down on the mountain trail. Diamond sees
Eve.

THE MOUNTAIN TRAIL

The young girl stumbles along the road, tied by a length of chain to Drak's
saddle. She's bruised and bleeding, her ankles shackled, barely able to
walk.

THE ROCK OVERHANG

Diamond looks at her, close to tears, but there's nothing she can do. She
watches the convoy wind along the trail.

Boomi The fire must have hit a store of gunpowder - an explosion rips
through the eagle's nest, blowing out the side of one of the peaks. Diamond
watches the dust climb into the sky. All her hopes seem to be going with
it.

IN THE RIVER

It's twilight. Will and the Lookout are wading around a knob of land that
protects one end of a tiny beach.

Will sees a fire burning on the sand, a cave opening off the beach, piles
of stones like burial mounds.

WILL

What is this place?

LOOKOUT

It's called the Crossroads of the Fallen King - it's where our forefathers
are laid to rest. It's sacred to us - anyone who's still alive will make
their way here.

They wade closer to the beach. In the firelight they see groups of
tribesmen -survivors of the battle. Women and children - the lucky few who
managed to flee the eagle's nest - are binding the warriors' wounds.

They look up - everyone falls silent at the sight of Will. As he comes
closer he recognizes a woman, sitting alone -

WILL

It's Kip's wife. She's come from

THE EAGLE'S NEST -

He goes towards her, passing the other tribes-people. Nobody greets him.
They just watch him pass. He stops in front of Kip's wife. Her eyes are red
from crying.

WILL

rm sorry about your mate.

She says nothing - she just stares at him. Will keeps going -

WILL (CONT'D)

I've been to the eagle's nest. I was looking for the woman I was with. We
searched but...

(he pauses)

What happened - was she captured?

KIP'S WIFE

I threw myself off a platform. I don't know what happened to anyone.

Will nods. He gets to his feet and moves to the women near the fire. We
don't hear what he says, but we know what he is asking. One after another
they shake their heads - no, they know nothing of Diamond.

SHAFT OF MOONLIGHT

shimmers on the water. Will sits on a rock that straggles into the water.
His face is grim, his heart heavy with grief. He's making something with
his hands - twisting and turning them - but in the dim light we can't see
what it is.

INSIDE THE CAVE

A shaft of moonlight falls on a semi-circle of rock slabs standing on their
end - it's like Stonehenge. The surviving tribes-people are gathered in
their shadow.

OLD MAN

It's half a day since the battle. Any that survived would be here by now -
we are all that remains of the Seven Tribes. The Ranger himself died on the
field. We must decide ourselves what to do.

Silence for a moment. They have spent too long following a leader for
discussion to come easily. Finally, a wounded warrior speaks -

WOUNDED WARRIOR

Like you say, Kip is dead. Maybe it's a sign -the Rangers have left Middle
Earth forever. Perhaps it's telling us to do the same.

A young woman - probably in her 20s - shakes her head.

YOUNG WOMAN

Leave the valley? This is where the eagles fly. This is their home. Nobody
can live without their totem - we all know that!

LOOKOUT

Nobody can live with the apes eitherl If we stay here, we die. But if we
travel beyond the Tower of the Moon, we've got a chance. Who knows - maybe
our totems will follow us?

There's a murmur of agreement. It grows louder, tribes-people nodding their
heads.

THE BEACH

Now we see what Will has been making - it's a boat made out of twigs and
leaves. A tiny hull and a gaff-rigged mast. He leans forward and drops it
in the water. He watches the current carry it away. Farther and farther it
bobs out into the river -

WILL

(softly)

I'm sorry, Billie. I should have listened - it wasn't our war. All you
wanted was a baby...

He can't go on. He watches the tiny boat disappear around the knob of land.

IN THE RIVER

The current carries the boat past a jagged boulder. An ape's hand reaches
out and picks it up. He lifts it up to look more closely. We see his face -
it's Strider. He turns the toy over in his hand, looking at it quizzically.
He hands it to Diamond, wading along behind him -

STRIDER

It looks like someone made it.

DIAMOND

It's a boat - it's gaff-rigged.

(realizing)

Oh, Jesus...

She plunges forward, wading as fast as she can.

DIAMOND (CONT'D)

Will!

ON THE BEACH

Will is walking up the beach. He stops, listening. He hears it again -his
name! He turns and heads towards the river. He sees Diamond coming round
the headland, splashing through the water.

Will stops. They look at one another - then they both move forward, arms
stretching out. They wrap their arms around each other.

WILL

(softly)

I thought I'd lost you.

DIAMOND

I thought you were dead.

They keep holding each other.

WILL

How did you find this place?

DIAMOND

Strider. His father was a tracker. We've been following a trail for hours.

Will looks over her shoulder - Strider is wading towards them.

DIAMOND (CONT'D)

He saved my life, Will.

Will goes to greet him. The man and the ape embrace.

WILL

Thank you, my friend - thank you.

STRIDER

What did you expect? You would have done the same for me.

SHOWER OF SPARKS

as Will puts a log on the fire. From inside the cave we hear the murmur of
voices as the argument goes back and forth.

Both Diamond and Strider are wrapped in furs - their clothes are laid out
next to the fire, drying. Will speaks to Diamond -

WILL

Some times when we want something so bad, we can take a thing and twist it
in our head. You're sure about this, Billie?

DIAMOND

I'm pregnant, Will - I'm not crazy. She's not like them - she's a mutation.
Evolution's always trying to improve on itself. It's turned out a child
that can walk taller and run faster, one whose brain-pan holds a mind that
can think laterally. I've seen her, Will. I've held her in my arms - she
was us.

Will looks at her. There's no doubt - he believes her.

WILL

You said she was with Drak.

DIAMOND

On a chain.

WILL

It's two days' march to the city. Was she wounded - can she make it?

DIAMOND

She can make it.

(a beat - she looks at him)

Will?

Before he can answer, the Old Man and several others come down the beach -

OLD MAN

It's decided - we're leaving the valley forever.

(turns to Strider)

Your people have won - the Seven Tribes of Middle Earth have been broken.
Long may their spirits haunt you

(he turns back to Will)

You and your mate can travel with u but we've got misery enough to carry.
Our hearth is not home to ny ape.

WILL

Then it's not home to us. The ape's better than any man I've known.

The Old Man's lip curls in a sneer. He shrugs and walks away.

STRIDER

Go with them. Will - everyone needs their own kind.

Will and Diamond newer almost simultaneously -

WILL

No!

DIAMOND

Of course we can't...

(to Will)

The city, Will.

Will and Strider turn nd look at her - incredulous.

WILL

We call it a city - it's more like a fortress, Billie. It can't be done.

DIAMOND

The three of you got out - everyone thought that was impossible too.

WILL

We were lucky. But that's the trouble with luck - it runs out. I don't want
to be back in the city when it does.

DIAMOND

What about Eve - what do we do, just forget about her?

WILL

No. Maybe we can't stop the apes giving her the disease - but they'll have
to turn her loose. That's the only way she can infect others. So we lay a
plan and we find her. Then it's our job to stop her having children. If we
can do that, it can't be passed on through the race.

She shrugs That's the only thing I can think of.

DIAMOND

How long will that take - less than twenty-five days ?

WILL

No.

DIAMOND So what of my child?

We have to face it - you're going to lose it.

She turns away, trying to keep her emotions in check. Will comes to her
side -

WILL (CONT'D)

We can't take our eye off the goal. If we solve this, you can have other
children. Not if wa throw our lives away, though.

DIAMOND

Whose, Will - whose children?

She looks at him. He meets her gaze. A beat.

WILL

guess that's your call.

DIAMOND

What sort of father would you make? You told me once the only thing that
matters is knowledge. That's wrong. Science and technology can only take
you so far - in the end it's our humanity that maners. That's what makes us
great. You're a wonderful scientist, Will -but what sort of person are you?
What would you do if it was your child?

She looks straight into his eyes. Finally he answers. Softly -

WILL

I don't know how to do it - not the humanity part, that's easy compared to
getting into the city. I just don't know...

He picks up a stick and starts to scratch out a rough map on the ground.

WILL (CONT'D)

It sits on a river. There's only one bridge -heavily guarded. Even if we
could cross it, all the ridges and roads are patrolled -

STRIDER

There's one place that's not.

Both Diamond and Will turn to him. He takes the stick -

STRIDER (CONT'D)

Down here - it's called Funeral Rock. It sits at the bottom of the temple.
From there you can make your way into the city. Even so, you still have to
cross the river.

He draws an arrow across the water, illustrating the problem. Diamond is
about to speak but she looks at Will - he's staring at the arrow, an idea,
half formed, is starting to form.

WILL

Maybe there is a way...across the river, I mean.

DIAMOND

How?

Will turns to her -

WILL

You'll love it - there's barely any science to it at all.

DIAMOND

We're going? Is that right - we're going!?

Their eyes meet and hold. He smiles at her.

THREE SILHOUETTES

travel fast along a high ridge. The sun - a fiery disc - rises right behind
them. We recognize their physiques - Will in the lead, then Diamond and
Strider. As they cross the face of the sun, we dissolve to -

LIGHTS TWINKLE

on the buildings and terraces of the apes' city. Will and his two comrades
are on a bluff, looking down. The sound of music and laughter drifts
towards them on the night air. Suddenly a huge tongue of flame shoots out
of a stone chimney.

STRIDER

They've started up the furnace.

(softly)

Let the games begin.

DIAMOND

What games?

WILL

The apes kill their prisoners for sport. The furnace takes care of the
bodies.

Diamond - sickened by it - turns to look at Will. Already he's heading off,
leading them down nrrow trail.

A HIDDEN LEDGE

much closer to the city. Will and the others move fast along it, deep in
the shadows. The river thunders by below them, separating them from the
city. The only way across is the massive iron and wood bridge. Ape guards
patrol it.

Only Diamond pauses to look et it. Will and Strider urge her forward. It
disappears from view.

A STEEL ARROW

flies through the air. Tied to its shaft, trailing out behind, is a rope
made from vines. Will lowers a crossbow. He watches the arrow fly through
the mist and spray -

THE RIVER

races by just below and pours over the Falls of No Return. Whack! The arrow
buries itself in the trunk of a massive tree standing on the bank.

ON THE OTHER SHORE

Will and Strider haul the rope taut and tie it round a tree. It stretches
from one side of the river to the other. All it has to do is hold. Will
turns to Diamond. He shouts to be heard over the roar of the falls -

WILL

You first. We'll be right behind.

Diamond scrambles up on to a rock platform and grabs hold of the rope. She
looks across the riverthe moonlight spills through the wind-blown spray;
the roaring water rushes by; the rope hangs like a thread. There's fear on
her face -

WILL (CONT'D)

You ready?

DIAMOND

It sure as shit ain't Kansas, is it?

WILL

Go!

Diamond throws herself forward. Her feet leave the platform. Hand over hand
she goes - out across the river.

Will watchel for a moment then launches himself - his hands wrap around the
rope.

Strider slings his crossbow over his shoulder and jumps. The line bows
under his weight. Diamond'l feet drop closer to the water. She looks down -
the mass of black water, flecked with foam, rushes past.

Will looks ahead - Diamond is almost lost in flurries of spray. She's
dripping wet, hauling herself forward -

The sound of the Falls is deafening. Right below her, a huge, swirling
"hole" opens up. It's a whirlpool. She starts to swing across it. Joltl

THE TREE TRUNK

The arrow pulls part way out of the tree. The steel shaft shivers but it
holds. Everything seems okay. Suddenly -

Snap! One of the strands of the vine breaks -

ON THE ROPE

Everything bucks and shudders. Diamond screams. She looks down - straight
into the vortex of the whirlpool. Her blood runs cold - she freezes.

WILL SEES HER HANGING MOTIONLESS ON THE ROPE. HE SCREAMS AT HER -

WILL

Go! Billie - go!

She doesn't seem to hear. Her eyes are wide with fear - staring down, down
into the whirlpool's bottomless well.

WILL, TRYING TO GET TO HER, HURLS HIMSELF FORWARD. THE ROPE STRAINS AND
BOWS -

WILL

Move!

She doesn't react. Strider watches as Will tries to catch up. The rope is
swaying so much it's agonizingly slow.

Diamond stares at a huge log spinning down into nothingness. The whirlpool
seems to be swallowing everything, even the moonlight -

WILL (CONT'D)

Billiai What about the baby?!

The word hits her. She pulls her eyes from the swirling death. She looks at
Will.

WILL (CONT'D)

Move, Billiel Nowl

She understands. She starts to pull herself forward. Will slumps with
relief -

ON THE SHORE

The arrow moves another inch out of the trunk. The rope fixed to its shaft
is strained to breaking point. But still everything holds...

THE IRON AND WOOD BRIDGE

One of the guards patrols the bridge. Out of the corner of his eye - flash
of something. He looks towards the Falls.

GUARD

(calling)

Gimla.

The other guard joins him. They peer through the night at the spray rising
from the Falls. They see it again - above the river, a flash of light on
metal.

The keep watching. An eddy of wind clears the mist for a second. They see
Strider going hand over hand along the rope, moonlight glinting on his
crossbow.

ON THE SHORE

Another strand of the rope breaks. We follow it as it unravels - past
Diamond and Will. Before we get to Strider it stops - a section of the rope
is so badly frayed it can't go any farther. It's going to break any moment.

Screech! A siren wails.

STRIDER

They've seen usl Will looks up-river to the bridge. Through a hole in the
mist he sees ape guards pointing and yelling. A whole squadron runs to join
them.

Diamond throws herself forward - she makes the shorel

Will and Strider give it everything they've got. Strider's first hand
passes the frayed section. He's following it with his second -

Snap! The whole rope breaks. Will - closest to the shore - plunges into the
ripping current. But at leaIt he's clinging to the rope with both hands.
Strider's in the water hanging on to the end of the rope by the fingers of
one paw. Will turns and reaches for him.

STRIDER (CONT'D)

No! Save yourselfl

ON THE SHORE

Diamond has grabbed hold of the rope and is trying to pull it in. The
weight - of the men and the current - make it impossible. All she can do is
try and hold them.

ON THE ROPE

Strider's fingers are slipping free. Will grabs him - man and ape, hand to
paw. Will holds him.

STRIDER

We'll both die. Let gol Will shakes his head - no. Hanging on to the rope
one-handed, the current tearing at his body, he tries to haul Strider in.

Whizz! An arrow flies past, just missing them, and plunges into the water.
The apes on the bridge are firing.

STRIDER (CONT'D)

Another minute, we'll both be dead. Do it, Willl

Will tries again to drag Strider to the rope. Another arrow flies through
the mist and spray - even closer. Strider reaches out with his free hand.
He starts to prize Will's fingers loose -

STRIDER (CONT'D)

If nothing else, I made it to the Falls No Return.

Will realizes - nothing is going to stop Strider.

WILL

The sacred words, Strider - what are the words?!

STRIDER

"In the beginning...

WILL

'In the beginning was the word and the word wes God...'

STRIDER

(in wonder)

You know the words?

WILL

You'll walk in the next world, Strider.

STRIDER

How do you know?

WILL

I've seen the future, haven't I?

Strider smiles at him - a smile of perfect peace.

STRIDER

Good-bye Will. Take care of Billie.

He twists Will's last finger free. He drops - the swirling river carries
him away. Will is close to tears, but he won't let himself cry. Two more
arrows sizzle past -

WILL

And the word was God. Yea, though I walk through the valley of death, I
will fear no evil...

Strider spins down the river, through the spray and foam.

WILL (O.S.) (CONT'D)

Surely goodness and mercy shall follow me all the days of my life and I
will dwell in the house of the Lord forever. Amen.

Strider, one arm raised, plunges over the Falls.

ON THE BRIDGE

We see who's been coordinating the firing. It's Drak. Archers are kneeling
on the bridge, trying to sight a target through the foaming water and
clouds of mist.

Drak, never taking his eyes off of the river, draws back the massive spring
of his crossbow and reloads.

ON THE SHORE

Diamond ia hauling on the rope, pulling it in. Will, up to his neck in
water, tows himself along it. His feet find a footing - he starts to
scramble up the bank. Diamond goes towards him -

Just for a moment, the mist clears.

ON THE BRIDGE

moment's long enough. Drak's seen him. In one fluid movement he adjusts his
aim and fires -

ON THE SHORE

Diamond is almost in Will's arms. Sswhack! The arrow rips into WiU's back,
through his ribs. He pitches forward. Diamond screams. He falls into her
arms.

The mist closes around them.

HUGE STONE ARCH

The survivors of the Seven Tribes travel fast along a forest trail. All of
them are burdened down with possessions, weary from the road - they are
leaving the valley.

Kip's Wife and the Old Man are in the lead. They pass through the arch, out
into a clearing. In the middle of it is a fire, shadows camped around it -

Kip's wife and the other survivors stop in fear. One of the shadows rises
from the. fire. Bathed in moonlight - almost ghost-like - he comes towards
them. It's Aragorn!

Kip's wife moves forward and embraces him -

KIP'S WIFE

We thought you were dead.

ARAGORN

Hunted, but not dead. A dozen of us were driven back in the battle -

He indicates his men. They are coming forward, greeting the survivors. The
Young Woman sees her mate - she cries out. They hold each other.

ARAGORN (CONT'D)

For three days a squadron of apes have tracked us. Last night we ambushed
them. We're heading now for the eagle's nest.

KIP'S WIFE

(softly)

There is no eagle's nest.

Aragorn stares at her, not wanting to believe it.

KIP'S WIFE (CONT'D)

We're all that's left of the Seven Tribes.

Grief wells up inside Aragorn. We hold on his face.

A FIRE CRACKLES

All of the tribes-people are gathered around it.

OLD MAN

There is no-one else, Aragorn - you are the Ranger.

ARAGORN

(shaking his head)

No. We must all follow the trail we think best. You've decided yours. For
me * I'll go to the city of the apes and take what revenge I can. I'll go
alone - but like the traveler, I think death will be the only thing I find
there.

OLD MAN

Then it will find us, too. Warriors follow their Ranger. That's always been
the way of it in Middle Earth.

ARAGORN

But nothing's the same now. Think of the women-folk. What will become of
them?

KIP'S WIFE

You're right - there's so few of us now, nothing is the same. You must
allow the women to follow, too.

ARAGORN But women can't fight.

KIP'S WIFE Women have never been allowed to fight. That doesn't mean they
can't.

All the women nod their assent. The men smile, agreeing. Everyone waits for
Aragorn to decide. A beat - then he nods his head and smiles.

The tribes-people start to cheer. The Lookout steps forward. From out of
the folds of his fur, he takes the Crescent of Light. All of the tribe
stare at it.

LOOKOUT

I found it on the battlefield. There were those who said the Rangers had
left Middle Earth forever - I didn't know what to do with it.

He hands it to Aragorn. The whole tribe watches as the proud man once again
ties the talisman of his rank around his neck.

ARAGORN

Douse the fire. The Seven Tribes are going to war.

ON THE SHORE

The apes, carrying torches, search the river bank and surrounding cliffs.
We push in on a pool of darkness behind them -

Will and Diamond hide in a hollow beneath the tangled roots of a huge tree.
They have done their best to dress Will's wound but he's obviously in a lot
of pain -

DIAMOND

You can't go on, Will - not like this.

WILL

What about the baby?

DIAMOND

I'll keep going - I'll try and get Eve.

WILL

Alone? Don't be ridiculous -

He starts to haul himself to his feet. His face twists in pain - he has to
stop.

DIAMOND

Look at you - you can barely walk.

He puts out his hand, needing I boost up.

WILL

If I can just get up - help me.

Diamond shakes her head - no. They look at one another.

WILL (CONT'D)

Don't do this to me - pleasel

DIAMOND

You've done enough - more than anyone else could. You're one of the finest
men

I've ever known - but it's over, Will. You're going to have to wait. Now
it's my turn -

She grabs her weapons and starts to leave. Will makes it to his feet -

WILL

Billie!She's almost through the tangled roots.

WILL (CONT'D)

I made a mistake once - I went on a journey with someone I loved. At the
end, I let her go into danger alone.

Diamond stops.

DIAMOND

Where was that - Berkeley, Will?

She turns and looks at him. He nods his head - yes.

DIAMOND (CONT'D)

What happened?

WILL

I knew I'd found the chemical key. I was working with three young
researchers. One of them was a woman called Ali Conoily. We were engaged.
They were the ones that went into the tanks. I didn't know as much as I
thought I did. They died in there.

DIAMOND

Why didn't you go, Will?

WILL

We all wanted to. It was a great adventure. Wa drew lots for it. I should
never have agreed, but we were young - and like the young we thought life
would last forever.

DIAMOND

Robert Plant died too, didn't he - in a way?

WILL

The experiment was unauthorized. There was an inquiry. They said the theory
had no basis. 'Ludicrous" was a word they used. My career had gone up like
a rocket. It came down like the stick. I couldn't find work anywhere

DIAMOND

"Will Robinson" - that was your joke, I guess. You were Lost in Space, were
you?

WILL

Yeah, but I never realized it'd be so appropriate.

They sort of smile at one another.

WILL (CONT'D)

had twenty years to work out where my research went wrong - so what,
though. It was just a mind game. But I've learnt a lot of things - the most
important is that sometimes you get a second chance. A second chance for a
lot of things -

He looks straight at her. They hold each other's eyes.

WILL (CONT'D)

And when you do, you have to grab it and make sure you never let it go.
I've got the heart, Billie. It's my body that's failing me.

Neither one of them moves. A beat.

DIAMOND

Give me your hand, Will.

She helps him to his feet.

A GIANT CHASM

It's several hours before dawn. In the gloom - whooshl Kip's Wife rides a
flying fox across a precipitous drop.

She lands on the other side of a jagged ravine. The rest of the tribe, all
heavily armed, are waiting there. They turn end run, fading into the trees.

THE FUNERAL ROCK

juts out into the roaring river. Will and Diamond scramble out of the
darkness and land on the rock. Will's face is haggard with pain but he
forces himself forward. He's loosening up. going faster as he moves -

They pass through the huge legs of the stone ape - into the Temple.

A DARKENED ROOM

Torches flicker on the walls. From somewhere close-by - muffled - we hear
the sound of a crowd. A young ape, barely in his teens, stands in the
middle of the room, almost naked. His face is painted with strange ochre
markings.

A circle of ape warriors watch as Ma-Gog lifts a slender blade. Intoning
words in some strange tongue, he slices the blade across the Teenager's
forehead. The Teenager winces but he doesn't cry out - this is his manhood
ceremony.

THE STABLES

The sound of the crowd is much louder here but still we don't see them. The
prisoners from the Eagle's Nest are crowded into the corrals.

One of the gates is thrown open. Three ape guards enter. They push the
tribes-people aside and grab a 12-year old boy. His mother clings to him,
screaming. One of the guards drags her off and they haul the boy out of the
corral.

AN ARENA

-like a small bullring - in the center of the stables. Now we see the crowd
- apes, all males, sit in the bleachers. They roar as a door is opened and
the young Tribe-Boy is pushed into the ring.

He looks around the arena - yelling, screaming apes. Terror on his face. An
even louder roar goes up. The Boy turns -

The Teenage ape steps out of a tunnel, the ochre markings on his face like
war-paint, the blood barely dried on his forehead. He carries spears and a
club.

One of the apes throws a couple of captured human weapons down to the Boy.
The Teenage ape moves in on him. He is a warrior now - this is going to be
his first kill.

IN THE CORRAL

The Boy's mother is huddled down, being comforted by other tribes-people. A
huge roar goes up from the arena as the first blow is struck. The sound
carries over to -

A TERRACE

Drak is alone, walking a high ridge. He stops, looking down on the
twinkling lights. The city is virtually deserted but Drak doesn't move -
he's uneasy, troubled by something he can't put a name to.

THE COOL AND LOVELY ROOM

The five baby apes sit on cots. They watch as Doctor Zora inserts a syringe
into the smallest ape's arm. The baby starts to cry. Doctor Zora comforts
her as she draws out a cup of blood. She turns to her assistant, Ben-Guri

DOCTOR ZORA

Is the girl animal ready?

BEN-GURI

They're doing it now.

INSIDE THE LABORATORY

Eve is struggling and crying as an ape guard carries her towards an
operating table. He and another guard start to strap her down.

The Vet works at the bench, heating a steel needle over a flame. It's the
same sort of catheter that was used on Will - one end of the needle
attached to a long tube. A knock on the door.

VET

That must be Zors with the blood.

One of the guards goes and unbolts the door. He recoils - it's Will.
Sswhack! He fires the first bolt from a double-barreled crossbow. It takes
the guard in the chest.

He and Diamond dive into the room. Eve starts hollering. The second guard
is wheeling, crossbow rising. He rifle-butts Diamond across the head. Her
weapon goes flying.

The guard is aiming. Will is on the floor, tumbling. Barely time to aim, on
his back, firing overhead, he shoots -

Whack! Bullseye. The arrow hits the guard dead in the heed.

The Vet grabs the first guard's fallen crossbow. He aims at Will. Diamond
screams a warning but there's nothing Will can do - he's struggling to
reload, one-handed because of his wounds.

Diamond - unarmed - scoops the red-hot syringe off the bench. The Vet
reaches for the trigger. Diamond leaps forward. She drives the syringe into
his chest.

The Vet stands goggle-eyed. Diamond must have found his heart - a torrent
of blood pours down the clear tube. It spills on to the floor. The Vet
topples forward.

Slash! Slash! Will cuts throughthe straps that tie Eve to the table.

OUTSIDE THE HALL OF LEARNING

Drak turns a corner of the building. He stops and touches the ground with
his finger. He lifts it to his mouth and tastes it. He rises to his feet,
following trail of blood.

A TORCH

is ripped from a bracket. It's Drak.. He shines it down into a stone well.
The flame splits the darkness. Floating in the water at the bottom of the
well is an ape guard -dead, an arrow through his throat.

IN THE ARENA

The Tribe-Boy is sprawled in the dust, bleeding badly from a rip across his
ribs. His spear lies next to him, a wooden shield raised across his head.
The Teenage ape , rains blows down on it with a sword.

The apes in the bleachers are cheering wildly. Smash! The shield splinters.
The sword slices the Boy's arm -

APES

Kill! Kill! Kill!

The Boy stares up - the Teenage smiles and raises his sword.

Shriek! The alarm sounds. Everything freezes. Then officers are on their
feet, yelling orders. Ape soldiers grab their weapons, heading for the
doors.

The Teenage ape looks around, robbed of his moment. The Boy sees his
chance. He raises his spear and drives it deep into the ape's groin. He
staggers and falls - on top of the Boy.

The apes pour out of the arena. The siren carries over to -

A STONE CORRIDOR

Will's got Eve slung over his shoulder. They're stumbling down a corridor -
past other labs and research rooms. They burst through a sat of doors, into
-

A COURTYARD

at the back of the Hall of Learning. It's deep in shadow. From behind they
hear the sound of pounding feet. Will looks around, not sure which way to
go. He glances across a terrace - the doors to the stables fly open. The
ape warriors charge out.

WILL

Can you ride?

Diamond nods her head - yes. He thrusts Eve into her hands -

WILL (CONT'D)

Go for the stables. Head for the eagle's nest. I'll try to join you there.

Diamond hesitates - she doesn't want to leave him.

DIAMOND

What are you going to do?

WILL

Delay them. Now go, Billie. Go!

THE PRIMITIVE ELEVATOR

rops down the side of the ravine. Standing on it are Nazgul and about

THE PRIMITIVE ELEVATOR

a dozen Praetorian Guards. Nazgul looks down - torches and fires in drums
are lighting up the streets and terraces. Ape soldiers are running
everywhere - searching.

ON THE GROUND

The flame-thrower rolls along a street. The driver's canopy is hidden by
flapping tarpaulins. In the chaos nobody pays it any attention.

ON THE ELEVATOR

Nazgul sees the machine rolling towards them.

NAZGUL

That's strange - why does Drak need the Flame?

Suddenly he realizel. He turns, screaming up at the apes controlling the
mechanism.

NAZGUL (CONT'D)

Stopl Take it backl

THE FLAME-THROWER

dead guard is draped over the side of the machine, blood dripping from his
headWill is in the cabin, working the controls. He sees the elevator slow
in mid-descent. He throws a lever forward. For a moment, nothing. Then -

Whoosh! A huge tongue of flame blasts out of the barrel.

Two of the guards are trying to climb the ropes. Nazgul is wheeling around
in a panic. The flame hits them! The whole wooden structure catches fire.
We see the apes through the flames, struggling and writhing.

The ropes burn through. The blazing structure plummets down -

THE CENTRAL SQUARE

Smash! It hits the ground in a shower of blazing timbers and dead apes. Ape
soldiers - standing nearby - stare in shock. The smell of roasted ape fills
the air.

EVE SITS ALONE

She's on the floor of the stables, deep in shadow. She's scared, looking
ahead -

The first weak light of dawn shines through the open doors. We see an ape
guard, keys jangling from his waist, on petrol.

He hears something - a rock falling, a rustle of movement. Raising his
weapon, he moves towards a pool of black shadow, past a pile of rocks, into
an alcove.

Diamond rises out of the rocks behind him. He spins - she's got her
cross-bow raised. Point-blank range. She nails him.

THE PRISONERS

are shackled in the corrals. They see Diamond running out of the shadows
towards them. She tossel them the keys -

DIAMOND

Arm yourselves. Find Will - he needs youl She turns and goes. The prisoners
start to unlock the chains.

EVE

smiles as Diamond races out of the shadows, sweeps her up and keeps
running.

IN THE ARENA

The Teenage ape and the Boy lie where they fell, their spilt blood staining
the dust.

The Boy's mother scrambles over the deserted bleachers and goes to her son.
She drags off the ape. Her son's eyes are closed, his arms lacerated, his
chest wounded and crusted with blood. She stares at him - he doesn't move.

She starts to sob. The Boy's eyes flicker open. They look at one another.
The motheY gathers him into her arms. He's alive! He's alive!

The sound of a horse. The mother turns, fearful. She looks across the
arena, through a railing -

IN THE CORRALS

Diamond gallops a stallion through the corrals. Eve's clutching the saddle
in front of her - hair flying, her eyes sparkling with exhilaration. The
stallion gallops faster.

The prisoners - unchaining the last of their comrades - turn and look. It's
a magnificent sight. Diamond is crouched Iow over the flying horse.
Straight ahead - a railed fence, part of the corral.

She leaps the horse over it. They land. In front - another hurdle. Again
she does it.

The prisoners stare. Diamond charges towards the open doors of the stables.

CLOUDS OF SMOKE AND FLAME

The crashed elevator hal set the surrounding buildings on fire. Ape city is
burning.

The Flame stands on a steep incline, its back wedged against the wall of a
terrace. Whooshl Fire shoots out of its barrel as Will keeps a horde of ape
soldiers at bay.

The soldiers turn - Drak, surrounded by the Praetorian Guard, gallops
straight towards them. He'l not stopping for anything - the soldiers
scramble aside.

IN THE CABIN

Will sees Drak and the guards appear through the swirling clouds of smoke.
They look like the horsemen of the apocalypse. As Will throws the lever we
sea a primitive gauge above his head. It's in the red -

IN THE SQUARE

Whoosh! The tongue of flame shoots through the smoke. It touches the guards
with a deadly kiss, throwing them screaming from their horses. But Drak
blasts through -

IN THE CABIN

Will is engulfed in a backdraft of black oily smoke. He peers through it -
Drak charges towards him! Will hits the lever again. The flame erupts from
the barrel. Then it dies - out of fuel.

WILL

Shit!

IN THE SQUARE

Drak gallops forward. He raises weapon - a shoulder-mounted harpoon. He
aims -

IN THE CABIN

Will throws himself aside. He smashes both hands down on a lever on the
floor. A hiss of steam. The machine lurches forward -

IN THE SQUARE

Drak tries to get a clear shot at Will. The machine gathers speed down the
incline, coming straight towards Drak. He veers his horse aside and wheels
around. He charges alongside the cabin - it's empty

ON THE MACHINE

Will clings to the outside of the Flame as it roars across the smoke-filled
square. He's out of sight of Drak - but not for long. The ape and his
stallion loom into view behind the machine, Will scrambles back into the
cabin -

IN THE SQUARE

Apes are scattering as the runaway machine flies across the square. Drak is
at full gallop, veering from one side of the Flame to the other. Will
clambers back and forth - cat and mouse at full tilt.

Drak swings his horse close to the back of the machine. He stands up in the
stirrups, the harpoon clamped to his shoulder - he's going on board!

The Flame flies out of the square and down a street. An ape throws himself
into a doorway - just in time, Drak steadies himself, about to jump.
Suddenly his horse whinnies wildly. Drak looks ahead - holy shit!. They're
heading straight for the front of a blazing house.

Drak throws himself down into the saddle and hauls on the reins. Will hurls
himself back into the cabin, arms shielding his head. Smash! The Flame
crashes through the front wall -

INSIDE THE HOUSE

The barrel of the Flame acts like a battering ram - it blasts through the
walls in a shower of burning timbers. It crashes through the kitchen and
stops in a courtyard.

Will clambers out of the cabin and drops to the ground. A yell goes up -
apes are coming through the adjoining houses. Will turns and heads down an
alleyway.

CITY STREET

Diamond's horse flies down a street - a high terrace towers on one side, a
row of burning buildings on the other. The road turns right. She swings
around it - apes! A platoon of them right in front of her. She screams at
Eve -

DIAMOND

Hold on!

She throws herself aside, pulling on the reins. The horse spins in a
U-turn, grazing past a burning building. Diamond gallops back the way she
came.

Crash! The wall of a burning building in front of her collapses. Blazing
beams block the road. The horse shies away. Diamond wheels him around -

The apes race into the road. She looks around desperately - she's trapped.
She grabs Eve and awingl her onto the saddle behind her - she'll be safer
there.

She spurs the horse forward and crouches Iow in the saddle - she's going to
charge straight through the apes. They drop to one knee - the firing
position - and raise their weapons. A dozen crossbowl aim straight at
Diamond.

There's no way out - she flies towards them. Whizzl The sound of arrows.
But it's not the apes - they go down like nine-pins.

Diamond looks up - Aragorn has arrived! Backlit by the rising sun, the men
and women of the Tribes are pouring volley after volley into the apes.
Nobody fires better than Kip's Wife.

Diamond leaps the horse through the dead and dying apes and turns down the
road.

MA-GOG

stands on a terrace, his cloak blowing in the wind, his one cruel eye
blazing with anger. Flanked by two ape warriors, he looks down on the
burning buildings.

The freed prisoners are waging a pitched battle outside the stables.

Ma-Gog sees Will - he's running along the rooftops, leaping from one
building to the next. Ma-Gog points at him, yelling at apes in the streets
below -

MA-GOG (CONT'D)

Kill him! In the name of God, kill himl Sswhish! The blade of a sword
cleaves through frame. It cuts one of the ape warriors from neck to waist.
Ma-Gog spins - it's Aragorn, armed to the teeth, behind them.

The second warrior goes for him. Aragorn has dropped the sword. He raises a
crossbow and fires. The bolt shatters the ape's armor and buries itself in
his chest.

Ma-Gog swirls aside his cloak. In his good hand he holds a double-edged
sword. Aragorn drops the crossbow ands ducks beneath Ma-Gog's arcing blow.
He lunges with a short-handled spear -

ARAGORN

For my people!

It takes Ma-Gog in the gut. His one eye bulges. Aragorn rips the spear out
-

ARAGORN (CONT'D)

And this - for my daughterl He drives the spear into the High Priest's
heart. The cruel eye flickers and dies.

ON THE ROOFTOP

Will has seen it all. He screams -

WILL

Behind you! Aragorn - behind!

ON THE TERRACE

Aragorn turns. It's Drak, on horseback, thundering down on him. But the
leader of the Seven Tribes knows no fear - only the memory of his lost
child.

He raises his second spear and charges straight at Drak. The huge ape
levels the shoulder-mounted harpoon. He pulls the trigger. Sswang! The
powerful spring on the barrel releases, the harpoon trails a length of rope
behind it -

Wham! The harpoon smashes through Aragorn's chest. He dies as he falls.

ON THE ROOFTOP

Will stares in anguish. He turns away - he sees Diamond. She's at full
gallop - Eve clinging to her back - charging along a road several terraces
below. She's got a clear run for the iron bridge and freedom.

Will looks across at Drak - he's seen her too! For a moment the two of them
stare at one another. Will's face is drawn and haggard from the injuries he
carries.

Drak's lip curls in a sneer - he knows he's going to win. He beats his
chest with his fists and spurs the stallion over the edge of the terrace,
going for Diamond.

Will runs as fast as his body will let him - along the rooftop.

INSIDE A HOUSE

An ape mother cowers in a corner, her two children clutched to her, the
sounds of battle all around. She looks up in terror -

Smash! Will's feet blast through the roof. He lands on the floor, crossbow
raised -but not st her. Framed in the front doorway is an ape warrior on
horseback. Wham! Will shoots him and runs for the horse.

DIAMOND

and Eve fly down charred street .They head towards a large open square.

OUTSIDE THE STABLES

Smoke and dust swirl through the air. The freed prisoners are fighting ape
infantry. Drak races past the battle. The rope from the harpoon is tied
around the saddle, dragging Aragorn's body through the dust.

He looks ahead - Diamond gallops across the square. Drak whips his horse
forward -

A CURVED ROAD

on a high terrace. Flying around a corner - Will! His coat is billowing,
the horse's mane streaming in the wind. He hits the straight-away and
gallops even faster.

He looks down on the road below - Diamond is ahead but Drak is gaining on
her. Will plunges into a tunnelhewn out of rock.

ON THE ROAD

Eve clings tight to Diamond's waist. The little girl looks back - Drak is
thundering behind them, pennants snapping in the wind, armor glinting on
the horse's chest. It's an awesome sight.

Drak has the reins in his teeth. He's using both hands to reload the
harpoon.

Diamond sees the bridge dead ahead. Heavily armed apes have barricaded it.
She curses and yanks the bridle. The horse sweeps around an island in the
center of the road - a huge monument to some dead ape. She gallops back the
way she came, almost passing Drak. He charges round the island.

OUT OF THE TUNNEL

comes Will. He looks down to the lower road - Diamond and Drak are coming
back towards him! He turns the horse around - back into the tunnel.

Whooshl He flies out the other end, into daylight. He looks over his
shoulder - he's in front of them but thirty feet too high. He digs his
heels into the horse's flanks -over a Iow wall they fly. God knows where it
goes -

DOWN A ROCKY SUDE

into a dead-end cul-de-sac just above the roadway. Apesi Two of them are
guarding the Claw and the Bells. Will fires from the shoulder - he drops
the first ape.

The second ape aims at him. Will raises another crossbow. They fire almost
simultaneously. Will throws himself aside, out of the saddle. The horse
rears and bolts.

Will looks up from the dirt - the ape has Will's arrow embedded in his
chest. He falls forward - dead.

Will scrambles to a parapet and looks down on the road just below. Diamond
and Eve - clinging to the horse for dear life - race towards him. Will
grabs a crossbow and struggles to reload. He can't - it takes the strength
of both arms to cock it,

ON THE ROAD

Diamond's horse is lathered in sweat, almost blown. Eve looks over her
shoulder, her eyes wide with fear - Drak is close behind, gaining at every
step.

IN THE CUL-DE-SAC

Will leaps from the Balls on to the Claw.

ON THE ROAD

Drak swings the harpoon on to his shoulder. He sights down the barrel. Eve
sees the weapon lock on to their backs. She screams a warning et Diamond -

EVE

Billie!

Diamond leaps the horse over a charred wagon abandoned on the road. Drak
loses her in his sights. He follows her over the wagon.

ON THE CLAW

Will is in the driver's seat. He throws a lever - nothing happens. He tries
another -the long jib that supportl the two iron jews swings towards the
road.

DRAK

aims the harpoon. He's got Eve end Diamond, one behind the other, in his
sights.

DRAK

A bargain - two for the price of onel

ON THE CLAW

Will spins a small steering wheel.

ON THE ROAD

Drak is close behind Diamond. The harpoon's massive spring is coiled.
Drak's finger curls around the trigger, about to fire.

Suddenly he screams - dropping right in front, coming straight towards him,
are the opening jaws of the Claw.

WILL JERKS BACK ANOTHER LEVER -

WILL

Keep your hands off her, you dirty ape.

The jaws lock clean around Drak's waist, plucking him off the saddle and
lifting him up into the air. He's still got the harpoon. He sees Will at
the control. He swings the barrel round -

Will hits a switch. Wrong one - nothing happens.

Drak's got him in his sights. His finger finds the trigger -

Will throws another switch.

The jaws start to close! Drak tries to pull the trigger - he can't, his
body is twisting. The jaws are crushing him! He musters all of his strength
and tries to fire. He and Will look straight at one another. A beat. Drsk's
finger starts to slide off the trigger -

IN THE SQUARE

Apes stare up at their warrior lord, clamped in the Clew. He let out a
blood curdling scream. The bottom half of his torso - everything from the
waist down - falls towards the ground. Maybe it's just the wind, but the
legs still seem to be kicking.

The apes reel beck in horror. With mighty battle cry, the tribes-people -
the prisoners end Aregom'l followers - hurl themselves forward, attacking.

The apes break end start to run.

ON THE ROAD

Diamond end Eve have dismounted. Diamond stumbles forward - Will is coming
towards her. She holds out her arms and they embrace. Neither one says a
word, they just hold each other tight.

CLOUDS OF SMOKE

almost obscure the setting sun. Will and Diamond stand on the iron bridge
watching the tribes-people. They've harnessed horses to ropes tied around
the statues on the avenue of idols - one after another the stone monoliths
come crashing down.

DIAMOND

If nothing else, we helped the tribes take back their valley.

WILL

Our valley, too Billia.

She looks at him - questioning.

WILL (CONT'D)

There's one thing I never told you - I never worked out how to get back.

She smiles at him.

DIAMOND

A small point. But give me some credit. I'm a scientist - I knew that.

WILL

(in wonder)

But you came anyway.

DIAMOND

That was love.

WILL

For the baby?

She shakes her head.

DIAMOND

For the both of you.

They stare into each other's eyes. They kiss.

DIAMOND (CONT'D)
I only have one regret. We'll never know if we succeeded.

WILL
Of course we will. You're pregnant - if the baby's born alive, we'll know
it worked.

SUNLIGHT GLISTENS ON THE OCEAN

The surf rolls in on a golden beach. At the water's edge, a line of
footprints. We follow them to find Will on top of a rocky cliff. He's
building something out of iron and rock and sand but we can't make out what
it is.

DIAMOND (O.S.)
Will 

He turns and runs to the mouth of a large cave.

INSIDE THE CAVE

Diamond lies on her back on a pile of animal skins. Her belly is exposed,
heaw with the unborn child. Eve crouches next to her, trying to help.

WILL
It's started?

She nods her head then grimaces with pain as another contraction starts.

THE SUN IS SETTING ON THE SEA

From inside the cave, we hear Diamond scream.

IN THE CAVE

Will kneels between Diamond's legs. Her face, glistening with sweat; is a
mask of pain. She holdl Eve's hind tight and pushes.

Will, half hidden by her upraised legs, delivers the child. Diamond raises
herself up -trying to See her child. Neither she nor us can see it's face.

We push in on Will. Ha raises his hand and slaps the baby's rump. No sound.
Ha raises his hand again - suddenly the baby starts to cry. Now we see the
baby - a perfect little boy.

Eve laughs. Diamond smiles. Tears fill her eyes. She and Will look at one
another. He comes towards her and tenderly places the baby in her arms.

THE CAVE

Will and Eve help Diamond. She comes out of the cave, still holding the
baby. It's magic hour - they stand on a rock ledge, looking at the ocean
washed with color from the setting sun.

We see what Will was building. It's sort of like a sculpture - just the
head and crown of the Statue of Liberty.

Diamond smiles. She looks at him, wondering why -

WILL
It's to make sure we never forget where we came from.

The baby starts to cry. Will puts one arm each around Diamond and Eve.

We pull back from them - high up into the stars. The baby's cry carries
over. We see earth rise. In all this nothingness - life.

RETURN OF THE APES

                              by Terry Hayes

                                first draft

                                   1996

DEEP SPACE.

No atmosphere, no life, nothing. Just a web of lights- a billion stars hang
in a velvet void. The only sound is the howl of the cosmic wind.

The light of a distant sun strikes a rising planet. We see ragged
continents and oceans wreathed in cloud. This is earth rise. Our world
spins slowly in space, a thing of beauty, of awesome majesty. In all this
nothingness - life.

We push in on the planet - in to the Americas. The wind grows louder -

A PUEBLO VILLAGE.

A broken-down pick-up bumps into a God-forsaken villagea cluster of adobe
houses, blinding flurries of dust and sand. The pick-up stops in front of a
crumbling church. A man in his 60s gets out carrying a medical bag. This is
the DOCTOR. '

A WOMAN'S FACE.

Screaming. She's very young - a South American Indian - lying on a bed in a
corner of one of the houses. She is in the final throes of childbirth, a
sheet draped over her loins. The Doctor works between her legs, encouraging
her in Spanish.

The local PRIEST, not long out of the seminary, crouches at her side
counting off the beads of a rosary. He looks like he is about to pass out.

SUDDENLY THE WOMAN BITES DOWN HARD ON HER LIP. A THIN LINE OF BLOOD COURSES
DOWN HER CHIN. THE BREATH EXPLODES FROM HER LUNGS AS SHE PUSHES REALLY HARD
-

DOCTOR

Arriva!

He lifts the child from her loins, but it makes no sound. We don't see the
baby - just the shock on the Doctor's face. The mother struggles up to see
her child.

The Doctor grabs the sheet from her torso and covers the baby with it. He
thrusts the bundle into the Priest's hands.

DOCTOR (CONT'D)

(in Spanish)

Dead - the child is dead. Now go!

We hold on the mother's anguished face. Dissolve to

A HELICOPTER

Off the roof of a tall hospital building. As it rises up into the night we
see a red cross painted on its side. It's an air ambulance.

The chopper turns away. The Manhattan skyline, every skyscraper a blaze of
lights, opens up behind it. The chopper swoops over the Brooklyn bridge and
into the night.

GROVE OF TREES

Winter's coming on - every leaf is a different shade of amber and gold. The
helicopter drops down between the branches and lands on an immaculately
tended lawn. Surrounding it are the gracious buildings of a great
university. Harvard.

Two paramedics clamber out of the back of the helicopter and load a
stainless steel casket onto a gurney. They wheel it fast towards one of the
buildings. As they go' through the front doors, we hold on a sign etched
into the stone

DEPARTMENT OF BIOLOGY

A PAIR OF MECHANICAL HANDS

slide a long cylindrical "key" into the stainless steel casket. We pull
back to reveal the casket lies in a sealed, uncontaminated room. A group of
people in lab coats -scientists and researchers - stare through the glass
walls.

A young TECHNICIAN, working at a console, keyboards in a series of
commands.

Sswhish. The top of the steel casket swings open. Clouds of white gas
stream out -whatever's inside has been nitrogen cooled.

The gas clears. Lying inside is the body of a newborn child - except that
the baby has the skin, the face and the features of a man of eighty. The
scientists and the researchers react - shocked.

One of the mechanical hands glides towards the baby. In its fingers it
holds a long steel scalpel. This is the highest-tech autopsy you've ever
seen. The scalpel drives down, about to open the chest cavity -

BLOOD SPRAYS

But not from the baby's chest - it's in glass vials, exploding as white-hot
flames consume them. A plastic-gloved lab assistant, silhouetted against
the flames, is emptying hospital waste into a furnace. He slams the door
shut.

He turns we see his face. He's in his 4Os, handsome in a rough-hewn way - a
strong jaw and a muscular body. There's a cool intelligence in his eyes,
but a two-day beard and a worn-out uniform make him look like a man who,
between youth and middle-age, lost his way. And so he has. His name is WILL
ROBINSON.

He takes a steel trolley, wheels it through a set of swing doors and out of
sight.

CLOSED CIRCUIT TV SCREEN

features the image of one of the scientists we recognize from the autopsy.
She's in her 30s - attractive, long hair left loose on her shoulders, an
air of authority about her. Her name is BILLIE RAE DIAMOND. She is a
Professor of Biology.

We tilt down from the screen. It hangs from a wall in a deserted laboratory
-overhead lights, rows and rows of wire animal cages. Moving down death
row, feeding the lab animals, is Will Robinson.

TWO SAD-EYED CHIMPS, CLEANING EACH OTHER IN THEIR TINY CAGE, TURN AND STARE
AT HIM. SUDDENLY WILL STOPS - HE'S HEARD SOMETHING ON THE SCREEN THAT HAS
CAUGHT HIS ATTENTION. HE TURNS AND LOOKS -

DIAMOND

The exact cause of death is still unknown. What is certain - we're dealing
with something we've never seen before. Every organ in the body is
affected...

Superimposed over Diamond's face is a three dimensional, computer-generated
graphic of the baby's body.

Will forgets about what he's doing. He walks towards the screen. We push in
on it. Screeds of new data appear

Vascular System ...............Atrophied

Neurological Function .........Senile dementia

We hold on Will's eyes - he stares at it.

AN AUDITORIUM

Billy Rae Diamond stands on a podium continuing her briefing. About forty
scientists are sitting in front of her in a dimly-lit lecture hall.

Diamond is even more impressive in person - she is tall and gracious but
you don't become a Professor at Harvard' at her age without having an iron
will and a sparkling intelligence. She speaks with great authority -

DIAMOND (CONT'D)

The baby in question, Michael James Flanagan -she points at the
computer-generated graphic on a huge screen

was born at New York Hospital yesterday.

MAP OF THE WORLD ILLUMINATES AN ADJOINING SCREEN -

DIAMOND

But the Center for Disease Control in Atlanta has received similar reports
from a village in Bolivia, two cities in Australia, seven countries in
Europe, a cluster of cases in Namibia and Mexico. Forty-two cases in all.

As she speaks, pinpoints of light on the map identify the exact locations.
They dot their way across the entire globe. Dr Diamond turns to face her
audience-

DIAMOND (CONT'D)

Like Michael Flanagan, they were full-term babies. Two hundred and seventy
eight days since conception and yet, by all reasonable medical standards,
they have completed their entire life cycle. They have gone from conception
to death, not in three score years and ten, but in slightly less than nine
months. Michael Flanagan died of old age.

Silence as Diamond lets the scientists and researchers absorb it. On a
balcony high above, another man is taking notes. He sits alone, almost
hidden in shadow. It's Will Robinson.

SHEETS OF ICE ON A SHUTTER DOOR

Will crouches in front of a row of self-storage units on the edge of town.
It's night, the place is deserted. He slips a rusted key into a padlock.
Snapl The key breaks.

Will curses. He grabs a piece of timber and pulls a nail out of it. He
slides the nail into the padlock and manipulates the tumblers. The padlock
springs open.

SPIDERS

weave a web in a corner of the storage unit. A work light hangs from the
ceiling. Will is ripping open stacks of boxes from long ago. He puts
together a pile of yellowing files and old floppy disks.

PULLS OUT A CASSETTE TAPE AND STARES AT IT, UNSURE WHAT'S ON IT. HE TAKES A
CASSETTE PLAYER FROM OUT OF THE JUNK, SLIDES IT IN AND PRESSES "PLAY"A HUGE
ROUND OF APPLAUSE. AS IT DIES, WE HEAR A MAN'S VOICE. IT'S WILL, SPEAKING
FROM YEARS AGO -

WILL

(on tape)

I would like to thank the faculty and staff for this great honor...

We push in on Will's face as he listens to himself...

WILL (CONT'D)

have had the opportunity to work with three talented colleagues. I'm
privileged to also call them my friends -

A shadow of pain crosses his face. He shuts off the tape and sits
motionless.

LAFAYETTE PARK

Night. Homeless people in the park build cardboard shelters against a
coming storm. Across the road, the first drops of rain splatter against the
White House.

A string of Government cars pass through the huge gates and pull up in
front of the West Portico. From inside, we hear a man's voice -
well-spoken, authoritative

PRESIDENT (O.S.)

There's no mistake - you're sure?

JEFFERSON LIBRARY

Diamond sits in the President's study - book-lined walls, a fire in the
hearth. A group of men sit on the sofasthe Surgeon-General, the Chief of
Staff, the National Security Advisor, the Secretaw of Health. A table is
littered with graphs end files.

DIAMOND

We've got five thousand cases now, Mr President. That's in three weeks. The
number is doubling every hundred and sixty-eight hours.

The President stands near a window, half in shadow, the firelight playing
across his face. He's in his 50's but the strain of office makes him look
older.

DIAMOND (CONT'D)

That's a geometric progression, sir. In three months there'Il be over seven
million cases. After that we hit the wall -

She pushes a thick, bound volume across the table.

DIAMOND (CONT'D)

According to this, there won't be a live birth on the planet.

The President looks at her for a moment. Then he reaches down and picks up
the bound volume. It's hundreds of pages of numbers and projections.

PRESIDENT

These are just computer projections -

species don't disappear that fast.

DIAMOND

Tell that to the dinosaurs, sir.

He looks out the window at the winter storm sweeping down on them.

NATIONAL SECURITY ADVISOR

What date - when exactly do we hit this wall?

DIAMOND

Six months and twenty-one days.

Silence. The President keeps looking out the window.

PRESIDENT

Can't somebody tell me - what exactly are we dealing with. Is it a virus or
what?

DIAMOND

We don't know, sir.

The President turns to the Chief of Staff.

PRESIDENT

Whatever they need, Bob - anything. Harry Truman put together the Manhattan
Project - you understand?

The Chief of Staff nods his head - yes.

PRESIDENT (CONT'D)

(softly)

A world without children -it's inconceivable. And what about the rest of us
- what do we do? Just sit and watch our species die? Will the last person
to leave the planet turn out the lights.

Silence again. Finally a young woman - the White House Press Secretary -
speaks.

PRESS SECRETARY

We're going to have to manage the public. Right now, the truth may be
inoperative -

PRESIDENT

Of course we're going to have to manage itl We're going to have to manage a
whole lot of things. But can't we take at least one moment to be human?

He looks around the room. We hold on their somber faces.

A CHEAP APARTMENT

Through the window - the neon sign of a gas station. This is Will's place,
He lives alone - a bed in the corner, run-down furniture, dishes in the
sink.

The kitchen table has been turned into a desk - Will sits at an old
computer, surrounded by the yellowing stacks of files and floppy disks. He
stares at the screen - the notes and equations are blurred. He's been at
this so long, he can barely focus. He rubs his hand across his eyes.

A small mewing sound. Will turns to an alcove in the corner - a cat lies in
a basket, panting. Will goes to her.

She's giving birth - the first of her new-born kittens lies next to her.
Will strokes the mother's head, looking at the miracle of new life. He puts
his fingers in a water bowl, about to moisten the mother's mouth.

Then he stops. He looks again at the kitten - there's two of them now. A
beat as he just stares -

WILL

(softly)

Jesus Christ... of course!

A LUXURIOUS BATHROOM

Through frosted glass we see the silhouette of a woman taking a shower.
Whoever she is, she's got a great figure. The sound of a doorbell. The
shower door opens -Diamond sticks her head out. She looks at a clock - it's
almost midnight.

VIDEO ENTRY PHONE

A video screen monitors the front door. On it we see Will - his hair
tousled, an old overcoat buttoned to the neck, a battered briefcase under
his arm.

Diamond - a towel around her shoulders, hair dripping - picks up the phone.

DIAMOND

Who is it?

WILL (O.S.)

Will Robinson.

DIAMOND

I think you have the wrong house.

WILL (O.S.)

I work at the department.

He turns and looks straight into the camera. Instinctively, Diamond covers
her breasts. She looks at him - recognition dawns.

AN ELEGANT ROOM

Will and Diamond sit in the living room of a gracious townhouse - wooden
floors and beautiful rugs. Diamond doesn't wear any make-up -just jeans and
an oversized shirt. She looks even more beautiful. It does nothing to ease
Will's nerves. He's got his briefcase open in front of him, speaking from
sheaves of notes and papers.

DIAMOND

(interrupting)

Hold on - how do you know about the case load? The Government's trying to
manage this - they've withheld that information.

WILL

The Internet, Doctor. It's a highway - you can ride it anywhere you want. I
got into 'the Center for Disease Control. I had a look at their raw data.

DIAMOND

Jesus. Do you know what you're doing? This is the White House we're talking
about.

WILL

(Heated))

No, it's a disease and it doesn't come any worse than this - that's what
we're talking about.

HE LOOKS AWAY, CALMING HIMSELF. HE SHUFFLES HIS NOTES. HE SPEAKS AGAIN,
QUIETLY -

WILL

I've listened at the lab - I think I know where you're looking. Bacterias
mostly, but there's a strong push into the retro-viruses. You're wrong,
Doctor.

DIAMOND

Really - and I thought I was arrogant. But then, I'm just a professor.

WILL

No virus or bacteria has ever discriminated on the grounds of sex.

DIAMOND

I can think of one.

WILL

Sure, it can start in pockets but it never stays there. This thing does. It
only affects women of child-bearing age. What - it's so smart it can
recognize motherhood? I don't think so. No, this is into the very heart of
what we are. This is genetic. This is part of the DNA.

DIAMOND

Thank you. A hundred thousand genes make up human DNA - that really narrows
it down.

WILL

As a matter of fact it does. There's only one part of the DNA that's passed
exclusively through women. Thirty-seven genes, the oldest part of the human
organism -

DIAMOND

(realizing)

The mitochondrial DNA.

WILL

Over the years there's been speculation -not all of it crazy either - that
somehow it triggers aging, He slides a sheaf of yellowing extracts from
scientific journals across the table. She doesn't pay them any attention -
she's thinking.

DIAMOND

You realize what you're saying, don't you? A bacteria - I think we'd get it
for sure. A virus -you'd have to say we've got a chance. But say you're
right. The mitochondrial DNA - that's so far out on the frontier, we can
barely see it.

WILL

Like I said - it doesn't get any worse than this.

She keeps staring down at the documents and notes lying on the table. A
beat.

WILL (CONT'D)

Are you okay?

DIAMOND

Sure.

WILL LOOKS AT HER FOR A MOMENT -

WILL

Shit. You're pregnant, aren't you?

DIAMOND

Nine weeks.

THEIR EYES MEET - SHE SHRUGS, TRYING TO PUT A BRAVE FACE ON IT. SHE GETS TO
HER FEET -

DIAMOND

Do you want a drink - coffee, a sandwich or something?

WILL

(Recoiling)

No...no, I'm fine thanks.

Watches as he picks up his papers and puts them back in his battered
briefcase.

AN EMPTY STREET

It's late at night. Will clutches his briefcase under his arm, heading
home. A bitter wind blows out of the north. He looks a lonely and forlorn
figure as he makes his way through the pools of light cast by the
streetlights.

CONVOY OF N.A.S.A. TRUCKS

RUMBLE THROUGH THE EARLY MORNING - THE CITY IS JUST WAKING. THE TRUCKS,
DOZENS OF WHITE EIGHTEEN-WHEELERS, TURN THROUGH THE FRONT GATES OF HARVARD.
THEY STOP IN FRONT OF THE GROVE OF TREES. WE CRANE UP FROM THEM TO A WINDOW
IN THE BIOLOGY BUILDING -

HAND HITS A TABLE

IT'S DIAMOND - SHE'S ANGRY. BREAKFAST TRAYS CLUTTER THE TABLE -SHE'S IN THE
MIDDLE OF A CONFERENCE WITH A GROUP OF SCIENTISTS. SHE GLARES AT AN
ARROGANT YOUNG NEUROLOGIST -

DIAMOND

It's just an idea, Bob. All we're doing is taking it for a walk around the
block.

A man in his 60s - distinguished, diplomatic - intercedes.

DE MAUPASSANT

There was a lot of work done on it in the 7Os. I can't recall the details
but someone had the idea that mitochondriel DNA was like a genetic memory.
If you could unlock it, you could physically travel back down it. Through
evolution - like a time machine.

BOB

Wowl Those 70s, man. I'm really sorry I missed them.

Everyone - Diamond included - laughs.

OLD PHOTOS OF A SAILING BOAT

They hang on the wall of a tiny room - not an office, just a
hole-in-the-wall Will has turned into his own. He sits at a table, making
notes. A knock - Diamond enters.

DIAMOND

I thought you'd like to know - we're looking at mitochondrial DNA,

WILL

Thanks for telling me.

THEY LOOK AT ONE ANOTHER. IT'S AN AWKWARD MOMENT - NEITHER ONE QUITE SURE
WHETHER OR HOW TO CONTINUE THE CONVERSATION. DIAMOND SEES THE PHOTOS -

DIAMOND

Is that you?

She points at a man in his 20s standing on the deck in one of the photos,
Will nods.

DIAMOND (CONT'D)

Seattle. Is that where you went to school?

Will hesitates - we sense that he doesn't really want to answer.

WILL

No. Princeton.

DIAMOND

Expensive.

WILL

A scholarship. Then I did some post-graduate work... I never really
finished.

Something in the way Will says it - some sense of loss - makes Diamond
pause. She recovers and looks in her wallet. She pulls out a photograph and
hands it to Will. It shows a small sailing boatgaff-rigged and a varnished
hull.

WILL (CONT'D)

It's a Kestrel 24 - I haven't seen one of those in years. She's a beautiful
boati

DIAMOND

My grandfather left it to me. I don't sail it much any more - it's too hard
to find a for'etd hand.

WILL

What about your husband - doesn't he sail.

DIAMOND

I don't know - I haven't met him yet.

WILL LOOKS AT HER. HIS EXPRESSION SAYS IT - WHAT? SHE SHRUGS -

DIAMOND

I wanted a baby but I'm thirty-four-years old. Sooner or later you realize
that somewhere along the way you've missed the man you've been waiting for.

WILL

What did you do - ask a friend?

DIAMOND

I thought of it.

WILL

Lucky friend.

DIAMOND

I went to a clinic. Not exactly romantic, but it worked.

(pauses)

Good idea, bad timing.

WILL

How many people have you put on the mDNA?

DIAMOND

Seven.

WILL

That's all?!

DIAMOND

That's all I can spare. It's just a theory -one of dozens of theories.

Will looks away in disgust.

DIAMOND (CONT'D)

What is it with you - it's not just science is it? Why are you so
passionate about this?

WILL

I know I'm right. It's a mutation. A hundred thousand years it's probably
been lying there -shifting, weaving into the mDNA. You either go back and
change evolution or you engineer it out. Seven peopleYou might as well
shoot peas at a dam.

DIAMOND

You haven't answered my question - why so passionate?

WILL

The question's not relevant. The only thing I'm interested in is the
science.

He turns back to his work. We hear the door close as Diamond leaves.

A GEODESIC DOME

White, space-age, is being erected on the lawn. Workmen are unloading the
NASA trucks. We pull back through a high window of the Biology building. A
woman stands there, looking out. Her name is KRIS McQUADE. This is her
office -

MCQUADE

You want to tell me what's going on?

She turns and looks at Diamond, sitting on the other side of the desk,

DIAMOND

Don't ask, Kris, I'd have to lie and I don't want to do that to my best
friend,

MCQUADE

The rumor is, you've done something really big. They say the Defense
Department is taking it over.

Diamond just sits there, staring straight ahead. McQuade waits. Finally -

MCQUADE (CONT'D)

Okay, okay - I'm sorry I asked. So what about this guy - what's he done?

DIAMOND

He hasn't done anything - I'm just interested.

MCQUADE

Ten thousand employment records I've got on file and you want to know about
a lab assisant?

DIAMOND

The smartest assistant I've ever known.

MCQUADE

What - he can mop and fart at the same time?

She picks up pages from a computer printer - including a copy of Will's
photo I.D.

MCQUADE (CONT'D)

He's handsome, at least I'll say -

(a thought strikes her)

Jesus - you're not interested in him like that, are you?

DIAMOND

No, but he's the most unbelievable smelling man.

MCQUADE

Smelling? You're pregnant - obviously your hormones have gone crazy. What
exactly does he smell like?

DIAMOND

You know...

(searching for the right word)

.., wholesome.

MCQUADE

Of course he does - that's the Lysol.

Diamond laughs but McQuade barely notices it. She's leafing through WiU's
file -

MCQUADE (CONT'D)

That's strange - there's supposed to be a background sheet. Family, school
-all that shit. It must have gotten lost.

Before Diamond can say anything, a young man enters. He's McQuada's
assistant.

ASSISTANT

Your secretary's on the line, Dr Diamond. There's a call for you.

DIAMOND

Tell her to take a message.

ASSISTANT

It's the New York Times.

MCQUADE

What do they want?

DIAMOND

I think Washington's news management just went south.

THE WHITE HOUSE

Night. Scores of television news vans are parked outsideDutch, Japanese and
French reporters are doing stand-ups live-to-air. We hear Peter Jennings of
ABC.

JENNINGS (O.S.)

We're standing by to go live to Washington as events continue to unfold on
this remarkable day. I don't think there's a person anywhere who's not
sitting by a radio or television now. I'm told the President is on his way
to the press room -

FIFTH AVENUE

is totally empty - just a young man on rollerblades. He skates effortlessly
down the deserted avenue - past Tiffany's and the Trump Tower, all silent
now.

PRESIDENT (O.S.)

My fellow Americans...

The rollerblader passes the cathedral of St John. The front doors are open.
Someone is playing the organ - Mozart's Requiem. The rollerblader fades
into the night.

STEEL DOOR OPENS

A sharp-faced caretaker - scruffy clothes and a limp - escorts Will into a
vaulted basement. All we can see are silhouettestowers of crates, racks of
equipment...

CARETAKER

This used to be the basement of the Psychology Department. We just sort of
stacked everything around 'em -

He flicks a switch - the storage room floods with light. He points at two
long iron cylinders - like small submarines - rigged up to a series of
valves and pipes.

CARETAKER (CONT'D)

Flotation tanks. They used 'em for experiments in sensory degradation -

WILL

Deprivation - sensory deprivation.

CARETAKER

Yeah, well - whatever.

SHAFT OF LIGHT

WILL OPENS AN IRON HATCH THAT GIVES ACCESS INTO ONE OF THE TANKS. HE DROPS
INTO IT AND WALKS FORWARD, EXAMINING IT. THE DARKNESS CLOSES AROUND HIM. HE
STARES AHEAD. VOICES DRIFT OUT OF MEMORY -

YOUNG MAN (O.S.)

Now I know what a mole feels like -

YOUNG WOMAN (O.S.)

(lightly)

It feels like a fucking coffin, that's what it feels like.

Other voices laugh. They're all young and like the young they think they'll
never die.

CARETAKER (O.S.)

Hey, fella - what are you doing?

HE'S PEERING DOWN THROUGH THE HATCH. WILL DRAGS HIMSELF OUT OF THE PAST. HE
TURNS -

WILL

Just looking. I'll be coming back - I'll need a key.

The caretaker shrugs - sure. Will climbs out of the tank.

WILL (CONT'D)

One other thing - don't tell anyone, huh?

CARETAKER

Who would I tell? They treat me like shit Worse than shit. All work, no
appreciation. The phantom of Harvard. Someone should write a fucking
musical about me.

CIRCLES OF LIGHT

Desk lamps, glowing in an office. Diamond and a team of researchers are
working through piles of old journals and extracts from scientific papers.

RESEARCHER

Here's another one - "Mitochondrial DNAA Map to the Past."

DIAMOND

Who's it by?

RESEARCHER

Same guy - Doctor Robert Plant.

DIAMOND

Jesus, what did this guy do - write the book on it? Who is he?

HUGE BOOK BEING OPENED

It's a scientific directory. The researcher flicks the pages and stops at
"Plant".

RESEARCHER

Wow - I thought your career was impressive.

Diamond looks up from her reading.

RESEARCHER (CONT'D)

Degrees in medicine and microbiology. A PhD at 24, a member of the Academy
of Sciences, published twenty times by 1974...

DIAMOND

And then?

RESEARCHER

Then nothing.

DIAMOND REACTS. SHE GETS TO HER FEET, COMING CLOSER -

DIAMOND

Where did he go as an undergraduate?

RESEARCHER

Princeton.

DIAMOND

On a scholarship?

A CORRIDOR

It's late at night. The scientists and their staff are working around the
clock. Will wheels a trolley laden with bottles, vials, and catheters down
a crowded corridor. Diamond pushes through the people behind, trying to
catch up to him. Scientists turn to speak to her but she ignores them.

DIAMOND (CONT'D)

Robert!

Will keeps walking, heading for an elevator. Diamond skirts around a knot
of people.

DIAMOND (CONT'D)

Doctor Plant!

Will hesitates - one split second - then keeps going. The elevator doors
slide open. Will steps in, turns and hits a button. He watches Diamond
pushing towards him. For a moment their eyes meet. She comes closer.
Sswhish! The doors slide shut.

DIAMOND'S OFFICE

She sits behind her desk, listening to the chief of campus security.

SECURITY OFFICER

The equipment you saw him with was taken from three labs. It includes a
range of genetic material-

(hands her an inventory)

We've checked all the buildings your team is using - he's not in any of
them.

DIAMOND

What about hie house?

SECURITY OFFICER

He asked his landlady to look after his cat. She hasn't seen him for three
days.

IN THE BASEMENT

there's a make-shift bed and a hot-plate with a battered saucepan. Next to
it is a rack of medical equipment and laboratory vials.

Will is sit'ting in front of three computers running in parallel - data and
equations reel across them. The caretaker comes out of the shadows,
carrying two mugs of thick coffee. He puts one down next to Will -

CARETAKER

You wanna tell me what exactly you're doing?

WILL

Looking for a date.

The caretaker stares at the confusion of diagrams and equations on the
screen -

CARETAKER

What's wrong with a calendar?

WILL

These are chemical sequences - they represent human genes. By following a
trail of mutations, I can date them. I'm trying to find out when a major
change occurred in something called the mitochondrial DNA.

CARETAKER

The mitochondrial DNA? Yeah... well that makes sense.

But Will barely hears it. Suddenly he's leaning forward, keyboarding in
complex commands. The caretaker watches him -

CARETAKER (CONT'D)

You've found it?

WILL

Maybe...

He has illustrations of two long-chain molecules on the screen. He moves
them together. Aa they overlap, we see they're not identical - the tail of
one kicks upwarda. Will starel at it -

WILL (CONT'D)

(softly)

Yeah - I've found it.

CARETAKER

So - what's the date?

Will presses a key. Faster than the eye can follow, the first long-chain
molecule starts to shift and mutate. Finally it resolves itself into the
second molecule. Will looks at a graph on the side of the screen -

WILL

The best computer science can do? One hundred and two thousand years ago.

CARETAKER

Sort of what I figured - give or take a day or two.

DIAMOND'S OFFICE

Diamond is poring through scientific articles written by Will. She flicks a
page -there's a photo of Will, 20 years younger, surrounded by three
colleagues. He's got his arm around one of them - an attractive young
woman.

Diamond lifts the photo, looking at it more closely. She starts to read the
caption. We push in on it and hold on the words... "UC Berkeley".

WE ARE FLYING

swooping and soaring - through a weird landscape of towering cliffs,
tumbling streams and primordial forest. There's something unreal about it -
we pull back to reveal they're computer-generated images, playing on the
screens in the basement.

The caretaker has pulled up a chair. He and Will are watching the images
generated by a CD-ROM.

WILL

This is someone's version of the prehistoric world. I'm interested in the
geography, the atmosphere -that sort of stuff.

CARETAKER

Where are we?

WILL

Africa - that's where Mankind started.

Will keeps looking at the strange images. The caretaker gets to his feet -

CARETAKER

I'll see you in the morning.

WILL

Yeah.

The caretaker limps towards the door. Will looks up -

WILL (CONT'D)

Thank you - for helping me, I mean.

CARETAKER

It sounds like you're leaving or something.

WILL

No. I just wanted to say it, that's all.

The caretaker keeps looking at him -

CARETAKER

What exactly are you doing? You're a bit old to try and make your mark,
aren't you? Anyway, nobody listens to people like us.

WILL

Fate can be kind - sometimes a man gets a second chance. Do you know what
it's like to be ridiculed, to have your ideas thrown back in your face? And
that was the easy part. I guess that's what I'm doing - I want to prove
that I was right.

CARETAKER

You're lying to me.

WILL

What do you mean?!

CARETAKER

You are going somewhere. I don't know where it is. I'm not even sure I can
imagine it. Good luck, though. I hope you find whatever it is you're
looking for.

WILL

Thanks.

CARETAKER

No point in getting you breakfast, huh?

Will shakes his head - no. They smile at each other. The caretaker turns
and goes.

DIAMOND'S OFFICE

Diamond looks up from the papers and articles littering her desk. Her
Secretary stands in the doorway -

SECRETARY

I've got Eleanor Wilkins on the phone. She runs the archives at Berkeley.

DIAMOND

(into phone)

Ms Wilkins?

We push in tight on Diamond's face as she listens. Anxiety and alarm
register on it.

OUTER OFFICE

The security officer and several of his men are looking at maps of the
campus. Researchers and scientists have gathered in the office, rumors are
flying. Everyone turns - Diamond stands in the doorway to her office. She
looks at deMaupassant.

DIAMOND (CONT'D)

You were right, Luc. That work you remembered from Berkeley - he was the
one that did it. He said man was the last step on an evolutionary trail.
Within every one of us is the history of our race. It's imprinted on our
genes - like a map. Anyone that can find the chemical key can travel back
down it. Through the womb. Through time and space -

(she looks at them all)

That's what he's doing. He's going back. He's going to try and change
evolution.

SECURITY OFFICER

Is that possible?

DIAMOND

He was the best of his generation. He thinks so. He's got the genetic
material for the key. All he needs are flotation tanks.

THE FLOTATION TANKS

The valves are open - warm water is pouring into the tanks.

Will sits next to the rack of medical equipment, beads of sweat on his
forehead. He slides a syringe into his forearm and inserts a catheter. He
opens a series of tiny valves on the glass vials. A cocktail of fluid -
minutely measured doses - flows down the clear plastic towards his arm. The
fluid hits his blood stream and drains into it.

A LONG CORRIDOR

Diamond and the others run fast through pools of light cast by naked bulbs.
Ahead -a pair of swing doors -

BOB

A theory's one thing - do you really think he'll try it?

DIAMOND

He's spent fifteen years as a lab assistant. He lives in a two room walk-up
with a cat. No family, no friends. What's There's left for him here? Of
course he'll do it.

Smack! They push through the doors, into another corridor.

AN IRON LADDER

Will climbs up the side of the flotation tank. Suddenly he stops - a
tremor, a rippling wave, passes from his feet to his head. It's his muscles
contracting. It wracks him with pain. He gasps at the intensity of it.

Smash! The steel door into the basement shudders as someone tries to get
in. Will looks up - the door twists and moves. His vision is starting to
distort. He grabs the access hatch and swings through -

Splashl He drops into the water. Clang! He closes the hatch.

Barn? The steel door flies open. The security officer lowers a sledge
hammer. Diamond steps in end throws a light switch.

DARKNESS IN THE TANK

Will floats on his back, the only sound is the rapid thump of his
heartbeat. The water sloshes back and forth - his muscles are going into
spasms. We push along his body - up to his face. His eyes roll back into
his headl

All we see are the whites of them. They shatter into a web of capillaries -

WILL'S POV

red mist swirls in front of him. It resolves itself into a web of
interwoven tendrils -the double helix of the DNA molecule. Will starts to
travel through it -

INSIDE THE TANK

Will is morphing, shedding cells - we're losing him in the warm, dark fluid
of the tank. It's like the womb. His body seems to be disintegrating,
dissolving into it. Water flows through the sockets where his eyes once
were.

His hollow mouth opens. From far away we hear him scream - a primal scream.

OUTSIDE THE TANK

Not a sound escapes. The security officer is about to try and open the
hatch.

DIAMOND (O.S.)

NO!

The security officer turns - Diamond is holding the catheter in her hand.

DIAMOND (CONT'D)

If we open the hatch, I think we'll kill him. It's too late - it's his
journey, he's going to have to take it.

INSIDE THE TANK

Will's body is like a shadow, almost one with the water, growing less
distinct by the moment. What is left of his face - a strange, shifting
shape - floats towards us. Closer... closer. It melts completely into the
water -

WILL'S POV

He spirals down a tunnel - into a whirlpool of white light. As he hits, it
shatters into a million fragments of light. It looks like a comet, wheeling
through the heavens. A cosmic wind blows it forward. Will is traveling
through space and time -

OUTSIDE THE TANK

Diamond and the others are gathered around the computers. Bob is working
the keyboard. Diamond is looking.through the piles of papers, notes and
star charts.

DIAMOND

Everything's here - he kept a record of every step. He can even tell the
date -forty hours after he arrives there's a solar eclipse.

BOB

Billie - there's a note for you.

Diamond looks over his shoulder at the computer screen. She reads what is
writ'ten -

DIAMOND

"I won't be here, but if I solve this thing make sure you tell them,
Billie. Tell them it was Robert Plant, Doctor Robert Plant of UC Berkeley."

THE FRAGMENTS OF LIGHT

blaze through the heavens. They draw together, changing and reconstituting
into a shape we recognize - the interwoven strands of DNA molecules. The
strands connect. A blast of light! It's the rays of -

THE SUN

streaming into a cave. Will lies in the fetal position, bleeding from his
nose and ears. The light grows stronger - it's dawn. Will drags himself up
and stumbles towards the entrance. We tilt up from him. He doesn't see it,
but we do - prehistoric cave paintings are etched into the rock.

A CRAGGY PEAK

Will steps out of the cave. Sunrise sweeps over a world born brand new -
plains and jungle and primordial forest. Rising above it is a snow-capped
mountain that looks like Kilamlnjlro. A ragged gash runs across the earth -
a rift valley. Will stares at it. He raises his face to the sun. He did it.
The first step's over - and he did itl He looks down - rising out of the
valley is a tiny pillar of smoke.

A FOREST CLEARING

In the middle are the smoldering remains of a camp-fire. Will moves
cautiously towards it. He stops - several bodies, terribly mangled, lie on
the ground.

Will turns one of them over - he's got matted hair, a heavy brow and a
short, muscular body. As primitive as he is, there's no doubt of his
species. He is a man. A Paleolithic man.

This was a hunting party -scattered weapons and the trussed carcasses of
dead animals lie nearby. For a moment Will thinks the hunters must have
been torn apart by wild animals. Then he looks up into the trees - more
bodies of the hunters. But no animal did this - they hang from iron chains,
left there as some sort of trophy. Or a warning.

CRUSHED LEAVES AND BROKEN PLANTS

Will is following a tiny trail through the forest. He's taken what is
useful from the bodies of the hunters - an otter-skin water bag, two
short-handled spears and a bed-roll made from an animal pelt. He moves on -
deeper into the shadows of the forest.

A SPARKLING STREAM

Will splashes through the crystal water. He looks upstream - a small lake.
A flock of strange birds - like huge flamingos take flight in a blaze of
pink and gold.

He steps out of the stream and along a path beneath a canopy of
over-arching trees. We hold on his feet - whip! He triggers something. A
net of woven vines engulfs him. He drops the spears and bedroll. Suddenly
he's soaring through the air.

He jerks to a halt - he's a netted animal hanging high in the trees. The
faces of two Paleolithic men, crouched on boughs, stare at him.

PLUME OF WATER

cascades a hundred feet into a hidden gorge. Smoke curls up from fires.
Scores of stone-age people - man, women and children - turn and look. Will,
roped and bound, is being hauled into the encampment.

The primitive people - nervous but intrigued - circle around him. They are
dressed in skins and fur. talismans hang from their necks. The warriors
carry not only weapons but ritual scars across their foreheads. It makes
them look even more savage.

Will is led past the haunches of soma massive animal cooking in a pit. A
pile of ivory tusks lie nearby. The two captors jerk on the leash - it
stops Will in front of a cave. Hanging from the roof is the giant pelt and
head of their totema saber-toothed tiger. This is the Tribe of the Tiger.

A man emerges from under its outstretched paws. He's in his late 20's -
proud and strong. His name is Kip-Kena - he is their leader. He and Will
look at one another.

Kip uses his hands to sign to Will in the formal language of his race. Will
stares at him - he has no idea what it means. He shrugs. Kip tries a new
tack - he speaks. The sounds are rough and guttural - but understandable,
KiP Where is your tribe?

Will pauses, searching for an answer- where do you start? He gives up.

WILL

I don't have a tribe.

A rolling murmur of disbelief from the surrounding tribe.

KIP

No man can live without a tribe! How would he hunt the mighty animals? Who
would keep his fire burning?

WILL

I come from far away... I'm a traveler.

KIP

What is traveler? Is that a tribe?

Again Will's at a loss. Something catches Kip's eye. He reaches forward and
rips the water bag out from under Will's coat. The tribe reacts -

KIP (CONT'D)

You carry things taken from our hunters! Kill him.

He turns away. Will throws himself at him -

WILL

NO!

Whackl A blow to the back of Will's neck knocks him to his knees. He looks
up -two warriors have their spears raised, about to plunge them into his
chest.

A sound like thunder - it's hooves. The warriors turn. Will follows their
gaze - half an army, mounted on horseback, surges into the gorge, They are
heavily armed, dressed in armor but it's not their weaponry that astonishes
Will. These are apes!

The tribes-people scream in terror. They turn and run. The two warriors
forget about Will. He dives for cover in a pile of rocks. As he tears
himself free of the ropes that bind him, he looks out -

The apes charge in to the camp. At their head is a huge gorillarippling
muscles and intelligent eyes - deep set and yellow, like pissholes in the
snow. He wears a suit of black armor ribbed in silver. His name is Drak. He
is the Lord of the High Rivers, supreme commander of the ape army. On
either side ride his elite Praetorian Guard.

Woo-woo-woo! Kip swings a hollow piece of wood above his head. It's a
bull-roarer. The warriors of the tribe know its meaning - they rally to
Kip's side. Armed only with spears and primitive bows they stand between
the apes and their panic-driven people, trying to buy them time to get into
the cave.

Sswhish! The sound of arrows. The apes carry triple-barreled iron
crossbows.

Short iron bolts cut several of the tribesmen down. Dust and smoke swirls
across the camp. Kip and his men, fighting all the way, retreat towards the
cave.

A baby's cry! Will turns - a toddler sits at a hearth, left behind in the
confusion. Will half rises to his feet, about to go for him. Too late -
there's a blur of movement irt the trees. A tribe-boy - too young to be a
warrior - has come back for the child.

Out of the dust and smoke - Drak! Foam flies from his horse's mouth. He's
seen the boy and the child. He locks what looks like a Gatling gun tight
under his huge bicep.

Will screams a warning. The boy turns - he sees Drak as he fires. A hail of
iron darts - twenty or more - cut him and the child down.

Rage flashes in Will's eyes. He scrambles over a boulder and rips a
crossbow from a dead ape's hand. He slides bolts into the barrels and grabs
a lever with both hands -you need the strength of an ape to cock it. A
sound behind him - little more than a whisper. He swings -It's an arrow.
Whackl It rips into his shoulder, hurling him to the ground. Ape infantry -
foot soldiers - are coming into the gorge behind him.

In their midst are three huge steam-driven machines - like iron erector
sets. One is the Claw, one is the Balls and the other is the Flame.

THE CAVE ENTRANCE

Kip and his warriors have seen them too. They scramble into the cave. Men
and women are inside, swinging closed two huge stockade doors made from
tree trunks.

Other warriors, caught outside, run for the closing gap. On their heels is
Will - still clutching the crossbow, blood streaming from his wound. The
doors are closing... closing. Will dives through the gap, almost crushed -

INSIDE THE CAVE

Slam! The doors fly shut. Wham! A huge cross-beam drops into place. Will,
sprawled in the dust, looks up - chaos. By torchlight, the medicine man is
tending the wounded, children are screaming, women and old people are
clambering up a series of ledges. High above is a tiny slash of
daylightanother entrance.

From deep in the cave Will hears the roar of some animal but he doesn't
have time to think about it. Smash! The great wooden doors shudder from
some mighty blow.

OUTSIDE THE DOORS

The three machines are in place. The first of them has two huge stone balls
suspended by chains from an overhead jib. An ape sits right on top,
operating it. The balls dance and swing wildly - smash! They hit the door,
opening a hole.

INSIDE THE CAVE

Daylight streams in. Kip and his warriors have ranged themselves high
around the walls, ready to attack when the apes pour in. A pair of huge
iron jaws appear in the hole. This is the second of the apes' machines -
the Claw.

Another roar from the animal. Will watches the Claw reach in and grab the
massive crossbeam. It snaps it like a twig. Will gets to his feet and runs.
He sees Kip signal -

AN OLD WARRIOR

is perched high on a series of wooden bars that seal off a corner of the
cave, turning it into a cage. He opens it.

Crash! The stockade doors at the front of the cave burst open. The first of
the ape cavalry charges in. A roar from the unseen animal. The apes' horses
catch the scent of it. They whinny in terror.

Will stares as a blur of striped fur and muscle flies out of the cage. The
tribe's totem is a living thing - the saber-toothed tiger ia three times
the size of its Bengal cousin, a head the size of an ox and two ten-inch
teeth curved down either side of its jaw.

The horses are bucking and rearing. The tiger leaps towards the door,
heading for freedom. A dismounted ape raises his weapon. The tiger doesn't
even break stride. One lazy swipe from his paw tears open the armor and
flesh of the ape's chest.

Will can smell the animal's breath as it flies past. An ape officer, still
on his horse, turns - another swipe from the.tiger's paw rips out his
throat.

Kip and his warriors hurl their spears and stone tomahawks at the cavalry -
half of them dismounted, all of them in disarray. The tiger runs soars
through the doorway -

OUTSIDE THE CAVE

Drak fights to control his mount as the tiger lands once and bounds into
the forest.

ON THE LEDGES

Kip's men are fighting as they retreat, heading towards the opening at the
roof of the cave. Will, clutching his wounded shoulder, makes his own way
up the wall.

Beneath him, Drak and the apes roll in the third of the machines - a long
iron tube in a rolling superstructure. Feeding it are a series of
oil-filled bladders. One of the apes touches a torch to a firing hole. A
tongue of fire erupts from the end of the tube. It's a flame thrower -The
fiery tongue shoots up towards the roof of the cave. The flame engulfs two
warriors. Skin blazing, they plummet to the ground.

The flame thrower fires again - scorching the rock wall, filling the cave
wit a pall of smoke. It hits the tiny patch of daylight, cutting off
escape.

Will - trapped - runs along a ledge, over a pile of rocks and jumps. Into
mid-air! He lands on the back of a riderless horse and drives his heels
into its flanks.

The apes and the surviving warriors turn. For a moment they just stare -
nobody's ever seen a human ride a horse before. Will flies towards the
entrance. He sees Kip on a ledge just above, battling three huge apes.

WILL

Jump!

Kip sees Will galloping towards him. One of the apes raises a double-bladed
sword. Kip jumps sprawling across the horse's neck, grabbing on to its
flowing mane.

Drak stares at Will - he's never seen anything like him. He wheels his
horse around and spurs it forward in pursuit.

OUTSIDE THE CAVE

Will's horse bursts out of the cave - past the Claw and under the Balls.
The apes turn and look - astonished. They scramble for their horses. Drak
charges through.

Will hurtles towards the trees. Kip, hanging on for life, looks behind -
Drak raises his Gatling gun and aims. Kip wrenches Will's head down - zing!
The arrows skim past.

Drak can't outpace them - and he can't re-load at the gallop either. They
charge out of the camp, into -

THE DAPPLED LIGHT OF THE FOREST

Drak rises up in the stirrups and hauls himself on to the saddlethe huge
ape stands on the back of the charging horse!

He jumps - his rippling arms catch hold of an overhanging bough. He swings
himself up into the tree - he is an ape, after all. He throws himself from
branch to bough, traveling at incredible speed.

Will glances back - he sees Drak's riderless horse. His eyes dart in
confusion -where is he? We crane up - he's in the trees above! Drak jumps -

Wham! Hundreds of pounds of gorilla blast into Will's shoulder, lifting him
out of the saddle and hurling him to the ground.

Kip hauls down on the horse's bridle - wheeling the stallion around.

Will looks up from the dust - Drak towers above him. Will sees Kip coming
back -

WILL (CONT'D)

Run!

A volley of arrows whiz past Kip - other apes are galloping through the
trees. Kip grabs the bridle and kicks - the horse spins and gallops away.

massive, armor-clad paw grabs Will's head. He looks straight into Drak's
face. The ape reaches out and rips a claw down Will's cheek. Will tries to
stifle the scream. Drak touches the wound and tastes the blood -

DRAK

So - it's human, after ell.

He spits the blood out in revulsion. Will stares into the piu-holes in his
face. Never has he seen eyes so cold.

Will tries to rise to hie feet. His wounded shoulder has weakened him - he
staggers. Drak's clenched fist, clad in chain mail, drives straight et
Will's jaw. Smashl Fade to black.

THE WORLD UPSIDE DOWN

It's Will's point of view - he-s lying on his back in a horse-drawn cart.
He's very weak, his shirt drenched in blood. He rolls over and the image
rights itself.

He drags himself on to all fours but he can't get any further - his legs
are chained.

WILL

(fevered, disoriented)

Where the fuck am I?

Will looks up - a huge ape sits guard in the back of the wagon.

GUARD

(smiling)

The end of the road.

Will - confused, panicky - grabs the side of the cart and hauls himself to
his knees. He looks past an escort of ape cavalry - they are traveling down
an avenue of idols -towering statues of apes, sculpted out of stone, old as
ages past. Fires burn somewhere within them giving the eyes a red,
flickering glow.

Will turns away. Behind him he sees humans, rows of them - dead - hanging
upsidl down from long poles like trophies.

Everything comes flooding back - he slumps against the side of the cart,
eyes barely focused. Blood trickles down under his shirt and forms a pool
between his legs. He doesn't even notice it.

MASSIVE IRON AND WOOD BRIDGE

spans a roaring river. Drak and his convoy clatter across it. We crane up -
laid out before is a city. Terraces are cut into both sides of a jagged
ravine. Opening on to them are caves and houses and buildings made out of
stone.

Apes are everywhere - hammering stones to enlarge a house, chattering in
the trees, swinging hand-over-hand along horizontal ladders - crossing from
one side of the ravine to the other.

Will has roused himself. He stares at the city through feverish eyes - to
him, it appears to float. Buildings swim in and out of focus. His shoulders
shake - he starts to laugh, an edge of hysteria to it.

WILL

A city... of course. Ape city! I've destroyed my mind. Or maybe I'm dead
and this is God's last joke - hell is ruled by apes.

Whhish - the end of a whip sails through the air. Crack! It hits Will's
back, doubling him over.

GUARD

Quiet, animal!

RIPPLES OF WATER

run across the surface of a beautiful pool. A black shape glides along
underwater. The head breaks the surface - it's an old gorilla, the fur on
his face gray and balding. This is NAZGUL. He is the Ghan - the President -
of the Council of Elders.

He walks out of the water. Other old apes - all male, their days of warring
and building over - lie around the pool. Several of them, draped only in
rough loin-cloths, groom each other, picking nits out of their fur.

The sound of a gong! Nazgul picks up a loin cloth and walks the end of the
pool. He looks straight down the ravine - at the far end, Drak and his
troop come into view.

NAZGUL

The raiders are home.

OLD APE

(lazily)

Good hunting?

Nazgul squints against the sun. He sees the poles carrying the dead humans.

NAZGUL

By the look of it.

GRAY-BEARDED WARRIOR, HIS CHEST MARKED BY THE SCARS OF MANY BATTLES, GETS
UP -

GRAY BEARD

(proudly)

Not as good as when we rode the high ridges, I'll warrant.

NAZGUL

Times are different now. Back then, a could go out and come back with a
brace of animals. They're far scarcer now -

OLD APE

Not scarce enough, I say.

There's a murmur of agreement from the other apes.

A TINY BOAT

is wreathed in woven leaves. Lying in it is the dead body of a young ape.
The boat drifts down an underground stream. All around it rise the stone
walls of a huge cavern. Torches light up the gloom - this place is a
temple.

A group of apes - mourners - walk along a path, keeping pace with the
funeral boat.

They make a humming sound deep in the back of their throats - a dirge for
the dead.

At the head of the procession, swinging a smoking censer, is an ape wearing
a lion-skin cloak. His face is scarred and twisted - he has one cruel eye,
the other is just an empty socket. Beneath the cloak, one arm and a leg are
withered. The whole effect, rather than diminishing his power, enhances it.
His name is MA-GOG. He is high priest of the apes, defender of the faith,
keeper of the Book of the Lore.

The funeral boat gathers speed in the current. It thrusts towards sunlight
pouring through an arch.

A ROCK PLATFORM

The mourners step through the arch and on to a slab of rock. We pull back
to reveal where they stand - a huge crouching ape has been carved out of
the face of a cliff, Its bowed front legs form the archway, the entrance to
the temple of the ape.

CLOUDS OF MIST AND WIND-BLOWN SPRAY SWEEP OVER MA-GOG AND THE MOURNERS. ALL
AROUND THEM, THE SOUND OF ROARING WATER. THE FUNERAL BOAT FLOATS OUT OF THE
TEMPLE AND INTO A ROARING RIVER. MA-GOG SWINGS THE CENSER OVER THE WATER -

MA -GOG

(intoning)

In the beginning was the word, and the word was the Book of the Lore. It
says God created the ape in His own image. Alone among His creatures, the
ape has a soul. One crosses the river now but death is only a door. He will
dwell in the house of the Lord forever. Amen The mourners beat their chests
with their fists. They repeat the word "Amen".

For a moment the clouds of mist clear. Now we see where the boat is headed
- half an ocean of water pours over a sheer drop. These are the Falls of No
Return. The boat races forward - over the waterfall it goes.

The sound of cheering voices, very faint, drifts towards them. Ma-Gog turns
and looks up the river towards the city -

APES HANG FROM THE 'LADDERS'

looking down on Drak and his troops. The convoy passes along a road cut
into the side of the ridge. Apes have come out of the houses and buildings
to greet them.

Will lies in the back of the cart, unconscious. Faces of apes stare in at
him - they've never seen anything like it. A young ape - a little boy -
stands with his grandfather.

KID

What is it?

GRANDFATHER

Some... sort of human.

KID

But look at the eyes, 'Pa - they're the color of the sea. Where's it from?

GRANDFATHER

I don't know - a traveler, maybe. Nobody knows what lies beyond the Tower
of the Moon.

THE WORD "TRAVELER" IS PICKED UP BY OTHER APES. IT RIPPLES THROUGH THE
CROWD. A WOMAN ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE WAGON CALLS OUT -

WOMAN

No it's not - it's a mutant.

LABORER

Put it in the zoo!

A female ape pushes them aside. She's heavy-set, bright eyes, an air of
authority about her. Over her shoulder she carries a leather satchel with a
series of steel instruments dangling from it. Her name is ZORA - she is a
doctor.

She and her ASSISTANT - a young male - swing themselves on to the cart.
Kneeling beside him, Zora puts her hand down and grabs hold of Will's
crotch.

ZORA

Whatever it is, it's male.

She rips open Will's shirt - his chest is covered in blood from the gaping
wound.

ZORA (CONT'D)

Probe.

The Assistant hands her a steel instrument. She slides it towards the
wound. We hold on Will's face - a strangled cry but he doesn't regain
consciousness. Zore returns the bloodied probe to her Assistant. She calls
out -

ZORA (CONT'D)

Drak!

The leader of the ape warriors, riding close by, turns -

ZORA (CONT'D)

The animal's bleeding to death, my Lord.

Drak rides up to the wagon.

DRAK

I didn't bring him all this way just to have him die.

ZORA

(to the assistant)

Ben-Guri - get a vet. Quicklyl

AN APE IN A LEATHER APRON

uses a grinding wheel to sharpen a gruesome looking knife. This is the VET.
Will lies on a stone slab nearby - it's a sort of medical centersinks along
the walls, racks of equipment, hoses to wash down the blood.

The Vet cuts the clothing away from Will's wound. He turns to Doctor Zora -

VET

We're going to have to give him blood.

PRISONER IN A CELL

He's a tribesman - in his late 40s. Despite his tattered furs and hollow
cheeks, he carries himself with dignity - he's a proud man. His name is
ARAGORN. On a chain around his neck he wears a metal ornament, like
crescent moon. Etched into it are strange markings and the totems of
various tribes.

The sound of a key in lock. Aragorn turns - the cell door is thrown back.
Three ape guards enter. Two of them, armed with spears, drive Aragorn into
a corner. The third ape has a leather collar on the end of a pole. He drops
it over Aragorn's head.

Aragorn struggles but the ape jerks the collar tight. They drag him from
the cell.

TEAM OF HORSES

- their flanks drenched in sweat - walk in a circle. They turn a huge wheel
that controls a series of pulleys and winches. Attached to the end of a
heavy cable is a wooden platform - a primitive elevator. It runs from a
series of impressive house, down the side of the ravine, to the center of
the city.

Standing on the platform are Nazgul and several other elders. They look
down on the central square. It's crowded with apes - soldiers are being
greeted by their kin.

ARAGORN LIES ON HIS BACK

He's strapped to a slab, half-naked, in the medical center. They've put a
gag in his mouth and though he struggles to free himself, he can barely
move.

Will, still unconscious, lies on a table next to him. Nazgul peers down at
him.

NAZGUL

It's human, you say?

Doctor Zora nods - yes.

NAZGUL

It's even uglier than the others.

He pulls a covering aside and looks at Will's naked legs.

NAZGUL (CONT'D)

How can he hunt with legs like those -they're like twigs. Maybe he's
diseased.

Everybody shrugs - who knows?

The Vet heats a steel needle over an open flame. The other end of the
needle is attached to a length of animal intestine. It acts as a tube. The
Vet grabs Will's forearm and slides the red-hot needle into the vein.
Will's body jerks with the pain. Nazgul and the others spring back.

For a moment Will's wrenched back to consciousness - he sees a light-filled
room, a bandage on his chest, a bladder full of blood hanging above him.
His puts it together the only way he knows - he thinks he's in hospital

WILL

(groggy)

Help me. I've got health insurance. Honest...

His eyes close as he slips back into darkness. Nazgul looks at Doctor Zora.

NAZGUL

What is health insurance?

DOCTOR ZORA

Some sort of religion...?

The Vet turns and makes an adjustment to the bladder. Another length of
tubing snakes out of it and is attached by a needle to Aragorn's arm. It's
his blood. Now we realize - this is the ape version of a blood transfusion.

NAZGUL

Do you think this'Il work?

VET

You can never tell with animals. Their bodies aren't as sophisticated as an
ape's. Sometimes their blood fights with each other. Either way, you know
really quick -they get up and walk around, or they're dead.

The Vet turns a little tap - Aragorn's blood flows down the tube. It hits
Will's vein.

WORDS CHISELED INTO STONE

"An Ape without knowledge is a fire without light."

Euripadape III

It stands over the doorway of a building high on a ridge. This is the Hall
of Learning. Ma-Gog - his lion skin cloak billowing behind him - hurries up
the steps.

THE BLADDER OF BLOOD

is empty. Guards are collaring Aragorn, preparing to drag him out. The door
into the room is thrown open. Ma-Gog enters. Nazgul and the others greet
him but he barely acknowledges it *

MA-GOG

Show him to me.

The Vet grabs Will's hair. He lifts up his head so that Ma-Gog can see his
face.

The high priest takes a step back - there's something about Will that fills
him with loathing. Anger flashes in his one good eye. He stares at Will.
His voice is Iow, almost to himself -

MA-GOG (CONT'D)

All my life I've dreaded this day.

(turns to the others)

Kill him.

DOCTOR ZORA

We've just spent an hour trying to save him -

MA-GOG

Kill him!

He grabs the stand holding the bladder and throws it to the ground. Doctor
Zora takes his arm, stopping him -

DOCTOR ZORA

The animal's unique, my lord. At least we should look at his brain. Maybe
it's possible to remove the frontal lobes without killing him. Imagine - a
tame human!

MA-GOG

Man can't be tamed. Alone among God's primates he kills for lust or greed.
He will murder his own brother to possess his brother's land.

NAZGUL

The doctor's only asking for a chance to experiment. The benefits would be
enormous. A tame species of human could double food production, at last we
could dam the rivers.

MA-GOG

You don't know what you're dealing with.

NAZGUL

It's just an animal, Ma-Gog.

MA-GOG

It's not. That's the trouble.

A movement on the stone slab. They turn and look - Will's eyelids are
fluttering. He's starting to come round. itl

He turns to Nazgul In the name of God - summon the Council of Elders.

Will's eyes are open now. Like through a glass - darkly - he sees the ape
guards coming for him. He tries to struggle but he's very weak. They haul
him off.

HEAVY IRON DOOR

set in a rock wall - on one side a key-hole. We tilt up the door to a
narrow set of bars high above it. A face, straining with effort, rises up
to peer through the bars. It is Will - looking like death but forcing
himself to do it, desperate to see where he is.

INSIDE THE CELL

The muscles across his shoulders ripple. His one good hand clutches the
bars. He hangs by it, supporting his weight, staring out at a vaulted
underground cavern. It looks like a cattle-yard, broken down and disused
nowa series of long pens, wooden chutes and a primitive conveyor belt.

Will can't support himself any longer - he tumbles to the ground. He crawls
across the floor and examines the door. It fits tight to the rock. There's
no hope of picking the lock - the key-hole doesn't even come all the way
through.

Suddenly he stops. Nothing for a moment, then he hears it again - a
scraping sound.

He peers under the wooden bed at the stone blocks that form wall. One of
the blocks moves. Will grabs hold of it and hauls it into the cell. Aragorn
squeezes through from the adjoining cell. He looks at Will -

ARAGORN

So you lived, then?

WILL

What did they do?

ARAGORN

They gave you blood.

He holds up his bandaged forearm - Will realizes where it came from.

WILL

I hope you had a medical.

Aragorn looks at him - confused. From a distance, the sound of horses
whinnying.

WILL (CONT'D)

What is this place?

ARAGORN

It was a slaughterhouse.

WILL

For horses?

ARAGORN

They use it for stables now. No - s different kind of animal. For humans.

Will stares, taken aback. Aragorn starts to gather twigs from the corners
of the cell.

ARAGORN (CONT'D)

In my father's time, the apes rounded up tribes and brought them here.
Young apes killed some during their manhood rites, the others were made
sport of in the corrals. At the end, the bodies were thrown onto the belts
and fed to the fire.

Aragorn has made a pyramid of twigs and leaves. From out of his cloak, he
takes two pieces of flint and strikes them. A spark starts the fire -

ARAGORN (CONT'D)

(softly)

Death is stuck to these walls, stranger -sounds not even s thousand winters
can take away. Sometimes of s night they speak to me - I can hear the
screams of my people.

Will looks at him. Firelight plays across their faces.

WILL

Why haven't they killed you?

ARAGORN

They keep me ss bait. My name is Aragorn -

He lifts his hand to Will - palm outwards. It's some form of greeting. Will
returns it.

ARAGORN (CONT'D)

I am the Ranger of the Easterlings, the Leader of the Seven Tribes. They
hope the warriors will come and try to free me.

WILL

And will they?

ARAGORN

Not if they fear my anger. I was taken in summer and now winter's almost
gone. Even the apes grow tired - soon they'll make me walk the Paths of the
Dead.

Will looks at Aragorn's eyes - they're fearless. The ornament glints on his
chest. Will points at it -

WILL

what is it?

ARAGORN

It's called the Crescent of Light - it's the talisman of my rank.

WILL

Silver.

ARAGORN

Mithral is how we name it..

Will reaches his hand towards it -

WILL

Can I borrow it?

Aragorn recoils - this is the most precious thing in the world to him. His
hand closes around the insignia -

ARAGORN

Who are you? What brings you to the valley of the tribes?

WILL

I meant you no harm. I'm looking for woman, one of my own kind. Do you know
of people like me?

ARAGORN

Never.

Will nods his head, accepting it. Slowly he reaches his hand out -

WILL

If you want to get out of hare. I need the talisman. Aragorn.

The two men look at each other. A beat - then Aragorn reaches up and
unfastens it.

THE TEMPLE OF THE APE

Torches burn on the walls. They cast a glow across the temple - the
underground stream, pools of water, shelves of rock hewn out of the walls.
Several apes crouch on them, praying to a golden idol of an ape.

Mist rises off of the pools. Moving through it, we see Nazgul, Drak and e
group of old apes. The Council of Elders is gathering. They pass through a
narrow door -

THE TEMPLE'S INNER CHAMBER

Oil lamps - hidden in alcoves - illuminate Ma-Gog. He stands in front of an
ancient book - strange symbols, like Sanskrit, run across its pages. This
is the Book of the Lore.

Ma-Gog looks at the Council of Elders seated in front of himNazgul, Drak
and five other huge apes - all leaders in their time.

MA-GOG

How many scrolls are there in the Book of the Lore?

Nobody replies - the question is so obvious it needs no answer.

MA-GOG (CONT'D)

One-hundred-and-seventy-six, you say -every child knows that.

(softly)

But every child is wrong. There is one more scroll - the last scroll,
sealed with seven seals, handed down from high priest to high priest...

He slides his hand under the top of the pedestal and releases a hidden
catch. The top - the Book still resting on it - tilts up, revealing a
secret compartment. It is lined with gold leaf. Lying in it is a slim folio
of pages -

MA-GOG (CONT'D)

It is called the Scroll of Revelation.

The Council of Elders stare in awed silence. Ma-Gog takes the pages out and
unfastens the seals. He reads -

MA-GOG (CONT'D)

"And it was given unto me to know the wisdom of ages. A silence fell and I
saw a new heaven and a new earth. Like through a glass, darkly, I saw the
future."

The Council of Elders stare at him. He limps forward and stops in front of
them. He recites from memory -

MA-GOG (CONT'D)

"Behold - there rose out of the earth a pale horse and the name of the
horse is Death. Those that ride on him are beasts, but like no beasts born
before. Their limbs are weak but their eyes are as cold as the sea. They
are given power over the earth to kill with the sword and with famine and
with fire. And let him that hath understanding know the number of these
beasts. It is the number of Man."

He raises his eyes and looks straight at the Councilors.

MA-GOG (CONT'D)

Today we saw that beast. Mark those words, my Lords - "their limbs are weak
but they are given power over the earth". Now will you listen? Kill him!
And if we don't? Then all hope will fail in this bitter winter.

He lays down the secret scroll and closes the secret compartment. Nazgul
looks from one to the other of the elders. Nobody says a word but he can
read their grim expressions. He turns to Drek -

NAZGUL

Kill him. Kill him with the sword and with fire. Kill himl

THE KEYHOLE TO THE CELL

It's a shining bright image, slightly distorted. We pull back to reveal
it's a reflection. Aragorn's silver ornament has been polished to a
brilliant luster. It's fixed to the end of a length of wood sticking
through the bars high above the iron door.

INSIDE THE CELL

The wooden bed has been smashed to pieces.

Both Aragorn and Will have used parts of their clothing to harness
themselves so they can see through the bars. Aragorn controls the pole with
the "mirror" on the end of it.

By looking into it, Will can see the keyhole on the other side of the door.
He has a pole with a nail attached to the end of it. He turns the pole,
guiding the nail towards the keyhole. He's trying to pick the lock.

WILL

Do you understand time.., what time is it?

Aragorn looks at the shadows in the slaughterhouse -

ARAGORN

Seven hours since the rising of the sun.

WILL

Just after noon...

ARAGORN

Shouldn't we wait until night?

WILL

(concentrating)

If I'm right, it's gonna be dark a lot sooner than you think.

The nail is almost in the key-hole. Half an inch to go... a quarter. It
slides off. Will curses and starts again -

THE SUN

beats down from a cloudleu sky. Drak and two huge Praetorian Guards - Max
and Hannibal - come through a huge stone portico. It's another entrance to
the Temple -one that opertl onto a central square. Orak and the two guards
hurry across it. towards the slaughterhouu.

THE NAIL

at the end of the pole slides into the keyhole. Will - barely breathing in
case it breaks his concentration - listens carefully. He moves the end of
the pole. The nail turns.

HUGE SET OF DOORS

are thrown open. Daylight spills into the slaughterhouse. Drak, Max and
Hannibal enter. Drak stops - he listens to the horses whinnying and
stomping their hooves -

DRAK

Something's wrong!

(turns to Max)

Get the dogs.

HANNIBAL

moves cautiously along the side one of the corrals, trying to see what's
wrong with the horses. Behind him - a movement in the shadows.

Sswhish. The sound of something slicing through the air. He turns -

It's the side of Aragorn's hand. It chops hard into the ape's throat,
shattering his larynx and blasting him into unconsciousness. He crumples to
the ground.

Aragorn and Will strip him of his weapons. Will starts to go but Aragorn
tears a strip off both their shirts. He ties the fabric around the ape's
ankles.

WILL

What are you doing?

ARAGORN

Watch - they're going to bring in the dogs.

THE DOGS

aren't really dogs at all - they're a much earlier ancestor. We call them
wolves. There are two of them, on the end of heavy leather leashes. Their
handlers have them in Will's cell, rubbing parts of the abandoned harnesses
in front of their noses. The wolves take the scent.

Drak watches as the handlers unfasten the leashes. The wolves leap out of
the cell.

HANNIBAL

rises groggily to his feet, clutching his injured throat. He takes a few
steps forward -Grrrr! He turns - the two wolves fly towards him. He tries
to yell but the only sound he can make is a squeak.

He runs - the fabric, unseen by him, trails from his ankles. The wolves
pound after him. He glances over his shoulder. First one wolf - then the
other - leaps.

Fangs and claws glistening, they hit him in the back, hurling him to the
ground. He writhes on to his back. One wolf tears at his ankles, the other
goes for his throat. Rip! Blood sprays as the artery breaks.

A STONE PASSAGE-WAY

Will and Aragorn are running, plunging down in to darkness. Arches and
corridors open off of it. It's like a labyrinth -

WILL

This doesn't seem like the way out.

ARAGORN

We're not going out - not yet.

WILL STOPS, GRABBING HOLD OF HIM, TURNING HIM ROUND -

WILL

So what are we doing?

ARAGORN

(softly)

We're going killing.

WILL

Killing?! Don't be stupid -

Will jerks on Aragorn's arm, starting to haul him back. Aragorn throws off
his hand -

ARAGORN

You do what you like! But I'm the Ranger of the Easterlings -I won't leave
here until it's done.

From behind them - the sounds of pursuit.

WILL

Shit!

He starts to run. Together they disappear into the gloom ahead.

ROW OF CAGE-LIKE CELLS

Will and Aragorn glide past them. They're taking it slowly, very carefully.

Now we see why - ahead of them is a set of steel doors. Torches on either
side illuminate a guard post but there's no sign of the sentry.

Will and Aragorn move closer. They pass -

CREVICE IN THE ROCK

We hold on the narrow opening, looking deep into the shadows. A big ape,
heavily armed, stands there. He has his back to us, his legs spread. A
trickle of water runs down the rock and drains away - he's taking a piss. A
shadow flickers on the wall above him. He sees it -THE PASSAGE-WAYMore
shadows -Will and Aragorn are move through the torchlight. The steel doors
are straight ahead.

The sentry slides out of the crevice - he's behind Will. Silently, back
pressed again6t the bars of a cell, he creeps closer to Will. He has a
curved knife in one hand and a short-handled spear in the other. Closer...
closer.

He raises the spear - a rustle of movement. Will spins - he sees the spear
about to thrust. He's a dead man.

An arm? It shoots between the bars of the cell and locks around the
sentry's throat, half choking him.

Will leaps forward and drives the butt of a weapon into the sentry's jaw.
The sentry crumples to the ground, revealing the face of the prisoner. It's
not a man, though -it's an ape. He's in his prime - barrel chested and a
fine head. His name is STRIDER.

He and Will look at each other through the bars.

STRIDER

Two rules in life - never play cards with anyone called Doc and never,
whatever else you do, turn your back on an ape.

Will stares at him. Strider grins. Will smiles back -

WILL

Thanks. I'll remember that.

He starts to search the sentry.

ARAGORN

What are you doing?

WILL

Looking for the keys.

ARAGORN

No!

WILL

He saved our lives.

ARAGORN

He's an ape!

Will shrugs himself free of Aragorn's hand -

WILL

You go and kill as many apes as you like - I'm setting this one free.

Aragorn looks at him. A beat.

ARAGORN

(softly)

It's not apes I'm going to kill.

A PRISON LABORATORY

The heavy steel doors stand open. Inside is a clean and gruesome room -
sinks and instruments along a wall, a series of operating tables and a row
of cages.

Behind the bars are six tribes-people - men, women and a little boy. All of
them carry surgical scars on their heads. It's made two of them blind; the
others stare blankly into space.

Aragorn moves down the cages. Several of them shuffle towards him but
there's no recognition - they're like the walking dead. Aragorn doesn't say
a word. Grim-faced, he loads the crossbow and starts to fire, killing them.

Will and Strider come through the doorway - they see Aragorn going from
cage to cage. Will steps forward, going to stop him. Strider's hand grabs
his shoulder, restraining him.

STRIDER

Leave it. He knows what he's doing.

Will turns and looks at him, questioning.

STRIDER (CONT'D)

The doctors operate on them - up here.

(taps his head)

The tribes think that we steal their souls...

(he pauses - softly)

Maybe they're right.

Aragorn reaches the last cage. A woman - in her 20s - stands in the middle
of the cell, looking at him. Aragorn stares at her face. His lip trembles
with emotion. She tilts her head on one side, as if trying to work
something out. Tears fill Aragorn's eyes. She stumbles a step forward. The
Ranger closes his eyes. He pulls the trigger. A crossbow bolt slams into
her chest and she falls.

Will leans against the doorway, unwilling to watch, staring down the
passageway. He turns at a footfall - Aragorn rejoins them. His voice is
hollow, as if something has died within him -

ARAGORN

It's done. We can go now.

He turns and leads them back down the passageway.

THE WOLVES

There's five of them now, hunting through the slaughter-house in a pack.
All around them we see the torches of the apes as they search the nooks and
crannies. The horses whinny wildly as they catch the scent of the wolves.

Will, Aragorn and Strider are crouched in a corner of the corral, smearing
their bodies with horse manure.

STRIDER

The fresher the better. Cover everything -that's the only way you'll hide
your scent.

The wolves sniff the air, coming closer. Will, staring through the rungs of
the coral, sees their gleaming eyes coming closer. He raises his crossbow,
getting ready.

The wolves stop. They raise their heads and look - the whole cavern is
growing dark. A giant shadow falls across the doorway into the outside
world.

The horses rear and buck. The apes are staring - darkness is falling in the
middle of the day. The wolves hackles rise in fear. They howl.

Aragorn and Strider are cowering back

ARAGORN

What is it?

WILL

Come on! Now!

He drags them forward and grabs hold of one of the horses.

AN UNEARTHLY LIGHT

has fallen on the city. The apes are in confusion - soldiers and workers
are running, children are screaming. A horse has thrown its rider and is
bolting down the terraces.

The darkness grows ever deeper. In the sky, the face of the moon
obliterates the sun - it's a full solar eclipse.

Two horses, flying at a gallop, charge through the doors of the
slaughterhouse. Will is on one, Aragorn clinging to his back. Strider is on
the other. They wheel across an open space, through running apes, and speed
down a terrace.

MA-GOG

steps out on to a rock ledge. He holds a staff in one hand, his cloak
thrown back over his shoulder, magnificent in the eerie light. He stares
down at the chaos. Drak swings across a ladder and lands at his side -

DRAK

What is it?

MA-GOG

(wild)

A sign - the hand of Man passes across the face of God! Lookl He points to
a terrace below - Will leads the other two escapees along a road and on to
the iron bridge. Drak and Ma-Gog stare at them. Darkness engulfs them.

Out of the blackness, an image -

CHRIST ON THE CROSS

It's a stained-glass window in a huge cathedral. A priest is at the altar
conducting Mass for the repose of the dead. We pull back to reveal a tiny
white coffin - just big enough for a baby. Next to it is another coffin.
And another - a row of them.

PRIEST

And even now as sorrow has no end, we find comfort in the words of the Lord
Jesus Christ. Did he not say unto Mark -"suffer the little children to come
unto me, for they are the Kingdom of Heaven. Now and forever." Amen.

The congregation - sad-eyed relatives and weeping parents - fill the pews.

CONGREGATION

Amen.

Pall-bearers lift up the tiny coffins. The organ starts to play. A soloist
- a tenor -steps to the side of the altar. He starts to sing the Latin hymn
"Penis Angelicas". The haunting words of the hymn fill the cathedral. They
carry over to -

THE SPACE DOME

is lit up by banks of lights that turn night into day. The clock tower
above the biology building shows the time2.00am. Even so, the area bustles
with activity.

INSIDE THE DOME

An illuminated chart dominates one wall - just like the strategy map in the
Pentagon's war room. Every research center is identified - next to it is
its function and a list of personnel. We see Princeton, Stanford, Texas
A&M, Los Alamos. Tentacles reach out to Oxford, the Pasteur Institute, the
University of Beijing...

Below the chart are nitrogen-cooled Cray super-computers. We track through
teams of men and women processing data, satellite dishes feeding a
communications network, a video conference taking place in a corner,
technicians routing and re-routing phone calls and faxes.

We come to a glass wall. On the other side is Diamond -

A SMALL OFFICE

Glass doors seal out the electronic hum. Diamond, staring through the
glass, looks exhausted. DeMaupassent sits on a couch. He's in his
shirt-sleeves, dark rings under his eyes. Next to him is Bob, the young
neurologist. He wears jeans and a t-shirt. On the front it says

"I'll sleep when I'm dead."

The coffee table is piled with files, journal extracts and computer
print-outs. A video projector beams a complex molecular structure on to a
screen.

Diamond rubs her eyes, trying to wipe away the fatigue.

DIAMOND

I'm sorry Luc - say that again.

DEMAUPASSANT

DEMAUPASSANT (CONT'D)

(kindly)

My fault, Billie - I rattle on too much. The result is - we've fixed the
time frame.

He hits the projector - the image of a fetus developing normally in the
womb appears on the screen... deMAUPASSANT

The fetus develops normally through the first trimester. Then it happens -
about sixteen weeks and two days, everything falls apart. The whole
chemical structure goes out of control -

He flashes up another image - a fetus that is already aging remarkably.
deMAUPASSANT

Once it starts, it's irreversible. If we're going to stop it, we've got to
intercede here -

He points at the slide of the normally developing fetus.

BOB

(taking over)

There's a trigger - some major fucking switch gets turned. That's what I've
been working on. It's definitely in the mDNA. There's a fragment of one
chromosome I'm looking at -

He flicks a switch on the video projector. A slide of a human gene,
massively magnified, popl on to the screen.

BOB (CONT'D)

It's so different, I call it the alien. How it got there, exactly what it
does - I haven't got the first idea.., no fucking idea at all.

Diamond looks at his grim face. He seems totally defeated.

DIAMOND

(quietly)

Is it that bad?

He stares at the floor. There's not even a hint of the former arrogance.

BOB

Someone's dropped us in the middle of the Louvre. We're blind men and
they've told us to find the Mona Lisa. There's four miles of galleries end
we've got five minutes to do it. That's how I feel -and that's when rm
optimistic.

Diamond turns to deMaupassant.

DIAMOND

Luc?

DEMAUPASSANT

I'm sixty-two years old. I've seen us go from DC3s to landing on the moon.
In my life I've won all the glittering prizes. I've always believed nothing
was beyond the reach of Man, but I'll tell you honestly - this may never be
unraveled. If it is, it won't be in my lifetime.

He looks at them. Silence. There's nothing anyone can say. He starts to
gather up his papers-

DEMAUPASSANT (CONT'D)

So what do we do? I think it's like Gatsby -"so we beat on, boats against
the current, borne back ceaselessly into the past." There's no other way,
ia there?

They nod their hoods - you have to try. DeMaupaasant and Bob start to
leave.

DIAMOND

Luc?

(he turns))

You're certain - about the time, I mean?

DEMAUPASSANT

(Nodding)

Sixteen weeks. How far along are you?

DIAMOND

Twelve weeks.

They look at one another. The old man speaks gently -

DEMAUPASSANT

Good night, Billie.

A TINY FETUS

perfectly formed - floats in the amniotic fluid. It's alive - the large
head sways, the heart beats through the translucent ribs.

Diamond has her shirt pulled up and her jeans down around her thighs. She
lies on a stainless steel table in a hi-tach examination room. A complex
array of equipment -ultra-sounds and scanners - beams down on her exposed
stomach. It projects a , video image onto a screen.

She is alone in the room, manipulating the equipment herself. She stares up
at the child growing in her womb. We see the genitalia.

DIAMOND

So - you're a little boy. It's funny - I think I knew.

She reaches up and gently touches the image of his face.

DIAMOND (CONT'D)

We've got four weeks. The way I see it -there's nothing to lose. I can't
tell you whet'Il happen to us. It's on the edge, mister. The air's so thin
out there, we may not even be able to breathe. But what the hell - it's a
chance.

She takes her hand away and looks at his face.

DIAMOND (CONT'D)

You want to try it? Sure you do. You're my son. We've waited all our lives
for each other.

A STACK OF HAND-WRITTEN NOTEPADS

lie on a table in the basement. We track through them - past computer
print-outs and dog-eared journals. We recognize them - these are Will's
detailed notes.

To the table is the makeshift lab - racks of bottles and syringes. In the
dim light we see Diamond. She removes the catheter from her vein, turns and
climbs up the flotation tank.

INSIDE THE TANK

Water sloshes back and forth. Diamond lowers herself in and floats there.
For a moment, she stares up at the circle of light spilling through the
hatch. We hold on her face.

DIAMOND (CONT'D)

(softly)

So we beat on, boats against the current.

She reaches up and pulls the hatch shut. Clang! Darkness.

THE SUN AND THE MOON

It's one of those strange twilights when both celestial bodies hang in the
sky together. Smoke drifts across them. We tilt down to ape city -

A column of smoke and flame spirals out of a stone chimney on top of the
slaughterhouse.

RED HOT FIRE

burns in a huge furnace at one end of the slaughterhouse. The rickety
conveyor belt is working, clattering away. Several ape workers throw the
bodies of the lab animals - the dead tribes-people - on to the belt.

The body of the young boy is carried forward on the belt. It dumps him into
the furnace. The flames engulf him.

WILL'S EMPTY CELL

The door hangs open. The space is lit by a dozen torches. Drak is alone,
moving around the cell, trying to work out how Will escaped. He looks at
the smashed bed, the hole in the wall, the torn clothing that made the
harness.

He swings the heavy door on its hinges and touches the lock. No answers
there. Lying in the doorway is the length of wood with the nail in the end.
Drak picks it up. He turns it over in his hand, th!nking about it.

He jumps! One handed he catches hold of the bars above the door.
Effortlessly, he hauls himself up and pokes the wood through the bars. The
nail touches the lock.

DRAK

(to himself)

Clever... you clever fucking animal.

DOCTOR ZORA (O.S.)

My lord...

He turns and sees the doctor hurrying towards him.

DOCTOR ZORA (CONT'D)

(urgent)

Could I see you please?

THE HALL OF POWER

is a magnificent room - stone columns and towering trees growing in huge
pots. At one end is a rock shelf - open to the gathering twilight.
Silhouetted against it, commanding a view of the entire city, is the
Council of Elders. They sit around a table made from bone and tusks, deep
in discussion.

Nazgul looks up - he sees Drak approaching through the shadows.

NAZGUL

Drak. I was just saying - maybe it's a blessing.

DRAK

A blessing?

NAZGUL

Where there's one, there must be others. If we'd killed him, we might never
find them.

MA-GOG

But the animal's not stupid - he knows come day-break we'll be tracking
him. Who's to say he'll run for home?

Drak stops in front of them.

DRAK

No - he's not stupid. But even dogs hunt in packs of seven. Every animal
needs its kind. And when we find them - what then?

MA-GOG

What do you think?!

DRAK

Just like the tribes - burn them out of their holes, put them to the sword?
I don't mind doing that - I like it - but it's never enough, is it? No
matter how many we kill, every year they're still here. Why will it be any
different with the Blue Eyes? What we need is a final solution.

NAZGUL And where do we find that?

DRAK (CONT'D)

Doctor Zora's brought back patients from a place called Kismatu. I've been
talking to her about it -

Several of the Council are looking at each other - perplexed.

MA-GOG

What is Kismatu?

NAZGUL

It's a tiny colony farther out than even the northern frontier. Females and
babies have been dying there.

He turns to Drak - his eyes intense, very interested.

NAZGUL (CONT'D)

Go on.

COOL AND LOVELY ROOM

There are iron barn on I series of high windows but in the middle of the
room is a jungle-gym. Underneath it are ape toys. Five baby apes sit on
cots. They must be no more than two or three years old but their faces end
bodies are those of old, old apeswizened and wrinkled, frail with age.

A double set of bars provide a sort of air-lock. Hanging on them is a sign

"Quarantine. No Entry".

Drak and the Council of Elders stare in at the children. Doctor Zora is
with them - she's nervous, twisting her fingers.

DOCTOR ZORA

We don't know what causes it- a virus probably. I'd hoped to complete our
research before I came to you with my proposal. But, given the
circumstances -

NAZGUL I

It's a brilliant idea.

(turns and smiles at her)

Brilliant.

HORSES' HOOVES

paw the ground. They're bound with cloth to stop them leaving a trail. It's
night -the horses are tethered near a fire burning in the lee of a rock.

Will and Strider have made camp - a hare roasts over the fire. Aragorn sits
well apart - a silhouette in the moonlight - staring out into the forest,
lost in his thoughts. Will and Strider look at him.

STRIDER

He's their leader - he can never take his eye from the mountain. He has to
do what he thinks is right.

WILL

(hard)

By killing them?

STRIDER

Don't judge him, Will. I couldn't have done it. I wonder if you could? One
of those women he just killed wes his daughter.

Will reacts. He turns and stares at the silhouette. A long beat.

WILL

(quietly)

We call it a Iobotomy. What other things have you people tried?

He turns to face him. Strider shrugs. There's something about it -
something almost evasive.

WILL (CONT'D)

Fuck you, Strider! Tell me!

He stares at Will - he's never seen him angry.

STRIDER

don't know if it's true.., my sister's mate works in the lab. He says
Doctor Zora's working on some disease -

Will comes towards him -

WILL

What sort of disease?

STRIDER

Of the children, I think - ape children.

WILL

How did they die, Strider? Old in the belly -is that how?!

STRIDER

Some of them. You know this disease?

Will stares at him, taking it in.

WILL

(softly)

So that's how it happened. Fuck you people.

STRIDER

They haven't done it yet. It may not work.

WILL

They will and it does.

He turns end takes step towards the forest. He runs his fingers through his
hair -WILL God help us.

STRIDER

That's funny - that's exactly what an ape would say.

Will turns. He and Strider stare at one another - the ape and the man, both
struck by the sudden commonality.

STRIDER (CONT'D)

I'm sorry...

Will walks slowly back to the fire. Strider starts to strip the meat off a
hare he's roasting over the flames. He offers it to Will. He shakes his
head - he's not hungry anymore. He stares into the flames -

WILL

What about you, Strider - why were you in the cell?

STRIDER

I fought another ape. Nothing very heroic, I'm afraid - I was drunk. He
fell badly, his head hit the branch of a tree going down. It broke his
neck.

He pauses We're not like humans. An ape never kills one of his own. Never.

WILL

What's the punishment?

STRIDER

At the ceremony of summer rites, the high priest would curse me with death.

I would have been left to die in the forest -no journey over the waterfall,
no-one to say the sacred words. Without that, no ape can walk in the next
world. You saved my life, Will and I'm grateful. But there's nothing I can
do about my soul. I'm a dead ape walking.

Strider stripe more meet off the hare. Will picks up a saddle and blanket
and starts to make himself bed.

STRIDER (CONT'D)

You knew, didn't you? You knew the sun was going to swallow the moon.
That's why you weren't afraid.

Will pauses - then he turns to him.

WILL

Yes - I knew.

STRIDER

WHO ARE YOU, WILL?

WILL

I've come a long way, Strider - it's farther then I can explain.

STRIDER

I've heard stories - old apes tell them 'round the fire late at night - of
strange lands where the creatures can tell the future. Is that where you're
from?

WILL

In a way.. yeah, it's something like that.

STRIDER

So what happens to it afl, to the world we've built? Tell me that.

WILL

It passes away.

Strider stares at him through the firelight.

STRIDER

History remembers, though - it's passed on, what we did, I mean?

WILL

No, Strider - there's nothing, not a trace left behind.

Strider thinks for a moment, then he smiles gently.

STRIDER

So it's just vanity then - what we believe, that the works of the ape will
last forever?

WILL

Yes, it's vanity. But not just of apes, Strider -maybe of men, too.

He turns and settles down on his makeshift bed. Strider - the food
forgotten - stares out into the night. A million stars hang on a velvet
sky.

Look down from them - in the vast blackness of the forest, one tiny
lightthe flickering fire.

DUST SWIRLING, HOOVES POUNDING

battalions of ape cavalry sweep out of the stables. Dawn is breaking across
the city. Ma-Gog stands on a ridge, his staff raised, blessing the army as
it rides out.

At its head is Drak. He clatters across the iron and wood bridge and down
the avenue of idols. Votive fires burn in front of every statue.

A RAINBOW

arches across the end of a tiny gorge. Dozens of streams cascade into
pools, spilling over ledges and swirling into ponds. Aragorn leads Will and
Strider along a hidden, path - a rock ledge that runs behind the
waterfalls.

The ledge widens into a large cave. Sunlight streams through a veil of
cascading water. Aragorn looks around - something's worrying him.

ARAGORN

This is the Rainbow Tribe's cave. They should be here.

A STONE FIREPLACE

Aragorn places his hand on the circle of stones, feeling its warmth.

ARAGORN (CONT'D)

They left at the rising of the sun.

He moves deeper into the cave - a maze of limestone caverns and
passage-ways. He stops at sleeping area - weapons lie there, food in
baskets.

ARAGORN

(softly)

Why such hurry?

Suddenly he stops, listening. He looks at Strider -

ARAGORN (CONT'D)

You heard it?

Strider nods his head - yes. Will hasn't heard a thing. He listens hard -
nothing.

ARAGORN (CONT'D)

Animal?

STRIDER

I don't think so.

Strider moves silently to the side of the cave. He picks up a crossbow.

STRIDER (CONT'D)

Is there another entrance?

ARAGORN

From the ridge above. Apes?

STRIDER

Scouts probably.

He cocks the crossbow. Aragorn has picks up a bow and spear. He moves
towards a cavern, signaling Strider to take a passageway.

Will grabs a crossbow. Strider tosses him a chain mail vest - armor. They
move off.

HONEYCOMB OF PASSAGES

eep in the cave. A sound - pebbles falling off a ledge. Then we see a
flicker of light - a torch is moving through a cavern. Whoever holds it,
turns a corner and is lost in darkness.

A CROSSROADS

of arches and stalactites. Will and Strider split apart. Will moves
silently through the darkness, into a cavern. Through an archway he sees a
shadow on the wall! He goes fast towards it -

A HUGE BOULDER

The shadow comes round the boulder. We tilt down and now we see who's
holding the torchDiamondl She's armed with a crossbow - cocked end loaded.
She turns a corner -

Ten feet in front of her is Strider. She stares at the massive ape's back -
a bandoleer of arrows slung over his shoulder. Her eyes widen with fear.
She raises the crossbow -

Strider hears it. He spins, weapon rising -

turns into a passage midway between them. He sees Diamond about to fire. He
screams -

Too late - she pulls the trigger! Will hurls himself forward - in front of
Strider. Whack! The arrow blasts into his chest. He crashes to the ground.

Diamond stares down at him.

DIAMOND

Will!

His eyes open - he's gasping for breath from the impact. He and Diamond
look at one another. Strider reaches down and rips the arrow out of Will's
chain mail armor. Diamond's shoulders sag with relief.

DIAMOND (CONT'D)

(indicates Strider Who's he?

WILL

I'll explain later.

He struggles to his feet and looks at Diamond -

WILL (CONT'D)

What made you come? I thought the mDNA was just a theory. One of dozens of
theories - isn't that what you said?

DIAMOND

We did a lot of work. I guess I was wrong.

WILL

People have been wrong about a lot of things.

THE GREAT VALLEY

stretches out below - primordial forests and cascading streams. Will and
Diamond stand on a rock ledge outside the cave.

WILL (CONT'D)

This is the rift valley in Kenya -

He points at the towering, snow-capped peak.

WILL (CONT'D)

That's Kilamanjaro - ten thousand feet higher but a hundred thousand years
of wind and rain will turn it into the mountain we know. Think of it -
we've come back a hundred thousand years! Everyone told me it couldn't be
done, but we've crossed the frontier now - Man has traveled through space
and time. How long has science dreamed of that?

DIAMOND

How long have you?

WILL

All my life.

DIAMOND

Dream no more. You've done it. Like you said in your note - it was Doctor
Robert Plant of UC Berkeley.

WILL turns and looks out at the valley -

WILL

(softly)

Yeah - I really have, haven't I?

Diamond watches him. There's a shout from inside the cave -

STRIDER (O.S.)

Aragorn - I've found it!

A CAVE PAINTING

Newly-drawn, is hidden in e nook high up in the main cave. Strider, Will
and Diamond watch aa Aregorn looks at it by torchlight.

ARAGORN

I thought they would leave word for their hunters. Kip-Kena has called a
gathering of the Seven Tribes.

WILL

Where?

ARAGORN

Two days' travel - at the Eagle's Nest.

He looks out through the mouth of the cave - twilight is closing in.

ARAGORN (CONT'D)

We'll stay hera tonight. Be ready to leave at first light.

THE EMBERS OF A FIRE

burn in the circle of stones. Aragorn and Strider are sleeping next to it.
Will and Diamond have been awake all night. They sit in the shadows near
the entrance to the cave, speaking quietly.

DIAMOND

An ape civilization? You said there was a city.., what happened to it all?

WILL

You know what we've found of Aragorn's whole race? Seventeen bones, that's
all. Anthropologists have discovered evidence of the apes - we call them
skulls. Bones last a lot longer than civilizations.

DIAMOND

I guess there's a lesson in that.

WILL

Listen, Billie - the apes have discovered a disease.

Diamond reacts. Will crouches down - in the dirt he scratches out a small
chain of circles. It's a molecule.

WILL (CONT'D)

It's really rare and, lucky for them, it's in an isolated area. They're not
stupid - they understand it's potential. They plan to give it to the tribes
-

He draws an arrow from the molecule to a bow-legged stick figure of a man.

WILL (CONT'D)

And maybe they do, but it doesn't matter -Aragorn's people aren't us.
Already evolution's taken another track -

scratches a cross through the bow-legged man. He draws the figure of an
upright human.

WILL (CONT'D)

Somewhere in the rift valley is someone like us - the first man.

DIAMOND

Woman. You said it was in the mitochondrial DNA - it has to be a woman.

She reaches forward and scratches long hair on to the figure's head.

WILL

You're right. Sooner or later the apes find her. She doesn't look like the
tribes but the apes don't care - she's human.

So they give her the disease. She's different though - it doesn't work, or
at least it doesn't seem to. It gets integrated into her. It's passed on,
it mutates, it weaves its way into the mDNA. It lies there - a bomb waiting
to go off. And then one day -

DIAMOND

After a hundred thousand years?

WILL

The planet's five billion years old. What's that to Nature? A blink of the
eye.

Will throws the stick down on the ground.

WILL (CONT'D)

That's the theory, anyway.

DIAMOND

(impressed)

A helluva theory, Doctor Plant.

HE TURNS AND LOOKS IT HER -

DIAMOND (CONT'D)

There's not much time, Will. We have to find her before the apes and we
have to do it within four weeks.

WILL

Jesus, Billie! Four weeks? We've got a theory - that's all. We don't even
know half the problems we're dealing with. You can't put a deadline on
science.

DIAMOND

Science, Will? What about people? Isn't that what this is all about. I'm
sorry - I thought there were children dying.

WILL

Sure. Of course it's about that too.

DIAMOND

But then, you don't care muchabout people do you?

THEY LOOK AT ONE ANOTHER. A BEAT. WILL'S VOICE IS HARD -

WILL

No - I guess I don't. Not for a long time. Ideas and knowledge are what
matter. They're the shining ideals. That's the only way we progress.

DIAMOND

Progress to what? We're both children of our age, aren't we? We've grown up
to believe the more we know, the more advanced we are. But what does that
mean if we've forgotten the things of real value. You know the reason I
came? It's got nothing to do with science or knowledge. I'm going to have a
child -that's why I'm here.

They look at one another.

DIAMOND (CONT'D)

Uke you said, the women's out there somewhere. Why ere we traveling with
them?

(indicates Aragore and Strider)

We should cut ourselves loose.

WILL

We wouldn't last a day. We've got to keep moving, Billie. The apes are like
storm-troopers.

DIAMOND

Where are they now?

WILL

Right behind. I think Strider has some sort of tribal intuition. He says he
can hear their hoof beats in his head.

The first rays of dawn pierce the mist from the waterfall. Will and Diamond
turn at a sound behind them - Aragorn is getting up.

ARAGORN

Ready?

A SPARKLING RIVER

winds through a beautiful valley. The two horses splash along the water's
edge. Strider and Aragorn are mounted on one, Will and Diamond on the
other. They turn a curve - Aragorn leads them out of the shallows and into
the forest.

THE CAVE OF THE RAINBOW

Ape soldiers are swarming over the cave. A TRACKER uses torchlight to study
footprints. He looks up at Orak -

TRACKER

There's four of them, my Lord.

DRAK

Four? The Tracker points It a at of prints -

TRACKER

It's woman. Blue Eyes has a mate.

DRAK

Excellent. I look forward to meeting her.

SOLDIER (O.S.)

My Lord - hoof prints.

Drak turns - the man stands on a path that curves up towards the roof of
the cave. Drak looks up - high above he sees a slash of daylight. It's
another entrance.

DRAK

Malakai! Bolag!

Two heavily-armed officers emerge from among the soldiers. With Drak they
run for the wall. They leap up the rock face - their massive hands grabbing
tiny ledges.

Other apes follow them. They scramble up the wall with amazing speed.

AN EAGLE CIRCLES

Soaring and hovering in the sky. We tilt down a tribesman - dressed in
skins edged with feathers - is perched high on a jagged peak. He's a
LOOKOUT. He tenses -

Four figures on foot appear on a path cut into the side of a cliff. The
Lookout gives a piercing crythe sound of an eagle. It carries down to -

SERIES OF WOODEN PLATFORMS

are built into the rocky crags, opening into caves. They are connected by
ladders and bridges slung across dizzying drops. The inhabitants here live
with their totem -this is the nest of the Tribe of the Eagle.

The platforms and caves are crowded with the gathering tribes. People turn
at the Lookout's cry. A man pushes through, listening - it's Kip-Kena.

THE LOOKOUT POST

Kip follows the direction of the Lookout's pointing finger. Will and
Diamond lead the other two - all on foot now - along the path.

KIP

It's the traveler! With a woman...

The Lookout shields his eyes against the sun - the visitors ere coming
closer.

LOOKOUT

The fool - he's brought an ape with himl He reaches for a bow but Kip's
hand falls on his arm, stopping him.

KIP

Who's the other one, though?

(realizing)

Aragorn!

He turns, yelling down to the platforms -

KIP (CONT'D)

It's the Ranger! The Ranger is free!

ON THE PLATFORMS

The tribes-people burst into action - running for the bridges, scaling the
ladders.

A WOODEN BRIDGE SWINGS THROUGH THE AIR

Whack! It locks into place on the far side of a deep crevasse. It's a
primitive drawbridge. Aragorn steps on to it, leading the others across.

The tribes-people are gathering, eager to greet him. Then they see Strider.
A ripple of fear and anger runs through them.

ARAGORN

The ape travels with me - treat him as a friend.

Nobody argues with the Ranger. He stops in front of Kip. The young warrior
starts to bow his head but Aragorn stops him. He puts out his arms - they
embrace.

Will crosses the bridge. Kip sees him. He grasps Will's arm in greeting -

KIP

You carry part of my spirit with you -I owe you my life. Welcome, Traveler.

INSIDE THE EAGLE'S NEST

A series of caves, connected by vaulted arches, extend in to the mountain.
They're crowded with members of various tribes - children are playing,
flint-knappers are fashioning tools, women ara cooking.

A shaft of sunlight strikes a ledge high up the wall. Kip and Will have
found a quiet place amid the bustle.

WILL

Are the seven tribes here?

KIP

All except the Antelope. They hunt the plains far to the west - they have
the longest journey.

WILL

Will they come?

KIP

Who knows - maybe the apes have found them. Nobody has seen them for many
summers gone. Why?

WILL

I'm searching for someone - a young woman. She looks like us ...

(he indicates Diamond))

I thought she might live with the tribes.

KIP

Is she a relative - was she born to your hearth?

WILL

To all of our hearths. My race reveres her. We think of her as the first
woman. Without her. our lives are nothing.

KIP

(nodding his head)

Women are of the spirit - we believe that. too. Mother Earth mates with the
totems. Only through woman can their children walk the world.

WILL

Have you seen her?

KIP

NO.

WILL

You're sure? Perhaps some of the women have seen something?

KIP

She looks like you, you say? No offense, Traveler, but the women say you're
the ugliest man they've ever seen. A woman that looks like you - I'm sure
they would have talked about it.

WILL

Ugly?

They smile at one another.

KIP

I'm sorry I can't help.

A torch flares below. Kip looks down into an adjoining cave. It's empty
except for a group of men - all warriors - filing in. These are the leaders
of each of the tribes.

ANOTHER TORCH IS LIT

They ring the walls of the small cave. By their light we see the skins, the
feathers and the symbols of each tribe's totem - the eagle, the tiger, the
rainbow...

Beneath each one squats its leader. One place is empty - the Tribe of the
Antelope. Will sits near the entrance. He watches Aragorn - dressed in
ceremonial robes, the Crescent of Light glistening at his neck - rise to
his feet.

ARAGORN

We've traveled without rest - there are soldiers a day behind. The ape says
it's an army.

KIP

And there are more coming from the north. Five squadrons et least, the
runners say. It's led by the old warrior Nazgul.

ARAGORN

Is that why you called the gathering?

KIP

Great things are moving, Ranger -

An old man, battle-scarred and gray, leans forward. He is the leader of the
Rainbow.

A RAINBOW

A stranger walks out of the west, the moon hides the sun, armies are on the
march - come the new moon, nothing in Middle Earth will be the same.

Others nod their heads in agreement.

KIP (CONT'D)

We either fight or flee - the Tribes must decide.

ARAGORN

I know you, Kip - you always were a fighter. What do the others say?

warrior in a feathered cloak speaks -

EAGLE

It doesn't matter what we say - the Ranger has returned. We'll follow
wherever he leads.

Aragorn looks at their faces. Slowly he shakes his head -

ARAGORN

I'll walk the path Mother Earth has laid for me, but I'll walk it no more
as Ranger.

The leaders stare at him. Several start to object but he silences them with
his hand -

ARAGORN

A man leads from his heart and winter has come early to mine.

(softly)

I took the life of my daughter - and some of your kinfolk with it. I did my
duty -nothing more can be asked of I men. But now others must walk in my
place.

He walks forward, unfastening the Crescent of Light. He stops in front of
Kip -

ARAGORN

If I should have had a son, I would have hoped for a man as fine as you.
This is my last act as Ranger of the Easterlings-

He reaches out and slips the Crescent of Light around Kip's neck.

ARAGORN (CONT'D)

Take care of my father's people. Guide them well.

(he looks at the leaders)

You must decide what is best for the Tribes. For me... I was the one that
had to strike the blow, but it was the apes who killed my child. Tomorrow I
will go to fight them. What father could do any less?

He turns away and walks towards the entrance. Only Will sees the tears in
his eyes.

KIDS' FACES, WIDE-EYED

They huddle together - staring at the strange-looking woman and the ape.
Strider is building a small fire at the side of the cave, Diamond lays down
furs for sleeping. , She looks up - the leaders are coming out of the
meeting. Will approaches.

WILL

They're going to war. They leave at dawn.

STRIDER

They'll be slaughtered.

WILL

They think if they leave the valley, their totems won't follow. Without
them, they say they're dead anyway.

DIAMOND

We should go now.

Will looks at her. She meets his gaze. Suddenly she realizes -

DIAMOND

Oh, nol We're not fighting someone else's war -

WILL

Listen to me -

DIAMOND

We've got four weeks, Willl Four weeks to find her. She's not here, so whet
are we waiting for? Let's go!

The tribes-people turn at the raised voices. Will takes Diamond's arm and
guides her to a private corner -

WILL

Listen, Billie! We know the future - but if we beat the apes, they can't
harm the woman.

DIAMOND

Beat the apes?! And say we don't - or say one of us gets captured. What
then? Don't you understand? Four weeksi

WILL

Yeah, I understand - but those things aren't going to happen. We know
things the apes can't even dream of. This is our world, Billie - men won it
with their minds. All we need is knowledge and science. We've got them
both. We can win!

DIAMOND

What are we going to do - dazzle them with calculus? This is an army, Will
- you said it yourself. Storm-trooperst

WILL

Look -

He bends and picks up s rock from the ground. He hands it to Diamond -

WILL (CONT'D)

Taste it. That's saltpeter - the natural form of potassium nitrate. The
caves are littered with the stuff. You've smelt the air - there's sulfur
all around. If we burn timber, that'Il give us charcoal. You're s scientist
- you know what it means.

Sure - she knows what it means. She stares at him.

DIAMOND

It's strange, isn't it? Give s man s problem and the first thing he thinks
about is weapons.

WILL

We're a frail species, Billea. It's only weapons that have made us bigger
than we are.

DIAMOND

Or smaller.

WILL

It's the apes who are going to be a whole lot smaller after this. We can
beat themi No more experiments - no more problem.

DIAMOND

(quietly)

I hope your right, Will.

FIRES BURN

all over the eagle's nest, turning piles of timber into charcoal. The camp
is a hive of activitycolumns of tribes-people make their way up from the
valley carrying piles of sulfur rock; women and children sit in circles,
pounding the saltpeter into dust. Will moves among the tribal leaders,
watching as they measure and combine the elements in bowls.

Strider sits apart, watching, not sure if the humans have lost their minds.

STRAW MAN FLIES TOWARDS US

He looks like a scarecrow except he's dressed in captured ape armor. Rigged
to a flying fox, he speeds past a rock face. All of the tribes-people are
gathered on the side of a crevasse, watching.

The straw men flies closer - towards a rocky outcrop. Will touches a
burning ember to the ground. We see a flash of flame as a fuse ignites but
we lose it among the rocks. A thin trail of smoke marks its passage.

The tribes-people watch - nothing seems to be happening. Suddenly - just as
the straw man reaches the outcrop -

Ka-boom! A huge explosion. Fire and flying rock hit the straw men.

The tribes-people scream. Terrified, they turn and run. Smoke and dust
obscure the flying fox. Will walks forward to examine his handiwork.

Tribes-people peer out from their hiding places - the smoke and dust clear.
They see the tattered shreds of the straw man hanging from the rope.
Several of the women start to cry in fear.

Will stands on the edge of the crevasse. He turns - Kip, Aragorn and the
other leaders are approaching. They look at him with trepidation.

KIP

You make fire from rocks of the earth -what is this thing?

WILL

Gunpowder.

Kip turns to the others. They repeat the word, as if that will unlock its
mystery.

WILL (CONT'D)

We've still got work to do.

He turns and goes. The tribes-people, emboldened by their leaders, come
closer. They draw back from Will as he makes his way through them. He comes
face to face with Strider. The man and the ape look at one another.

STRIDER

Apes believe men are the devil's children. Maybe they're right. What have
you done, Will - what have you unleashed on the world?

WILL

Nothing, Strider. The future, that's all.

STRIDER

I can't fight with you tomorrow, Will. To kill an ape in a brawl is one
thing, but I can't go to war against my people.

WILL

(kindly)

I never expected you to.

Again they look at one another. Will turns and leaves.

WATER FLYING, HOOVES POUNDING

Drak and his cavalry, pennants flying, gallop along the edge of a river.
Ranks of infantry, followed by horse-drawn supply wagons, travel behind.

The river swings around a point thick with trees. We crane up above the
foliage - a tributary flows clown the other side. Marching through the
shallows is another army of apes. At their head, on a stallion, is Nazgul.

The two squadrons converge at the end of the point. The foot soldiers meld
together, the Praetorian Guard splash ahead, Drak and Nazgul ride side by
side. Ahead, the river and its tributary pour over a broad rock ledge. It's
a natural weir -

THE FORD OF THE THREE RIVERS

A jumble of logs and broken branches lie snagged in the middle of the
river. The Praetorian Guard sweep past them and turn on to the weir.

The Guard spur their horses forward, forcing them through the fast-running
current, crossing to the other side -

IN THE TREES

A shadow of movement. Tribesmen glide through the dappled light of the
forest, almost invisible in skins and camouflage.

Will and Kip stand motionless, deep in shadow. They watch as the Guard on
their horses come thundering across the ford, straight towards them. The
infantry are close behind. Will drops his hand -

TRAILS OF FIRE

whip along the ground - out of the forest and on to the flattened rocks
that form part of the ford. The Guards' horses shy away. The apes look down
in puzzlement -

Boom! Boom! Booml Sections of the weir explode in plumes of rock and water.
Apes are cut to pieces, horses are hurled into the fast-flowing water.

On the far side - Orak's horse rears up. He drives his spurs into its
flanks, trying to control it. Clouds of dust and smoke billow across the
weir, the wounded are screaming - the ape cavalry wheel and turn in
confusion.

Drak plunges forward - chaos all around him. He pounds his chest with both
fists and roars -

DRAK

Apes - chargel

The apes still on their horses hear his cry. They spur their mounts
forward. The first of the cavalry reach -

THE SHORE

Boom... boom! More explosions rip the river bank to pieces.

IN THE FOREST

Batteries of cross-bows are mounted on a series of long wooden frames. The
Eagle leader and his warriors run from one to the other, touching flames to
rope fuses. Fire sizzles towards the crossbows, each one loaded with a
charge -

Bam...bam...bamf The scores of crossbows fire.

ON THE FORD

The ape cavalry are plunging through the smoke and debris. Wham! The hail
of arrows cut them to pieces.

Drak is in the middle of a whirling mass of apes and horses. He looks
through the smoke - into the forest. He sees Will, standing on a rock with
Kip, like a general commanding his army.

Drak bellows with rage. He snaps the reins, about to drive his horse
onward. An arrow flies in from the flank. Whackt It slams into Drak's chest
armor, splintering. He turns -

THE JUMBLE OF LOGS

floats in the middle of the river. The leader of the Rainbow Tribe, water
streaming off of him, kneels on the tangle of trees and branches, reloading
his bow. This is no jumble of logs - it's a firing platform they've
anchored therel

dozen Rainbow warriors, hidden in the water, clamber out of the river. They
kneel next to their leader, drlwing their bows -

THE FORD

Drak watches es I flight of arrows slam into the milling ranks of apes.
Right in front of him, an arrow rips through the throat of the leader of
the Praetorian Guard. Drak turns to Nazgul, yelling -

DRAK

The ones in the river - take themi Nazgul spurs his horse back across the
weir.

ON THE SHORE

Ape cavalry and infantry scramble up the river bank. Bam! They hear the
charges go off - the hurl themselves down. Another volley of arrows scythes
through them -

IN THE FOREST

The Eagle leader and his men work feverishly to reload and recharge the
batteries of crossbows. One of the warriors looks up - terror on his face.

Drak, followed by the remnants of his Praetorian Guard, charge through the
blue haze of gunsmoke - straight towards them.

One of the crossbow batteries fires! Arrows hit his horse's armor but Drak
doesn't falter. Crouched Iow in the saddle, he spins the Gatling gun like a
gunslinger. He locks it under his arm.

The eagle warriors start to break and run. The apes' horses sound like
thunder rolling closer. The Eagle leader and several of his warriors stand
their ground, desperately working to reload.

They spin the battery, sighting straight at Drak's chest. They fire! Arrows
fly -

Drak leaps out of the saddle! He catches hold of an overhanging bough. The
arrows whiz underneath, skimming his butt. He leaps again - higher into the
tree.

The Eagle leader looks up - sunlight sparkles on the leaves. It's dazzling
-

Smash! Drak's sword cleaves through one of the warriors. Drak has dropped
to the ground, right behind them. The Eagle leader turns - too latel
Rat-a-tat-tat! The Gatling gun fires. Arrows shred the Eagle leader's
feathered coat. He crumples to the ground like some fallen bird.

THE FORD

The ape infantry pour across the ford, charging over the bodies of their
fallen comrades.

THE FOREST

Riderless horses, part of the ape cavalry, charge wildly through the trees.
We tilt up - their riders have abandoned them and taken to the trees. The
branches are thick with apes firing, cutting down groups of running
tribesmen.

THE ROCK PLATFORM

Will and several tribesmen hurl camouflage aside revealing a long iron
barrel wedged in the rocks. One of the warriors tilts it up, aiming it at
the trees; another stokes pebbles and scraps of metal into the barrel.

Will touches an ember to a fuse. Everyone dives for cover -

Boom! The primitive cannon fires. The shrapnel hits the trees. Shredded
apes, branches and leaves fall to the ground.

Will and the warriors reload. Again they fire - but the charge is too big.
The whole cannon breaks free of the rocks. It flies like a missile and
smashes into the trunk of a tree. Timber!

A ROCKY GORGE

Its rugged walls are lined with piles of huge boulders. Aragorn and a group
of warriors are fighting hand-to-hand, being forced back by scores of ape
infantry.

Aragorn drives his spear at a huge ape. The point plunges into the animal's
belly, up and under his armor. Blood spurts out from the joins in the
metal.

IN THE TREES

An ape sharpshooter sights down his crossbow - straight at Aragorn. He
fires -

AMONG THE BOULDERS

Wham! The crossbow bolt smashes into Aragorn's shoulder, sending him
reeling. One of the tribesmen turns - it's Kip. He sees Aragorn on his
knees.

Kip wields a sword, fighting his way towards Aragorn. Slash! He takes one
ape across the chest. Whaml Another ape in the neck. He grabs Aragorn and
starts to drag him out of the melee.

IN THE TREES

The ape sharpshooter has Kip in his sights. His finger reaches for the
trigger. He starts to squeeze -

Sswhishl The sound of an arrow. Whackl It buries itself in the
sharpshooter's neck. He falls out of the tree -

HIGH AMONG THE BOULDERS

Will. He stands almost at the top of the gorge, lowering a crossbow. He
looks down at Kip's men - the apes, vastly superior in numbers, are
swarming forward, driving the tribesmen back.

On a ridge below him, four tribesmen scramble away from huge boulder. A
flash of fire then - Ka-bam!

ON THEGROUND

Apes are rushing forward. They hear the explosion. Several apes turn - the
huge boulder, split into chunks, flies towards them. The apes scatter.
Smashl The chunks knock apes aside like skittles.

But there's more of them behind, spilling in to the gorge, over-running it
-

THE DUST FROM THE EXPLOSION

swirls past Drak. He looks up - he sees Will on the ridge, silhouetted
against the sky.

Drak snarls deep in his throat. He wheels his horse and gallops hard
towards a trail that winds up among the boulders.

ON THE RIDGE

Will moves fast along the top of the ridge. He stops - looking down on the
river. On the other side, Nazgul and a platoon of apes unload huge leather
bladders from the wagons and empty them into the river.

Will shades hil ayes - the water glistens with iridescent colors. He
realizes - it's oil.

The current carries it straight towards the platform in the river. The
warriors of the Rainbow tribe - unaware - are still aboard, firing at the
apes on the ford.

Will turns fait - wa whip pan along the shoreline. He sees what he feared -
two apes below him with a fire burning. They slot flaming arrows into their
crossbows -

Will unslings his crossbow, steadies himself and fires -

Ks-whack! The arrow rips through one ape's neck. He pitches forward -
heed-first into the fire. The other ape hurls himself aside, diving for
cover.

Will re-loads. The side of the ape's head is just visible behind a rock. If
Will makes this, it's going to be a helluva shot.

His finger curls around the trigger - right behind him, the sound of
hooves. Will spins

it's Drak charging towards him. He raises the Gatling gun -

Will aims at the big ape's throat and fires.

Drak swerves. The arrow misses his throat but slams into his exposed
forearm. The Gatling gun flies from his hand.

There's no time for Will to re-load - he turns and runs.

Drak charges down on him. He draws a harpoon out of its scabbard.

Will scrambles over a crest - nothing but thin air!

Drak has him square in his sights. He draws back his arm, about to hurl the
harpoon. Will throws himself forward -

THE SIDE OF A CLIFF

Will falls down, down, down.

Drak reins his horse to a halt right at the edge. He looks over - Will
plunges towards the river, flowing fast below the ford.

Splash! Will cannonballs into the water and disappears. Drak stares down,
trying to catch sight of him. Nothing.

IN THE RIVER

A tree branch and other flotsam is being carried downstream by the current.
A pair of hands emerge from the water and grab hold of it. Will's head
follows.

Gasping, catching his breath, he looks upstream - the water pours over the
weir. A flaming arrow arcs through the air. The ape on the shore has done
his job -

THE OIL SLICK

erupts in flames as the arrow hits it. The whole surface of the river is
suddenly transformed into a raging blaze.

The Rainbow leader and his men turn. They see a wall of flame racing
towards them. Several warriors dive into the water, swimming for the shore
-

Whoosh! The flames engulf them. A wall of fire sweeps over the wooden
platform. Like macabre shadows - we see the dancing shapes of the dying
warriors.

IN THE RIVER

The current pulls Will down the river. He looks back - the molten fire
spills over the weir. Anguished screams are carried on the wind. A pillar
of black, oily smoke rises up high into the sky -

THE EAGLES' NEST

The platforms and rocky outcrops are crowded with the women, children and
old folks. Diamond and Strider stand together. All of them stare down at
the river valley. The pillar of smoke rises higher.

WOMAN (O.S.)

They're here!

Diamond turns - the woman is standing on the highest platform. Diamond
follows the direction of her outstretched arm.

A group of warriors, followed by their women-folk and children, are coming
round the mountain path. Their leader wears a golden fur and a head-dress
of auroch's horns. It's the Tribe of the Antelope.

OUTSIDE THE MAIN CAVE

A chorus of chattering voices. The new arrivals are surrounded by members
of their sister tribes. The leader of the Antelope stands in the center,
listening to a woman -Kip's wife. Whatever she's saying is lost in the
hubbub.

ANTELOPE

Quiet!

Instantly, the voices die.

ANTELOPE (CONT'D)

(anxious)

Where?

Kip's wife doesn't answer - she walks forward and points to the pillar of
smoke. The Antelope leader turns to his warriors.

ANTELOPE (CONT'D)

We go - now!

DIAMOND AND STRIDER

stand on the platform, watching several old men lower the drawbridge.
Whack! It locks into place. The antelope warriors cross it and disappear
down a narrow trail.

The rest of the Antelope tribe move towards the cave. Diamond turns away -
then she stops. Something has caught her eye. She stares at the crowd of
women and children heading into the cave.

STRIDER

What is it?

Diamond doesn't answer - she tenses. In the milling crowd of brown bodies,
she sees it again - a flash of gold. It*s sunlight on blonde hair.

DIAMOND

She's here.., holy God - she's herel It's not a woman - it's a child!

She grabs a rope ladder, ignores the rungs and slithers down it.

A YOUNG GIRL

helps her mother set up camp. She is about 10 years old, tawny-haired,
taller and straighter-backed'than any of her people. She looks like us.

Diamond pushes through the women and kids gathered around the hearth. She
stops. The young girl turns. For a moment she and Diamond stare at one
another, separated by a hundred thousand years, but so similar they can
both see themselves in the other.

THE YOUNG GIRL SMILES. DIAMOND RETURNS IT -

DIAMOND

What's your name?

The girl's mother stares, amazed to see someone who looks like her child.

MOTHER

Her name is Aiv.

DIAMOND

Ev?

(Realizing)

Of course. My people have a name like that - "Eve" is how we say it.

The mother nods - the sound seems to please her. Diamond puts out her arms
and indicates the young girl. The mother smiles, giving her permission.
Diamond puts her arms around Eve.

DIAMOND (CONT'D)

(softly)

I've come a long way to find you.

Eve looks at her - wide-eyed, innocent.

EVE

Why?

DIAMOND

To keep you safe.

She holds her tight. The mother catches Diamond's eye.

MOTHER

Do you have children?

Diamond shakes her head - no. The mother can't hide her disappointment.

DIAMOND

What's wrong?

MOTHER

I was hoping you had a son. Aiv's a sweet girl. She's the child of my
heart. But the way she looks, nobody will want her as a mate.

Before Diamond can answer there's a commotion outside the cave. She turns
to look - Strider and tribes-people are running out into the daylight.

SWIRLS OF DUST

rise up from I mountain path. Whatever's causing it is hidden from view by
the peaks and crags. The tribal-people gather on vantage points, watching
it come closer. Strider cocks his head - listening. A shadow of fear passes
across his face.

STRIDER

Horses! It's horses!

Horses mean apesi Panic sweeps through the tribes-people. Women grab their
children, young kids start screaming, old men and boys scramble for
weapons.

Diamond weaves through the flying mass of people. She swings up on to a
platform beside Strider. He points -

Coming into view on the mountain path - running and stumbling, dragging
their wounded - are what's left of the Antelope warriors.

Their women-folk cry out as they realize what has happened to their mates.
The warriors race along the path and across the drawbridge. Nobody raised
it when they left -

Several old men and a couple of boys struggle now to do it. They haul on
the ropes and pulleys. It starts to swing upwards -

Here he comes - Drak! He's galloping hard at the head of his cavalry,
battle scarred and bloodied. He sees the drawbridge starting to lift. He
doesn't pause - he whips his horse into a thundering gallop.

The bridge rises higher. Drak's horse leaps! It soars across the crevasse -
the giddylng drop stretches out below - and lands on the lifting bridge.

The men and boys stare in horror. Orak charges down on them. They back away
-all except one boy, not even in his teens, who stands his ground.

Swish! Drak's sword cleaves him from shoulder to waist. The other tribesmen
run. Wham! The drawbridge falls back into place. The ape cavalry charge
across it.

BROAD WOODEN PLATFORM

An ape horseman flies across the platform. He leaps off the edge, on to a
lower platform. Diamond's right in front of him!

She throws herself aside, grabs hold of a rope ladder and drops onto -

A ROCK SHELF

She looks across the broad area in front of the cave - apes everywhere,
weapons flashing, people screaming.

A young boy tries to out-run an ape warrior - it's Gray Beard. The young
boy hasn't got a chance. Gray Beard lashes out at him with a stock-whip.

It curls around the boy's ankle, tripping him. The boy looks up - he tries
to shield his face. Too late! The horse's hooves smash down -

Diamond looks away, unable to watch. She sees Eve. The young girl is at the
front of the cave, spinning in panic. Her mother runs towards her...

The mother doesn't see Gray Beard galloping towards her. Diamond screams a
warning but it's just one more crv in the commotion.

Gray Beard raises a short-handled lance and hurls it like a javelin. It
hits the mother in the small of the back, straight through the spine. She
pitches forward - dead. Eve screams and runs towards her mother.

Diamond leaps off the rock ledge -

IN FRONT OF THE CAVE

Diamond runs faster than she's ever run, sprinting to grab Eva. Drak wheels
his horse - he sees Diamond. His lip curls back and he smiles - one of the
Blue Eyes! And a woman! He leaps his horse forward -

DRAK

Grab the female!

Gray Beard is off his horse. Diamond runs towards him. He raises a
crossbow...

Drak charges down on her from behind. He holds the harpoon at his shoulder.
He aims at her legs.

Diamond races on - her only thought, to save Eve. It'll never happen -
she's as good as deadGray Beard's in front, aiming. Drak's right behind. He
hurls the harpoon.

Whoosh! Strider swings through the air. He clings to one of the rope
ladders - it's like Tarzan, except he's an ape. He grabs Diamond by the
scruff of the neck and yanks her out of the way.

Drak's harpoon skims past them. Gray Beard stares in amazement at the woman
flying through the air. But that's not his big surprise - with Diamond out
of the way, the harpoon is flying straight at him. He screams as it rips
into his throat.

HIGH ROCK LEDGE

Strider - Diamond clutched under his arm - lands on a ledge high above the
fight. Diamond turns fast and looks back -

IN FRONT OF THE CAVE

Eve crouches over the body of her mother. The woman's mouth is frozen in an
anguished scream, her dead eyes stare straight ahead. Eva shakes her,
desperately hoping for some sign of life. Nothing. Eve starts to cry.

A dark shadow falls across her. She looks up - it's Drak. He reaches down
and grabs her by the neck. He beats his chest with his fist and raises her
up above his head like a trophy.

ON THE ROCK LEDGE

Diamond, anguished, tries to go to the little girl but Strider holds her in
an iron grip. He swings Diamond off her feet, and leaps for an overhanging
branch of a tree. He jumpsfrom the tree to a jagged peak and vanishes from
sight.

CHARRED AND SMOKING WRECKAGE

floats at the shore of the river. It is what remains of the firing platform
- the bodies of several of the Rainbow warriors still on board.

Smoke curls away from the platform and drifts through the forest. The only
sound is the whinnying of a horse - it has a broken leg. Again and again it
tries to get to its feet.

A solitary figure makes his way through the shadows. It's Will, soaking wet
from the river. He stops at the entrance to the rocky gorge and looks at
the carnage all around him. So much for knowledge and science. This is
where the warriors of the tribes made their last stand - their bodies lie
huddled together in a jumble.

Will stares at them, anguish on his face.

WILL

(softly, to himself)

I was so sure...

He kneels and turns one of the bodies over. It's Kip - speared through the
chest. A shaft of sunlight hits the Crescent of Light. It glints on his
lifeless throat. Gently, he closes Kip's glassy eyes.

sound behind him. Will hurls himself aside, grabbing for a weapon. He looks
up -it's the Lookout, battle-stained and weary. Their eyes meet -

LOOKOUT

(quietly)

You said we'd win.

Will just nods - he knows.

LOOKOUT (CONT'D)

You gave us hope - that was the cruelest thing.

The Lookout kneels and crosses Kip's hands across his chest. He reaches
down and removes the Crescent of Light. He turns to Will -

LOOKOUT (CONT'D)

Get the weapons you need. The apes'Il be coming back for their dead. Hurry!

Will arms himself with crossbows and arrows from the bodies.

CLOUDS OF SMOKE

rise into the sky - the eagle's nest is on fire. Drak and his apes make
their way along a narrow mountain trail - they've put the humans' camp to
the torch.

With them is a long line of prisonerswomen and children mostly, many of
them in tears. They carry long poles over which are slung their dead and
dying. We crane, up to -

HUGE ROCK OVERHANG

high up the mountain-side. Standing underneath it, hidden in shadow, are
Diamond and Strider. They look down on the mountain trail. Diamond sees
Eve.

THE MOUNTAIN TRAIL

The young girl stumbles along the road, tied by a length of chain to Drak's
saddle. She's bruised and bleeding, her ankles shackled, barely able to
walk.

THE ROCK OVERHANG

Diamond looks at her, close to tears, but there's nothing she can do. She
watches the convoy wind along the trail.

Boomi The fire must have hit a store of gunpowder - an explosion rips
through the eagle's nest, blowing out the side of one of the peaks. Diamond
watches the dust climb into the sky. All her hopes seem to be going with
it.

IN THE RIVER

It's twilight. Will and the Lookout are wading around a knob of land that
protects one end of a tiny beach.

Will sees a fire burning on the sand, a cave opening off the beach, piles
of stones like burial mounds.

WILL

What is this place?

LOOKOUT

It's called the Crossroads of the Fallen King - it's where our forefathers
are laid to rest. It's sacred to us - anyone who's still alive will make
their way here.

They wade closer to the beach. In the firelight they see groups of
tribesmen -survivors of the battle. Women and children - the lucky few who
managed to flee the eagle's nest - are binding the warriors' wounds.

They look up - everyone falls silent at the sight of Will. As he comes
closer he recognizes a woman, sitting alone -

WILL

It's Kip's wife. She's come from

THE EAGLE'S NEST -

He goes towards her, passing the other tribes-people. Nobody greets him.
They just watch him pass. He stops in front of Kip's wife. Her eyes are red
from crying.

WILL

rm sorry about your mate.

She says nothing - she just stares at him. Will keeps going -

WILL (CONT'D)

I've been to the eagle's nest. I was looking for the woman I was with. We
searched but...

(he pauses)

What happened - was she captured?

KIP'S WIFE

I threw myself off a platform. I don't know what happened to anyone.

Will nods. He gets to his feet and moves to the women near the fire. We
don't hear what he says, but we know what he is asking. One after another
they shake their heads - no, they know nothing of Diamond.

SHAFT OF MOONLIGHT

shimmers on the water. Will sits on a rock that straggles into the water.
His face is grim, his heart heavy with grief. He's making something with
his hands - twisting and turning them - but in the dim light we can't see
what it is.

INSIDE THE CAVE

A shaft of moonlight falls on a semi-circle of rock slabs standing on their
end - it's like Stonehenge. The surviving tribes-people are gathered in
their shadow.

OLD MAN

It's half a day since the battle. Any that survived would be here by now -
we are all that remains of the Seven Tribes. The Ranger himself died on the
field. We must decide ourselves what to do.

Silence for a moment. They have spent too long following a leader for
discussion to come easily. Finally, a wounded warrior speaks -

WOUNDED WARRIOR

Like you say, Kip is dead. Maybe it's a sign -the Rangers have left Middle
Earth forever. Perhaps it's telling us to do the same.

A young woman - probably in her 20s - shakes her head.

YOUNG WOMAN

Leave the valley? This is where the eagles fly. This is their home. Nobody
can live without their totem - we all know that!

LOOKOUT

Nobody can live with the apes eitherl If we stay here, we die. But if we
travel beyond the Tower of the Moon, we've got a chance. Who knows - maybe
our totems will follow us?

There's a murmur of agreement. It grows louder, tribes-people nodding their
heads.

THE BEACH

Now we see what Will has been making - it's a boat made out of twigs and
leaves. A tiny hull and a gaff-rigged mast. He leans forward and drops it
in the water. He watches the current carry it away. Farther and farther it
bobs out into the river -

WILL

(softly)

I'm sorry, Billie. I should have listened - it wasn't our war. All you
wanted was a baby...

He can't go on. He watches the tiny boat disappear around the knob of land.

IN THE RIVER

The current carries the boat past a jagged boulder. An ape's hand reaches
out and picks it up. He lifts it up to look more closely. We see his face -
it's Strider. He turns the toy over in his hand, looking at it quizzically.
He hands it to Diamond, wading along behind him -

STRIDER

It looks like someone made it.

DIAMOND

It's a boat - it's gaff-rigged.

(realizing)

Oh, Jesus...

She plunges forward, wading as fast as she can.

DIAMOND (CONT'D)

Will!

ON THE BEACH

Will is walking up the beach. He stops, listening. He hears it again -his
name! He turns and heads towards the river. He sees Diamond coming round
the headland, splashing through the water.

Will stops. They look at one another - then they both move forward, arms
stretching out. They wrap their arms around each other.

WILL

(softly)

I thought I'd lost you.

DIAMOND

I thought you were dead.

They keep holding each other.

WILL

How did you find this place?

DIAMOND

Strider. His father was a tracker. We've been following a trail for hours.

Will looks over her shoulder - Strider is wading towards them.

DIAMOND (CONT'D)

He saved my life, Will.

Will goes to greet him. The man and the ape embrace.

WILL

Thank you, my friend - thank you.

STRIDER

What did you expect? You would have done the same for me.

SHOWER OF SPARKS

as Will puts a log on the fire. From inside the cave we hear the murmur of
voices as the argument goes back and forth.

Both Diamond and Strider are wrapped in furs - their clothes are laid out
next to the fire, drying. Will speaks to Diamond -

WILL

Some times when we want something so bad, we can take a thing and twist it
in our head. You're sure about this, Billie?

DIAMOND

I'm pregnant, Will - I'm not crazy. She's not like them - she's a mutation.
Evolution's always trying to improve on itself. It's turned out a child
that can walk taller and run faster, one whose brain-pan holds a mind that
can think laterally. I've seen her, Will. I've held her in my arms - she
was us.

Will looks at her. There's no doubt - he believes her.

WILL

You said she was with Drak.

DIAMOND

On a chain.

WILL

It's two days' march to the city. Was she wounded - can she make it?

DIAMOND

She can make it.

(a beat - she looks at him)

Will?

Before he can answer, the Old Man and several others come down the beach -

OLD MAN

It's decided - we're leaving the valley forever.

(turns to Strider)

Your people have won - the Seven Tribes of Middle Earth have been broken.
Long may their spirits haunt you

(he turns back to Will)

You and your mate can travel with u but we've got misery enough to carry.
Our hearth is not home to ny ape.

WILL

Then it's not home to us. The ape's better than any man I've known.

The Old Man's lip curls in a sneer. He shrugs and walks away.

STRIDER

Go with them. Will - everyone needs their own kind.

Will and Diamond newer almost simultaneously -

WILL

No!

DIAMOND

Of course we can't...

(to Will)

The city, Will.

Will and Strider turn nd look at her - incredulous.

WILL

We call it a city - it's more like a fortress, Billie. It can't be done.

DIAMOND

The three of you got out - everyone thought that was impossible too.

WILL

We were lucky. But that's the trouble with luck - it runs out. I don't want
to be back in the city when it does.

DIAMOND

What about Eve - what do we do, just forget about her?

WILL

No. Maybe we can't stop the apes giving her the disease - but they'll have
to turn her loose. That's the only way she can infect others. So we lay a
plan and we find her. Then it's our job to stop her having children. If we
can do that, it can't be passed on through the race.

She shrugs That's the only thing I can think of.

DIAMOND

How long will that take - less than twenty-five days ?

WILL

No.

DIAMOND So what of my child?

We have to face it - you're going to lose it.

She turns away, trying to keep her emotions in check. Will comes to her
side -

WILL (CONT'D)

We can't take our eye off the goal. If we solve this, you can have other
children. Not if wa throw our lives away, though.

DIAMOND

Whose, Will - whose children?

She looks at him. He meets her gaze. A beat.

WILL

guess that's your call.

DIAMOND

What sort of father would you make? You told me once the only thing that
matters is knowledge. That's wrong. Science and technology can only take
you so far - in the end it's our humanity that maners. That's what makes us
great. You're a wonderful scientist, Will -but what sort of person are you?
What would you do if it was your child?

She looks straight into his eyes. Finally he answers. Softly -

WILL

I don't know how to do it - not the humanity part, that's easy compared to
getting into the city. I just don't know...

He picks up a stick and starts to scratch out a rough map on the ground.

WILL (CONT'D)

It sits on a river. There's only one bridge -heavily guarded. Even if we
could cross it, all the ridges and roads are patrolled -

STRIDER

There's one place that's not.

Both Diamond and Will turn to him. He takes the stick -

STRIDER (CONT'D)

Down here - it's called Funeral Rock. It sits at the bottom of the temple.
From there you can make your way into the city. Even so, you still have to
cross the river.

He draws an arrow across the water, illustrating the problem. Diamond is
about to speak but she looks at Will - he's staring at the arrow, an idea,
half formed, is starting to form.

WILL

Maybe there is a way...across the river, I mean.

DIAMOND

How?

Will turns to her -

WILL

You'll love it - there's barely any science to it at all.

DIAMOND

We're going? Is that right - we're going!?

Their eyes meet and hold. He smiles at her.

THREE SILHOUETTES

travel fast along a high ridge. The sun - a fiery disc - rises right behind
them. We recognize their physiques - Will in the lead, then Diamond and
Strider. As they cross the face of the sun, we dissolve to -

LIGHTS TWINKLE

on the buildings and terraces of the apes' city. Will and his two comrades
are on a bluff, looking down. The sound of music and laughter drifts
towards them on the night air. Suddenly a huge tongue of flame shoots out
of a stone chimney.

STRIDER

They've started up the furnace.

(softly)

Let the games begin.

DIAMOND

What games?

WILL

The apes kill their prisoners for sport. The furnace takes care of the
bodies.

Diamond - sickened by it - turns to look at Will. Already he's heading off,
leading them down nrrow trail.

A HIDDEN LEDGE

much closer to the city. Will and the others move fast along it, deep in
the shadows. The river thunders by below them, separating them from the
city. The only way across is the massive iron and wood bridge. Ape guards
patrol it.

Only Diamond pauses to look et it. Will and Strider urge her forward. It
disappears from view.

A STEEL ARROW

flies through the air. Tied to its shaft, trailing out behind, is a rope
made from vines. Will lowers a crossbow. He watches the arrow fly through
the mist and spray -

THE RIVER

races by just below and pours over the Falls of No Return. Whack! The arrow
buries itself in the trunk of a massive tree standing on the bank.

ON THE OTHER SHORE

Will and Strider haul the rope taut and tie it round a tree. It stretches
from one side of the river to the other. All it has to do is hold. Will
turns to Diamond. He shouts to be heard over the roar of the falls -

WILL

You first. We'll be right behind.

Diamond scrambles up on to a rock platform and grabs hold of the rope. She
looks across the riverthe moonlight spills through the wind-blown spray;
the roaring water rushes by; the rope hangs like a thread. There's fear on
her face -

WILL (CONT'D)

You ready?

DIAMOND

It sure as shit ain't Kansas, is it?

WILL

Go!

Diamond throws herself forward. Her feet leave the platform. Hand over hand
she goes - out across the river.

Will watchel for a moment then launches himself - his hands wrap around the
rope.

Strider slings his crossbow over his shoulder and jumps. The line bows
under his weight. Diamond'l feet drop closer to the water. She looks down -
the mass of black water, flecked with foam, rushes past.

Will looks ahead - Diamond is almost lost in flurries of spray. She's
dripping wet, hauling herself forward -

The sound of the Falls is deafening. Right below her, a huge, swirling
"hole" opens up. It's a whirlpool. She starts to swing across it. Joltl

THE TREE TRUNK

The arrow pulls part way out of the tree. The steel shaft shivers but it
holds. Everything seems okay. Suddenly -

Snap! One of the strands of the vine breaks -

ON THE ROPE

Everything bucks and shudders. Diamond screams. She looks down - straight
into the vortex of the whirlpool. Her blood runs cold - she freezes.

WILL SEES HER HANGING MOTIONLESS ON THE ROPE. HE SCREAMS AT HER -

WILL

Go! Billie - go!

She doesn't seem to hear. Her eyes are wide with fear - staring down, down
into the whirlpool's bottomless well.

WILL, TRYING TO GET TO HER, HURLS HIMSELF FORWARD. THE ROPE STRAINS AND
BOWS -

WILL

Move!

She doesn't react. Strider watches as Will tries to catch up. The rope is
swaying so much it's agonizingly slow.

Diamond stares at a huge log spinning down into nothingness. The whirlpool
seems to be swallowing everything, even the moonlight -

WILL (CONT'D)

Billiai What about the baby?!

The word hits her. She pulls her eyes from the swirling death. She looks at
Will.

WILL (CONT'D)

Move, Billiel Nowl

She understands. She starts to pull herself forward. Will slumps with
relief -

ON THE SHORE

The arrow moves another inch out of the trunk. The rope fixed to its shaft
is strained to breaking point. But still everything holds...

THE IRON AND WOOD BRIDGE

One of the guards patrols the bridge. Out of the corner of his eye - flash
of something. He looks towards the Falls.

GUARD

(calling)

Gimla.

The other guard joins him. They peer through the night at the spray rising
from the Falls. They see it again - above the river, a flash of light on
metal.

The keep watching. An eddy of wind clears the mist for a second. They see
Strider going hand over hand along the rope, moonlight glinting on his
crossbow.

ON THE SHORE

Another strand of the rope breaks. We follow it as it unravels - past
Diamond and Will. Before we get to Strider it stops - a section of the rope
is so badly frayed it can't go any farther. It's going to break any moment.

Screech! A siren wails.

STRIDER

They've seen usl Will looks up-river to the bridge. Through a hole in the
mist he sees ape guards pointing and yelling. A whole squadron runs to join
them.

Diamond throws herself forward - she makes the shorel

Will and Strider give it everything they've got. Strider's first hand
passes the frayed section. He's following it with his second -

Snap! The whole rope breaks. Will - closest to the shore - plunges into the
ripping current. But at leaIt he's clinging to the rope with both hands.
Strider's in the water hanging on to the end of the rope by the fingers of
one paw. Will turns and reaches for him.

STRIDER (CONT'D)

No! Save yourselfl

ON THE SHORE

Diamond has grabbed hold of the rope and is trying to pull it in. The
weight - of the men and the current - make it impossible. All she can do is
try and hold them.

ON THE ROPE

Strider's fingers are slipping free. Will grabs him - man and ape, hand to
paw. Will holds him.

STRIDER

We'll both die. Let gol Will shakes his head - no. Hanging on to the rope
one-handed, the current tearing at his body, he tries to haul Strider in.

Whizz! An arrow flies past, just missing them, and plunges into the water.
The apes on the bridge are firing.

STRIDER (CONT'D)

Another minute, we'll both be dead. Do it, Willl

Will tries again to drag Strider to the rope. Another arrow flies through
the mist and spray - even closer. Strider reaches out with his free hand.
He starts to prize Will's fingers loose -

STRIDER (CONT'D)

If nothing else, I made it to the Falls No Return.

Will realizes - nothing is going to stop Strider.

WILL

The sacred words, Strider - what are the words?!

STRIDER

"In the beginning...

WILL

'In the beginning was the word and the word wes God...'

STRIDER

(in wonder)

You know the words?

WILL

You'll walk in the next world, Strider.

STRIDER

How do you know?

WILL

I've seen the future, haven't I?

Strider smiles at him - a smile of perfect peace.

STRIDER

Good-bye Will. Take care of Billie.

He twists Will's last finger free. He drops - the swirling river carries
him away. Will is close to tears, but he won't let himself cry. Two more
arrows sizzle past -

WILL

And the word was God. Yea, though I walk through the valley of death, I
will fear no evil...

Strider spins down the river, through the spray and foam.

WILL (O.S.) (CONT'D)

Surely goodness and mercy shall follow me all the days of my life and I
will dwell in the house of the Lord forever. Amen.

Strider, one arm raised, plunges over the Falls.

ON THE BRIDGE

We see who's been coordinating the firing. It's Drak. Archers are kneeling
on the bridge, trying to sight a target through the foaming water and
clouds of mist.

Drak, never taking his eyes off of the river, draws back the massive spring
of his crossbow and reloads.

ON THE SHORE

Diamond ia hauling on the rope, pulling it in. Will, up to his neck in
water, tows himself along it. His feet find a footing - he starts to
scramble up the bank. Diamond goes towards him -

Just for a moment, the mist clears.

ON THE BRIDGE

moment's long enough. Drak's seen him. In one fluid movement he adjusts his
aim and fires -

ON THE SHORE

Diamond is almost in Will's arms. Sswhack! The arrow rips into WiU's back,
through his ribs. He pitches forward. Diamond screams. He falls into her
arms.

The mist closes around them.

HUGE STONE ARCH

The survivors of the Seven Tribes travel fast along a forest trail. All of
them are burdened down with possessions, weary from the road - they are
leaving the valley.

Kip's Wife and the Old Man are in the lead. They pass through the arch, out
into a clearing. In the middle of it is a fire, shadows camped around it -

Kip's wife and the other survivors stop in fear. One of the shadows rises
from the. fire. Bathed in moonlight - almost ghost-like - he comes towards
them. It's Aragorn!

Kip's wife moves forward and embraces him -

KIP'S WIFE

We thought you were dead.

ARAGORN

Hunted, but not dead. A dozen of us were driven back in the battle -

He indicates his men. They are coming forward, greeting the survivors. The
Young Woman sees her mate - she cries out. They hold each other.

ARAGORN (CONT'D)

For three days a squadron of apes have tracked us. Last night we ambushed
them. We're heading now for the eagle's nest.

KIP'S WIFE

(softly)

There is no eagle's nest.

Aragorn stares at her, not wanting to believe it.

KIP'S WIFE (CONT'D)

We're all that's left of the Seven Tribes.

Grief wells up inside Aragorn. We hold on his face.

A FIRE CRACKLES

All of the tribes-people are gathered around it.

OLD MAN

There is no-one else, Aragorn - you are the Ranger.

ARAGORN

(shaking his head)

No. We must all follow the trail we think best. You've decided yours. For
me * I'll go to the city of the apes and take what revenge I can. I'll go
alone - but like the traveler, I think death will be the only thing I find
there.

OLD MAN

Then it will find us, too. Warriors follow their Ranger. That's always been
the way of it in Middle Earth.

ARAGORN

But nothing's the same now. Think of the women-folk. What will become of
them?

KIP'S WIFE

You're right - there's so few of us now, nothing is the same. You must
allow the women to follow, too.

ARAGORN But women can't fight.

KIP'S WIFE Women have never been allowed to fight. That doesn't mean they
can't.

All the women nod their assent. The men smile, agreeing. Everyone waits for
Aragorn to decide. A beat - then he nods his head and smiles.

The tribes-people start to cheer. The Lookout steps forward. From out of
the folds of his fur, he takes the Crescent of Light. All of the tribe
stare at it.

LOOKOUT

I found it on the battlefield. There were those who said the Rangers had
left Middle Earth forever - I didn't know what to do with it.

He hands it to Aragorn. The whole tribe watches as the proud man once again
ties the talisman of his rank around his neck.

ARAGORN

Douse the fire. The Seven Tribes are going to war.

ON THE SHORE

The apes, carrying torches, search the river bank and surrounding cliffs.
We push in on a pool of darkness behind them -

Will and Diamond hide in a hollow beneath the tangled roots of a huge tree.
They have done their best to dress Will's wound but he's obviously in a lot
of pain -

DIAMOND

You can't go on, Will - not like this.

WILL

What about the baby?

DIAMOND

I'll keep going - I'll try and get Eve.

WILL

Alone? Don't be ridiculous -

He starts to haul himself to his feet. His face twists in pain - he has to
stop.

DIAMOND

Look at you - you can barely walk.

He puts out his hand, needing I boost up.

WILL

If I can just get up - help me.

Diamond shakes her head - no. They look at one another.

WILL (CONT'D)

Don't do this to me - pleasel

DIAMOND

You've done enough - more than anyone else could. You're one of the finest
men

I've ever known - but it's over, Will. You're going to have to wait. Now
it's my turn -

She grabs her weapons and starts to leave. Will makes it to his feet -

WILL

Billie!She's almost through the tangled roots.

WILL (CONT'D)

I made a mistake once - I went on a journey with someone I loved. At the
end, I let her go into danger alone.

Diamond stops.

DIAMOND

Where was that - Berkeley, Will?

She turns and looks at him. He nods his head - yes.

DIAMOND (CONT'D)

What happened?

WILL

I knew I'd found the chemical key. I was working with three young
researchers. One of them was a woman called Ali Conoily. We were engaged.
They were the ones that went into the tanks. I didn't know as much as I
thought I did. They died in there.

DIAMOND

Why didn't you go, Will?

WILL

We all wanted to. It was a great adventure. Wa drew lots for it. I should
never have agreed, but we were young - and like the young we thought life
would last forever.

DIAMOND

Robert Plant died too, didn't he - in a way?

WILL

The experiment was unauthorized. There was an inquiry. They said the theory
had no basis. 'Ludicrous" was a word they used. My career had gone up like
a rocket. It came down like the stick. I couldn't find work anywhere

DIAMOND

"Will Robinson" - that was your joke, I guess. You were Lost in Space, were
you?

WILL

Yeah, but I never realized it'd be so appropriate.

They sort of smile at one another.

WILL (CONT'D)

had twenty years to work out where my research went wrong - so what,
though. It was just a mind game. But I've learnt a lot of things - the most
important is that sometimes you get a second chance. A second chance for a
lot of things -

He looks straight at her. They hold each other's eyes.

WILL (CONT'D)

And when you do, you have to grab it and make sure you never let it go.
I've got the heart, Billie. It's my body that's failing me.

Neither one of them moves. A beat.

DIAMOND

Give me your hand, Will.

She helps him to his feet.

A GIANT CHASM

It's several hours before dawn. In the gloom - whooshl Kip's Wife rides a
flying fox across a precipitous drop.

She lands on the other side of a jagged ravine. The rest of the tribe, all
heavily armed, are waiting there. They turn end run, fading into the trees.

THE FUNERAL ROCK

juts out into the roaring river. Will and Diamond scramble out of the
darkness and land on the rock. Will's face is haggard with pain but he
forces himself forward. He's loosening up. going faster as he moves -

They pass through the huge legs of the stone ape - into the Temple.

A DARKENED ROOM

Torches flicker on the walls. From somewhere close-by - muffled - we hear
the sound of a crowd. A young ape, barely in his teens, stands in the
middle of the room, almost naked. His face is painted with strange ochre
markings.

A circle of ape warriors watch as Ma-Gog lifts a slender blade. Intoning
words in some strange tongue, he slices the blade across the Teenager's
forehead. The Teenager winces but he doesn't cry out - this is his manhood
ceremony.

THE STABLES

The sound of the crowd is much louder here but still we don't see them. The
prisoners from the Eagle's Nest are crowded into the corrals.

One of the gates is thrown open. Three ape guards enter. They push the
tribes-people aside and grab a 12-year old boy. His mother clings to him,
screaming. One of the guards drags her off and they haul the boy out of the
corral.

AN ARENA

-like a small bullring - in the center of the stables. Now we see the crowd
- apes, all males, sit in the bleachers. They roar as a door is opened and
the young Tribe-Boy is pushed into the ring.

He looks around the arena - yelling, screaming apes. Terror on his face. An
even louder roar goes up. The Boy turns -

The Teenage ape steps out of a tunnel, the ochre markings on his face like
war-paint, the blood barely dried on his forehead. He carries spears and a
club.

One of the apes throws a couple of captured human weapons down to the Boy.
The Teenage ape moves in on him. He is a warrior now - this is going to be
his first kill.

IN THE CORRAL

The Boy's mother is huddled down, being comforted by other tribes-people. A
huge roar goes up from the arena as the first blow is struck. The sound
carries over to -

A TERRACE

Drak is alone, walking a high ridge. He stops, looking down on the
twinkling lights. The city is virtually deserted but Drak doesn't move -
he's uneasy, troubled by something he can't put a name to.

THE COOL AND LOVELY ROOM

The five baby apes sit on cots. They watch as Doctor Zora inserts a syringe
into the smallest ape's arm. The baby starts to cry. Doctor Zora comforts
her as she draws out a cup of blood. She turns to her assistant, Ben-Guri

DOCTOR ZORA

Is the girl animal ready?

BEN-GURI

They're doing it now.

INSIDE THE LABORATORY

Eve is struggling and crying as an ape guard carries her towards an
operating table. He and another guard start to strap her down.

The Vet works at the bench, heating a steel needle over a flame. It's the
same sort of catheter that was used on Will - one end of the needle
attached to a long tube. A knock on the door.

VET

That must be Zors with the blood.

One of the guards goes and unbolts the door. He recoils - it's Will.
Sswhack! He fires the first bolt from a double-barreled crossbow. It takes
the guard in the chest.

He and Diamond dive into the room. Eve starts hollering. The second guard
is wheeling, crossbow rising. He rifle-butts Diamond across the head. Her
weapon goes flying.

The guard is aiming. Will is on the floor, tumbling. Barely time to aim, on
his back, firing overhead, he shoots -

Whack! Bullseye. The arrow hits the guard dead in the heed.

The Vet grabs the first guard's fallen crossbow. He aims at Will. Diamond
screams a warning but there's nothing Will can do - he's struggling to
reload, one-handed because of his wounds.

Diamond - unarmed - scoops the red-hot syringe off the bench. The Vet
reaches for the trigger. Diamond leaps forward. She drives the syringe into
his chest.

The Vet stands goggle-eyed. Diamond must have found his heart - a torrent
of blood pours down the clear tube. It spills on to the floor. The Vet
topples forward.

Slash! Slash! Will cuts throughthe straps that tie Eve to the table.

OUTSIDE THE HALL OF LEARNING

Drak turns a corner of the building. He stops and touches the ground with
his finger. He lifts it to his mouth and tastes it. He rises to his feet,
following trail of blood.

A TORCH

is ripped from a bracket. It's Drak.. He shines it down into a stone well.
The flame splits the darkness. Floating in the water at the bottom of the
well is an ape guard -dead, an arrow through his throat.

IN THE ARENA

The Tribe-Boy is sprawled in the dust, bleeding badly from a rip across his
ribs. His spear lies next to him, a wooden shield raised across his head.
The Teenage ape , rains blows down on it with a sword.

The apes in the bleachers are cheering wildly. Smash! The shield splinters.
The sword slices the Boy's arm -

APES

Kill! Kill! Kill!

The Boy stares up - the Teenage smiles and raises his sword.

Shriek! The alarm sounds. Everything freezes. Then officers are on their
feet, yelling orders. Ape soldiers grab their weapons, heading for the
doors.

The Teenage ape looks around, robbed of his moment. The Boy sees his
chance. He raises his spear and drives it deep into the ape's groin. He
staggers and falls - on top of the Boy.

The apes pour out of the arena. The siren carries over to -

A STONE CORRIDOR

Will's got Eve slung over his shoulder. They're stumbling down a corridor -
past other labs and research rooms. They burst through a sat of doors, into
-

A COURTYARD

at the back of the Hall of Learning. It's deep in shadow. From behind they
hear the sound of pounding feet. Will looks around, not sure which way to
go. He glances across a terrace - the doors to the stables fly open. The
ape warriors charge out.

WILL

Can you ride?

Diamond nods her head - yes. He thrusts Eve into her hands -

WILL (CONT'D)

Go for the stables. Head for the eagle's nest. I'll try to join you there.

Diamond hesitates - she doesn't want to leave him.

DIAMOND

What are you going to do?

WILL

Delay them. Now go, Billie. Go!

THE PRIMITIVE ELEVATOR

rops down the side of the ravine. Standing on it are Nazgul and about

THE PRIMITIVE ELEVATOR

a dozen Praetorian Guards. Nazgul looks down - torches and fires in drums
are lighting up the streets and terraces. Ape soldiers are running
everywhere - searching.

ON THE GROUND

The flame-thrower rolls along a street. The driver's canopy is hidden by
flapping tarpaulins. In the chaos nobody pays it any attention.

ON THE ELEVATOR

Nazgul sees the machine rolling towards them.

NAZGUL

That's strange - why does Drak need the Flame?

Suddenly he realizel. He turns, screaming up at the apes controlling the
mechanism.

NAZGUL (CONT'D)

Stopl Take it backl

THE FLAME-THROWER

dead guard is draped over the side of the machine, blood dripping from his
headWill is in the cabin, working the controls. He sees the elevator slow
in mid-descent. He throws a lever forward. For a moment, nothing. Then -

Whoosh! A huge tongue of flame blasts out of the barrel.

Two of the guards are trying to climb the ropes. Nazgul is wheeling around
in a panic. The flame hits them! The whole wooden structure catches fire.
We see the apes through the flames, struggling and writhing.

The ropes burn through. The blazing structure plummets down -

THE CENTRAL SQUARE

Smash! It hits the ground in a shower of blazing timbers and dead apes. Ape
soldiers - standing nearby - stare in shock. The smell of roasted ape fills
the air.

EVE SITS ALONE

She's on the floor of the stables, deep in shadow. She's scared, looking
ahead -

The first weak light of dawn shines through the open doors. We see an ape
guard, keys jangling from his waist, on petrol.

He hears something - a rock falling, a rustle of movement. Raising his
weapon, he moves towards a pool of black shadow, past a pile of rocks, into
an alcove.

Diamond rises out of the rocks behind him. He spins - she's got her
cross-bow raised. Point-blank range. She nails him.

THE PRISONERS

are shackled in the corrals. They see Diamond running out of the shadows
towards them. She tossel them the keys -

DIAMOND

Arm yourselves. Find Will - he needs youl She turns and goes. The prisoners
start to unlock the chains.

EVE

smiles as Diamond races out of the shadows, sweeps her up and keeps
running.

IN THE ARENA

The Teenage ape and the Boy lie where they fell, their spilt blood staining
the dust.

The Boy's mother scrambles over the deserted bleachers and goes to her son.
She drags off the ape. Her son's eyes are closed, his arms lacerated, his
chest wounded and crusted with blood. She stares at him - he doesn't move.

She starts to sob. The Boy's eyes flicker open. They look at one another.
The motheY gathers him into her arms. He's alive! He's alive!

The sound of a horse. The mother turns, fearful. She looks across the
arena, through a railing -

IN THE CORRALS

Diamond gallops a stallion through the corrals. Eve's clutching the saddle
in front of her - hair flying, her eyes sparkling with exhilaration. The
stallion gallops faster.

The prisoners - unchaining the last of their comrades - turn and look. It's
a magnificent sight. Diamond is crouched Iow over the flying horse.
Straight ahead - a railed fence, part of the corral.

She leaps the horse over it. They land. In front - another hurdle. Again
she does it.

The prisoners stare. Diamond charges towards the open doors of the stables.

CLOUDS OF SMOKE AND FLAME

The crashed elevator hal set the surrounding buildings on fire. Ape city is
burning.

The Flame stands on a steep incline, its back wedged against the wall of a
terrace. Whooshl Fire shoots out of its barrel as Will keeps a horde of ape
soldiers at bay.

The soldiers turn - Drak, surrounded by the Praetorian Guard, gallops
straight towards them. He'l not stopping for anything - the soldiers
scramble aside.

IN THE CABIN

Will sees Drak and the guards appear through the swirling clouds of smoke.
They look like the horsemen of the apocalypse. As Will throws the lever we
sea a primitive gauge above his head. It's in the red -

IN THE SQUARE

Whoosh! The tongue of flame shoots through the smoke. It touches the guards
with a deadly kiss, throwing them screaming from their horses. But Drak
blasts through -

IN THE CABIN

Will is engulfed in a backdraft of black oily smoke. He peers through it -
Drak charges towards him! Will hits the lever again. The flame erupts from
the barrel. Then it dies - out of fuel.

WILL

Shit!

IN THE SQUARE

Drak gallops forward. He raises weapon - a shoulder-mounted harpoon. He
aims -

IN THE CABIN

Will throws himself aside. He smashes both hands down on a lever on the
floor. A hiss of steam. The machine lurches forward -

IN THE SQUARE

Drak tries to get a clear shot at Will. The machine gathers speed down the
incline, coming straight towards Drak. He veers his horse aside and wheels
around. He charges alongside the cabin - it's empty

ON THE MACHINE

Will clings to the outside of the Flame as it roars across the smoke-filled
square. He's out of sight of Drak - but not for long. The ape and his
stallion loom into view behind the machine, Will scrambles back into the
cabin -

IN THE SQUARE

Apes are scattering as the runaway machine flies across the square. Drak is
at full gallop, veering from one side of the Flame to the other. Will
clambers back and forth - cat and mouse at full tilt.

Drak swings his horse close to the back of the machine. He stands up in the
stirrups, the harpoon clamped to his shoulder - he's going on board!

The Flame flies out of the square and down a street. An ape throws himself
into a doorway - just in time, Drak steadies himself, about to jump.
Suddenly his horse whinnies wildly. Drak looks ahead - holy shit!. They're
heading straight for the front of a blazing house.

Drak throws himself down into the saddle and hauls on the reins. Will hurls
himself back into the cabin, arms shielding his head. Smash! The Flame
crashes through the front wall -

INSIDE THE HOUSE

The barrel of the Flame acts like a battering ram - it blasts through the
walls in a shower of burning timbers. It crashes through the kitchen and
stops in a courtyard.

Will clambers out of the cabin and drops to the ground. A yell goes up -
apes are coming through the adjoining houses. Will turns and heads down an
alleyway.

CITY STREET

Diamond's horse flies down a street - a high terrace towers on one side, a
row of burning buildings on the other. The road turns right. She swings
around it - apes! A platoon of them right in front of her. She screams at
Eve -

DIAMOND

Hold on!

She throws herself aside, pulling on the reins. The horse spins in a
U-turn, grazing past a burning building. Diamond gallops back the way she
came.

Crash! The wall of a burning building in front of her collapses. Blazing
beams block the road. The horse shies away. Diamond wheels him around -

The apes race into the road. She looks around desperately - she's trapped.
She grabs Eve and awingl her onto the saddle behind her - she'll be safer
there.

She spurs the horse forward and crouches Iow in the saddle - she's going to
charge straight through the apes. They drop to one knee - the firing
position - and raise their weapons. A dozen crossbowl aim straight at
Diamond.

There's no way out - she flies towards them. Whizzl The sound of arrows.
But it's not the apes - they go down like nine-pins.

Diamond looks up - Aragorn has arrived! Backlit by the rising sun, the men
and women of the Tribes are pouring volley after volley into the apes.
Nobody fires better than Kip's Wife.

Diamond leaps the horse through the dead and dying apes and turns down the
road.

MA-GOG

stands on a terrace, his cloak blowing in the wind, his one cruel eye
blazing with anger. Flanked by two ape warriors, he looks down on the
burning buildings.

The freed prisoners are waging a pitched battle outside the stables.

Ma-Gog sees Will - he's running along the rooftops, leaping from one
building to the next. Ma-Gog points at him, yelling at apes in the streets
below -

MA-GOG (CONT'D)

Kill him! In the name of God, kill himl Sswhish! The blade of a sword
cleaves through frame. It cuts one of the ape warriors from neck to waist.
Ma-Gog spins - it's Aragorn, armed to the teeth, behind them.

The second warrior goes for him. Aragorn has dropped the sword. He raises a
crossbow and fires. The bolt shatters the ape's armor and buries itself in
his chest.

Ma-Gog swirls aside his cloak. In his good hand he holds a double-edged
sword. Aragorn drops the crossbow ands ducks beneath Ma-Gog's arcing blow.
He lunges with a short-handled spear -

ARAGORN

For my people!

It takes Ma-Gog in the gut. His one eye bulges. Aragorn rips the spear out
-

ARAGORN (CONT'D)

And this - for my daughterl He drives the spear into the High Priest's
heart. The cruel eye flickers and dies.

ON THE ROOFTOP

Will has seen it all. He screams -

WILL

Behind you! Aragorn - behind!

ON THE TERRACE

Aragorn turns. It's Drak, on horseback, thundering down on him. But the
leader of the Seven Tribes knows no fear - only the memory of his lost
child.

He raises his second spear and charges straight at Drak. The huge ape
levels the shoulder-mounted harpoon. He pulls the trigger. Sswang! The
powerful spring on the barrel releases, the harpoon trails a length of rope
behind it -

Wham! The harpoon smashes through Aragorn's chest. He dies as he falls.

ON THE ROOFTOP

Will stares in anguish. He turns away - he sees Diamond. She's at full
gallop - Eve clinging to her back - charging along a road several terraces
below. She's got a clear run for the iron bridge and freedom.

Will looks across at Drak - he's seen her too! For a moment the two of them
stare at one another. Will's face is drawn and haggard from the injuries he
carries.

Drak's lip curls in a sneer - he knows he's going to win. He beats his
chest with his fists and spurs the stallion over the edge of the terrace,
going for Diamond.

Will runs as fast as his body will let him - along the rooftop.

INSIDE A HOUSE

An ape mother cowers in a corner, her two children clutched to her, the
sounds of battle all around. She looks up in terror -

Smash! Will's feet blast through the roof. He lands on the floor, crossbow
raised -but not st her. Framed in the front doorway is an ape warrior on
horseback. Wham! Will shoots him and runs for the horse.

DIAMOND

and Eve fly down charred street .They head towards a large open square.

OUTSIDE THE STABLES

Smoke and dust swirl through the air. The freed prisoners are fighting ape
infantry. Drak races past the battle. The rope from the harpoon is tied
around the saddle, dragging Aragorn's body through the dust.

He looks ahead - Diamond gallops across the square. Drak whips his horse
forward -

A CURVED ROAD

on a high terrace. Flying around a corner - Will! His coat is billowing,
the horse's mane streaming in the wind. He hits the straight-away and
gallops even faster.

He looks down on the road below - Diamond is ahead but Drak is gaining on
her. Will plunges into a tunnelhewn out of rock.

ON THE ROAD

Eve clings tight to Diamond's waist. The little girl looks back - Drak is
thundering behind them, pennants snapping in the wind, armor glinting on
the horse's chest. It's an awesome sight.

Drak has the reins in his teeth. He's using both hands to reload the
harpoon.

Diamond sees the bridge dead ahead. Heavily armed apes have barricaded it.
She curses and yanks the bridle. The horse sweeps around an island in the
center of the road - a huge monument to some dead ape. She gallops back the
way she came, almost passing Drak. He charges round the island.

OUT OF THE TUNNEL

comes Will. He looks down to the lower road - Diamond and Drak are coming
back towards him! He turns the horse around - back into the tunnel.

Whooshl He flies out the other end, into daylight. He looks over his
shoulder - he's in front of them but thirty feet too high. He digs his
heels into the horse's flanks -over a Iow wall they fly. God knows where it
goes -

DOWN A ROCKY SUDE

into a dead-end cul-de-sac just above the roadway. Apesi Two of them are
guarding the Claw and the Bells. Will fires from the shoulder - he drops
the first ape.

The second ape aims at him. Will raises another crossbow. They fire almost
simultaneously. Will throws himself aside, out of the saddle. The horse
rears and bolts.

Will looks up from the dirt - the ape has Will's arrow embedded in his
chest. He falls forward - dead.

Will scrambles to a parapet and looks down on the road just below. Diamond
and Eve - clinging to the horse for dear life - race towards him. Will
grabs a crossbow and struggles to reload. He can't - it takes the strength
of both arms to cock it,

ON THE ROAD

Diamond's horse is lathered in sweat, almost blown. Eve looks over her
shoulder, her eyes wide with fear - Drak is close behind, gaining at every
step.

IN THE CUL-DE-SAC

Will leaps from the Balls on to the Claw.

ON THE ROAD

Drak swings the harpoon on to his shoulder. He sights down the barrel. Eve
sees the weapon lock on to their backs. She screams a warning et Diamond -

EVE

Billie!

Diamond leaps the horse over a charred wagon abandoned on the road. Drak
loses her in his sights. He follows her over the wagon.

ON THE CLAW

Will is in the driver's seat. He throws a lever - nothing happens. He tries
another -the long jib that supportl the two iron jews swings towards the
road.

DRAK

aims the harpoon. He's got Eve end Diamond, one behind the other, in his
sights.

DRAK

A bargain - two for the price of onel

ON THE CLAW

Will spins a small steering wheel.

ON THE ROAD

Drak is close behind Diamond. The harpoon's massive spring is coiled.
Drak's finger curls around the trigger, about to fire.

Suddenly he screams - dropping right in front, coming straight towards him,
are the opening jaws of the Claw.

WILL JERKS BACK ANOTHER LEVER -

WILL

Keep your hands off her, you dirty ape.

The jaws lock clean around Drak's waist, plucking him off the saddle and
lifting him up into the air. He's still got the harpoon. He sees Will at
the control. He swings the barrel round -

Will hits a switch. Wrong one - nothing happens.

Drak's got him in his sights. His finger finds the trigger -

Will throws another switch.

The jaws start to close! Drak tries to pull the trigger - he can't, his
body is twisting. The jaws are crushing him! He musters all of his strength
and tries to fire. He and Will look straight at one another. A beat. Drsk's
finger starts to slide off the trigger -

IN THE SQUARE

Apes stare up at their warrior lord, clamped in the Clew. He let out a
blood curdling scream. The bottom half of his torso - everything from the
waist down - falls towards the ground. Maybe it's just the wind, but the
legs still seem to be kicking.

The apes reel beck in horror. With mighty battle cry, the tribes-people -
the prisoners end Aregom'l followers - hurl themselves forward, attacking.

The apes break end start to run.

ON THE ROAD

Diamond end Eve have dismounted. Diamond stumbles forward - Will is coming
towards her. She holds out her arms and they embrace. Neither one says a
word, they just hold each other tight.

CLOUDS OF SMOKE

almost obscure the setting sun. Will and Diamond stand on the iron bridge
watching the tribes-people. They've harnessed horses to ropes tied around
the statues on the avenue of idols - one after another the stone monoliths
come crashing down.

DIAMOND

If nothing else, we helped the tribes take back their valley.

WILL

Our valley, too Billia.

She looks at him - questioning.

WILL (CONT'D)

There's one thing I never told you - I never worked out how to get back.

She smiles at him.

DIAMOND

A small point. But give me some credit. I'm a scientist - I knew that.

WILL

(in wonder)

But you came anyway.

DIAMOND

That was love.

WILL

For the baby?

She shakes her head.

DIAMOND

For the both of you.

They stare into each other's eyes. They kiss.

DIAMOND (CONT'D)
I only have one regret. We'll never know if we succeeded.

WILL
Of course we will. You're pregnant - if the baby's born alive, we'll know
it worked.

SUNLIGHT GLISTENS ON THE OCEAN

The surf rolls in on a golden beach. At the water's edge, a line of
footprints. We follow them to find Will on top of a rocky cliff. He's
building something out of iron and rock and sand but we can't make out what
it is.

DIAMOND (O.S.)
Will 

He turns and runs to the mouth of a large cave.

INSIDE THE CAVE

Diamond lies on her back on a pile of animal skins. Her belly is exposed,
heaw with the unborn child. Eve crouches next to her, trying to help.

WILL
It's started?

She nods her head then grimaces with pain as another contraction starts.

THE SUN IS SETTING ON THE SEA

From inside the cave, we hear Diamond scream.

IN THE CAVE

Will kneels between Diamond's legs. Her face, glistening with sweat; is a
mask of pain. She holdl Eve's hind tight and pushes.

Will, half hidden by her upraised legs, delivers the child. Diamond raises
herself up -trying to See her child. Neither she nor us can see it's face.

We push in on Will. Ha raises his hand and slaps the baby's rump. No sound.
Ha raises his hand again - suddenly the baby starts to cry. Now we see the
baby - a perfect little boy.

Eve laughs. Diamond smiles. Tears fill her eyes. She and Will look at one
another. He comes towards her and tenderly places the baby in her arms.

THE CAVE

Will and Eve help Diamond. She comes out of the cave, still holding the
baby. It's magic hour - they stand on a rock ledge, looking at the ocean
washed with color from the setting sun.

We see what Will was building. It's sort of like a sculpture - just the
head and crown of the Statue of Liberty.

Diamond smiles. She looks at him, wondering why -

WILL
It's to make sure we never forget where we came from.

The baby starts to cry. Will puts one arm each around Diamond and Eve.

We pull back from them - high up into the stars. The baby's cry carries
over. We see earth rise. In all this nothingness - life.
RISE OF THE PLANET OF THE APES

          EYES. Expressive, alive. Human?
           No. They belong to a FEMALE CHIMPANZEE: BRIGHT EYES.

          EXT. GROVE OF TREES -- DAY

          She sits in a tree with ALPHA, her mate - large and muscular,
          a PROMINENT WHITE BIRTHMARK ACROSS HIS SHOULDER, LIKE A

          SHOOTING STAR.
          Around them, under the TREE CANOPY, a COMMUNITY OF
          CHIMPANZEES naps, eats, plays.

          EXT. WEST AFRICAN JUNGLE - DAY

          A DOZEN POACHERS on horseback slog through the jungle.
          They're working towards the GROVE, visible in the distance.
          As they near it, the LEADER points, sending the MEN moving
          quietly, NETS and RIFLES ready.

          EXT. CANOPY - DAY

          Alpha sits up, sensing something. BIRDS take sudden flight.
          He stands on the branch and YELLS OUT A WARNING. FEAR
          ignites the community - but too late.
          POACHERS BURST INTO THE CLEARING, horses' hooves kicking up
          dirt. CHIMPS SCATTER.
          Bright Eyes wants to stay by Alpha's side, but he bares his
          teeth and sends her off.
          Then he drops, landing firmly on the clearing floor. All
          around him, POACHERS pursue terrified apes, nets swinging.
          MALE CHIMPANZEES jump up and down, SHOUTING AND SCREECHING -
          an aggressive show. A futile attempt to protect the tribe.
          Alpha zeroes in on a POACHER attempting to scoop up a YOUNG
          CHIMP. He streaks across the clearing, KNOCKS THE POACHER

          FROM HIS MOUNT.
          Alpha POUNDS his CHEST, letting out a BATTLE CRY -- trying to
          rally a counter-attack.
          But the other chimps pay no heed. There's no organization to
          the defense. It's chaos.
          SHOTS RING OUT. The Chimps mauling the Poacher drop, one by
          one. Others take off.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          2.
          Alpha spots Bright Eyes across the clearing, dragged off in a
          net. He RUSHES to save her, leaps in the air...

          A SHOT RINGS OUT.

          BRIGHT EYES WATCHES - HORRIFIED - AS ALPHA CRUMPLES IN THE

          AIR AND FALLS TO THE GROUND. LIKE A STONE.

          FADE TO WHITE
          TWO FACES wearing SURGICAL MASKS lean in and peer down at us.
          FRANKLIN - broken horn-rimmed glasses - and CAROLINE - curly
          red hair under a sterile cap.

                         CAROLINE
          Nanotherapy, beta version: Tuesday,
          March 10, 2011. Female Test
          subject Number four.
          Franklin reaches for us, smiles...

                         FRANKLIN
          Here we go, Bright eyes.
          A MIST fogs our view for a moment.

                         CAROLINE
          Not too much. She needs to be
          calm, but alert.

          VOICE THROUGH INTERCOM
          Go ahead - send her through.
          A LOUD HUM and we start moving, sliding into a tunnel a
          tubular CT SCAN - with a MIRROR on the top.
          Now WE SEE OUR FACE REFLECTED: A FEMALE APE IN A GAS MASK.
          Bright Eyes.

          INT. OBSERVATION ROOM - SAME

          WILL RODMAN - late twenties, lab coat over a T-shirt and
          jeans - stands at the glass, watching the terrified
          chimpanzee slide into the machine.
          The focus in his eyes belies the casual dress.

                         WILL
          Start the scan.
          A TECHIE sits at a computer screen beside Will.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          3.

                         TECHIE
          Scanning.

          INT. WHITE ROOM -- DAY

          Another tech, DONNIE - skinny, tattooed - controls the
           machine, sending the restrained animal into the scanner.
          Caroline moves to an IV STAND beside the scan. The bag's
          full of a PHOSPHORESCENT GREEN LIQUID.

                         DONNIE
          Stuff looks like Kool-aid.

                         CAROLINE
          Go ahead, I'm sure you could use
          it.

                         (OPENING VALVE)
          Starting the therapy...

          INT. OBSERVATION ROOM - SAME

          Will looks at a monitor showing the BRAIN SCAN OF THE CHIMP.
          The image starts to shake. Concerned, he looks to the other
          room - where he can see the CHIMP'S LEGS SHAKING IN THEIR

          RESTRAINTS.

                         FRANKLIN
          She's convulsing.
          Caroline sticks a stethoscope in the tube, listens to Bright
          Eyes' heart.

                         WILL

                         (INTO INTERCOM)
          Please keep the monkey still.
          He focuses back on the monitor.

                         CAROLINE (INTERCOM)
          She's not a monkey.
          Will looks from the monitor to Caroline. His look is
          intense, tough to read. She blushes slightly at the heat of
          his gaze.

          CAROLINE (INTERCOM) (CONT'D)
          She's an ape. Chimpanzees,
          gorillas and orangutans, they're
          all apes.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          4.

                         WILL
          Good to know. Just keep it from
          moving.
          She's stung, wonders, why does he have to be such a jerk
          sometimes.
          He's oblivious to this, instead intent on getting the scan
          right. The green liquid moves through the chimp's neck...

                         TECHIE
          Here we go.
          Will stares at the scan, his eyes willing the test to
          succeed.. .the green liquid LIGHTS UP THE CHIMP'S BRAIN.

          CHEER FROM THE GROUP.
          Will fights a CONTRACTION OF EXTREME EMOTION that passes
          across his face. He quickly hides it - offers up a smile for
          the others.

                         WILL
          We're on our way.

                         (BEAT)
          Good work.

          INT. WHITE ROOM - DAY


                         CAROLINE
          What is this?
          Caroline holds up a picture of a tree for Bright Eyes, who
          sits at a table in front of a LEXIGRAM, a lit-up board with
          colorful symbols.
          Bright Eyes presses a button.

                         ELECTRONIC VOICE
          Tree.

          SUPER: "ONE MONTH LATER."
          Caroline holds up a picture of an acorn.

                         CAROLINE
          And this?
          The chimp presses another button.

                         ELECTRONIC VOICE
          Acorn.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          5.

                         CAROLINE
          Where does the acorn come from?
          Bright Eyes considers... then presses a button.

                         ELECTRONIC VOICE
          Acorn.

                         CAROLINE
          Yes, but where does the acorn come
          from?

                         ELECTRONIC VOICE
          Acorn.

                         CAROLINE

                         NO -
          Bright Eyes interrupts, now pressing three buttons.

                         ELECTRONIC VOICE
          Acorn. Tree. Acorn.
          The chimp looks at Caroline, who's stunned, trying to process
          the ADVANCED THINKING JUST MANIFESTED. Then she presses
          another button.

          ELECTRONIC VOICE (CONT'D)
          Surprise.
          The unnatural voice - paired with Bright Eyes' eerily human-
          like gaze - is somehow CREEPY... The IMAGE FREEZES and we...

          PULL BACK TO REVEAL: WILL'S OFFICE
          Diplomas on the wall, books everywhere. Bright Eyes looks
          out at Will from a computer screen. He's got two CT SCANS
          sitting on the desk in front of him.

                         CAROLINE
          We started the therapy four weeks
          ago. This was yesterday.
          Will's studying the scans. They look good. Real good.

                         CAROLINE (CONT'D)
          There's been clear cell growth.
          Both on the frontal lobe and the
          neocortex.
          She's purposely standing close in order to point this out.
          He notices but doesn't respond - there's history between them
          and he's regretting that - gets in the way.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          6.

                         WILL
          I see that. But I don't understand
          the primate behavioral norms. She
          knows an acorn's a seed. Wouldn't
          any monkey know that?

                         CAROLINE
          No - it's conceptual. Acorn gives
          us a tree, which gives us an acorn.

                         WILL
          Abstract thought...

                         CAROLINE
          In a chimpanzee. Unheard of.
          Will turns the possibilities over in his mind. Caroline
          moves away from him. He barely notices her now.

                         CAROLINE (CONT'D)
          You're calling her a monkey just to
          piss me off, aren't you?

                         WILL
          Start the other's on the 112.

                         (BEAT)
          And double this one's dose.

          EXT. GEN-SYS LABORATORIES - DUSK

          Will climbs into his truck. Alone, he allows his excitement
          to show. Abstract thought!
          He pulls away from the BIO LAB, which is tucked in a corner
          of an old military base.

          EXT. GOLDEN GATE BRIDGE - DUSK (AERIAL)

           Will drives over the majestic Golden Gate Bridge.

          EXT. WILL'S HOUSE - NIGHT

          Will pulls up in front of his house.
          Set in a hillside neighborhood, it's neat, nondescript. The
          home of a bachelor who hasn't given it much thought.
          As Will pulls into the driveway, WE HEAR C SHARP PLAYED OVER

          AND OVER ON A PIANO.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          7.

          INT. WILL'S HOUSE - NIGHT

          WALTER RODMAN, 60, sits at the piano dressed in a robe,
          stabbing at the key with his finger.
          Will enters, his posture almost visually changing with the
          emotional weight of this man, his father.

                         WILL
          Hey Dad.
          Walter looks up, whispers...

                         WALTER
          John... is that you?

                         WILL
          It's me. Will.

                         WALTER
          As thou dost, Anthony.
          (staring at the keys)
          .he hears no music. No music...

                         VOICE
          (heavy Russian accent)
          He's been doing that all day.
          A Home Aide enters, grabs her coat. This is IRENA.

                         IRENA
          He found an old book of his.
          She pulls a worn paperback of Julius Caesar from Walter's
          pocket. He snatches it from her, puts it back.

                         IRENA (CONT'D)
          (shrugging on coat)
          I had no idea you liked Shakespeare
          so much, Mr. Walter.

                         WILL
          My mother was the one. She liked
          Shakespeare...

                         IRENA

                         (KISSES HIM)
          Good night, Walter, hone-ee.
          She heads out. Will gently takes his father's arm.

                         I WILL
          Come on, Dad.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          8.

          INT. WALTER'S ROOM - NIGHT

          Will helps his father change into pajamas.

                         WILL
          Remember I told you we were using
          Basic Fibroblast Growth Factors on
          the apes? Well the therapy seems
          to be working. We've seen definite
          signs of adult brain neurogenesis.
           Walter holds up his arms for Will to slide on the pajama top.

                          WILL (CONT'D)
           Board of Directors is coming in a
           couple weeks to talk about Phase 2 -
          that's clinical trials.
          Walter gives no hint he's even listening, much less
          understanding what Will's saying.

                         WILL (CONT'D)
          Human trials, Dad. Soon.

                         WALTER
          I rather tell that what is to be
          feared than what I fear: for
          always... I am Caesar...
          There's no way to reach him tonight. Still Will tries..

                         WILL
          I'm going to make you better - I
          swear it.
          His father looks at him. A moment of recognition?

                         WALTER
          John... ?

                         WILL

                         (DISAPPOINTED)
          No, Dad, it's me. Will.
          Will helps the old man under the bedcovers.

                         WILL (CONT'D)
          John's gone.
           He moves to the door, pausing to take in the diplomas on the
          walls - Walter's name on all of them. (Physics, Astronomy.)

                         

                         

                         

                         

          9.
          Will looks at his father lying there on his back, staring up
          at the ceiling. The once brilliant man now slipping away.

          INT. WILL'S STUDY - LATE NIGHT

          It's late. Signs of a half-eaten frozen dinner on the desk
          beside numerous papers, charts, and Will's computer.
          He looks exhausted, gulps from a cup of coffee as he works.

          INT. PRIMATE LAB - DAY

          Franklin moves from cage to cage, greeting the apes.

                         FRANKLIN
          Good morning, Felix. Bam Bam.
          Monty. Hey - what's the matter,
          don't like my cooking?

          SUPER: TWO WEEKS LATER
          He pauses in front of Bright Eyes, huddled at the back of her
          cage.

                         FRANKLIN (CONT'D)
          You okay back there?

                         CAROLINE
          Something wrong with Bright Eyes?

                         FRANKLIN
          I'll check on her when we're done.
          Franklin unlocks a cage and leads a CHIMP - LUCKY - into the
          next room, where Caroline waits beside the CT scanner.
          Lucky's head is shaved, exposing a long, curving scar on his
          cranium.
          From Bright Eyes' vantage point she can see through the open
          door as Lucky's strapped down.

          EXT. GEN-SYS GROUNDS - SAME

          Will - dressed in an ill-fitting suit off the rack, hair
          brushed in an attempt at neatness - meets STEVEN JACOBS as he
          steps from a beautiful BLACK JAGUAR.

                         JACOBS
          You could at least try to look
          excited.

                         0

                         

                         

                         

                         

          10.
          Will's too nervous to look excited. He eyes the FOUR SUITS
          disembarking from nearby TOWN CARS.

                         WILL
          I'm not good with this stuff.
          Jacobs puts a hand on Will's back, leads him inside.

                         JACOBS
          You'll do fine. Just speak
          English. Keep the science simple.

          INT. LAB - SAME

          From the back of her cage, Bright Eyes watches through the
          open door as the ape on the table convulses.

                         CAROLINE
          Okay. Back it out...

                         DONNIE
          Your turn.
          Bright Eyes RUSHES FORWARD, HER HANDS GRIPPING THE BARS SO

          DONNIE CAN'T OPEN THE CAGE.

                          DONNIE (CONT'D)
          C'mon - Let go -
          She understands what he wants but she won't do it. THAT'S

          WHEN HE NOTICES: HER HANDS ARE BLOODY.

                         DONNIE (CONT'D)
           Hey! Something's wrong with number
          four!
          Franklin looks over - he's still dealing with Lucky on the
          table...

                         FRANKLIN
          Be right over -
          Donnie looks closely at Bright Eyes. There's something
          different in her face today. Rage? Force of will?

                         DONNIE
          What's the matter with you?

          INT. BOARDROOM - SAME

          Will stands at the head of a table. A BIG PLASMA SCREEN
          behind him shows a BLOW UP OF A BRAIN SCAN. As Will speaks,
          he gestures at it with a LASER POINTER.

          large subcortical regions of the
          brain...

          INT. LAB - SAME

          Donnie and Bright Eyes are at a standoff. Once more he tries
          to open the cage, once more she yanks it shut.
          Again he tries... and is taken by surprise when SHE GRABS HIS

          HAND AND PULLS IT THROUGH THE BARS.

                         DONNIE
          Hey!!!
          Now Donnie's smashed up against the bars. Hard. The other
          apes begin to SCREECH.
          Donnie hasn't panicked quite yet, but he's about to.

                         DONNIE (CONT'D)
          Someone get her off of me!

                         CAROLINE
          Hang on -
          Franklin struggles to hold onto Lucky as Caroline hurries
          over. He eyes the chimps in their cages - GOING CRAZY.

          INT. BOARDROOM - DAY

           Will continues his presentation. Stevens looks around at the
          board members - they're lost.

                         WILL
          In the past, it's been impossible
          to target specific areas, both
          because of the Blood Brain Barrier -
          Jacobs stands, interrupting Will.

                         JACOBS
          What Dr. Rodman has done is to
          invent a virus that can, for the
          first time, cross the membrane that
          protects the brain and deliver a
          genetic, therapeutic, payload.

                         WILL
          (trying to sell)
          This 'payload' would directly
          affect the areas of memory, higher
          function - and, of course, the
          motherlode: intelligence.
          The board members stare, trying to comprehend.

                         BOARD MEMBER
          Meaning?

                         WILL
          Meaning.
          (deep breath here)
          If Phase 2 goes as planned, we're
           looking at a cure for Alzheimer's.
           With an elbow prompting from Jacobs, Will takes a SAMPLE VIAL
           from his jacket pocket and awkwardly holds it up for dramatic
          effect.

          INT. LAB - DAY


                          DONNIE
          She's breaking my hand!

                         CAROLINE
          Let go, Bright Eyes! You're
          hurting him!
          She tries to help pull Donnie away.

                         CAROLINE (CONT'D)
          Let go!
          In the next room Franklin's having troubles of his own.

          LUCKY - RILED UP FROM THE COMMOTION IN BRIGHT EYES' CAGE AND

          THE SCREAMING FROM THE OTHER CHIMPS - BREAKS AWAY.

          HE CRASHES OUT OF THE LAB, DRAGGING HIS LEASH.

                         FRANKLIN
          Lucky no! Stop!

                         (TO CAROLINE)
          Hit the alarm!
          Caroline lunges to an ALARM BUTTON and pounds it.

          DONNIE'S SCREAMS BECOME OTHERWORLDLY AS WE GO TO...

          INT. LAB SECURITY ROOM - SAME

          LOUD BEEPING as two GUARDS look to a BLACK AND WHITE SCREEN
          of a corridor. They see Lucky dragging his leash as he
          scampers - unattended - down the hall.

                         GUARD #1
          Uh oh.
          Guard #2 turns to another screen - where DONNIE IS VISIBLE IN

          SILENT AGONY, PUSHED UP AGAINST THE CAGE, CAROLINE TRYING TO

          GET HIM FREE.

                         GUARD #2
          Hey, Len...?
          Bright eyes is pulling Donnie's arm right from its socket...
          Donnie falls to the floor at Caroline's feet...

          EXT. GEN-SYS GROUNDS - DAY

          Lucky BURSTS from the lab building and runs across the
          grounds. He leaps over a car, then heads for the nearest
          building.

          INT. BOARDROOM - DAY

          The room is still thrumming with the excitement of Will's
          pronouncement.

                         BOARD MEMBER
          What about the safety of the virus?

                         WILL
           Perfectly safe. We're using the
          most stable -
          A COMMOTION outside. Someone SCREAMS.
          Then a BLACK BLUR as LUCKY CRASHES THROUGH THE GLASS WINDOW.

                         WILL (CONT'D)

          NO!
          Lucky turns on Will with a growl, lurching toward him and
          pinning him to the wall. It happens fast.
          The chimpanzee opens his powerful jaw, exposing DEADLY

          INCISORS...
          â¢ BAM! BAM! BAM! Security Guard #1 SHOOTS LUCKY IN THE BACK.
          The chimp turns, leaps for the Guard - who FIRES again.

          Will watches as the chimp - and all of Will's dreams -
          collapses on the boardroom table.

          EXT. GEN-SYS GROUNDS - NIGHT

           Rain and fog. An AMBULANCE pulls out, past POLICE CRUISERS
          and two CDC (CENTER FOR DISEASE CONTROL) VANS.
          Will - face cut, clothing torn - finishes with a DETECTIVE
          and walks through the chaotic aftermath. He watches Caroline
          walk alongside a stretcher carrying Donnie, his shoulder
          packed in ice.
          He spots Jacobs, who looks wrecked. He hurries over to him.

                         WILL
          Are they gone?

                         JACOBS
          Long gone.
          Will knows the answer, but has to ask anyway.

                         WILL
          Did they say anything before they
          left? I mean, about Phase 2.

                         JACOBS
          Look around you, for Christ sakes.
          We'll be lucky if we don't go to
          jail.
          Will's gutted - devastated.

                         WILL
          But we're so close.

                         JACOBS
          You think you're the only one who's
          got something at stake here? I've
          got my own skin in this game!

                         WILL
          What happened had nothing to do
          with the 112.
          (desperate to clarify)
          Take an already aggressive animal,
          make it smarter - you're going to
          get a potentially dangerous

                         SITUATION -

                         

                         

                         

                         

          15.

                         JACOBS
          What makes you so damned positive
          about that?
          (pauses for emphasis)
          What if this drug does things you
          don't understand? Are you going to
          take responsibility for that?
          Because I'm sure as hell not going
          to.
          Here Will hesitates.

                         JACOBS (CONT'D)
          We're not ready for human trials.
          Hell, we weren't ready for monkey
          trials.

                         WILL
          They're apes.

                         JACOBS
          This is what we're going to do:
          You're taking a sabbatical. I'll
          let the board handle the lawsuit.
          When this blows over I'll bring you
          back and we'll start over - we'll
          do it right this time. With mice.
          Tiny mice that can't hurt anybody.
          Will finds to his dismay that he's got nothing to say.

          INT. LAB REFRIGERATION ROOM - NIGHT

          Will stands at the fringes of the room, watching MEN IN
          HAZMAT SUITS pull down SHELVES OF METAL CANISTERS LABELED ADV

          112.
          His work - destroyed.

          EXT. BACK LOT, BEHIND THE LAB - NIGHT

          Will climbs into his truck and pauses. He reaches into a
          jacket pocket and brings out a VIAL - IT'S THE VIAL of 112 HE

          USED IN THE PRESENTATION - THE ONLY REMAINING ONE.
          TAP AT THE WINDOW. Franklin's face appears.
          Will shoves the VIAL back into his pocket, rolls down the
          window.

                         Â¢ FRANKLIN
          Show you something, boss?

                         

                         

                         

                         

          16.

                         WILL
          I don't work here anymore,
          Franklin.

                         FRANKLIN
          I just put down fifteen animals,
          Dr. Rodman. The least you could do
          is give me a moment of your time.
          Will's shoulders sag with exhaustion. It's been a long,
          devastating day.

                         WILL
          of course.

          INT. PRIMATE LAB - NIGHT

          The cages are empty, the doors open. Will notes used
          SYRINGES on the table, filled body bags lined up on the
          floor.
          It's a creepy, horrible scene.

                         FRANKLIN
          They're all gone.

                         WILL
          I'm sorry, Franklin. Genuinely
          sorry...
          What's he got to do to get the hell out of there?
          Franklin ignores him, steps inside Bright Eyes' cage. He
          moves to the very back and pulls aside a blanket.
          At first Will doesn't understand what he's looking at. The
          lighting's dim and the thing's so small...
          But then IT MOVES AND WILL REALIZES HE'S LOOKING AT AN INFANT

          CHIMPANZEE.
          Will stares at it for a long moment, his brain overloaded.

                         WILL (CONT'D)
          It's impossible. How could a full-
          term gestation go unnoticed?

                         FRANKLIN
          They carry small. Must have been
          pregnant when they brought her in.
          Will tries to get his mind around the situation.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          17.

                         WILL
          Who else knows about this?

                         FRANKLIN
          No one.

                         (BEAT)
          I'd bring him home, but my brother-
          in-law works for security. He'd
          rat me out in a second.
          That's when will realizes.

                         WILL
          You want me to take him?

                         FRANKLIN
          He's an orphan now.

                         WILL
          I could be thrown in jail. He's a
          chimpanzee who's been exposed to a
          possibly dangerous drug.

                         FRANKLIN
          You don't believe that.

                         WILL
          Doesn't matter what I believe.

                         FRANKLIN
          Just for a couple days. Until I
          can find a sanctuary.

                         WILL
          That's not possible.

                         FRANKLIN
          I heard you outside, fighting to
          keep them alive.

                         WILL
          I was talking about the work, my

                         RESEARCH -

                         FRANKLIN
          she was just trying to protect him.

                         WILL
          What?

                         0

                         

                         

                         

                         

          18.

                         FRANKLIN
          Bright Eyes - the mother. That's
          why she wouldn't let anyone into
          her cage.
          Will looks down at the helpless baby.

                         WILL
          I'm sorry, Franklin - I'm sorry -
          but there's nothing I can do here.
          He's got to be put down like the
          others.

                         FRANKLIN
          Tell you what, Doc.
          (producing a syringe)
          I'm done for the day. So you be my
          guest.
          Franklin hands the LONG NEEDLE to Will.
          It's quiet. Will can hear the baby's WHEEZY breath. He
          enters the cage kneels beside it, regards his tiny body, his
          little hands.
          Will readies the needle, brings it close to the chimp's
          belly... but there's no way he can go through with this.
          Angrily Will tosses the needle aside. Turns to Franklin, who
          watches from outside the cage.

                         WILL
          Two days. Then you have to figure
          it out.

          INT. WALMART - NIGHT

          A BOX OF DIAPERS pulled from the shelf and tossed into a
          cart.
          Will moves down the aisle in a daze, the baby chimp - covered
          in a blanket - plastered to his chest.
          He stops at the powdered formulas, overwhelmed by the array
          of choices.

          INT. WALMART CHECK OUT - NIGHT

          A TEEN rings up the baby goods.

                         TEEN CASHIER
          Hey man. Congratulations.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          19.

                         WILL
          Huh?

                         (REALIZING)
          Oh. Thanks.

          EXT. WILL'S HOUSE - NIGHT

          Will pulls up in his truck.

          EXT. FRONT DOOR - NIGHT

          Will's coat is pulled forward to shield the baby at his
          chest. He barely has the key in the lock when Irena opens
          the door.

                         IRENA
          It's Friday night. I had a date.

                         WILL
          I'm sorry - there was -
          She doesn't wait to hear his excuse, just moves down the
          walk, her footfalls pointed and angry.
           He pauses there. Apparently no end to this bad day.

          INT. KITCHEN - NIGHT

          Will dumps the baby goods on the counter, heads for the
          refrigerator. The infant's still plastered to his chest.
          He opens the fridge, grabs a crisper drawer, empties its
          contents in the sink.
          Then Will REACHES INTO HIS JACKET POCKET AND TAKES OUT THE

          VIAL OF 112. CAREFULLY HE PLACES IT INTO THE DRAWER AND

          ROLLS THE DRAWER BACK IN THE FRIDGE.

          INT. BEDROOM - NIGHT

          Will sleeps the deep sleep of exhaustion. A HIGH PITCHED
          WAIL comes from another part of the house.
          Will sits up, remembering.

          INT. LAUNDRY ROOM - NIGHT

          Will enters, half asleep, turns on the light. The baby chimp
          lies in a cardboard box on the floor and he's obviously sick,
          making UNNATURAL WHEEZING NOISES.

          20.
          Will stares down at the little creature, trying to decide
          what to do.

          INT. BATHROOM - NIGHT

          Will turns on the HOT WATER. SHUTS the door. Holding the
          limp, feeble chimp in his arms, he puts down the toilet seat
          and sits.

                         WILL
          It's okay. It's going to be okay.
          Awkwardly, he even rocks back and forth a little bit.
          Will looks down at the chimp, struggling for breath. The
          room fills with STEAM.

                         CUT TO:
          A LARGE MALE CHIMPANZEE IN THE WILD. He stands at the top of
          a tree, an alpha male, eyeing the CHIMPS around him.
          In a sudden BURST of movement, the CHIMPANZEE TAKES OFF,
          FLYING FROM BRANCH TO BRANCH with tremendous force, a FREIGHT

          TRAIN OF THREAT, POWER AND VIOLENCE.
          Teeth bared in a terrifying display, the ape easily
          intimidates all the chimps around him.

          REVEAL THAT THE CHIMP IMAGES ARE YOU-TUBE AND WILL'S WATCHING

          THEM ON HIS LAPTOP.
          Abruptly he closes it. Looks down at the infant, so peaceful
          in his arms.

          SUPER: "TWO YEARS LATER"
          SOUND of a TOILET FLUSH.

          INT. HOUSE - DAY

          The chimp - looking like a toddler - walks out of the
          bathroom, hiking up a pair of shorts. WE FOLLOW HIM THROUGH
          THE HOUSE as he zig zags up and over furniture.
          The house looks warmer, cluttered, more lived-in.
          The chimp arrives at a hallway, where he leaps into the air
          and grabs hold of a CORD that hangs from the ceiling.
          As his weight pulls it down, there's a SQUEAK and a FOLD DOWN
          LADDER opens from above. WE FOLLOW HIM up the ladder into...

          â¢INT. ATTIC -- DAY

          .the attic. Beams of light streaming through a LARGE VENT
          TO THE OUTSIDE. Rings and pegs for climbing are set into the
          walls. Toys, books and puzzles scattered across the floor.
          SOUNDS of KIDS PLAYING and LAUGHING OUTSIDE.
          The chimp heads for the vent and peers through. WE GO OVER

          HIS SHOULDER TO SEE...

          EXT. THE OUTSIDE WORLD - DAY

          From up here, the chimp has a commanding view of the entire
          neighborhood. A group of CHILDREN rides bikes. A MAN mows
          his lawn.
          There's a HONK below, and the chimp watches as a TAXI pulls
          up to the HOUSE NEXT DOOR.
          HUNSIKER - A MAN in an AIRLINE PILOT uniform - kisses his
          WIFE and young DAUGHTER, ALICE, then climbs into the cab with
          his carry-on suitcase.
          Alice clutches a doll in her hand as she watches her daddy's
          Taxi disappear around the corner... Then TODD, the big
          brother, SWIPES THE DOLL FROM HER HAND and rides off on his
          bike. His FRIENDS LAUGH.
          The chimp watches, riveted, as the Alice BURSTS INTO OUTRAGED
          TEARS and runs after them.

          WILL (O.S.)
          Caesar! Breakfast!
          The chimp turns at Will's call. HIS NAME IS CAESAR.

          INT. HOUSE - DAY

          Will comes away from the ladder, heads for the kitchen.
          The living room floor is strewn with puzzles and games. One
          of them has been completed. Will considers it, looks around
          for the box, reads the side...
          AGES 12 and up. 12 and up.
          Caesar runs past, jumps onto d chair at the kitchen table,
          picks up a fork and starts eating his eggs and potatoes.
          Will walks over, sits across from him.

          INT. GEN-SYS LAB - DAY

           A MOUSE moves through a maze as a LAB TECH marks its
          progress. Will - in a lab coat - watches with intensity.
          The mouse moves effortlessly through the maze until it
          reaches an ORANGE CONE at a crossroads. The mouse stops,
          studies the cone.

                         LAB TECH
          Is he going to turn left or
          right...?
          The mouse turns left at the cone - and finds his way to a
          piece of cheese. Will does his best to hide the excitement
          blooming on his face.

                         WILL

           VISITORS buy tickets at the entrance gates. Will pulls
           around to an Employee Parking Lot.

           INT. PRIMATE INFIRMARY, SAN FRANCISCO ZOO - DAY

          Dr. Molly Stewart - late 20's, pretty tomboy -- finishes
           taking Caesar's blood pressure.

          After. Sit still.

                         STEWART
          What about diet?

                         WILL
          A healthy diet. Fruits,
          vegetables.

                         CAESAR
          Ice cream.
          Will ignores him.

                         STEWART
          What's he saying?

                         WILL
          He's hungry.
          Caesar's angling to climb off the examining table. Will
          sends him a look - out it out.

                         STEWART
          He seems extremely intelligent.
          How many words does Caesar sign?
          Beat.

                         WILL
          You know, the basics.

                         CAESAR
          Soft-serve.

                         STEWART
          I've heard of apes learning up to a
          hundred and fifty words. Is he
          good with puzzles?
          Will hesitates.

                         0

                         

                         

                         

                         

          24.

                         WILL
          He's pretty good.

                         STEWART
          Well, Caesar's healthy, obviously
          happy. You're doing a great job
          with him.
          (doesn't want to alarm)
          But there is an anomaly I noticed.

                         WILL
          Like what?

                         STEWART
          When I was examining his eyes, I
          noticed a strange green
          pigmentation.

                         WILL
          Green?
          His heart starts to pound.

                         STEWART
          Green. Never.seen it before.
          She hands Will an OTOSCOPE.

                         STEWART (CONT'D)
          Take a look.
          Will peers through the magnification - and sure enough, finds

          FLECKS OF BRIGHT GREEN PIGMENTATION - JUST LIKE THE 112.

                         STEWART (CONT'D)
          It's faint, can you pick it up?
          He sits down in the nearest chair - stunned. She eyes him.

                         STEWART (CONT'D)
          You alright? Want a glass of
          water?

                         WILL
          No thanks.

                         (EMBARRASSED)
          Sure, that would be good.
          She gets him one. Concerned, Caesar comes over.

                         WILL (CONT'D)
          Forgot to eat today. Not a big
          deal.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          25.
          Stewart hands him the glass. He downs it.

                         WILL (CONT'D)

                         (TO CAESAR)
          I'm fine.
          Stewart puts her hand to the side of his neck. Feels good.

                         STEWART
          Carotid pulse is running a little
          fast.

                         WILL
          For a human or a chimpanzee?
          First time he's seen her smile. It lights up her face.

                         STEWART
          Gotta remember to eat.

          INT. MOVING CAR - DAY

          Will drives Caesar, both of them licking soft-serve ice cream
          cones. He pulls up outside a store: "SMART CHILD"

          EDUCATIONAL TESTING TOYS.

          WILL (O.S.)
          You have to move the whole tower to
          another peg, one block at a time.

          INT. KITCHEN - DAY

          Walter's parked in front of the TV, not watching it.
          Caesar sits at the table looking at a flat board with three
          wooden poles. There are four colored blocks threaded on the
          first pole, stacked biggest to smallest, making a 'tower'.
          Irena stands next to Will, watching Caesar. There's also a
          CAMCORDER on a tripod.

                         WILL
          Here's the hard part: you can't put
          a larger block on top of a smaller
          one.
          Caesar studies the puzzle.

                         WILL (CONT'D)
          Understand?

                         

                         

                         

                         

          26.
          Caesar's already started. He methodically begins moving
          blocks from one pole to another, pausing, backtracking,
          getting it right, never a bigger one on top of a smaller...
          Will watches, increasingly amazed, as he re-creates the tower
          on a different pole. It's easy for him.
          Finished, Caesar looks up at him. Will fumbles in his
          pocket, HANDS CAESAR SOME M&MS.

                         WILL (CONT'D)

                         (STUNNED)
          He did it in fifteen moves.

                         IRENA
          What's the best score?

                         WILL
          Fifteen.
          Will looks over at Walter, who's staring at the wall.

                         IRENA

                         (AMAZED)
          I wonder where he gets such talent?

                         WILL
          (eyes on Walter)
          It was passed down from his mother.

          INT. WILL'S STUDY - NIGHT

          Will uploads the MPEG video of Caesar doing the puzzle and
          prepares to record an AUDIO ATTACHMENT.

                         WILL
          (into computer mic)
          At age two Caesar appears to exceed
          his mother's aptitude. He signs
          over three hundred words. He
          exhibits no visible side effects
          from the therapy...

          INT. GARAGE - NIGHT

           Will flips on a light. Enters. Closes the door behind him.
           Taking a key from his pocket he approaches a SMALL, PADLOCKED
           REFRIGERATOR and unlocks it. Opens the door.
           Inside-WE SEE: THE SINGLE VIAL OF ADV 112.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          27.

          INT. LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

          Will sits on the edge of the sofa, the VIAL of 112 in his
          hand. He's deep in agonized thought.
          Finally he takes a SYRINGE and FILLS IT WITH THE GREEN
          LIQUID. Then he stands, walks to a closed door.

          INT. WALTER'S ROOM - NIGHT

          The opening door sends a wash of light into the dark room.
          Walter's in bed. He opens his eyes, squinting at the
          brightness.

                         WILL
          (syringe in hand)
          Dad. I've got something that's
          going to make you better.
          Will closes the door behind him. WE HEAR A RHYTHMIC
          SQUEAKING NOISE as we...

                         CUT TO:

          EXT. BACK YARD - DAY

          The movement of a SWING. Caesar's strapped in it, and WE

          NOTICE IMMEDIATELY THAT HE'S GROWN OLDER.

          SUPER: TWO YEARS LATER
          Caesar's features are more mature. He appears more like a
          "little boy" - and his EYES HAVE TURNED A DEEP GREEN.
          Back and forth Caesar goes, as high as he can manage.
          At the height of his forward motion, he peers down into the
          neighbor's yard where, for just an instant, HE CAN SEE TODD

          PLAYING BALL WITH ALICE AND ANOTHER KID.
          At the height of his backward motion he catches another
          glimpse.
          Caesar pumps his legs, eager to get a better look...

          INT. KITCHEN - DAY

          Will's making sandwiches, his eye on Caesar through the
          window.

                         WILL
          (to someone offscreen)
          You want turkey or ham?

                         

                         

                         

                         

          28.

          VOICE (O.S.)
          Ham!

          INT. LIVING ROOM - DAY

          WE FIND WALTER just sitting down on the piano bench. He
          begins playing a competent version of "CLAIR DE LUNE."

          INT. KITCHEN - DAY

           Will pauses, listening to the MUSIC. He moves to the doorway
          to watch his father.
          The happiness - the relief - is clear on his face.

          EXT. BACK YARD - DAY

          SQUEAK.SQUEAK of the SWING, the PIANO FAINT from out here.
          Caesar studies the harness that's keeping him in the swing.
          There's a clamp on either side and a clamp on the back. He
          undoes the one on his right side. CLICK. Then the left
          side. CLICK.
          Caesar wriggles the harness around so that he can reach the
          clamp on his back with his long chimpanzee arms.

          INT. KITCHEN - DAY

          Will returns to his sandwich making. It takes him a moment
          to notice that CAESAR HAS DISAPPEARED FROM THE SWING.
          The color drains from his face.

          EXT. HUNSIKER BACK YARD - DAY

           Caesar stands at the edge of the yard, unsure what to do
          next. All three kids - Todd, Alice and Todd's buddy - have
          stopped playing to stare at him.
          Caesar spots a BALL lying on the grass. He picks it up and
          tosses it to Todd's Buddy. The Boy catches it, throws it
          back to Caesar.

                         TODD'S BUDDY
          Check it. He wants to play.
          Thrilled at the contact, Caesar throws the ball to Todd. But
          Todd has an idea, and the idea makes him smile.
          Alice doesn't have a good feeling. She watches as her
          brother throws the ball to his Buddy OVER CAESAR'S HEAD.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          29.

                         TODD
          Monkey in the middle.
          Todd's Buddy LAUGHS. Caesar LAUGHS too, although he's not
          sure what's funny.

          EXT. STREET - DAY

          Will and Walter walk down the street looking for Caesar.

                         WALTER
          Caesar!

                         WILL
          He won't go far.

                         WALTER
          You don't know that.

                         WILL
          I do, Dad.

          INT. HUNSIKER BACK YARD - DAY

          Todd and his buddy throw the ball over Caesar's head, while
          Caesar jumps to try and catch it.

          TODD AND FRIEND
          Monkey in the middle, monkey in the
          middle...
          Caesar's having fun, unaware that the game has become keep-
          away from him. Until he NOTICES ALICE'S EXPRESSION - SHE

          FEELS SORRY FOR HIM.

          THEN, IN A STOMACH-LURCHING MOMENT CAESAR REALIZES WHAT'S

          GOING ON: HE'S THE BUTT OF A JOKE.
          They're making fun of him.
          "MONKEY", "MONKEY", "MONKEY"... The chanted words ring in
          Caesar's ears. He drops his arms and walks over to Todd,
          stepping close, hot rage escaping from his nostrils.
          Todd tries to laugh it off, but the fear's plain on his face.
          Alice runs inside.

          EXT. STREET - DAY

          Will and Walter search down the street. Then they hear it:
          â¢ HUNSIKER'S YELL. Will runs for the neighbor's house.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          30.

          EXT. HUNSIKER BACK YARD - DAY

          Hunsiker approaches Caesar with a raised bat. The terrified
          chimp backs toward his fence.

                         HUNSIKER
          Hah! Hah -
          Will JUMPS INTO THE YARD AND PUTS HIMSELF BETWEEN HUNSIKER
          AND CAESAR. Caesar cowers behind him.

                         WILL
          Hold on - it's okay - he's
          harmless!

                         HUNSIKER
          Your monkey came onto my property!
          Threatened my kids!
          By now Caesar has climbed into Will's arms, burying his head
          in. his neck. Will backs toward the gate.

                         WILL
          It won't happen again...

                         HUNSIKER
          Damn right it won't happen again!
          I'll press charges if it does!
          Will holds Caesar close and hurries home.

          INT. STEWART'S OFFICE - DAY


                         STEWART
          What does he do for fun?
          Will's brought Caesar in for a check-up. He's a little
          thrown by the question.

                         WILL
          Well we've got puzzles, games, a
          swing set...

                         STEWART
          My guess is he needs more. More
          exercise, more space.

                         WILL
          We'll work on that.
          Stewart continues examining Caesar. Will watches her listen
          to his heart. Closing her eyes for a moment, listening.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          31.
          He gets up his nerve.

                         WILL (CONT'D)
          What about you?

                         (BEAT)
          What do you do for fun?
          She opens her eyes, looks at him. He thinks she doesn't
          understand the question.

                         WILL (CONT'D)
          How about dinner and a movie?
          Stewart pulls the stethoscope from her ears.

                         STEWART
          I'm sorry, did you say something?
          He starts to try again - but the moment's gone.

                         WILL
          No - nothing.
          Caesar meets Will's eyes, obviously disappointed.
          Stewart lingers a moment, certain she's missed something -
          but Will doesn't say more.

          EXT. MUIR WOODS, ESTABLISHING - DAY

          From high above, WE PASS OVER the Golden Gate Bridge, the
          link between the bustling city and a huge, green FOREST.

          INT. MOVING CAR - DAY

          Caesar - driving with Walter and Will -- looks out the window,
          extremely excited.

          EXT. PARKING LOT, MUIR WOODS - DAY

          As Caesar scrambles out of the truck, WILL HOOKS A HARNESS
          TO HIS COLLAR and helps Walter from the car.
          The chimp looks around at the SOARING TREES. What is this
          place? The three of them head into the forest, Caesar
          tugging at the leash.

                         WALTER
          Take him off the leash.

                         Â¢ WILL
          There's a place up ahead.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          32.

          EXT. PARK/CLEARING - DAY

          They've walked deep into the park. No people here. Will
          kneels next to Caesar.

                         WILL
          Don't go far. Stay where I can see
          you.
          Will takes OFF CAESAR'S HARNESS. The chimpanzee runs, begins
          flying from tree to tree. Will watches, nervous. But it's
          gratifying to see Caesar so happy.
          The CHIMP DISAPPEARS around a corner. A moment passes, then
          another. The men follow... and discover CAESAR STANDING IN A

          GROVE OF TREES.

                         WILL (CONT'D)

                         (YELLING)
          Remember - stay where I can see you
          - if you got lost in these woods
          I'd never find you.

          BUT CAESAR BARELY HEARS HIM. HE'S UTTERLY CAPTIVATED. THE

          SPOT IS BEAUTIFUL, WITH GREEN, LUSH BRANCHES JOINING TO FORM

          A CANOPY OVERHEAD.

                         WALTER
          Go ahead. Climb!
          The men sit down on a log, watching as Caesar swings from the
          branches. Free, elated. An animal in his element.
          Caesar begins climbing a redwood. Our view of him is
          obscured by the leaves. As his dark form ascends, Will and
          Walter become smaller and smaller down below.

          SUPER: THREE YEARS LATER
          RUSTLING LEAVES whisper Caesar upward. He moves with an easy
          grace, exhilarated by the freedom.
          At the TOP of the giant redwood CAESAR EMERGES THROUGH THE

          LEAVES - AND WE SEE THAT HE'S GROWN, FILLED OUT - THE CHIMP

          EQUIVALENT OF A FULL-BLOWN TEENAGER.

          HIS DISTINCTIVE LOOKS ARE MORE PRONOUNCED NOW: EYES A DEEP

          GREEN, FEATURES SOMEWHAT LESS SIMIAN, PERHAPS MORE HUMAN...
          Caesar looks across the bay to San Francisco, looks north at
          the mountains. Then down to Will below.
          Will's pointing to his watch.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          33.
          â¢ CLOSE ON A HARNESS. Will has it waiting as Caesar lands
          beside him on the forest floor.
          Will attaches the harness and they walk together. Caesar's
          much taller now - over five feet.

                         WILL
          Sorry to rush you - got to get home
          and check on Walter.
          They approach a WOMAN with a LARGE DOG on a leash - a GREAT
          DANE. The dog BARKS, lunging menacingly. The Woman
          struggles to control him.

                         WOMAN

                         (INCREDULOUS)
          Is that a chimpanzee?

                         WILL
          Don't worry - he's harmless. Very
          sweet.
          The big dog keeps BARKING.
          Annoyed, Caesar finally turns and gives him a LARGE,

          CHIMPANZEE SNARL, BARING HIS TEETH.
          The Great Dane immediately WHIMPERS - terrified - and pulls
          the Woman away.

                         WILL (CONT'D)
          Guess he had it coming.
          Caesar watches as the Woman walks off with the dog, HIS GAZE

          LINGERING ON THE LEASH.
           THEN HIS EYES MOVE TO HIS OWN LEASH. Is he a pet too?

          EXT. ZOO - DAY

          Will drives up, Caesar in tow. The ZOO'S BEING RENOVATED -
          machinery everywhere.

          INT. STEWART'S OFFICE - DAY

          Will leads Caesar inside the examination room - and finds
          himself face to face with a YOUNG MALE VETERINARIAN.

                         WILL
          Where's Dr. Stewart?

                         S VETERINARIAN
          She doesn't work here anymore.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          34.
          Doesn't work here anymore?

                         WILL
          Do you know where she went?

                         VETERINARIAN
          I'm sorry - I don't.
          Will's deeply disappointed.

          EXT. ZOO - DAY

          Disoriented because of the construction, Will makes a wrong
          turn as he leads Caesar to the car.
          They find themselves in front of THE PRIMATE ENCLOSURE.
          Caesar goes rigid, staring at a DOZEN CHIMPS in the branches
          of the trees - behind bars. They stare back at him. One
          CHIMP, a GRIZZLED OLD MALE, STEPS FORWARD - OMINOUS. HE

          LOOKS AT CAESAR AS IF LOOKING INTO HIS SOUL.
          Caesar's transfixed.
          Will looks back and forth between the chimps and Caesar.
          Neither makes a sound.

                         WILL
          Come on.
          As Will drags Caesar off, the apes in the enclosure climb
          higher in the tree to watch. Suddenly they ALL BEGIN TO

          SCREAM IN A DEAFENING CHATTER.

          INT. ATTIC - DAY

          Caesar stands at the vent watching the neighborhood TEENAGERS
          walk home from school.
          One BOY walks with a blonde teenage GIRL, books clutched to
          her chest. Caesar watches the Boy flirt with her. The girl
          smiles, flirts back.
          One of the younger Kids runs by, bopping the Boy on the head.
          The BOY SHOOTS HIM THE FINGER and returns to the girl.
          Caesar's fascinated by these antics. He wants to be with
          these teens. He wants to be one of them.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          35.

          INT. BATHROOM - DAY

          Caesar stands in front of a FULL LENGTH MIRROR, shirtless.
          He stands up straight, like a human. Tries to imitate their
          posture, their gait.

          BUT FROM THE MIRROR A CHIMPANZEE STARES BACK AT HIM. A

          CHIMPANZEE WITH GREEN EYES.

          THERE'S A PROMINENT WHITE BIRTHMARK ON HIS SHOULDER - JUST

          LIKE ALPHA'S.
           He runs two fingers down the length of it.

          INT. KITCHEN - NIGHT

          Caesar, Walter and Will sit at the dinner table. There's
          tension here, but we can't place it yet.
          Then WE SEE that WALTER IS STRUGGLING TO EAT BECAUSE HE'S
          USING THE WRONG END OF THE SPOON. He clutches the utensil,
          staring at it.

                         WILL
          Turn it around, Dad. You're using
          the wrong end.
          Walter looks at Will, uncomprehending.
          With care and compassion, Caesar reaches over and helps the
          old man, adjusting the spoon.
          Will watches. Heartbroken.

          INT. LAB - DAY

          A MOUSE runs through a MAZE. It reaches a fork in the path,
          leading to two different plastic objects, one green, one
          orange. The mouse hesitates, confused.
          He backs away from the cone.
          A LAB TECH makes a note. Will and Jacobs stand behind him,
          reading the number results on a monitor.
          Will's obviously discouraged.

                         WILL
          The drug's not staying ahead of the
          disease.

                         0

                         

                         

                         

                         

          36.

                         JACOBS
          But we're still making progress,
          right?
          Will tries to tamp down the frustration he's sure is written
          all over his face.

                         WILL
          Sure. At this pace we'll get to
          trials by the time Hell freezes
          over.
          Jacobs - embarrassed in front of the Tech - pulls him aside.

                         JACOBS
          This isn't graduate school -
          there's a procedure we have to
          adhere to.

                         WILL
          It'll take forever. I need to
          start developing a primate version
          now.
          Jacobs looks at Will. He's known him a long time.

                         JACOBS
          How's your father? Haven't seen
          him in a while.

                         WILL
          This isn't about him.

                         JACOBS
          He's worse, isn't he?
          Will wants to tell Jacobs the truth - he's tempted to tell
          him about Caesar, about Walter's treatment - but he can't.

                         WILL

                         (EVASIVE)
          He's fine.

          WE HEAR A PERSISTENT C SHARP COMING FROM A DISTANT PIANO.
          It's a familiar, baleful SOUND that continues over the
          following...

          INT. WILL'S STUDY - DAY

          Will sits in front of the computer, looking at a file crammed
          with MPEGs of Caesar doing puzzles and games.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          37.

                         WILL
          (into computer mic)
          Caesar continues to maintain a high
          level of cognition. But Walter's
          disease has caught up to the
          neurogenesis treatment. Nearly all
          initial improvement has been
          erased...
          Will stops recording. KICKS his desk in frustration.

          INT. LIVING ROOM - DAY

          Walter sits at the piano, hitting his one note.
          Caesar passes him, heads for Will's study.

          INT. WILL'S STUDY - DAY

          Caesar enters, finds Will at the desk, head in hands. Will
          senses his presence. Looks up.

                         CAESAR
          Who Caesar.

                         WILL
          What do you mean?

                         CAESAR
          Who.
          With effort, Will pulls himself from his own thoughts and
          tries to understand what Caesar wants from him.

                         CAESAR (CONT'D)
          Who.

                         WILL
          Caesar is an ape.

                         (SIGNING)
          A chimpanzee.

                         CAESAR
          No "what". "Who".
          Will is taken aback - beginning to realize the intellectual
          leap Caesar's taken.

                         WILL
          Are you asking about your identity?
          That's abstract thought, Caesar.
          Caesar couldn't care less about 'abstract thought.'

                         

                         

                         

                         

          38.

                         CAESAR
          Walter Will father. Will Caesar
          father?
          Will looks at the chimp - sees the intensity, the pain on his
          face. How to begin to answer?

          WILL (O.S.)
          This is where you were born. It's
          the place where I work.

          INT. MOVING CAR/PARKED CAR - DAY

          Will and Caesar are PARKED ACROSS THE STREET FROM THE GEN-SYS
          LAB GROUNDS, its buildings visible through the fencing.

                         WILL
          I never knew your father, but your
          mother came to live here. This is
          where you were born.

                         CAESAR
          Caesar mother?

                         WILL
          She was very very smart. And she
          passed that onto you through her
          blood.
          Caesar strains for a better view. Undoes his seatbelt.

                         CAESAR
          Caesar go. Caesar see.
          Will locks the car door.

                         WILL
          She's not here anymore. I'm sorry,
          Caesar - she died. That's when I
          brought you home to live with me
          and Walter.
          Caesar's getting worked up - he wants out of the car.

                         CAESAR
          Caesar mother...
          Will grows concerned.

                         WILL
          No. This is a bad place for you,
          Caesar. We're going to go now.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          39.
          As Will pulls away Caesar strains for a last glimpse,
          twisting around to look out the back window.

          VOICE (O.S.)
          Let's see if we can find something
          for you on the TV...

          INT. LIVING ROOM - DAY

          Walter has a new HOME AIDE - a pale, hard-looking older
          woman. He sits on the sofa staring at the TV's moving images
          as she changes channels.
          The Aide settles on a news show covering preparations for a
          SPACE LAUNCH. ASTRONAUTS wave to the PRESS CORPS as they
          board a SHUTTLE.

                         TV REPORTER
          The Icarus crew is led by Commander
          Colonel George Taylor. This is his
          fifth space mission...

          INT. ATTIC - DAY

          CLOSE ON a crude drawing of an ape. Caesar sits on the
          floor, working on its details. As he draws the white
          birthmark - like a falling star - WE REALIZE it's a self-
          portrait.

          EXT. BACK YARD - DAY

          The Home Aide lights herself a cigarette, sits down on a deck
          chair.

          INT. LIVING ROOM - DAY

          TV's still blaring, but the sofa's empty.
          REVEAL Walter, standing in the middle of the room, confused.
          As if he's not sure where he is.
          Abruptly he turns and heads across the room... and OUT THE

          FRONT DOOR.

          EXT. STREET - DAY

          Walter pauses on the porch, blinking in the sun. The street
          ahead of him is quiet. No one around.
          Walter wanders down the front path. When he arrives at the
          sidewalk he keeps on going, STEPPING OUT INTO THE STREET.

                         0

                         

                         

                         

                         

          40.
          He's immediately startled by a SUDDEN HONK, the SOUND of
          SQUEALING BRAKES, and a car fishtailing out of control. The
          car SMASHES into a nearby tree.

          INT. ATTIC - DAY

          Hearing the CRASH, Caesar jumps to his feet, rushes to the
          vent. He sees Hunsiker emerge from the smashed car, unhurt.
          Caesar watches as Hunsiker inspects the ruined front fender,
          then turns to YELL at someone.
          That's when Walter comes into Caesar's view.
          He's in the street, afraid, disoriented - while Hunsiker
          rages, jabbing a threatening finger towards Walter's chest.
          In a flash Caesar's down the attic stairs.

          EXT. STREET - DAY

          Walter backs up as Hunsiker approaches, still jabbing the
          menacing finger.

                         HUNSIKER
          Look at the front of my car you
          stupid, stupid old man! You should
          be locked up! Your son's going to
          pay for that damage -

          CAESAR EXPLODES OUT THE DOOR.
          No time for anybody to react. The chimpanzee BODY SLAMS
          HUNSIKER to the ground.

                         WALTER
          Caesar...
          Straddling Hunsiker, teeth bared, Caesar pounds him with his
          fists.

                         HUNSIKER
          Help! Get him off -

                         WALTER
          Caesar... no... Stop!
          Walter grabs Caesar by the shoulders, tries to pull him back.
          But Caesar's too carried away by his rage - he shrugs the old
          man off his back.
          Then he grabs one of Hunsiker's hands and BITES OFF THE

          "JABBING" POINTER FINGER.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          41.

                         HUNSIKER
          Aaaaaaaah!
          Walter struggles to his feet and grabs Caesar again. A PULSE

          OF HUNSIKER'S BLOOD STREAKS ACROSS HIS NECK.

                         WALTER
          Caesar!
          Caesar hesitates. Blood dripping down his chin, he looks
          over his shoulder and meets Walter's eyes.

                         WALTER (CONT'D)
          Please stop.
          Hunsiker uses the distraction. He scrabbles to his feet and
          sprints for his house.

          CAESAR CATCHES A GLIMPSE. ANIMAL INSTINCT TAKES OVER - IT'S

          TOO BIG TO FIGHT.
          He races after Hunsiker. WALTER FALLS TO THE GROUND. HIS
          HEAD HITS THE PAVEMENT, stunning him.

          EXT. HUNSIKER'S HOUSE - DAY

          Just as Hunsiker's about to reach his front door, Caesar
          flies from behind - his feet hitting the door - and lands to
          block Hunsiker's entrance.
          White with terror, Hunsiker - clutching his bleeding hand to
          his chest - takes off running down the sidewalk.

          EXT. STREET - DAY

          Hunsiker runs for his life. He looks over his shoulder -
          Caesar's galloping behind, in hot pursuit.
          He tries to speed up - can't go any faster. Again he glances
          over his shoulder - Caesar's closing in.
          Breath coming hard, Hunsiker sprints, scrambles, desperate to
          escape. He looks over his shoulder-but this time CAESAR

          HAS DISAPPEARED. HE'S NOT ANYWHERE, UP OR DOWN THE STREET.
          Unsure where to go, half-stumbling, Hunsiker keeps running.
          Then, OUT OF NOWHERE, CAESAR SWINGS DOWN FROM A TREE. HE

          LANDS SQUARELY IN FRONT OF HUNSIKER, BLOCKING HIS PATH.
          Hunsiker backs up, changes direction, runs across the street.

                         0

                         

                         

                         

                         

          42.
          Enjoying the chase, taking his time, Caesar grabs a tree
          branch and swings from tree to tree.
          with one giant jump, he makes it to the top of a tree across
          the street, tracking Hunsiker like prey.
          Hunsiker's running out of steam. Caesar swings down in front
          of him and KICKS him in the chest, sending him flying.
          Calmly he stands over Hunsiker, who cowers.

                         HUNSIKER
          Please no...
          Caesar pounds his chest, YELLING in triumph.
          But then he sees something across the street that abruptly
          pulls him out of his euphoria: WALTER - STRUGGLING, BLOODY -

          BEING HELPED TO HIS FEET.
          He looks down at Hunsiker, cringing.
          All at once CAESAR REALIZES WHAT HE'S DONE.

          EXT. COUNTRYSIDE - DAY

          Jacobs sits forward, turns up the volume.

                         REPORTER (CONT'D)

          Will and a chimpanzee? Jacobs stares at the TV, dumbfounded.

          INT. MOVING CAR Â»- DAY

          Will and Caesar drive. Caesar's dressed up - khaki pants and
          a Polo shirt.

                         WILL
          We're visiting a place called "The
          Ranch". They have animals.

                         CAESAR
          Real animals?

                         WILL
          You bet. Apes. Chimpanzees,
          gorillas, orangutans...
          Caesar GRUNTS, excited.

                         WILL (CONT'D)
          It'll be good. You'll like it very
          much.
          Caesar looks at Will, picking up on something.

                         CAESAR
          Will sad?

                         WILL
          What? No, I'm fine.

          EXT. THE RANCH - DAY

          As Will pulls into the entrance, Caesar's glued to the
          window.

          INT. MOVING CAR - DAY

          They pull into a CLEARING. Ahead is a new world - CONCRETE
          AND STEEL BUILDINGS set incongruously into the bucolic
          countryside.
          A HOUSE/OFFICE, a LIVING QUARTERS, a HORSE PADDOCK - all
          cold, efficient structures.

                         CAESAR
          Where animals?

                         

                         

                         

                         

          44.
          Will sees the PRIMATE CAGES in the distance, next to a GIANT

          RED METAL ATRIUM.

                         WILL
          Inside, I think...

          EXT. THE RANCH - DAY

          As they climb from the car, MR. LANDON, 50's, emerges from
          the office. DODGE, 20's, hangs back.

                         WILL
          You must be Mr. Landon.

                         (SHAKING HANDS)
          This is Caesar.

          MR. LANDON
          Nice to meet you, Caesar. This is
          Dodge, helps me run the place.

                         WILL
          I've been telling Caesar about the
          animals you have here. How much
          fun it is.

          MR. LANDON
          Yes, we have a big play center
          where the chimpanzees like to
          climb.

                         (TO CAESAR)
          Want to see the play center?
          Caesar nods. Absolutely.

          EXT. CAGED ATRIUM - DAY

          A HUGE CAGED STRUCTURE, the size of a gymnasium. Inside are
          climbing constructions, ropes, toys, and, in the middle, a
          LARGE TREE, reaching up through the top bars.
          A CAGED-IN BRIDGE leads to a row of DARK DENS. But for
          now... it's empty. No apes in sight.
          Caesar approaches with will and Mr. Landon.

          MR. LANDON
          What do you think, Caesar? Want to
          give it a try?
          Trying to mask his growing dread, Will removes Caesar's
          harness.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          45.

                         WILL
          Go ahead.
          He watches Caesar - unsuspecting - move through AN OPEN, GATE-

          LIKE SLIDING DOOR.

          EXT. ATRIUM - DAY

          Caesar scampers up the ledges and leaps to a bar. He swings
          from bar to bar, then hits the ground and runs for the tree.

          EXT. OUTSIDE CAGED ATRIUM - DAY

          Will can barely watch AS DODGE ROLLS THE SLIDING DOOR CLOSED,

          LOCKING IT.
          He braces himself.

          EXT. ATRIUM - DAY

          Caesar joyfully climbs the sprawling tree until he HITS THE
          TOP OF THE CAGE. Branches continue through spaces in the
          bars, but HE'S REACHED...

          A DEAD END.
          CAESAR TURNS, FINDS WILL'BELOW. What he reads in Will's eyes
          gives him a sudden, sharp sense of dread.

          HE LOOKS TO THE CAGE ENTRANCE, SEES THAT THE GATE IS LOCKED.

          HE'S LOCKED IN. TRAPPED.
          Caesar SHRIEKS, speeds down the tree.
          Other SHRIEKS join in. EXCITED APE NOISES - coming from
          UNSEEN, CAGED APES - fills the atrium.
          The STRANGE ANIMAL VOICES FUEL CAESAR'S PANIC. He runs to
          the gate, tries to shake it open.

                         WILL
          It's okay, Caesar. It's going to
          be okay...
          The words are for him as much as Caesar.

                         WILL (CONT'D)
          You're going to live here for a
          while. This is what the Judge says
          we have to do.

                         0

                         

                         

                         

                         

          46.
          WHAT? Caesar can't believe what he's hearing! He
          frantically signs, desperate, pleading.
          The SHRIEKS of the UNSEEN APES continue, feeding Will's
          apprehension. Caesar doesn't belong here. It takes every
          bit of restraint he has not to take Caesar out, to run...

                         WILL (CONT'D)
          They'll take good care of you here.

                         DODGE
          That's about it for visiting hours.
          Will shoots him a look of daggers.

          MR. LANDON
          What Dodge means is, in our
          experience, longer you drag out the
          leave-taking, harder it is. On
          both of you.
          Caesar WHIMPERS, tries to bend the bars apart. When this
          doesn't work, he tries prying them open with his teeth.

                         WILL
          I'm sorry to trick you this way,
          but you would never have agreed. I
          was afraid they'd hurt you if they
          forced you -

          MR. LANDON
          He'll be fine.
          Will gives Caesar a last, long look. The pain in his eyes is
          matched only by Caesar's.
          WE STAY WITH CAESAR as Will forces himself to walk away.
          Caesar's SHRIEKS build. The SURROUNDING APES chime in...a

          CACOPHONY OF PRIMAL ENERGY.

          CAESAR HURTLES HIS BODY AGAINST THE CAGE.

                         DODGE
          Caesar. Hey. I can get you out.
          Dodge stands at the end of the atrium, BECKONING.

                         DODGE (CONT'D)
          This way.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          47.
          Caesar follows Dodge to the far end of the play area, then
          through the CAGED-IN BRIDGE. Will's almost out of sight.
          Caesar can see that he's nearly reached the car.
          He GRUNTS with stress as he follows the bridge into...

          INT. CHIMPANZEE HOUSE - DAY

          .the Chimpanzee House - and stops in his tracks.
          This is the source of the APE NOISE. It has an open, indoor
          area in the center, bordered by cages of CHIMPANZEES.
          Caesar's TAKEN ABACK BY THE LOUD, DARK FORMS POUNDING AROUND

          THEIR CAGES.

                         DODGE
          Caesar - over here.
          Dodge stands at a cage door. Caesar sprints for it, as for
          salvation-but AS SOON AS HE CROSSES THE THRESHOLD, HE

          REALIZES IT'S A DEAD END.
          He turns, but DODGE SHUTS THE DOOR IN HIS FACE AND LOCKS IT.

          CAESAR FINDS HIMSELF TRAPPED IN A 10' BY 10' CAGE.

                         DODGE (CONT'D)
          Stupid monkey.

          FOR A MOMENT CAESAR'S IN SHOCK, HIS MIND UNABLE TO PROCESS

          THE BETRAYAL.
          Then he begins frantically grabbing at the bars, jumping to
          the ceiling, searching for a way out.
          To his left: the faces of THREE HUGE, AGITATED CHIMPANZEES
          pound the concrete floor, YELLING at him. To his right:

          THREE MORE CHIMPANZEES.
          Caesar lets out a PRIMAL, BLOOD-CURDLING SCREAM. WE FOLLOW
          THE SCREAM as it spreads out over the property...

          EXT. MOVING CAR - DAY

          .and finds the Will's car, driving down the winding road,
          away from the Ranch.

          INT. MOVING CAR - DAY

          Will keeps driving, TEARS streaming down his face.

          48.

          INT. CAESAR'S CAGE -- LATER

          Time has passed. Long shadows of late afternoon.
          Caesar sits on a bed of twigs and straw in a corner of the
          cage, heavy head resting on his arms.
          He slowly becomes conscious of a RHYTHMIC SCRAPING NOISE,
          followed by a LOUD BANG. He looks up.
          In the cage next door, Caesar sees a strapping, MUSCULAR

          CHIMP, JET BLACK, WITH A LONG SCAR RUNNING DOWN HIS FOREHEAD

          ACROSS HIS NOSE, PAST HIS MOUTH AND CHIN.
          This is ROCKET.
          He shoves a PLASTIC 'PLAY REFRIGERATOR' across the cage
          floor... then SLAMS IT AGAINST THE WALL.
          He repeats this movement over and over - all the time with a
          challenging eye to Caesar.

          SCRAPE AGAINST CONCRETE... BAM! SCRAPE... BAM!
          A terrifying display of power and dominance.

          DODGE (O.S.)
          Okay, assholes. Dinner time.
          Rocket - slowly and deliberately, with a last threatening
          look to Caesar - moves off.
          Caesar crawls to the edge of his cage and peers out.
          Dodge and another animal wrangler, RODNEY, move from cage to
          cage, SHOVELING PRIMATE CHOW INTO TROUGHS. Rodney tosses in
          an occasional rotted vegetable.
          The APES enthusiastically receive the food. Dodge shovels
          food into Caesar's trough. Caesar stares down at the wet-
          looking dog food.

                         DODGE (CONT'D)
          Mmmm mmm. Grade A primate chow.
          Bet you don't get none of that in
          the suburbs.
          Caesar reaches into the disgusting goop and THROWS A HANDFUL
          IN DODGE'S FACE. The apes SCREAM with LAUGHTER. Rodney
          looks away so Dodge doesn't see him laughing too.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          49.

                         DODGE (CONT'D)
          Think that's funny? That funny to
          you, you hairy prick?
          Caesar stares at Dodge... then SHOOTS HIM THE FINGER.

                         RODNEY
          Look at that!
          Infuriated, Dodge grabs a hose, drags it to Caesar's cage.

                         DODGE
          One thing you can count on: Long as
          there are humans on this earth,
          you'll always be a monkey in a
          cage.
          The BURST from the HOSE sends Caesar flying backwards.
          Pinned into a corner, he curls himself into a ball, using his
          back as a shield.
          The water BLAST is relentless.
          Eventually, Dodge turns the water off. The two men take a
          long look at Caesar. He's left battered and soaked on the
          floor.

                         RODNEY
          What about his clothes? Might
          cause problems with the other apes.

                         DODGE
          Leave 'em.

          EXT. BACK YARD - DAY

          Walter's frail hand runs along the cold rail of Caesar's
          swing set. Empty. Useless in the back yard.
           The Aide stands nearby, sending a text message.

          INT. WILL'S HOUSE - DAY

          Will looks terrible. He's unshaven, pale, drawn. He sits on
          the sofa, surrounded by reminders of Caesar - puzzles, games,
          etc. The newspaper's unread beside him.

           WALTER (O.S.)
           John?
           Walter enters, looks at Will.

                         9

                         

                         

                         

                         

          50.

                         WALTER (CONT'D)
          John - where's Caesar?
          The old man looks stricken.

                         WALTER (CONT'D)
          Shouldn't we look for him? Isn't
          there something we can do?
          Will looks up at his father. He's just had an idea.

          INT. LAB CAFETERIA - DAY

          WE FOLLOW Will as he strides purposefully into the cafeteria.
          He's shaved, pulled himself together.
          Will spots Jacobs,'lunching with his Blackberry, in a corner.
          He heads for him. Jacobs looks up, sees will coming.
          Will slides into the seat across from him.

                         JACOBS
          You've been gone a week.

                         WILL
          I was sick.

                         JACOBS
          Too sick to return my calls? You
          know it was a funny thing, but I
          was watching the news and they
          started talking about a seven-year-
          old chimpanzee that went nuts - and
          all of a sudden, there you were on
          the TV. A seven year old chimp,
          raised since birth.
          The cafeteria gets a little awkward as Jacobs raises his
          voice. Neither man cares.

                         WILL
          He's the son of chimp 4. And he's
          smart. Off-the-charts smart.
          Because of the 112. The genetic
          therapy was passed in utero - from
          the mother to the son. Without a
          single negative side-effect.

                         JACOBS
          Aside from biting off a man's
          finger.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          51.

                         WILL
          He was protecting my father. The
          same way his mother was protecting
          him.

                         JACOBS
          We've had this conversation
          already. We knew the 112 was
          making the apes smart -

                         WILL

                         (INTERRUPTING)
          I tried the 112 on my father.
          A conversation stopper. Jacobs is stunned. That's the
          effect Will was after.

                         WILL (CONT'D)
          I had a sample vial.

                         JACOBS
          You're out of your mind.
          Like a chess player, Will lets the unasked question sit
          there. And Jacobs is undeniably, voraciously curious.

                         WILL
          Don't you want to know if it
          worked?
          Jacobs can't resist...

                         JACOBS
          Did it?

                         WILL
          It was miraculous. Unquestionable
          adult neurogenesis - development of
          fresh nerve tissue.

                         (BEAT)
          It brought my father back.
          But Jacobs is confused.

                         JACOBS
          You told me he was failing.

                         WILL
          It's just like with the mice.
          Alzheimer's is a progressive
          disease, you need to keep it at bay
          â¢ - you need boosters.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          52.
          Will can see Jacobs turning this over in his mind - the
          possibilities. The money.

                         JACOBS
          Why have you waited so long to tell
          me this?

                         WILL
          I couldn't risk losing him.

                         JACOBS
          'Him'?

                         WILL
          Caesar.

                         JACOBS
          The ape?
          Jacobs looks at his old friend, wondering about his sanity.

                         WILL
          We've discovered a safe treatment.
          It's the payday you've been waiting
          for. I'll recreate the primate
          version of 112 for you.

                         (BEAT)
          But only under one condition.
          It takes Jacobs a moment before he gets outraged.

                         JACOBS
          You're giving me conditions? I
          could have you arrested for what
          you've done.

                         WILL
          But you won't - you need me to
          build the drug. Here's what I
          need: I want you to get Caesar
          back.

                         JACOBS

                         (THROWN)
          How the hell can I do that?

                         WILL
          However they do things in your part
          of the world. Get attorneys into
          it. Write checks. Slip cash into
          the right pockets.
          (pausing for emphasis)
          Make it happen.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          53.

          INT. CHIMPANZEE HOUSE/CAESAR'S CAGE - MORNING

          Early morning sun through the tiny window of Caesar's cage.
          He wakes shivering with cold. Notices that the other cages
          are empty - that his cage door is open.
          Tentatively, he makes his way into the common area.

          INT. CHIMPANZEE HOUSE/COMMON AREA - MORNING

          Caesar looks around. No chimps. The hose lies on the wet
          floor, along with the detritus of feeding time.
          He can HEAR the APES in the distance.
          Caesar tries the GATE/DOOR to the outside. LOCKED. He
          pauses, then makes his way toward the BRIDGE.

          EXT. ATRIUM/BRIDGE - MORNING

           Caesar walks across the bridge. To his left, (connecting to
          the bridge) he sees TWO MORE APE HOUSES CONNECTING TO THE

                         BRIDGE:
          THE ORANGUTAN HOUSE - which is empty.
          And THE GORILLA HOUSE, which houses only one lone gorilla,
          BUCK, who stares out at Caesar. Caesar registers THE FACT
          THAT BUCK'S NOT OUT WITH THE OTHER APES. Then he moves on
          toward the atrium.
          The APES are visible inside. CAESAR GETS HIS FIRST GOOD LOOK.
          Over two dozen CHIMPANZEES and three ORANGUTANS roam around
          the atrium. The groups don't mix - chimps hang with chimps,
          orangutans with orangutans.
          They haven't noticed him yet.

          EXT. ATRIUM - DAY

          Caesar enters, heads for the tree. One by one, the apes take
          notice. They STOP AND STARE at this new arrival - DRESSED

          LIKE A HUMAN.

          HE'S ONE OF THEM, BUT LOOKS VERY SUBTLY DIFFERENT. GREEN

          EYES, FACE CONTOURED WITH SLIGHTLY HUMAN FEATURES, POSTURE

          MORE UPRIGHT...
          Caesar looks around, finds THIRTY PAIRS OF APE EYES ON HIM.
          Should he continue to the tree? Go back to the cage?

                         

                         

                         

                         

          54.
          He spots a BALL across the way. Moves to it - the eyes
          follow him. He picks it up. The eyes wait.
           Caesar rolls the ball to a nearby chimp. It receives the
          ball, gives Caesar nothing - no smile, no connection - then
          tosses it to Rocket.
          Eyes on Caesar, Rocket discards the ball like a piece of
          trash. His look is insolent, an unmistakable challenge.

          AFRAID, CAESAR TURNS, HEADS BACK TOWARD HIS CAGE. ROCKET

          SWINGS OVER A COUPLE OF BARS AND LANDS IN FRONT OF HIM.
          Caesar tries to walk around. Rocket blocks his path, reaches
          out and pulls at Caesar's sleeve, as if to examine the
          material. Caesar jerks his arm away.
          Rocket bares his teeth, raises his arms.
          Caesar considers the options - should he run? Before he can
          make a move, Rocket GRUNTS, grabs his shirt at the chest.
          Caesar tries to push Rocket away, but the larger chimp throws
          Caesar to the ground, pinning him.
          Caesar struggles to get away, accidentally SLAPPING Rocket
          across the face.
          OUTRAGED, Rocket SLAMS his hand on Caesar's chest and starts
          POUNDING him. Caesar tries to block the blows, but they're
          coming hard and fast: his head, his stomach, his chest.
          Apes SHRIEK, jump up and down, egging Rocket on.
          Caesar manages to break loose, crawling away. Rocket grabs
          at his shirt, drags Caesar closer.
          He opens his mouth wide, moving sharp teeth toward Caesar's
          face. Caesar struggles, barely holds him off - and...

          .ROCKET BITES HIS ARM. BLOOD SPURTS.
          BAM! A SHOT RINGS OUT. Chimps scatter.
          Stunned, Rocket spins around - HIS MOUTH FULL OF CAESAR'S
          BLOOD - AND SEES DODGE OUTSIDE THE CAGE, RIFLE IN HAND. He
          pulls a TRANQUILIZING DART from his shoulder.
          Caesar starts to move off -

          BAM! DODGE SHOOTS A TRANQUILIZER DART INTO THE SIDE OF

          CAESAR'S NECK - HE GRABS AT THIS THROAT AND FALLS.

          BAM! DODGE SHOOTS ROCKET AGAIN.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          55.
          Caesar rolls over to look up... as Rocket topples onto him.
          Out cold.

          INT. RANCH INFIRMARY - DAY

          Caesar lies on a medical table, NECK AND LEFT ARM BANDAGED.
          His shirt's ripped, and he's still wearing the khaki pants,
          now filthy and torn. TIGHT STRAPS RUN ACROSS HIS CHEST,

          PINNING HIM TO THE TABLE.
          It's a small room furnished with meagre medical equipment.
          Rocket's across the way, unconscious but breathing,
          restrained to a medical table.
          Caesar opens his eyes. Takes a moment to get his bearings.

                         VOICE
          Caesar.
          Stewart stands over him. The light shines'behind her head.

                         STEWART
          Do you remember me? I'm Dr.
          Stewart.
          She hands him a cup of water with a straw.

                         STEWART (CONT'D)
          Drink.
          Caesar doesn't want the water. He signs. She clearly
          doesn't understand. He signs again.

                         STEWART (CONT'D)
          I don't understand.
          Caesar's desperate. He opens his mouth, makes a LONG, LOW
          SOUND. She's taken aback - is he trying to speak?

                         STEWART (CONT-D)
          Can you show me? Show me what you
          need.
          Caesar pulls at the restraints.

                          STEWART (CONT'D)
           I can't take those off.
           Caesar sags with defeat, overcome with DESPAIR.

                         0

                         

                         

                         

                         

          56.

                         STEWART (CONT'D)
          I'm sorry this has happened,
          Caesar. So sorry.
          Stewart stares at him. Moved at the complexity of his
          emotion, the obvious intelligence behind his pain.

                         STEWART (CONT'D)
          I'm here once a week. I'll do my
          best to look after you.

          EXT. STORAGE SHED - DAY

          Dodge pulls heavy bags of Primate Chow from a truck, stacking
          them in a SHED. He spots Stewart striding towards him, and--
          Ducks out of sight, vainly brushing back his hair.

          STEWART (O.S.)
          What were you thinking?

                         DODGE
          oh, hey Doc.

                         STEWART
          That chimp needs protection.
          Dodge's face falls.

                         STEWART (CONT'D)
          You could've gotten him killed.

                         DODGE

                         (A LIE)
          I told Rodney not to open his cage.

                         STEWART
          Can't you see how sensitive he is?
          How intelligent?

                         DODGE
          Yeah, no, he's a real smart
          dresser.

                         STEWART
          I want him moved to the orangutan
          house. He'll be safe there until
          we re-introduce him to the group.

                         DODGE
          I'm sorry, since when do volunteer
          animal doctors make the rules
          around here?

                         

                         

                         

                         

          57.

                         STEWART
          Please. Just do it.

                         DODGE
          Whatever you say, doc.
          Dodge returns to stacking the chow.

                         DODGE (CONT'D)
          You're the one with the college
          education.

          INT. 'VIRUS FACTORY', GEN-SYS LABS - DAY

          A spinning machine, test tubes, a giant propagation tank.
          Empty canisters labeled ADENOVIRUS 113.
          REVEAL WILL in the doorway, watching it all very carefully.
          A VIRUS TECHNICIAN approaches him. He's tentative, nervous.

                         VIRUS TECHNICIAN
          Dr. Rodman - I think there's been a
          mistake.
          Will's been waiting for this observation - he's surprised it
          took so long to come up.

          VIRUS TECHNICIAN (CONT'D)
          I've double-checked the replication
          rate of the 113 - and it's
          enormously fast compared to the

          112.

                         WILL
          That's why we're using it. We need
          the drug quickly.

                         VIRUS TECHNICIAN
          But... isn't it risky? I mean, at
          this rate of propagation, we
          greatly increase the possibility of
          mutations that are out of our
          control. It's a highly unstable -

                         WILL
          I appreciate your concern - but
          it's going to be fine. We plan on
          taking precautions.
          The Technician pauses, not entirely satisfied. But Will's
          look tells him the conversation is over.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          58.

          BEEP BEEP BEEP...

          EXT. GEN-SYS LABORATORIES -- DAY

           A large truck backs onto a loading dock. Will watches as a
           NEW GROUP OF CHIMPANZEES are unloaded from the truck and
          brought into the lab.

          INT. WILL'S STUDY - NIGHT

           Will's in his sweats, working. DOORBELL.

          EXT. WILL'S HOUSE - NIGHT

           Will opens the door to FIND STEWART STANDING THERE. For a
          moment he's too shocked to say anything.

                         STEWART
          Sorry to drop in on you like this.
          The clinic at the zoo gave me your
          address but they didn't have a
          phone number -

                         WILL

                         (RECOVERING)
          Don't worry about it. You want to
          come in?

          INT. WILL'S HOUSE - NIGHT

           They stand awkwardly by the door. She looks great.

                          WILL
          Can I - you want a cup of coffee or
          something?

                         STEWART
          No - thanks. I just wanted to let
          you know that I've seen Caesar.
          Seen Caesar?

                         WILL
          How?

                         STEWART
          I volunteer once a week at The
          Ranch.

                         WILL
          Is he alright?
          She hesitates, wanting to be honest but not alarming.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          59.

                         STEWART
          Yeah. He had a rough start, but
          things should get smoother from now
          on...
          In the other room, Walter and his Aide become visible. Will
          follows Stewart's curious gaze.

                         WILL
          That's my dad. He's not doing too
          well.

                         STEWART
          Oh. Sorry.

                         (BEAT)
          Anyway, Caesar's going to be okay.
          I'm looking after him.

                         WILL
          Thank you... I appreciate that.
          Awkward beat.

                         STEWART
          Well. If you give me your number
          I'll let you know from time to time
          how things are going -

                         WILL
          Let's grab a drink.
          Takes her by surprise. Maybe takes him by surprise too.
          She's happy he asked.

                         STEWART
          Love to.

          EXT. RANCH GROUNDS - NIGHT

          Nighttime.

          INT. ORANGUTAN HOUSE - NIGHT

          A repulsive bowl of primate chow. Caesar - bandaged, beat-up
          and miserable - picks at it. In the next cage, the
          orangutans sleep.
          ROCK AND ROLL MUSIC. Dodge and Rodney drive up in a truck,
          windows down, radio blaring. Dodge gets out, cigarette in
          his mouth, and moves drunkenly to the storage shed.
          40 He emerges with two BEERS, throws one to Rodney.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          60.
          Caesar watches as Dodge offers a beer can to a chimpanzee.

                         DODGE
          Want a beer?
          The chimp reaches but Dodge pulls it away.

                         DODGE (CONT'D)
          Here's a little taste of beer...
          He unzips his fly and PISSES INTO THE CHIMP'S FEEDING TROUGH.
          Caesar watches, disgusted.

          INT. ORANGUTAN HOUSE -- MORNING


          A LEVER THROWN OPEN.
          Caesar watches as Dodge opens all the chimpanzee house cages
          in succession.
          Rodney moves to the orangutan house. CAESAR PAYS CLOSE

          ATTENTION TO THE LOCK AS IT SLIDES OPEN.

                         DODGE & RODNEY
          Move it! Let's go!
          Dodge and Rodney herd the apes from their cages, brandishing
          ELECTRIC CATTLE PRODS. The primates rouse themselves, move
          across the bridge.
          On his way out, an orangutan, MAURICE - WISE COUNTENANCE,
          ORANGE AND WHITE BEARD - takes a moment to check Caesar out,
          then moves off to join the others.
          Caesar maneuvers to get a better view.
          Rocket walks, king-like, among the apes. Caesar watches him
          push a smaller MALE aside. The Male defers, extending his
          arm forward, palm up, supplicating. ROCKET CASUALLY RUNS HIS

          HAND, PALM DOWN, OVER THE OUTSTRETCHED ONE.
          Rocket's the cock of the walk - the ALPHA MALE.
          Caesar shifts his attention to the GORILLA, Buck - still
          alone in his cage, staring through the bars, miserable.
          Why doesn't the gorilla ever get to go out?
          Then something across the ranch catches Caesar's eye: WILL'S

          CAR'S DRIVING UP TO THE OFFICE.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          61.
          His heart skips a beat. He moves to the bars, barely able to
          contain his excitement.

          EXT. RANCH GROUNDS - DAY

          Will waits at a picnic table as Dodge approaches with Caesar
          on a leash. He's immediately struck by Caesar's injured
          appearance, but he plasters a smile on his face. Caesar's
          clearly thrilled to see him.

                         WILL
          There you are! I heard what
          happened.

                         CAESAR

                         (SIGNING)
          Home now. Caesar home.
          He tugs Will away from Dodge.

                         WILL
          I'm going to get you out of here,
          but not today. I'm working on it.
          Caesar's face falls.

                         WILL (CONT'D)
          Soon. I promise.
          Will notices Dodge's ELECTRIC CATTLE PROD.

                         CAESAR

                         (SIGNING)
          Home.
          Still a question, a flicker of hope.

                         WILL
          (kills him to say it)
          Not yet. I can't yet.
          Caesar realizes: Will's going to leave him here.
          First incredulous - then outraged - Caesar turns away and
           starts walking back to his cage.

                          WILL (CONT'D)
          Wait a second - Caesar, where are
          you going?
          â¢ Caesar doesn't respond, doesn't turn, just keeps walking.
          Dodge catches up with him.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          62.

                         DODGE
          (loud enough for Will)
          No place like home, huh monkey boy?

                         WILL
          Caesar - come back here!
          He watches Caesar's retreating back, Dodge trotting alongside
          him. Realizes Caesar's nearly breaking into a run.

          EXT. ORANGUTAN HOUSE - DAY

          Dodge locks Caesar in his cell. Then moves around to the...

          EXT. STORAGE SHED - DAY

           .storage shed. He notices Will's car still parked in front
          of the office... just as -
          BAM! WILL DECKS HIM WITH A FIST TO THE FACE. Dodge hits the
          ground. Will stands over him, too livid to realize he
          might've just broken his hand.

                         WILL
          You son of a bitch.
          Dodge scrabbles to his feet, wipes the blood from his nose.

                         DODGE
          That was not a smart thing to do.
          Dodge is clearly much tougher, stronger than Will, but Will's
          too angry to care.

                         WILL
          If I find out Caesar's been hurt,
          if he's mistreated in any way, I
          swear I'll have you brought up on
          charges.
          Dodge looks towards Landon's house, restrains himself.

                         DODGE
          That wild-eyed chimp isn't yours
          any more. He's mine now.
          The truth of the statement is worse than any punch.

                         DODGE (CONT'D)
          And you're on private property.
          Now get the hell out of here.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          63.

                         WILL
          Forget jail. I'll come back and
          kill you.

          EXT. STORAGE SHED - LATER

          A bag of CHIPS AHOY COOKIES. Caesar - looking morose -
          watches as Rodney pops a cookie in his mouth and stuffs the
          bag into the shed...

          STEWART (O.S.)
          Morning Caesar.

          INT. ORANGUTAN CAGE - DAY

          The door slides open. Stewart enters, followed by Dodge.

                         STEWART
          How's your arm? Mind if I take a
          look?
          Stewart rummages in her MEDICAL BAG. CAESAR WATCHES AS SHE
          PULLS OUT A PAIR OF SCISSORS, cuts off his bandages.

                         STEWART (CONT'D)
          Looking good...
          Caesar makes eye contact with Dodge over Stewart's shoulder.
          She pulls a harness from her bag.

                         STEWART (CONT'D)
          I'm taking him out. Thought I'd
          cheer him up, show him the horses.

                         DODGE
          No way.
          As she walks to Dodge, CAESAR GLANCES INTO HER MEDICAL BAG.

                         STEWART
          What are you going to do? Use a
          cattle prod on me?

                         DODGE
          If you're into that kind of thing.

                         STEWART
          I'm safer with him than I am with
          you.

                         DODGE
          Answer's no.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          64.
          Stewart turns to Caesar, who's retreated onto a bed of straw.

                         STEWART
          I can't take you.
          (glancing at Dodge)
          Maybe another time.

          INT. ORANGUTAN CAGE - NIGHT

          RAIN. The apes sleep. Except for Caesar.
          Standing in the corner of his cage, Caesar pulls STEWART'S
          SCISSORS and a roll of MEDICAL TAPE out from the STRAW.
          He kneels at his bedding, gathering sticks and straw. Then
          he begins weaving the tape through several sticks, binding
          them and extending them end to end.
          Caesar pauses, sensing something. He looks over his
          shoulder, discovers MAURICE THE ORANGUTAN watching him.
          They hold each others' gaze, Caesar taking his measure. Then
          Caesar puts a finger to his lips. "Shhhh."
          Maurice makes no movement, but the agreement is clear.
          Caesar returns to crafting the tool.

          INT. LAB/PRIMATE HOUSE - DAY

          Dark FORMS in cages, illuminated by GREEN FLUORESCENT LIGHT.
          The DOOR OPENS. EYES OPEN, HEADS TURN.
          Will enters - WE SEE THAT HIS HAND HIS BANDAGED.
          The apes watch as he walks along the cages, eyes searching
          the dark chimpanzee faces.

          EACH LAB CHIMP HAS A DIFFERENT COLORED IDENTIFICATION WRIST

          BAND.

                         WILL
          Which one of you wants chocolate...
          Chimpanzees stare back at him, giving him nothing.
          NOISE FROM BEHIND. Will turns. Down the row, A CHIMPANZEE

          ARM EXTENDS FROM A CAGE, PALM UP - WITH A RED BAND.
          Will walks to the cage, chimp #11, reads the label beside it.

                         WILL (CONT'D)
          "Koba."

                         

                         

                         

                         

          65.
          He peers inside. Koba stares back, EYES MURKY AND SMALL

          BENEATH A HEAVILY PROTRUDING BROW, DARKENED PIGMENTATION

          STREAKS DOWN EACH CHEEK. A SINISTER FACE.
          He DROPS AN M&M INTO KOBA'S PALM. Eyes on Will, Koba secrets
          it to a "storage spot" inside the cage.
          Then he puts out his hand again.

          VOICE (O.S.)
          Nanotherapy, beta version: Male
          Test Subject Number eleven.

          INT. PRIMATE RESEARCH LAB - DAY

          Koba doesn't resist as Will straps him to the table.
          He watches as a HANDLER -- EVANS - moves into the next room,
          opens a refrigerator with a strange BIOHAZARD SYMBOL and
          pulls out CANISTER labeled ADENOVIRUS 113.
           Evans and Will each slip on HAZMAT masks, making sure they're
          secure. Then Evans hands the 113 to Will.
           All of this avidly taken in by Koba's dark eyes.
          Will inserts the adenovirus 113 nozzle into a plastic oxygen
          mask.
          Koba's eyes are on him as he brings the mask toward the
          chimp's face.

                         EVANS

                         (THROUGH MASK)
          Boy, he's a calm one, isn't he?
          Will tilts the nozzle, releasing a BLAST OF AEROSOL MIST INTO

          KOBA'S NOSE AND MOUTH.

          THE CHIMPANZEE CONVULSES ON THE TABLE.

          INT. STEWART'S KITCHEN - NIGHT

          CHOP STICKS digging into take-out Chinese. Stewart and Will
          sit in her kitchen, eating. It's clear from their state of
          dress (or undress) that they've been intimate.
          Because his hand is still bandaged, he's having a hard time
          with the chopsticks.

                         STEWART
          You actually punched him?

                         

                         

                         

                         

          66.

                         WILL
          I did.
          She thinks it's funny.

                         STEWART
          I've been wanting to do that since
          the day I met him.

                         WILL
          I don't advise it. My hand's
          killing me.

                         STEWART
          Here. Let me help you out.
          She begins feeding him the Chinese food. He puts down his
          chopsticks.

                         WILL
          I'm going to get him out of there.

                         STEWART
          I know you are.

                         WILL
          And I'm going to get my dad back
          too.

          INT. ORANGUTAN HOUSE - NIGHT

          Caesar tapes sticks together. WE SEE that he's created a
          THREE-FOOT LONG "ARM". He tapes the scissors firmly to its
          end, finger holes sticking out. Finished.
          Silently he moves to the edge of the cage. USING THE

          CONTRAPTION, HE LOOPS THE FINGER HOLES OVER THE LATCH.
          He tries once. Misses. Twice. Misses again. Caesar keeps
          trying... until finally the loop's in place.
          Then he begins to tug. Tug. Tug. CLICK - the LATCH OPENS.
          He glances over to Maurice, who silently watches.
          Caesar pushes open the cage door. MAURICE'S EYES FOLLOW HIM

          INTO THE NIGHT.

          EXT. BRIDGE AREA - NIGHT

          Caesar walks across the bridge. He passes the entrance to
          the chimpanzee house - and keeps going.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          67.

          EXT. GORILLA HOUSE - NIGHT

          He arrives at the Gorilla House.
          Buck's visible in his cage, asleep on a bed of straw. Caesar
          unlocks the door latch and opens the cage door.
          He waits, but Buck doesn't budge. He's still fast asleep.
          Caesar hesitates. Then he slowly...

          INT. BUCK'S CAGE - NIGHT

          .enters the cage, edging up to the sleeping gorilla.
          From this vantage point, Buck looks enormous, his vast chest
          rising and falling with sleep. Caesar very carefully wiggles
          his toe.
          There's a GRUNT and a WHIRL OF BLACK FURRY MOVEMENT. Caesar
          finds himself staring into the huge, angry gorilla face.
          Caesar - nervous - beckons toward the open door.
           Buck understands but can't believe it. For a moment he
           doesn't move. Caesar makes the gesture again -- "Come on,
          let's go."
           Before he can finish, Buck bursts past him...

          EXT. BRIDGE - NIGHT

          .across the bridge...

          EXT. ATRIUM - NIGHT

          .and into the atrium. Caesar follows.
          The full moon shines down on Buck, the tree, the climbing
          structure.
          The gorilla feels his feet on the grass, savoring every step.
          Then he begins to run. He runs as fast as he can, all the
          way across the atrium, then all the way back.
          Back and forth, GORILLA WIND SPRINTS of freedom.
          Caesar stands back, silently watching.

          EXT. STORAGE SHED - MORNING

          A morning like any other. Dodge goes through his routine:
          0 opening the door, wheeling out a wheelbarrow.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          68.
          He makes his way to the ape houses.

          EXT. GORILLA HOUSE - MORNING

          Dodge and his wheelbarrow approach the Gorilla House. Closer
          and closer to the cage... until they're right in front.
          The CAGE DOOR'S CLOSED, BUCK INSIDE. Dodge shovels primate
          chow into the gorilla's trough.

          BUCK TAKES A HANDFUL AND LOOKS ACROSS TO CAESAR, WHO RETURNS

          HIS GAZE FROM THE ORANGUTAN HOUSE.

          INT. ORANGUTAN CAGE - MORNING

          Caesar senses something: Maurice is staring at him. Caesar 's
          beginning to wonder what Maurice wants when the ORANGUTAN

          DOES SOMETHING REMARKABLE: HE USES SIGN LANGUAGE.

                         MAURICE
          Happy gorilla.
          Caesar's shocked.

                         MAURICE (CONT'D)
          Surprise.

                         CAESAR
          Signing orangutan.

                         MAURICE
          Maurice circus orangutan.

                         CAESAR
          More ape sign?

                         MAURICE
          No. Maurice alone.
          They HEAR DODGE'S WHEELBARROW APPROACH.

                         CAESAR
          Careful. Stupid human no like
          smart ape.
          Dodge begins shoveling primate chow into the troughs.
          Maurice and Caesar stop signing and blend in.

          INT. CHIMPANZEE HOUSE/ROCKET'S CAGE - NIGHT

          Rocket sleeps. Pieces of primate chow hit him in the head.
          He wakes with a start. SEES THAT HIS CAGE DOOR IS OPEN.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          69.
          Rocket gets to his feet, sees CAESAR STANDING IN THE COMMON

          AREA.
          Rocket GRUNTS and sprints after him - through the chimpanzee
          common area - toward the door -
          Where WHAM! CAESAR WHACKS HIM IN THE HEAD WITH ROCKET'S

          PLASTIC REFRIGERATOR.

          ROCKET STAGGERS, TRYING TO RECOVER, AND LANDS ON HIS BUTT.

          HE LOOKS UP TO SEE CAESAR... AND BEHIND HIM, STANDING LIKE A

          MOUNTAIN: BUCK.
          Buck raises his arms and SLAMS them down with a MIGHTY ROAR;
          Caesar slings the plastic refrigerator aside, sending it
          SKITTERING across the CONCRETE.
          The chimpanzees, awake now, watch to see what will happen.
          Rocket looks from Buck to Caesar. He's beaten.

          STRETCHING OUT HIS HAND, PALM UP, ROCKET MAKES THE

          SUPPLICATING GESTURE. CAESAR RUNS HIS HAND - PALM DOWN -

          OVER ROCKET'S, SEALING HIS DOMINATION.
          A COLLECTIVE GASP OF AWE moves through the ho-use.
          Rocket crawls back to his cage, defeated. Caesar - walking
          at full height - follows. He CLOSES ROCKET'S CAGE DOOR AND

          LOCKS HIM IN.
          Then Caesar walks upright around the cages once more, making
          eye contact with each and every chimpanzee. He exits with
          his Lieutenant, Buck, in tow.

          CHIMPANZEE HOUSE HAS A NEW ALPHA MALE.

          INT. PRIMATE RESEARCH LAB - DAY

          Will and Evans (the handler) are wearing hazmat masks as they
          administer Adenovirus 113 to chimp after chimp.
          Chimp after chimp convulses on the table.
          They lead Koba to the table. Koba knows what to do. He lies
          down, allows himself to be strapped in.
          All routine. Everyone's guard is down.
          But as soon as the BLAST OF AEROSOL MIST is released, KOBA

          â¢ THRASHES OUT AN ARM, HITTING EVANS IN THE SIDE OF THE HEAD.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          70.

                         WILL
          Hold him steady!
          Evans tightens the straps on Koba's flailing arm.

          WE SEE THAT EVANS' MASK HAS BEEN KNOCKED ASKEW.
          Will finishes administering the drug. Koba goes limp on the
          table.

                         WILL (CONT'D)
          You okay Evans?

                         EVANS
          Yeah. I'm good.

          INT. PRIMATE RESEARCH LAB - DAY

          Will demonstrates the "Tower of Hanoi" puzzle. Koba watches.

                         WILL
          You can't put larger blocks on top
          of smaller ones.
          (pointing to right side)
          Move the stack from here to here.
          Koba takes the puzzle and ROTATES IT 180 DEGREES CLOCKWISE,

          SO THAT THE LEFT STACK IS INDEED NOW ON THE RIGHT SIDE.
          Will looks at Koba. Koba looks back.

                         WILL (CONT'D)

                         (DEMONSTRATING)
          You've got to take the blocks off
          and stack them again, like this.
          Will turns the puzzle back around.

                         WILL (CONT'D)
          Let's see you try.
          Koba puts out a palm - asking for an M&M.

                         WILL (CONT'D)
          I'll give you an M&M if you can get
          the blocks to the other side - but
          don't do it the way you did last
          time.
          Koba thinks, then ROTATES THE PUZZLE AGAIN - THIS TIME
          COUNTERCLOCKWISE. Ingenious in its own way.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          71.

                         WILL (CONT'D)
          You know what I want. You're just
          not going to give it to me.
          Koba puts out a palm. There's A LOOK IN HIS EYE, MALEVOLENT,

          DISQUIETING.

          AND SOMETHING ELSE: HIS EYES HAVE CHANGED. THEY LOOK

          SOMEWHAT LIKE CAESAR'S - GREENER, LESS SIMIAN...

          WILL (V.0.) (CONT'D)
          What do you think of Koba?

          INT. PRIMATE HOUSE - DAY

           We look through cage bars at Will and Franklin, who stand far
          away, across the room.

                          FRANKLIN
           You wanna know if I think the 113's
           making him nuts.

                         WILL
          I know he's smart. But there's
          something else, something
          worrisome. He challenges me.
          Taunts me.
          Will looks toward us, toward the bars.

                         WILL (CONT'D)
          (almost to himself)
          I don't want to try it on...

                         (CATCHES HIMSELF)
          .I don't want to start human
          trials if there's any chance of
          danger.

                         FRANKLIN
          What you're seeing has nothing to
          do with the 113, Doc. The apes're
          just like us - they're complex.
          Some are loyal, some are selfish,
          some have a good sense of humor.
          And some are born rotten.
          Koba moves into frame. We've been watching from his point of
          view, from inside the cage.
          Now we look over his shoulder, where the sharp planes of his
          â¢ face frame the two men across the room.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          72.

                         FRANKLIN (CONT'D)
          This one's a bad apple, that's all.
          A chill runs down Will's spine.

          EXT. GEN-SYS LABORATORIES/MAIN GATE - DAY

          A car pulls up to the gate. Evans is driving. He looks ill.

                         GUARD

                         (OPENING GATE)
          Early day today, Evans?

                         EVANS
          Actually I'm not feeling too good.

          EVANS GETS A SHIVER.

                         GUARD
          You know what: Whiskey, lemon,
          honey and a cup of hot water.
          Never fails.

                         EVANS
          Thanks - I'm on it.
          Evans drives off.

          EXT. PADDOCK - DAY

          Stewart sits atop one of the ranch horses, looking down at
          the chimpanzee area.
          She watches CAESAR walking across the bridge. Caesar moves
          easily among the apes, his Alpha Male status clear as the
          others make way for him.
          Stewart's relieved - and a little surprised - to see Caesar
          so at ease with the other apes.

          INT. CHIMPANZEE HOUSE - DAY

          ROCKET'S MISERABLE. Dodge and Rodney watch him through the
          bars.

                         RODNEY
          Still won't eat, won't come out.

                         DODGE
          I can fix that.
          Dodge drags the hose to Rocket's cage.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          73.

                         DODGE (CONT'D)
          Get that monkey ass out of there!

          INT. ORANGUTAN CAGE - DAY

          Caesar watches Dodge BLAST Rocket with WATER. Rocket doesn't
          struggle, doesn't fight back. The harsh jet pelts his back.

          INT. CHIMPANZEE HOUSE/ROCKET'S CAGE - NIGHT

          Rocket sleeps. The FEEDER BIN OPENS AND SHUTS, waking him.
          Tentatively, Rocket peers inside the bin: A COOKIE. Never
          seen a cookie before. Rocket picks it up. Smells it. Takes
          a taste. Wow. He gobbles it down.
          At that moment Rocket's CAGE DOOR OPENS.
          Caesar stands holding a LARGE BAG OF CHIPS AHOY. He tosses a
          cookie to Rocket. Beckons him out of the cage.

          INT. CHIMPANZEE HOUSE/COMMON AREA - NIGHT

          Rocket exits warily, on his guard for anything...
          But Caesar simply stands with the cookie bag. No gorilla.
          No shovel.
          He hands the cookie bag to Rocket.
          Rocket watches - confused - as CAESAR PULLS THE MAIN LEVER,

          OPENING ALL THE CAGES AT ONCE.
          CHIMPS EMERGE, bewildered.
          Rocket stands with the cookie bag, unsure what to do. Caesar
          makes a motion with his hand.
          Now Rocket understands. He gives a cookie to the nearest
          chimp. Then another one. Then another.
          The chimps go crazy for the cookies. THEY GATHER AROUND

          ROCKET, WHO PROUDLY DISTRIBUTES THEM. A TRANSFORMATIVE

          MOMENT - ROCKET'S FOUND HIS FOOTING.
          Now Caesar opens the orangutan and gorilla cages. A moment
          of discomfort as Caesar leads the other apes in.
          Caesar pulls an orangutan over to Rocket. Rocket hands the
          orangutan a cookie. The other orangutans and Buck
          immediately line up. Discomfort's gone - now it's one big
          â¢ party.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          74.
           Caesar watches, satisfied, as the apes feast together.

          EXT. ATRIUM/TREE - DAY

          Caesar sits high in the tree, looking down at the apes.
          Rocket's part of the group again, but no longer the Alpha.
          Caesar's got his eye on CORNELIA, a FEMALE APE, standing with
          a group of females. He follows her movements with his
          eyes...
          Maurice climbs up next to Caesar.

                         MAURICE
          Why cookie Rocket?

                         CAESAR
          Need strong. All apes strong.

                         MAURICE
          No understand.
          Caesar grabs a small twig off the tree and BREAKS IT.

                         CAESAR
          Gorilla.
          He breaks another twig.

                         CAESAR (CONT'D)
          Orangutan.
          He breaks another.

                         CAESAR (CONT'D)
          Chimpanzee.
          He grabs a bunch of twigs and holds them together - now they
          can't be broken.

                         CAESAR (CONT'D)
          Apes.

          EXT. WILL'S HOUSE - MORNING

          Establishing shot. A beautiful morning.

          INT. WILL'S HOUSE - MORNING

          Will's getting ready for his day. Hair wet from the shower,
          buttoning up his shirt, he pauses to pour himself a cup of
          coffee, look up at the clock.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          75.
          He takes a sip, heads down the hall to his father's room.

                         WILL
          Someone's sleeping late today -
          Will opens the door - and FREEZES IN HIS TRACKS.

                         WILL (CONT'D)
          Dad?

          EXT. CEMETERY - DAY

          LONG SHOT of Will sitting at a gravesite service, surrounded
          by twenty-odd PEOPLE. WE RECOGNIZE Stewart, Jacobs, one of
          the Aides.

          EXT. RANCH - DAY

          Will waits at the picnic table. He's been there a while.
          Finally Rodney appears.

                         RODNEY
          Sorry - can't get him to come out.
          He won't budge.

                         WILL
          He knows I'm here?

                         RODNEY
          I told him.
          Will brushes by Rodney, heads for the cages.

                         RODNEY (CONT'D)
          Hey - you are not allowed back

                         THERE -
          Will ignores him, keeps going.

          EXT. ORANGUTAN CAGE - DAY

          Caesar sees Will coming. He turns his back, heads to a
          common area away from the bars.
          Will runs up to the cage.

                         WILL
          Caesar - please! I've got
          something to tell you -

                         (BEAT)
          It's about Walter.

                         Â¢

                         

                         

                         

                         

          76.
          WE FIND CAESAR deep out of sight in the orangutan cage. He' s
          heard Will's words.
          Will waits. Caesar's not coming out.

          NEWSCASTER (O.S.)

          Will sits with a glass of Scotch, watching TV. Stewart's

                         WILL
          I was too late.
          She puts the photo down, cuddles against him.

                         STEWART
          You tried. You worked really hard.
          Walter knew that.

                         WILL
          Wasn't good enough though, was it.
          ANGLE ON THE PHOTOGRAPH. It shows a younger Walter and his
          two teenage sons...

          Crummy little place. TV's on with no sound. WE HEAR

          REVEAL EVANS, LYING IN BED, DEAD - a streak of brown dried
          blood across his cheek -- as if draining from his lifeless
          eye.

          EXT. RANCH - NIGHT

          Deep night at the ranch. A moon half-hidden by clouds.

          INT. ORANGUTAN CAGE - NIGHT

          Caesar uses his contraption to get out of the cage. Maurice
          grabs his arm.

                         MAURICE
          Where go?

                         CAESAR
          Find Mother.

          EXT. RANCH/PRIMATE HOUSES - NIGHT

          Caesar slips out of the orangutan house, heads toward the

          GATE.
          As he passes the chimpanzee house HE HEARS A CHIMPANZEE CALL
          OUT. He turns. Finds Rocket staring out at him, wanting to
          go with him.
          Caesar hesitates. Rocket CALLS OUT LOUDER.
          To quiet him, Caesar walks over to Rocket's cage, but as he
          gets closer, he sees something that gives him pause: ROCKET'S

          EYES HAVE CHANGED.
          Caesar gets right up against the bars of Rocket's cage, takes
          Rocket's face in his hands and looks into his eyes: THEY ARE

          UNMISTAKABLY GREEN.
          Reeling, Caesar tries to make sense of this. And then he
          remembers the bite. Rocket bit him. He looks down at the
          wound on his arm, now nearly healed.
          Has Caesar's blood changed Rocket?
          Caesar opens Rocket's'cage. The chimp emerges, ready for
          anything.

          EXT. CHIMPANZEE HOUSE - NIGHT

           Caesar and Rocket barrel across the ranch, past the living
          â¢ quarters, past the barn, onto the winding road leading away.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          78.

          EXT. NEAR-DESERTED TWO LANE HIGHWAY - NIGHT

          Middle of the night, only a few cars.
          Caesar and Rocket stick to bushes and shadows. They wait for
          a break in traffic, cross the highway.

          EXT. OUTSKIRTS OF TOWN - NIGHT

          In the distance the LIGHTS of the TOWN give a glow to the
          night sky. Caesar and Rocket gallop toward it.

          EXT. SUBURBAN STREET - NIGHT

          Dark, quiet. RUSTLING IN THE TREES, as if a storm is coming.

          SUDDENLY CAESAR BURSTS THROUGH, SWINGING FOR THE NEXT TREE
          A moment later ROCKET FOLLOWS.
          Swinging from tree to tree, they make their way down the
          suburban street.

          INT. WILL'S BEDROOM - NIGHT


          CLOSE ON WILL'S SLEEPING FACE.

          CREAK, CREAK... CREAK, CREAK.
          WILL'S WAKENED by the NOISE. What is that?

          CREAK, CREAK. . .CREAK, CREAK.
          It's coming from outside.
          REVEAL STEWART asleep next to Will. He gets out of bed,
          moves to the window, looks into the back yard.

          THE SWING MOVES BACK AND FORTH, AS IF RECENTLY OCCUPIED.
          Will scans the grounds - no movement, nothing to see.
          Satisfied, he climbs back in bed and closes his eyes.

          THAT'S WHEN A SHADOW PASSES OVER THE BED.
          It's CAESAR'S SILHOUETTE, noiselessly emerging from the
          darkness.
          He stands there, looking down at Will and Stewart.
          His face is impossible to read.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          79.

          INT. WILL'S LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

          Rocket's fascinated by photos of Caesar with Will and Walter
          along the mantle.
          Caesar emerges from Will's room and makes his way down the
          hallway.

          INT. WALTER'S ROOM - NIGHT

          Stripped bed, a couple of packed boxes. Caesar stands at the
          doorway, taking it in.

          EXT. STREET - NIGHT

          Feet pounding the pavement, Caesar and Rocket head away from
          Will's house.

          EXT. OUTSIDE LAB - NIGHT

          GEN-SYS RESEARCH SIGN. The grounds are deserted. A SECURITY
          GUARD listens to RADIO in the guard kiosk.
          Caesar and Rocket - eyes on the Security Guard - stop at a
          spot hidden by a tree and scale the fence.

          EXT. LAB GROUNDS - NIGHT

          Caesar and Rocket drop down to the grass. They SNIFF THE
          AIR, head toward the Primate House.

          INT. SECURITY KIOSK - NIGHT

          The Security Guard yawns, checks his watch. Over his
          shoulder, on a monitor, WE SEE the dark forms of two
          chimpanzees run across the grounds.

          EXT. PRIMATE HOUSE - NIGHT

          Caesar and Rocket arrive at the Primate House. Caesar tries
          the big double door - locked. He looks upward, spies a ROW
          OF AWNING WINDOWS near the roof.
          Rocket pushes a dumpster close to the building wall.
          Then Caesar jumps on the dumpster and catapults himself to
          the window's ledge. Hanging by one arm, he swings himself in
          through the window.
          Rocket follows.

                         0

                         

                         

                         

                         

          80.

          INT. PRIMATE HOUSE/OFFICE NIGHT

          Franklin's got the graveyard shift. He's watching a movie on
          the office computer - doesn't hear anything.

          INT. PRIMATE HOUSE - NIGHT

          Eerie, darkly lit. SLEEPING CHIMPS stir. CAESAR and ROCKET
          drop to the cement floor.
          Now they have a clear view of the cramped cages, DARKENED
          FIGURES INSIDE. Caesar walks alongside them, peering into
          each one, studying the shadowy, simian faces.

          A HAIRY ARM EXTENDS THROUGH THE BARS, PALM UP - IT HAS A RED

          BAND AROUND ITS WRIST.

          IT'S OFFERING AN M&M.
          Caesar approaches the cage... FINDS HIMSELF FACE TO FACE WITH

          KOBA.

          HIS EYES ARE BEADY, A STEELY GREY.

          THE TWO CHIMPANZEES SIZE EACH OTHER UP. EACH SENSES

          SOMETHING IN THE OTHER, BUT NEITHER KNOWS WHAT IT IS.
          Caesar moves on. HE'S INTENT, LOOKING FOR SOMEONE.
          Rocket barrels forward, grabs the M&M from Koba's hand.
          Koba offers up ANOTHER M&M. But ROCKET'S EYES ARE ON THE RED

          IDENTIFICATION BAND - THAT'S WHAT HE WANTS.

          KOBA CAN SEE THIS. HE OFFERS IT UP - IN RETURN FOR OPENING

          HIS CAGE.

          ROCKET CONSIDERS A MOMENT, THEN MOVES TO THE LATCH.
          ANGLE ON Caesar.
          He's nearly reached the last of the cages, and the

          DISAPPOINTMENT IS PLAIN ON HIS FACE.
          These chimpanzees are distant, strange. No familiar face.

          NO CONNECTION.
          Caesar reaches the last cage, where A YOUNG CHIMP, sick,
          stares back at him.
          Caesar turns away, crestfallen.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          81.
          He YELLS for ROCKET, and the two of them take off. The LAB
          CHIMPS start to SCREAM.

          INT. PRIMATE HOUSE/OFFICE - NIGHT

           HEARING THE COMMOTION, Franklin puts down his book, heads...

          INT. PRIMATE HOUSE - NIGHT

          .into the Primate House. Where he stops in his tracks.

          KOBA STANDS IN THE MIDDLE OF THE ROOM, UPRIGHT.
          They stare at each other.
          Then Koba LEAPS FOR HIM.

          EXT. LAB GROUNDS/GUARD KIOSK - NIGHT

          Caesar and Rocket head for the fence. A GUARD approaches on
          his nightly rounds.
          They look at each other, lay low.
          To protect Caesar, Rocket takes off running. The SHOCKED

          SECURITY GUARD SEES HIM, GIVES CHASE, FUMBLES FOR HIS WALKIE-

          TALKIE.
          But Rocket's too fast - in a moment he's out of sight.

          EXT. ROAD OUTSIDE LAB - NIGHT

          Caesar's waiting when Rocket runs up. They take off
          together.

          INT. CHIMPANZEE HOUSE - NIGHT

          Caesar and Rocket enter. That's when WE NOTICE: CAESAR'S

          KHAKI PANTS ARE GONE - HE'S NO LONGER DRESSED LIKE A HUMAN.
          Caesar opens Rocket's cage. As soon as the door closes
          behind him, the huge chimp collapses, exhausted.
          Caesar walks around the chimpanzee house, images of the night
          swirling through his head. Around him, the chimps sleep,
          oblivious.
          Except for CORNELIA - she's wide awake. Staring at him.

           INT. PRIMATE HOUSE - NIGHT

           The apes have calmed down. Koba slips back into his cage and
          â¢ closes the door.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          82.
          CLICK. It locks into place.

          EXT. RANCH GROUNDS - EARLY MORNING

          Dawn of a new day.

          INT. CHIMPANZEE HOUSE/CORNELIA'S CAGE - EARLY MORNING

          Sunlight reaches through the bars and streaks across Caesar's
          face. He opens his eyes. Looks at Cornelia, still asleep.
          Caesar creeps toward the open entrance to her cage.

          INT. CHIMPANZEE HOUSE/COMMON AREA - EARLY MORNING

          Caesar emerges into the common area. The chimps are still
          asleep.
          There's a CLANKING as the OUTSIDE GATE OPENS.
          Caesar freezes.
          Dodge enters with the wheelbarrow of Primate Chow and the
          shovel. Locks the door behind him.
          He hasn't seen Caesar yet.

                         DODGE
          Rise and shine, assholes.
          The chimps wake. One by one they notice Caesar, standing in
          the common area.

          THEN DODGE SEES HIM.

                         DODGE (CONT'D)
          What the hell -
          (seeing Cornelia's open

                         CAGE)
          You sly son of a bitch. How'd you
          do that?
          Dodge is careful, slow, as he picks up the shovel and holds
          it in front of him.
          He circles around the common area toward Cornelia's cage.

                         DODGE (CONT'D)
          We're gonna go slow here, alright?
          You're gonna go back in your cage,
          you're not going to give me no
          trouble.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          83.
          The apes - chimps, orangutans, the gorilla - are silent,
           riveted, waiting to see what will happen.
          Cornelia stands, watching.
          Caesar doesn't take his eyes off Dodge, but his expression is
          unreadable.
          Dodge reaches Cornelia's cage. He VIOLENTLY BANGS THE SHOVEL

          AGAINST THE BARS.

                         DODGE (CONT'D)
          Back!
          Caesar reacts, a snarl curling his lips.
          Keeping his eyes on Caesar, sweat dripping down his temples,
          Dodge KICKS CORNELIA'S CAGE SHUT.
          Now he starts moving forward, trying to back Caesar toward
          the orangutan cage.

                         DODGE (CONT'D)
          We're going to have you fixed,
          Einstein, that's for damn sure...
          But first we're going to figure out
          how you pulled this off...

          CAESAR INCHES BACK, KEENLY AWARE OF EVERY APE'S EYE ON HIM.

                         DODGE (CONT'D)
          Go on. Get in that cage.
          Caesar stops, refusing to go any farther.

                         DODGE (CONT'D)
          I said get!
          But Caesar doesn't move.
          Dodge pokes the shovel at him, then SLAMS it to the cement
          floor.
          He edges closer to Caesar, grip tightening around the shovel
          handle. Then he rears it back, face contorted in rage.

                         DODGE (CONT'D)
          Get in that cage, you damn dirty
          ape!

          â¢ CAESAR'S EYES NARROW. HE STANDS TALL, STRETCHING TO HIS FULL

          HEIGHT.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          84.

          THEN HE STARES DODGE FULL IN THE EYES, DIGS DEEP, AND WITH

          TREMENDOUS EFFORT... SPEAKS.

                         CAESAR
          (with his voice)
          No!

          STUNNED SILENCE.

          THE WORLD STOPS SPINNING.
          Dodge is thunderstruck - nearly loses his balance.
          Caesar has spoken. Actually uttered a word.
          Maurice, Rocket, Buck, and all the apes stare, dumbfounded,
          trying to comprehend what has just happened.
          And then... they go nuts.

           SCREAMING. YELLING. JUMPING UP AND DOWN.
           That's when Caesar attacks.
           He rushes Dodge, wrestling the shovel from his hands.
           Dodge spins around to defend himself - and CAESAR HITS HIM IN

           THE SIDE OF THE HEAD.
          Dodge staggers back.
          Caesar SLAMS the shovel in his stomach.
          Dodge crumples forward.

          CAESAR SWINGS THE SHOVEL UP, SMACKING HIM IN THE FOREHEAD.
          Lights out.
          Caesar drags Dodge to Rocket's cage and opens the door.
          Rocket helps pull him inside.

          THEN CAESAR OPENS ALL THE DOORS TO ALL THE CAGES - AND THE

          APES COME STREAMING OUT.
          They gather around Caesar, who holds up STEWART'S SCISSORS

          AND SLICES OPEN HIS OWN PALM.
          Then he walks to Rocket, who gets down on his knees and puts
          out his hand in the supplicating gesture. CAESAR TAKES THE

          SCISSORS AND SLICES ROCKET'S PALM, THEN PRESSES THEIR TWO

          HANDS TOGETHER.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          85.
          He moves to Maurice, who offers up his hand. Caesar slices
          the palm and places his hand against it.
          Then he turns to Buck - who stands up tall, beats his chest
          and YELLS... BUT THEN OFFERS UP HIS HAND.
          And now Caesar looks around, as EVERY APE LINES UP, THEIR

          OPEN PALMS WAITING.

          INT. WILL'S BEDROOM - DAWN

          Will wakes, climbs out of bed, careful not to wake Stewart.

          INT. HALLWAY - MORNING

          He moves down the hallway, approaching Walter's room. He
          pauses, puzzled, at the door - which is AJAR.
          Strange.

          THE PHONE STARTS TO RING.
          Will ignores it -- slowly pushes the door open... AND SEES

          CAESAR'S TATTERED PANTS LAID ACROSS THE STRIPPED BED.
          He stands there, stunned.

          JACOBS (O.S.)
          Will? Hello? Will pick up the
          goddamned phone!

          INT. KITCHEN - MORNING


                         WILL
          Hello?

          INTERCUT WITH JACOBS AT THE LAB.

                         JACOBS
          The animal handler - Franklin - was
          killed last night. In the primate
          house.

                         WILL
          Franklin's dead?

                         JACOBS
          Something very powerful broke his
          neck. Snapped it in two.

                         WILL
          Could it have been one of our
          chimps?

                         

                         

                         

                         

          86.

                         JACOBS
          All our apes are accounted for - â¢
          secured in their cages. But here's
          the kicker: One of our security
          guards swears he chased a
          chimpanzee off the grounds last
          night.
          Will - with growing dread - looks out the window at Caesar's
          swing.

                         JACOBS (CONT'D)
          Where in the hell did that chimp
          come from?!

          EXT. WILL'S HOUSE -- MORNING

          Will speeds out of the driveway, Stewart by his side. She's
          dialing her cell phone.

          INT. RANCH HOUSE/LIVING ROOM - MORNING

          Mr. Landon answers the RINGING PHONE. He's in his pajamas.

          MR. LANDON
          The Ranch. Landon speaking.

                         (LISTENING)
          Hey Stewart.

                         (LISTENING)
          Caesar? Dodge fed them breakfast
          about half an hour ago...
          He holds up a PAIR OF BINOCULARS, looks toward the atrium and
          ape houses. Can't see anything wrong.

          MR. LANDON (CONT'D)
          Let me call you back...
          He HEARS THE BACK KITCHEN DOOR OPEN. RUSTLING NOISES in the
          kitchen. Opening and closing of cabinets.

          MR. LANDON (CONT'D)
          Hey Dodge - Stewart just called -
          WE FOLLOW HIM out of the living-room, into the...

          INT. RANCH/KITCHEN - MORNING

          .kitchen.

          MR. LANDON
          She said that -

                         

                         

                         

                         

          87.
          Landon goes pale. ROCKET AND TWO OTHER CHIMPANZEES ARE

          STANDING IN THE KITCHEN.

          EXT. RANCH GROUNDS - MORNING

          The two CHIMPANZEES drag Mr. Landon toward the Ape Houses.
          Rocket follows, munching cereal from a box of Cheerios.

          IN THE DISTANCE
          Rodney's visible, being dragged, SCREAMING.

          EXT. RANCH GROUNDS - DAY

          Will's car speeds up to the gate and stops.

                         STEWART

                         (ON PHONE)
          No one's answering.
          In the distance they can HEAR the PHONE RINGING at the ranch
          house. From where the car is, nothing out of the ordinary is
          visible.
          Will thinks a moment, gets out of the car.

                         WILL
          You go get help.

                         STEWART
          Not a way in the world. I'm coming
          with you.

          EXT. RANCH HOUSE - DAY

           They sneak into the back of the ranch house. All is quiet.

          INT. RANCH HOUSE - DAY

          But once inside, the level of destruction is immediately
          visible: Overturned table and chairs, plates smashed,
          cupboards emptied.

                         STEWART
          Oh my God... I'm calling 911..
          Will picks up Landon's BINOCULARS, moves to the front window.
          HE SEES: Debris everywhere. Apes free, wandering... DODGE,
          LANDON and RODNEY BATTERED AND IN CAGES.

          AND - IN THE ATRIUM - SURROUNDED BY HIS CLOSEST FOLLOWERS...

                         

                         

                         

                         

          88.
          .CAESAR. CLEARLY THE ALPHA MALE. Clearly in control.

                         WILL
          Caesar.
          Will lowers the binoculars as Stewart rushes in. She's
          trembling.

                         STEWART
          It's going to take them at least
          half an hour to get here.
          He begins rummaging in drawers, in cabinets. There's an
          empty cookie bag, but Will's able to put his hands on a
          couple of stray COOKIES.
          He has an idea.
          Under the sink he finds what he's looking for: RAT POISON.

                         STEWART (CONT'D)
          What are you doing?

                         WILL
          I'm going to kill him.

                         STEWART

                         (HORRIFIED)
          Caesar?

                         WILL
          He's dangerous.

                         STEWART
          You're wrong - he can't have been
          the one who killed that man -

                         WILL
          There is no other explanation.
          A BLACK SHADOW passes by the window. Then another. Stewart
          turns. Now there's another.
          They're surrounded. She SCREAMS.
          Will barricades the back door with a table.
          Chimpanzees at every window BANGING ON THE GLASS, wanting in.

          GLASS SHATTERS.
          Will and Stewart run to the front room, just as the door

          CRASHES OFF ITS HINGES - REVEALING BUCK.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          89.

           INT. CHIMPANZEE HOUSE - DAY


                          WILL
           Caesar! I need to talk to you!
           Dodge, Rodney and Landon watch as Will and Stewart are pushed
          into the cage next door.

                          WILL (CONT'D)
          Caesar!

                         DODGE
          Welcome to the mad house.

                         STEWART
          I called Animal Control - they'll
          be here soon -

                         WILL
          (through the bars)
          I just want to talk to you!

                         DODGE
          Well this'll be interesting because
          your freak'll talk back.

                         RODNEY
          Dodge thinks he spoke to him.

                         DODGE
          He did! He said the word "no" -
          right to my face.

                         WILL
          What do you mean?

                         DODGE
          He can talk.

                         STEWART
          That's impossible.

                         DODGE
          Then he must have a voicebox in his
          ass, because I heard him!
          Caesar walks up.
           Will steels himself, feels in his pocket - the POISONED
          COOKIE is ready.

                         0

                         

                         

                         

                         

          90.

                         WILL
          Caesar - people are coming. People
          with guns. You've got to make the
          apes go back in their cages.

                         CAESAR

                         (SIGNING)
          Apes no belong in cage. Human put
          apes in cage.
          Will's heart sinks as he sees that Caesar is intransigent.
          He means what he's saying.

                         CAESAR (CONT'D)

                         (SIGNING)
          Never again.
          Will takes a moment, DIGS DEEP TO MAKE HIMSELF DO WHAT MUST

          BE DONE.
          Finally he brings the POISONED COOKIE from his pocket, holds
          it out.

                         WILL
          I brought this for you.
          Caesar eyes the cookie but doesn't take it.

                         WILL (CONT'D)
          (it's killing him)
          Don't you want it?

                         CAESAR

                         (SIGNING)
          Never.
          They look at each other. Two creatures once so close, but
          now with a vast chasm between them.

                         WILL
          You went to the lab last night. I
          know it was you.
          Caesar doesn't deny it.

                         WILL (CONT'D)
          (emotion spilling over)
          How could you kill that man,
          Caesar? Once you kill you can't it
          back - that man's gone forever.

          WILL SEES A GENUINE LOOK OF BEWILDERMENT CROSS CAESAR'S FACE.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          91.
          It gives him pause.

                         CAESAR

                         (SIGNING)
          Caesar no kill.

                         WILL
          But...

                         CAESAR

                         (SIGNING)
          Caesar no kill!
          Caesar SLAPS the COOKIE from Will's hand.
           Rocket immediately comes over to stand by Caesar, but Caesar
          doesn't want to fight. He's done - disgusted - with Will.
          He turns, begins to walk off.

                         WILL
          Don't walk away. We need to talk.

          CORNELIA FALLS IN STEP WITH CAESAR, BUT PAUSES TO SNIFF AT

          THE COOKIE ON THE GROUND.

                          WILL (CONT'D)
           Don't - !

          TOO LATE - SHE GOBBLES IT UP.

          FOR GOOD MEASURE, ROCKET GIVES THE BARS A THREATENING SHAKE,

          AND THAT'S WHEN WILL SEES IT: KOBA'S RED WRISTBAND WRAPPED

          AROUND KOBA'S ARM.

                         WILL (CONT'D)

                         (SHOCKED)
          Where'd he get that wristband,
          Caesar? That's Koba's band...

                         (REALIZING)
          Did Koba get out of his cage??
           Yelling after Caesar.

                          WILL (CONT'D)
           Caesar wait!
           But Caesar's not waiting.

           EXT. RANCH GROUNDS - DAY

           Caesar climbs onto the open tailgate of a pick-up truck.
          â¢ Apes gather around, expectant.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          92.

                         CAESAR

                         (VOICE STRAINING)
          No.
          At the sound of Caesar's voice, the apes rise tall.
          FROM THE CHIMPANZEE HOUSE Will and Stewart watch, stunned.

                         CAESAR (CONT'D)
          C...Cage!
          The humans' jaws drop, petrified.

                         CAESAR (CONT'D)

          NO CAGE! NO MORE'.

          CAESAR FIERCELY POUNDS HIS CHEST. EXACTLY LIKE ALPHA.

          THE APES SHRIEK TO HEAVEN.
          BEAT OF JUNGLE DRUMS as CAESAR BOLTS FROM THE TRUCK BED.

          APES RACE TO FOLLOW HIM OFF THE RANCH.
          Will - and the other humans - are blown away.

          EXT. COUNTRYSIDE - DAY

          The pack of apes, led by Caesar, emerges from the ranch gate
          and moves out over the countryside.

          EXT. RANCH GROUNDS - DAY

          ANIMAL CONTROL, AMBULANCE, POLICE VEHICLES stream onto the
          ranch.

                         VOICE
          They could be spread out all over
          the County by now.
          Will and Stewart - released from the cages - speak to OFFICER
          HUFFS. Dodge, Rodney, and Landon huddle nearby.

                         WILL
          No - they'll stick together.

                         DODGE

                         (INTERRUPTING)
          They're following one ape. You
          kill him, you stop them all.

                         HUFFS
          There's a leader?

                         

                         

                         

                         

          93.

                         DODGE

                         (POINTING)
          Ask him - he raised him.
          All eyes to Will.

                         WILL
          His name is Caesar. If I can
          reason with him, I know I can put
          an end to this.

                         HUFFS
          Reason with him?
          Huffs thinks he's nuts. He turns, starts toward his squad
          car. Will follows, Stewart on his heel.

                         WILL
          You don't understand - this chimp
          is smart - he'll listen to me

                         HUFF
          (to nearby JUNIOR OFFICER)
          Get on the horn with every agency
          you can think of! We've got to
          track down these monkeys before
          they do major damage!
          The Junior Officer - GRANGER - heads for his car. Dodge
          follows.

                         DODGE
          You need me riding with you. I've
          got experience with these animals.
          (eye on Will)
          I can point out the one you want.

          EXT. GEN-SYS LABORATORIES - DAY

          An AMBULANCE pulling away. Two POLICE CARS out front.
          Jacobs stands talking with a couple of POLICE OFFICERS.

                         OFFICER
          (handing Jacobs a card)
          If you think of anything else, this
          is where I can be reached -
          A RUMBLING SOUND from behind.
          They turn to see a RANCH APE ARMY heading their way.
          Shocked, they leap out of the way as best they can.

                         Â¢
          The apes STAMPEDE past them and SWARM INTO THE LAB.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          94.

          INT. LAB/PRIMATE HOUSE - DAY

          Caesar and his chimps BURST THROUGH THE DOOR.
          No time is wasted. Cages are opened, LAB CHIMPS liberated.
          Koba steps from his cage slowly, measuring the situation as
          apes around him go crazy.

          EXT. LAB - DAY

          A stunned officer gets to his squad car walkie-talkie.

                         OFFICER
          We have a situation at Gen-Sys
          Laboratory! Approximately two
          dozen apes, gorillas, I don't know
          what the hell they are -
          AUDIBLE CHAOS from inside the lab. YELLING, SCREAMING,

          DESTRUCTION.

          INT. MOVING SQUAD CAR - DAY

          Huffs drives - Will in the front, Stewart in back. They can
          hear everything through the radio.

                         WILL
          The lab.

                         HUFFS
          You know anything about this?

                         WILL
          That's where I work.

          INT. LAB/PRIMATE HOUSE/TREATMENT ROOMS- DAY

          ANARCHY OF MOVEMENT, BLURS of BLACK FUR running amok through
          white rooms, tearing everything up.
          EMPLOYEES SCATTER - running for the exits. Some duck behind
          desks.

          ANGLE ON REFRIGERATED CANISTERS OF 113.
          Like everything else in the lab, torn down, stomped on,
          thrown against the wall.
          Caesar and Buck walk through the lab, eyeing the destruction.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          95.

          EXT. LAB - DAY

          Jacobs, a Security Guard and the two Officers are huddled
          behind a squad car. Other Employees are hiding and watching
          from the safety of the parking lot. They suddenly realize
          that everything has GONE SILENT.
          A moment later, LAB DOORS FLY OPEN.

                         OFFICER #1
          Here they come!

          A MASS OF PRIMATES BARREL TOWARD THEM.

                         OFFICER #2
          There's more of them!

                         JACOBS

                         (REALIZING)
          Those are my chimps...
          They duck as the apes run by - some of them right up and over
          the car they're crouched behind.
           BAM! BAM! BAM! as the chimp's hit and leapfrog over the squad
          car - and their heads.
          The apes stampede across the parking lot, where several use
          Jacobs' BLACK JAGUAR to VAULT OVER THE FENCE.
          The last is BUCK, whose weight CRUSHES the car.
          And then they're gone. Every last one of them.
          Quiet now, except for CAR ALARMS.

          INT. LAB - DAY

          Jacobs enters the lab. In front of him is utter silence and
          devastation. Like the morning after a huge, destructive
          party.
          Out of the quiet there's the PADDING SOUND OF FOOTSTEPS ON

          BROKEN GLASS.
          Jacobs freezes.
          KOBA APPEARS from around a doorway. He and Jacobs look at
          each other for a long moment.
           Then Koba calmly walks past him.

                         0

                         

                         

                         

                         

          96.
          Once outside Koba GALLOPS OFF. Jacobs can see him through
          the open doorway disappearing in the direction of the others
          Jacobs takes a stumbling step backwards, KICKING SOMETHING

          THAT GOES LOUDLY ROLLING ALONG THE CEMENT FLOOR.

          IT'S A CRUMPLED CANISTER OF ADENOVIRUS 113. THE NOZZLE'S

          BROKEN OFF.

          EXT. POLICE STATION - DAY

          Four HELICOPTERS wait. Hoff s, Will and Stewart climb into
          one of them.

          INT. ASCENDING HELICOPTER - DAY


                         HOFFS
          Any idea where they're headed?
          Will sees Dodge joining SHARPSHOOTERS in another helicopter
          below. He doesn't like it.

                         WILL
          No.

                         HOFFS
          They were seen heading north from
          the lab - let's start with that.

          EXT. PLAYGROUND - DAY

          A hillside park overlooking San Francisco bay. THICK FOG
          moving in.
          KIDS EVERYWHERE - slides, seesaws, climbing structures.
          A LITTLE GIRL plays in a sandbox. Her MOTHER reads on a
          bench nearby. The Girl looks up, claps her hands.

                         GIRL
          Monkey!
          OVER HER SHOULDER WE SEE A CHIMPANZEE HEADING OUR WAY. Then
          another. And another.

          REVEAL THREE DOZEN APES EMERGING FROM THE FOG, MAKING THEIR

          WAY DOWN THE SLOPE.
          suddenly the Little Girl's not so sure.

          PEOPLE START TO NOTICE - GRAB THEIR KIDS.
          The Mother looks up from her book. SOMEONE SCREAMS.

                         GIRL (CONT'D)
          Mommy?
          The Girl's surrounded now by moving apes --- the Mother can't
          get to her.

                         MOTHER
          April!
          Suddenly Caesar doubles back from the lead. He scoops her up
          and puts her down out of harm's way.
          Then he continues herding the apes forward. He knows where
          he's going.
          SIRENS APPROACH. Squad cars give chase.

          INT. HELICOPTER - DAY

          Fog rolls in off the bay. Will's strapped into his seat,
          looking down at the city below.

                         HUFFS
          You see them?

                         WILL
          No, I can't see -

                          STEWART
          Oh my god.
          Seated next to Will, she draws him to her window. FAR BELOW:
          it looks like a BLACK LOCUST moving through the urban sprawl -
          chased by numerous Squad Cars - directly behind them, along
          parallel streets...
          She realizes something.

                         STEWART (CONT'D)
          I know where they're going.

          A SIGN: THE SAN FRANCISCO ZOO.
          FAMILIES. Hot dog stands and ice cream vendors.
          The fun is interrupted by the SOUND OF HELICOPTERS sweeping
          low overhead. Faces turn skyward...

                         

                         

                         

                         

          98.
          A moment later, Caesar and his apes RUMBLE IN. Chaos.
          PEOPLE scatter. SCREAM.
          Released balloons float lazily upward.

          INT. HELICOPTER OVER THE ZOO - DAY

          Will watches Caesar moving the apes down the zoo's pathways,
          dodging people, jumping over benches.

                         WILL
          He's going to release the apes.
          Looking to his left, Will sees a sniper try to get shots off -
          but hesitate.
          The apes are too interspersed with fleeing PATRONS.

          EXT. SAN FRANCISCO ZOO - DAY

          As the apes pass other enclosures, the ANIMALS GO NUTS.
          Lions ROAR. Giraffes run back and forth.

                         WRANGLER
          What the hell am I supposed to do
          when they get here?!
          An APE WRANGLER screams into a wall phone at the Ape
          Enclosure. The ZOO APES are agitated and anxious - they know
          something's coming.
          Suddenly the phone is ripped from wall. The Wrangler cowers,
          turns to see Caesar and his apes.
          Rocket rattles the door, bares his teeth.
          The Wrangler understands - fumbles for his keys.

          SOUND OF BOLTS AND LOCKS CLICKING OPEN.

           INT./EXT. APE ENCLOSURE/ZOO - DAY

          All kinds of apes - Chimps, Orangutans, Gorillas - rush from
           their separate enclosures.
           Caesar's apes are waiting for them.
           Caesar makes eye contact with the GRIZZLED OLD MALE
          CHIMPANZEE. Then - as a unit - they all run for the exit.

          By now, ALL THE ANIMALS ARE GOING CRAZY.
          Above, the sky is full of helicopters now -- some Police, some
          News Crews.

          INT. HELICOPTER OVER THE ZOO - DAY

          Apes are visible streaming from the zoo and emptying onto the

          SNIPER FIRE RINGS OUT from helicopters above - an APE FALLS.
          Caesar's leading, running alongside Cornelia. She falters.
          Caesar slows with her, concerned.
          SHE LOOKS ILL. But Cornelia digs deep and picks up her
          speed.
          Caesar continues on.

          INT. HELICOPTER- DAY

          Will's plastered to the window, anxiously watching Caesar's
          progress.
          Below, the BLACK LOCUST that is the pack of apes has grown
          larger, but they stay together, moving implacably North
          through the San Francisco streets.
          Up ahead, the GOLDEN GATE BRIDGE COMES INTO VIEW - majestic,
          shimmering in the afternoon light.
          And Will realizes the moment he sees it.

                         WILL
          They're going to Muir Woods.

          The apes arrive at the shadow of the great bridge - a
          stampeding phalanx with Caesar at the lead.
          But Cornelia can't keep up any more. Losing her balance, she
          stumbles, falls.
          Caesar rushes to Cornelia's side. By the time he reaches
          her, she's dead - a WHITE FOAM has formed at her lips.
          She's been poisoned.

          Caesar struggles to his feet with Cornelia in his arms - he's

          Other helicopters BUZZ low, SHOTS RING OUT, SIRENS CLOSE IN.
          Apes take cover around trees and structures, but they're

          EXT. BRIDGE ENTRANCE - DAY

          Two CHP PATROL CARS are frantically stopping new traffic from
          entering the bridge and waving exiting traffic through.

          Suddenly, OUT OF THE FOG, THE APES APPEAR.
          TRAFFIC slams to a halt.
          PEOPLE are STUNNED as chimps, gorillas, orangutans VAULT OVER
          THEIR CARS, run down the middle of the traffic - stampeding
          across the bridge.
          Helicopters BUZZ around like flies - SHARPSHOOTERS unable to
          get a safe shot.

          AT THE NORTH END OF THE BRIDGE
          Blocked off by CHP, all traffic stopped.
          A few helicopters touch down - SHARPSHOOTERS jump out, rifles
          ready, and follow on foot behind SQUAD CARS, FOUR ACROSS,

          THAT SLOWLY DRIVE ACROSS THE BRIDGE - TOWARD THE APES.

          DODGE IS AMONG THEM.

          AT THE SOUTH END OF THE BRIDGE
          Caesar and his apes race forward.

          INT. HELICOPTER - DAY

          Will and Stewart watch from above as the apes stream
          Northward, over and around stopped cars.

          Tell them to hold their fire until
          they get past the traffic!
          WILL SEES below that soon Caesar and the apes will reach a
          place on the bridge where there are no more cars.
          Then they'll be open season.
           Then HE SEES the FOUR SQUAD CARS slowly approaching from the
          north end of the bridge, SHARPSHOOTERS - and DODGE - on foot
          behind them.

          ON THE BRIDGE
          Caesar looks ahead - realizes that he's at the end of the
          bridge traffic.
          Ahead is empty roadway. And the slowly approaching squad
          cars.
          He looks up at the helicopters, rifles at the ready.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          103.
          He sees the FOG, swirling in and out of the SUSPENSION

          CABLES.
          Caesar SIGNALS TO MAURICE.
          Maurice glances over the bridge railing. The Bay churns and
          swirls hundreds of feet below.
          Caesar BARKS at Maurice, who then climbs over the railing,
          taking the orangutans and a handful of chimps with him.
          Caesar BARKS a command at BUCK - who waits by the last car
          with a PACK OF GORILLAS and some chimps.
          Then Caesar starts to climb. Shimmying up a cable and into
          the fog. Rocket's right behind.
          The remaining apes follow.

          INT. HELICOPTER - DAY

          From the sky Will sees Caesar divide up his army.
          Chimps ascend cables, disappearing in and out of patches of
          fog.
          Orangutans and apes descend below the bridge deck.
          And Buck with his gorilla, take refuge in the stalled
          traffic.

          BELOW THE BRIDGE
          Maurice finds bars and support beams. He and the below-deck
          apes begin swinging their way toward the.north end.

                         ABOVE BRIDGE
          Apes shimmying up cables appear out of the fog, arriving at
          the MAIN CABLE - the thick one running along the top.
          They start scampering and swinging north, the FOG MOVING AND

          SWIRLING, CHANGING SHAPE AROUND THEM.
          A SHARPSHOOTER from a helicopter takes a SHOT.
          A CHIMP FALLS TO HIS DEATH. It's a long fall, until - SPLASH
          the chimp hits the water.
          They keep moving.

          ON THE BRIDGE
          The FOUR PATROL CARS stop, creating a barricade. The
          Sharpshooters line up their rifles, ready to shoot.

          DODGE SEARCHES A SQUAD CAR, FINDS A RIFLE, AND LOCKS AND

          LOADS.
          They FIRE at the apes above them, but it's tough going - the
          apes are in constant motion, and the fog obscures them.
          BULLETS can be heard RICOCHETING off cables.
          Another chimp falls to its death.
          Then a heavy patch of fog rolls in, engulfing the middle part
          of the bridge, surrounding the barricade. Visibility's
          practically zero.

          NOW THE MEN AT THE BARRICADE CAN HEAR THE APES MOVE PAST THEM

          IN THE FOG.

                         OFFICER
          They're all around us!
          Apes swing above them, scamper by them. Movement - WHOOSH -

          WHOOSH...
          DODGE - nervous - crouches low. He edges backwards, hopeful
          of some visibility.
          That's when he SEES CAESAR, CLEAR AND OUT OF THE FOG,

          CLIMBING UP THE ASCENDING CABLES OF THE NORTH SIDE.

          WITH RELISH, DODGE READIES HIS RIFLE, AIMS AT CAESAR'S BACK.
          There's glare from a ray of sunlight that's broken through
          the fog.
          He SHOOTS, BARELY MISSING. The bullet RICOCHETS off the main
          cable.
          ROCKET, climbing behind Caesar, looks down - SEES DODGE
          AIMING AGAIN. He starts swinging towards Caesar.
          Another shot from Dodge. This time the BULLET GRAZES

          CAESAR'S SHOULDER, AND CAESAR STUMBLES, STARTS TO FALL.

          ROCKET REACHES HIM IN TIME - SNATCHES HIS ARM, HOLDING CAESAR

          UP.
          Then, using all his strength, ROCKET PULLS CAESAR BACK UP TO

          THE MAIN CABLE.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          105.

          BAM!
          Rocket's hit in the back!
          He and Caesar make eye contact as ROCKET FALLS OFF THE

          BRIDGE, TUMBLING TO HIS DEATH.
          Caesar SCREAMS, looks down at Dodge, who aims again.
          But Dodge is diverted by a RUMBLING - like an EARTHQUAKE ON

          THE BRIDGE.
          The GORILLAS ARE IN MOTION. LEAD BY BUCK, THEY CHARGE TOWARD

          THE BARRICADE.
          Like a freight train of menacing power.
          Helicopters FIRE, MEN at the barricade SHOOT as they try to
          back up.
          A gorilla falls... but they keep on coming.
          And now, climbing up from below - behind the barricade --
          MAURICE AND THE ORANGUTANS join in.
          Their sheer numbers and power are unstoppable.

          BELOW THE BRIDGE
          Koba hangs back. He's away from the action, but the battle
          waged above is audible.
          He creeps along toward the North end of the bridge.

          We can't gas the forest! The

          to Tiburon.

                         OFFICER #2
          Well it'll take us months to find
          them in there.

                         OFFICER #3
          Not to mention rounding them all
          up.
          Will approaches the group.

                         WILL
          I know where they are.
          The Officers look at him. Who the hell is this guy?
          Huffs - embarrassed - gestures toward Will.

                         HUFFS
          This man owns one of the chimps.

                         (BEAT)
          The so-called "leader". Says he
          can reason him out.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          107.

                         WILL
          His name is Caesar. I think he'll
          listen to me. If he comes out, the
          other apes will follow.
          Sounds pretty far-fetched.

                         OFFICER #1
          You think you know where to find
          this monkey?
          Will starts to correct him - lets it go.

                         WILL
          I do. I used to bring him here.
          The Officers look at each other.

                         OFFICER #1
          We don't have a lot of options.
          Let's give it a try.

                         WILL
          But you have to promise me - if I
          can get them out, you'll take them
          peacefully. Tranquilize them, cage
          them. No killing.
          Beat.

                         HUFFS
          Whatever it takes.

          EXT. MUIR WOODS/EDGE OF FOREST - MOMENTS LATER

          Will and Stewart stand at the edge of the woods. They're at
          the path Caesar and Will used to take.
          She's terrified, trying to mask it.

                         WILL
          You think this is a bad idea?

                         STEWART
          Definitely.
          He thought so.

                         STEWART (CONT'D)
          He's never going to agree to come
          out with you.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          108.

                         WILL
          I know. Got to try, right? I owe
          him that much.
          Will kisses her. Heads off down the path. Then he pauses,
          turns to look at her.

                         WILL (CONT'D)

                         (YELLING BACK)
          Think he'll forgive me?

                         STEWART
          (can't quite hear him)
          What?
          Will waves it off - never mind.
           Stewart watches him walk down the trail... and disappear into
          the woods.

          EXT. DEEP WOODS - DUSK

           Will walks. FLASH OF BLACK up ahead. His pulse quickens -
          he follows it.
          CRACKLING of BRANCHES.
          More BLACK, swinging through the trees. Is it Caesar?
          Will follows.

          EXT. PARK/CLEARING - DUSK

          Will enters the clearing.
          He knows this place. Up ahead is the GROVE OF TREES with the
          CANOPY that Caesar always loved.

          EXT. MUIR WOODS/PARKING LOT - DUSK

          Huffs stands looking at his watch. He looks up, turns to an

          ASSEMBLED GROUP OF ARMED MEN.

                         HUFFS
          Follow me.
          Stewart double-takes, sees the ARMY HEAD OFF IN WILL'S

          DIRECTION, GUNS READY.

                         STEWART
          Hang on a second...
          (to nearest Officer)
          Where are they going?

                         

                         

                         

                         

          109.
          Looks are exchanged. Someone grabs Stewart, who struggles
          with all her might.

                         STEWART (CONT'D)

          WHERE ARE THEY GOING?!

          EXT. PARK/CLEARING - DUSK

          Quiet here. Will heads toward the Grove of Trees.

                         WILL
          Caesar! ...
          He keeps walking, almost there. A DARK FIGURE DROPS DOWN IN

          FRONT OF HIM.

          IT'S KOBA.
          Will takes a step back, fear crawling up the back of his
          neck.

                         WILL (CONT'D)
          You.
          Koba stands up tall. Eyes Will.
          He takes his time - like he's enjoying every second of
          this... He walks towards will, bares his teeth.
          Suddenly CAESAR APPEARS, SLAMMING INTO KOBA, knocking him
          away.

          ENRAGED, KOBA STARTS TO CHALLENGE CAESAR... BUT CAESAR JUST

          STARES HIM DOWN.

          KOBA - THE COWARD - SLINKS OFF, DISAPPEARING INTO THE WOODS.
          Which leaves just Will and Caesar.

                         CAESAR
          Humans coming.

                         WILL
          No. I'm alone.
          Will pauses - there's so much he wants to say.

                         WILL (CONT'D)
          I owe you an apology.

                         CAESAR
          Will want Caesar dead.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          110.

                         WILL
          I thought you had killed a man.
          But I should have known better.
          Caesar's face is unreadable. Will can't tell what he's
          thinking.

                         WILL (CONT'D)
          I want you to know that all of this
          is my fault. My responsibility.

                         (BEAT)
          Can you forgive me?
          BIRDS TAKE SUDDEN FLIGHT. Caesar's eyes shift to the path.
          Will realizes he's been betrayed.

                         WILL (CONT'D)

                         (PANICKED)
          Wait - no -

                         CAESAR
          Will leave.

                         WILL
          I won't -

                         CAESAR
          Will leave now.

                         WILL
          No. I'm staying with you.
          Caesar pushes him. Will staggers backwards, falls down.
          At that moment, HUFFS and his ARMY step into the clearing.
          Huffs takes aim at Caesar.

                         WILL (CONT'D)

          NO!

          HE RUSHES CAESAR JUST AS HUFFS PULLS THE TRIGGER. THE BLAST

          OF THE GUN SHATTERS THE FOREST'S SILENCE.

          AT THAT SAME MOMENT APES DROP FROM THE TREES -- IT'S AN AMBUSH
          - a COUNTERATTACK.
          Huffs and his men are taken by surprise. SHOTS are fired,
          but not fast enough.

          UNLIKE ALPHA'S BATTLE IN THE AFRICA, IT'S A SLAUGHTER IN THE

          APES' FAVOR.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          AS THE APES MAUL THE MEN, CAESAR CARRIES WILL THROUGH THE

          CARNAGE.

          EXT. WOODS - DUSK

          Caesar lays Will out on the forest floor. There's a lot of
          blood.
          Will tries to speak. He looks up at Caesar.
          Caesar takes him in his arms, cradles him with love.
          Will looks into Caesar's green eyes. He relaxes. Lets go.
          Then the life passes out of him.

          EXT. PARKING LOT, MUIR WOODS - DUSK

          Stewart sits in the back of a locked Police Car, looking out
          at the forest in the gathering darkness.
          All is quiet.
          The forest is vast, dark, green. Impenetrable.

          HONK OF A HORN.

          EXT. HOUSE - NIGHT

          Hunsiker - Will's neighbor - exits his house with a small
          rolling suitcase. He's wearing his pilot's uniform.

          INT. TAXI - NIGHT

           Hunsiker enters, settles into the seat.

                          TAXI DRIVER
           Where to, my man?
          It's the Taxi Driver with the mustache - THE SAME ONE THAT

          GAVE JACOBS A RIDE HOME.

                         HUNSIKER
          SFO. International terminal.

                         TAXI DRIVER
          You got it.
          The Driver COUGHS as he pulls away. Light sweat on his
          forehead - he doesn't look too good.

                         0

                         

                         

                         

                         

          112.

          INT. AIRPORT TERMINAL - NIGHT

          CLOSE ON WHEELS TURNING. Hunsiker pulls his suitcase on
          wheels through the airport terminal.
          It's teeming with TRAVELERS. Holding on to the bannister,
          Hunsiker takes the escalator up.

          INT. AIRPLANE - NIGHT

          Hunsiker says hello to the FLIGHT STAFF and moves to the
          front of the plane.

          INT. COCKPIT - NIGHT

          Hunsiker shakes hands with his CO-PILOT and sits. He flicks
          a switch.

          EXT. RUNWAY - NIGHT

          The airplane takes off into the sky.

          NEWSCASTER VOICE #1 (O.S.)
          As the ape search continues, a
          virulent flu strain has exploded in
          and around San Francisco, sending
          shock waves and panic throughout
          the community.

          EXT. CLEARING - DAY

          We move along the ground of a clearing toward a lush canopy
          of trees. As we get closer, we notice flashes of movement.

                         NEWSCASTER VOICE #2
          Authorities suspect the origin of
          the deadly virus might be Gen-Sys
          Laboratories - the same private
          company from which several
          laboratory chimpanzees escaped
          earlier this week -
          We're still fifty yards away from the trees, but we can see
          it's filled with apes - chimpanzees, orangutans, gorillas.
          We keep pushing in, closer and closer to the trees. As we
          move past the leaves WE FIND BUCK. MAURICE. AND, SITTING

          APART FROM THE OTHERS... KOBA.
          All of them have eyes in varying shades of GREEN.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          113.

                         NEWSCASTER VOICE #3
          As the death toll rapidly rises,
          Hospitals are desperately trying to
          meet the growing demand...
          Caesar sits alone, staring straight at us.

                         NEWSCASTER VOICE #4

                         (INCREASINGLY DESPERATE)
          Although isolated in the western
          region of the country, the numbers
          are catastrophic and quickly
          rising...
          Push in on CAESAR'S FACE.

                         NEWSCASTER VOICE #5
          Efforts to quarantine appear to
          have failed. The strain has been
          spotted as far away as Singapore
          and Australia...

          CLOSER AND CLOSER ON CAESAR'S FACE.

                         NEWSCASTER VOICE #6

                         (RAGGED)
          Casualties have reached apocalyptic
          levels. Authorities urge you to
          stay inside your homes...

                         (LONG BEAT)
          For those of you who can hear me, I
          say...

                         (VOICE BREAKING)
          God's speed and so long to you all.
          The NEWSCASTER'S VOICE is replaced by the WHITE NOISE OF A

          SNOWY TELEVISION SET.

15	EXT.	A STILL FRAME OF A DENTON CATHOLIC CHURCH	DAY

					CHORUS (Cont)
			To the late night double feature
			Picture Show.

	The SONG ends with church bells ringing joyously as the IMAGE EXPANDS TO 
	WIDE-SCREEN.  The STILL FRAME bursts to life as the doors of the Denton 
	Catholic Church are flung open and Mendelssohn's wedding march resounds 
	from the church organ.

	The young married couple, RALPH and BETTY HAPSCHATT appear followed by a 
	crowd of friends and well-wishers throwing confetti and shouting 
	excitedly.

	The MINISTER shakes RALPH by the hand while RALPH slips him a $20 bill.

	PHOTOGRAPHERS take pictures.

	BRAD MAJORS, a young slightly awkward, clean-cut American in his mid-
	twenties, comes over the congratulate RALPH.  BRAD and RALPH shake 
	hands.

					RALPH
			Well Brad, I guess we made it huh!

					BRAD
			Well I don't think there was any doubt
			about that - You and Betty have been
			almost inseparable ever since you sat
			in on Dr Scott's refresher lectures.

					RALPH
			Tell you the truth Brad, she was the
			only reason I came in the first place.
			Science was never one of my favourite
			subjects but I sure with Dr Scott
			could have made it today.

					BRAD
			Yes, Janet and I are both fond of him.
			We drove over to see him last vacation.
			It's a shame his new job took him away
			from Denton.

	BETTY, the bride, throws the bouquet.

	JANET catches it.  She squeals with delight.

	The GUESTS cheer.

					RALPH
			Hey fella.  It looks like it could be
			your turn next.

					BRAD
			Who knows...ha ha.

	RALPH & BETTY drive off.  GUESTS wave and shout, BRAD & JANET with great 
	enthusiasm.  GUESTS begin to disperse.

	JANET & BRAD linger outside the church.  So do a strange FAMILY :  An 
	old man with a pitchfork and his wife and daughter.  They resemble the 
	Quaker family in "American Gothic", a painting.

	The MOTHER (MAGENTA) and FATHER (RIFF RAFF) stand outside the church 
	doors.  Their DAUGHTER (COLUMBIA) goes inside.  The FAMILY, and the 
	MINISTER (FRANK N. FURTER), and the GUESTS all resemble characters we 
	shall meet later at the Frank N. Furter place.

					JANET (who is holding the bouquet)
			Oh Brad, wasn't it wonderful. Didn't
			Betty look radiantly beautiful.  
			Just an hour ago she was plain old
			Betty Monroe.  Now she's Mrs. 
			Ralph Hapschatt.

					BRAD (Still looking after the car)
			Er...yes, Janet.......Ralph's a 
			lucky guy.  (They start to move d.s.)

					JANET
			Yes.

					BRAD
			Everyone knows Betty's a wonderful 
			little cook.

					JANET
			Yes.

					BRAD
			And Ralph himself will be in line for 
			promotion in a year or so.

					JANET
			Yes.

	With great decision BRAD turns on JANET

					BRAD (spoken)
			Hey Janet.

					JANET
			Yes Brad.

					BRAD
			I've got something to say.

					JANET
			Uh huh.

					BRAD
			I really loved the skilful way
			You beat the other girls
			To the bride's bouquet.

					JANET
			Oh Brad.

	(Singing begins)

					BRAD
			The river was deep but I swam it.

					FAMILY (Riff & Magenta)
			Janet.

					BRAD
			The future is ours so let's plan it.

					FAMILY (R & M)
			Janet.

					BRAD
			So please don't tell me to can it.

					FAMILY (R & M)
			Janet.

					BRAD
			I've one thing to say and that's
			Dammit, Janet.
			I love you.

			The road was long but I ran it.
			(He runs backwards towards church doors)

					FAMILY (Riff and Magenta)
			Janet.

					BRAD (Climbing onto fence)
			There's a fire in my heart
			And you fan it.  (Jumps off)

					FAMILY (Riff and Magenta)
			Janet.

					BRAD
			If there's one fool for you
			Then I am it.

					FAMILY (Riff and Magenta)
			Janet.

					BRAD (Getting chalk from pocket)
			I've one thing to say and that's,
			Dammit, Janet.

	He chalks a heart and arrow on the church door, which Riff Raff proceeds 
	to wipe off.

					BRAD
			I love you.

	JANET runs to him, he kneels and produces a ring.

					BRAD
			Here's a ring to prove that
			I'm not joker.

	CHURCH BELLS Peal out.  RIFF & MAGENTA open doors and solemnly enter the 
	church, door closes behind them.

					BRAD
			There's three ways that love can grow.
			That's good bad or mediocre.

	JANET grabs the ring as BRAD rises.  She throws down the bouquet and 
	would fall into BRAD's arms but he goes to the door to chalk on it 
	again.

					BRAD
			Oh - J - A - N - E - T
			I love you so.

	JANET, transfixed, bursts into the church.

17	INT. CHURCH		DAY

	"WEDDING SONG"  Pt. 2

	JANET bursts into the church, hypnotised by the ring.  BRAD follows her.

					JANET
			Oh!......It's nicer than
			Betty Munroe had

					MAGENTA (Peering up from behind pew)
			Oh Brad.

					JANET
			Now we're engaged and I'm so glad.

					MAGENTA & COLUMBIA
			Oh Brad.  (Both peer up and disappear)

					JANET
			That you met Mom
			And you know Dad.

					WHOLE FAMILY
			Oh Brad.  (peering up together)

					JANET (Taking his arm)
			I've one thing to say
			And that's, Brad
			I'm mad,
			For you too.

	BRAD & JANET start to walk d.s., arm in arm.

	the strange FAMILY march slowly across them l/r., in front.

					JANET (Laying head on Brad's sh.)
			Oh, Brad.

					BRAD
			Oh Dammit.

					JANET (Caresses his cheek)
			I'm mad.....

					BRAD
			Oh Janet

					JANET
			For you.

					BRAD (briefly kisses her)
			I love you too-oo-oo.

	BRAD takes JANET's hands, turning to her.  We are aware of THE FAMILY 
	bringing in coffin in b.g. through vestry door.

					BRAD & JANET
			There's one thing left to do-ah-ooh

	(They separate)

					BRAD
			And that's go see the man
			Who began it

					FAMILY (Carrying coffin)
			Janet.

					BRAD
			When we met in his science exam
			It -

	THE FAMILY move into position behind BRAD & JANET

					FAMILY
			Janet.

					BRAD
			Made me give you the eye
			And then panic,

					FAMILY
			Janet

	FAMILY lower coffin onto floor.

					BRAD
			I've got one thing to say, and that's
			Dammit,
			Janet.

			I love you.

	JANET runs to BRAD and he hugs her.

					BRAD (Circling Janet)
			Dammit, Janet.

	JANET circles BRAD twice, admiring her ring on the way.

					JANET
			Oh Brad,
			I'm mad.

					BRAD
			Dammit, Janet.

	BRAD & JANET kneel together with each following word until they are 
	kneeling on the floor)

					BRAD, JANET, FAMILY.
			I love you.

	BRAD & JANET kiss.

	The cross above spits optically.

18	INT.	A STUDY	NIGHT

	Mahogany bookcases, a large desk with a prominent globe of the world.  A 
	well-padded armchair has its back to the camera.  It swings around 
	revealing the NARRATOR.  He is in his smoking jacket.  He speaks 
	directly to us.

					NARRATOR
			I would like if I may to take you on a
			strange journey.

	He crosses to the bookshelf.  He selects a dossier.  We see the title: 
	"The Denton Affair".  He returns to his desk and places it on a 
	bookstand.  He puts on his reading glasses.

					NARRATOR
			It seemed a fairly ordinary night when
			Brad Majors and his fiancee Janet Weiss
			(two young ordinary healthy kids) left
			Denton that late November evening to
			visit Dr Everett Scott, ex. tutor and
			now friend of both of them.  It's true 
			there were dark storm clouds, heavy, 
			black and pendulous, toward which they 
			were driving.  It's true also that the 
			spare tyre they were carrying was badly 
			in need of some air.  But they being 
			normal kids and on a night out, well 
			they were not going to let a storm 
			spoil the events of their evening.

			On a night out.

	He closes the book marking the place.

	Thunder is heard distantly on the sound track.

					NARRATOR
			It was a night out they were going to
			remember for a very long time.

	Lighting cracks on the sound track.

								WIPE TO

19	EXT.	NIGHT

	A windscreen wiper working under strain.  Torrential rain on the 
	windscreen.  BRAD concentrating on visibility.  JANET eating chocolates 
	and listening to the car radio playing an Orson Welles serial - The 
	Shadow.

	A motorcycle roars past them.

					JANET
			Gosh.  That's the third motorcyclist
			that's passed us.  They certainly take
			their lives in their hands.  What with
			the weather and all.

					BRAD
			Yes, Janet.  Life's pretty cheap to
			that type.

	JANET takes another stick of gum.

	Offers BRAD some.  He declines.

	The car slows to a halt.

					JANET
			What's the matter Brad, darling?

	Headlights on sign reading: "DEAD END".

					BRAD
			I think we took the wrong fork a few
			miles back.

					JANET
			Oh dear!  But then where did the
			motorcyclists come from?

					BRAD
			Hmmm ... Well, I guess we will have
			to turn back.

23	INT.	CAR	NIGHT

					BRAD
			You'd better sit here and keep warm 
			while I go for help.

					JANET
			But where will you go?  We're in the 
			middle of nowhere.

					BRAD
			Didn't we pass a castle back down the
			road a few miles?  Maybe they have
			a telephone I might use.

	He unbuckles his seatbelt.

					JANET
			I'm coming with you.

					BRAD
			There's no point both of us getting wet.

					JANET
			I'm coming with you.
				(she unbuckles her seatbelt)
			Besides, darling, the owner of the phone
			might be a beautiful woman and you may
			never come back.

	BRAD laughs.

	A thunderclap.

	MUSIC commences and she alights from the car and follows him, newspaper 
	over her head.

								CUT TO

24	EXT.	ROAD	NIGHT

	SONG:		"OVER AT THE FRANKENSTEIN PLACE"

	The rain pours off the newspaper down JANET's face.  She walks along, 
	catching up with BRAD.

	She sing plaintively.

					JANET
			In the velvet darkness
			Of the blackest night
			Burning bright.

	We see the two of them - BRAD striding ahead, JANET nearly catching up 
	with him.

	Behind them on the side of the road, sparse trees and rock formations.

					JANET
			There's a guiding star
			No matter what or who you are.

	They have passed a row of trees.  A rock formation in the shape of a 
	castle is silhouetted against the sky.  It has a flag flying from the 
	turret.

	Lightning strikes.

	A glow of light appears in a window.  It illuminates a path to the 
	castle.

	BRAD and JANET turn.

	The castle is in the distance between the two of them.

					BRAD & JANET
			There's a light

	The castle looms in the distance.

					PHANTOM VOICES
			Over at the Frankenstein place.

	BRAD stares hard.

					BRAD
			There's a light.

	The castle looms closer.

					PHANTOM VOICES
			Burning in the fireplace.

					JANET
				(looks to Brad)
			There's a light, a light
			In the darkness of everybody's life

	Taking JANET by the hand, BRAD moves off the roadway towards the house.

					BRAD
			I can see the flag fly
			I can see the rain
			Just the same
			There has got to be
			Something better here
			For you and me.

	Lighting strikes.

	JANET jumps towards BRAD.

					BRAD & JANET
			There's a light.

	The castle seems to move forward.

					PHANTOM VOICES
			Burning in the fireplace.

					BRAD
			There's a light.

25	EXT.	CASTLE DRIVEWAY	NIGHT

	A motorcycle convoy roars by revealing a hidden road to the castle.

	The convoy drives up and disappears into a secret entrance in the rock.

								CUT TO

26	EXT.	CASTLE FACADE	NIGHT

	We see a cell-like window near a massive lighted window.  A tortured 
	face appears squinting into the darkness.

					RIFF RAFF
			The darkness must go
			Down the river of nights dreaming
			Flow morphia slow
			Let the sun and light come streaming
			Into my life.

	BRAD and JANET are at the gate.  There is a rusted sign.

	A bolt of lighting illuminates the sign which reads:  FRANK N. FURTER - 
	SCIENTIST.

								WIPE TO

34	INT.	STUDY	NIGHT

	The NARRATOR is in his armchair.  He leans forward with some urgency.

					NARRATOR
			And so it seemed that fortune had smiled
			on Brad and Janet and that they had found
			the assistance that their plight required -
			or had they?

	Thunderclap.

								WIPE TO

35	EXT.	FRONT DOOR OF THE CASTLE	NIGHT

	BRAD rings the doorbell.  It makes a strange sound.

					JANET
			Oh, Brad.  Let's go back.  I'm cold
			and I'm frightened.

					BRAD
			Just a moment, Janet.  They may have
			a telephone.

	The door opens.  Throbbing music is heard in the background as if there 
	is a party going on in the distance.

	The figure we have seen at the window emerges.  He is a hunch-backed 
	servant, RIFF RAFF.

					RIFF RAFF
			Hello.

					BRAD
			Uh - oh - Hi!  My name is Brad Majors.
			And this is my fiancee, Janet Weiss.  I -
			ah - wondered if you could help us.  Our
			car has broken down about two miles up the
			road.  Do you have a phone we might use?

					RIFF RAFF
			You're wet.

					JANET
			Yes, the rain has been very heavy.

					BRAD
			Yes.

					RIFF RAFF
			Yes.

36	EXT.	CASTLE	NIGHT

	A bolt of lighting illuminates a row of vehicles parked by the castle.

37	EXT.	FRONT DOOR OF CASTLE	NIGHT

	BRAD sees them and reacts with surprise.

	RIFF RAFF realises BRAD has seen them.

					RIFF RAFF
			I think you had better both come inside.

					JANET
			You're too kind.

	They enter apprehensively.

								DISSOLVE

38	INT.	STAIRWAY	NIGHT

	RIFF RAFF leads them down a stairway and beckons them to follow.

	The MUSIC has become louder.

					JANET
				(sotto voce)
			Oh Brad, I'm frightened.  What kind
			of place is this?

					BRAD
				(sotto voce)
			Oh, it's probably some kind of hunting
			lodge for rich weirdos.

								CUT TO

39	INT.	HALLWAY	NIGHT

	They arrive at a hallway at the bottom of the stairs.  Another servant,
	MAGENTA, who bears a striking physical resemblance to RIFF RAFF is 
	vacuuming the stairs.

					RIFF RAFF
			This way.

	JANET steps over the vacuum lead.

					JANET
			Are you - giving a party?

					RIFF RAFF
			No.  You've arrived on a rather special
			night.  It's one of the master's affairs.

					JANET
			Oh, lucky him.

					MAGENTA
			He's lucky.

	BRAD and JANET look at MAGENTA, surprised by her voice.

					MAGENTA
			You're lucky, I'm lucky, we're all
			lucky.

40	SONG:		"THE TIME WARP"

	BRAD and JANET are rather unnerved by this outburst from the domestic.  
	They look back to RIFF RAFF.  He is now standing by a set of mirrors 
	reflecting to infinity.

					RIFF RAFF
			It's astounding
			Time is fleeting
			Madness takes its toll
			But listen closely
			Not for very much longer
			I've got to keep control.

	MAGENTA gives RIFF RAFF a strange signal.

	RIFF RAFF starts to dance in an extraordinary fashion.

					RIFF RAFF
			I remember doing the Time Warp.

	BRAD and JANET are amazed.

					RIFF RAFF
			Drinking those moments when
			The blackness would hit me.

	MAGENTA half closes her eyes in pleasure.

	JANET clings to BRAD.

					RIFF RAFF
			And the void would be calling.

	RIFF RAFF opens a set of double doors marked BALLROOM.

41	INT.	BALLROOM	NIGHT

	BRAD and JANET find themselves on a balcony of a huge black and silver
	ballroom.  At the furthest end is a throne-like chair and, surrounding 
	it, a theatre proscenium.  In the body of the room are GUESTS.  They are 
	the people BRAD and JANET passed on the road.  They are the 
	Transylvanian Secret Agents - assembled on this special occasion from 
	all over the earth.  It is the Annual Transylvanian Convention - 
	announced by an official banner suspended over the Ballroom.  They are
	all dressed in strange but elegant evening wear.  They are a distorted 
	version of the GUESTS from the Denton wedding.  A party spirit prevails, 
	they throw their arms out in a plea to RIFF RAFF on the balcony.

					GUESTS
			Let's do the Time Warp again.

	JANET falls into BRAD's arms.

	RIFF RAFF is ecstatic.

	BRAD revives JANET.

					GUESTS
				(repeating action)
			Let's do the Time Warp again.

	JANET faints again.

42	INT.	STUDY	NIGHT

	The NARRATOR moves from his desk to the wall behind him.  He pulls down 
	a chart with illustrated dance steps on it.  He gestures to the 
	appropriate section of the diagram with the pointer.

					NARRATOR
			It's just a jump to the left.

								WIPE TO

					GUESTS (Cont)
			They really drive you insane.

	We see them from the balcony and they open out in formation.

					GUESTS (Cont)
			Let's do the Time Warp again.

	JANET revives.

	The GUESTS re-form.

					GUESTS
			Let's do the Time Warp again.

	BRAD and JANET make a run out the door.

								CUT TO

46	INT.	STAIRWAY	NIGHT

	They collide with MAGENTA who has blocked off the corridor with her 
	vacuum.  She sings with menace, waving the cleaner hose dangerously.

					MAGENTA
			It's so dreamy
			Oh, fantasy free me
			So you can't see me
			No not at all.

	BRAD and JANET look at each other in alarm.

			In another dimension.
				(she forces them back towards
				balcony)
			With voyeuristic intention.

	BRAD blushes.

			Well secluded I see all
			With a bit of a mind flip
			You're into the time slip
			Nothing will ever seem the same.

	They are back at the balcony.

			You're spaced out on sensation.

	They are at the edge of the balcony.

			Like you're under sedation.

	They force BRAD and JANET into the Ballroom proper.

	The GUESTS turn on them.

					GUESTS
			Let's do the Time Warp again.

	BRAD and JANET are completely dismayed.

					GUESTS
			Let's do the Time Warp again.

	COLUMBIA, a young girl, is the household groupie.  She sings with the

53A	INT.	HALL/LIFT	NIGHT

	BRAD and JANET retreat to the hall.  Behind them a lift slowly descends 
	bearing a figure in a black cloak and a diamante stiletto heel - beating
	time to a rhythm the band has started playing.

					JANET
			Brad, please lets get out of here.

					BRAD
			For God's sake keep a grip on yourself Janet.

					JANET
			But it seems so unhealthy here.

					BRAD
			It's just a..a party Janet.

					JANET
			Well I want to leave.

					BRAD
			We can't go anywhere until I get to a phone.

					JANET
			Then ask the butler - or someone.

					BRAD
			Let's wait awhile Janet.  We don't want 
			to interfere with their celebrations.

					JANET
			This isn't the Junior Chamber of 
			Commerce Brad.

					BRAD
			They're probably foreigners with ways 
			different from our own.  -  They may 
			do some more folk dancing.

					JANET
			Brad - I'm cold, I'm wet, and plain scared.

					BRAD
			I'm here, there's nothing to worry about.

	GUESTS rise, staring mesmerised at the lift.

	JANET sees the shoe, looks up at the face of its owner.

	JANET faints.

54	INT.	LIFT/HALL	NIGHT

	The figure turns and throws open lift cage door.  As camera zooms in to 
	the death mask above them the film changes from black and white to 
	colour.  However the only colour in evidence is the red lipstick on the 
	mouth of their host.

	SONG:		"SWEET TRANSVESTITE"

					FRANK
			How do you do.

			I see you've met my faithful handyman.
			He's a little brought down - 
			Because when you knocked
			He thought you were the candyman.

	RIFF RAFF scowls.

54A	INT.	BALLROOM	NIGHT

					FRANK
			Don't get strung out by the way 
			that I look.

	FRANK strides across the Ballroom to the throne.

					FRANK
			Don't judge a book by its cover
			I'm not much of a man
			By the light of day
			But by night I'm one hell of a lover.

	JANET gives a silent scream.

	FRANK lets the cloak fall onto the throne, which reveals his 
	transvestite attire.

	The GUESTS scream with delight.

					FRANK
			I'm just a sweet Transvestite
			From Transexual Transylvania.

	He slowly moves back to BRAD and JANET, doing leg kicks.

			Let me show you around, maybe play you a sound
			You look like you're both pretty groovie.

	He circles them and forces them into the Ballroom.

			Or if you want something visual
			not too abysmal
			We could take in an old Steve Reeves movie.

	BRAD clumsily attempts to circle around FRANK.  FRANK meanwhile ignores 
	him and greets his other guests.

					BRAD
			I'm glad we caught you at home
			Ah - could we use your phone
			We're both in a bit of a hurry.

	JANET joins BRAD.

					JANET
			Right!

					BRAD
			We'll just say where we are
			Then go back to the car
			We don't want to be any worry.

	FRANK turns on them.

					FRANK
			You got caught with a flat
			Well how about that
			Well babies don't you panic
			By the light of the night
			It'll seem alright
			I'll get you a satanic mechanic.

	FRANK turns his back on BRAD and JANET and splitting the ranks of his 
	GUESTS, departs for the other end of the Ballroom.  Streamers fall.

					FRANK
			I'm just a sweet transvestite
			From Transexual Transylvania.

	From the throne he gestures towards BRAD and JANET rather slowly over 
	the next verse.

					FRANK
			Why dont'cha stay for the night

					RIFF & MAGENTA
			"night"
			Or maybe a bite

					RIFF & MAGENTA
			"bite"
			I could show you my favourite obsession
			I've been making a man
			With blonde hair and a tan
			And he's good for relieving my tension.

	We view from OVERHEAD as the GUESTS surround him adoringly.

					FRANK
			I'm just a sweet transvestite

			for now and pull out the aces when the
			time is right.

	He turns to COLUMBIA who has been staring at his underpants.

					BRAD
			Ah, hi.  My name is Brad Majors and
			this is my fiancee, Janet Weiss.  You
			are ...

					COLUMBIA
			You are very lucky to be invited up
			to Frank's laboratory.  Some people
			would give their right arm for the
			privilege.

	RIFF RAFF has opened the cage doors to the lift.

	The GUESTS rush for positions.

					BRAD
			People like you maybe

					COLUMBIA
			I've seen it.

	COLUMBIA escorts them to the lift.

	RIFF RAFF throws two GUESTS to the floor to make room for them.
	He slams the cage door.

	The two discarded GUESTS cry and claw at the cage door as the lift moves 
	off under RIFF RAFF's control.

	BRAD and JANET are squashed, arms by their side.

	They stare straight ahead.

					JANET
				(to Magenta)
			It he - Frank - is he your husband?

	General amusement.

					RIFF RAFF
			The Master is not yet married.  Nor
			do I think he ever will be.  We are
			simply his servants.

					JANET
			Oh.

	The lift grinds to a halt.

	They have arrived at the laboratory.

								CUT TO

69	INT.	LABORATORY	NIGHT

	The laboratory is somewhere between a student observation operating 
	theatre and a Greek gymnasium.  It is pink-tiled throughout, facing the 
	lift entrance is a circular area containing a TANK on pedestals which
	though screened at this stage will be revealed to contain the body of 
	ROCKY submerged in chemicals, the wall to one side contains a raised 
	dias area for the GUESTS, and facing one end of the tank, the 
	operational controls, monitor and a giant refrigerator.  A chandelier 
	hangs above the tank.

	On the podium in front of Frank's chambers there is a stand microphone.  
	Near the podium are some weights.  Behind the tank is a vaulting horse.
	These are wrapped in sellophane - Rocky's presents.

	The GUESTS are waiting as the lift arrives.

	FRANK, now in surgeon's outfit stands in the middle of the room.  RIFF 
	RAFF gets out of the lift first, with a glass of champagne which he
	hands to FRANK.

					FRANK
			Magenta, Columbia, go and assist Riff Raff.

	As he speaks her name each one steps forward out of the lift.  They
	cross to RIFF RAFF behind the tank.

					FRANK
			I will entertain...ah...

	BRAD & JANET step out of the lift.

					BRAD
			I'm Brad Majors and this
			is my fiancee, Janet Vice.

					JANET
			Weiss.

					BRAD
			Weiss.

					FRANK (Taking Janet's hand to kiss)
			Encante....How nice.  (he circles them)
			And what charming underclothes you both have.
			(He takes two dust coats from Riff Raff 
			and hands them to Brad).
			But here, put these on.  They'll
			make you feel less vulnerable.

	MAGENTA & COLUMBIA cross to the podium.

					FRANK (continues)
			It's not often we receive visitors here.
			Let alone offer them hospitality.

					BRAD (Moving towards Frank)
			Hospitality!  All we wanted to do was 
			use your telephone.  A reasonable request 
			which you have chosen to ignore.

					JANET (Hurring after Brad)
			Don't be ungrateful Brad.

					BRAD (Stepping closer to Frank)
			Ungrateful!

	The room falls silent.  All eyes are on FRANK, waiting for his reaction.  
	A smile breaks on his face.

					FRANK
			How forceful you are Brad.  Such a 
			perfect specimen of manhood.  So dominant.

	MAGENTA & COLUMBIA laugh.

			You must be awfully proud of him Janet.

					JANET
			Well, yes I am.

	THE GUESTS oh and ah appreciatively, BRAD laughs, a little embarassed.

					FRANK
			Do you have any tattoos Brad.

					BRAD
			Certainly not!

					FRANK
			Oh well.  How about you.  (He laughs)

	RIFF RAFF has approached behind FRANK, looming over his shoulder.

					RIFF RAFF
			Everything is in readiness, Master.
			We merely await your word.

	FRANK drinks his champagne then hands RIFF RAFF the empty glass.  RIFF 
	RAFF goes to the control panel and FRANK to the podium

					FRANK
			Tonight...One, one, one.  Can you hear 
			me at the back?
			Tonight, my unconventional conventionists.

	MAGENTA, COLUMBIA and GUESTS laugh politely.

					FRANK
			Tonight you are to witness a breakthrough 
			in biochemical research.

	There is a gasp from COLUMBIA, MAGENTA and GUESTS.

					FRANK
			And paradise is to be mine.

	GUESTS and everybody applaud.  JANET claps too, but BRAD indicates that 
	she shouldn't.

					FRANK
			It was strange the way it happened.
			One of those quirks of fate really.  
			One of those moments when you seem 
			irredeemably lost:  you panic; you're 
			trapped; your back's against the wall.
			There's no way out, and then suddenly, 
			you get a break.  (He cracks the bones 
			in his hand)  All the pieces seem to 
			fit into place.  What a sucker you'r 
			been. What a fool.  The answer was there
			all the time.  It took a small accident 
			to make it happen.  An accident!

	MAGENTA & COLUMBIA step forward one each side of him.

					MAGENTA & COLUMBIA (softly)
			An accident.

					FRANK
			That's how I discovered the secret.
			That elusive ingredient, that spark 
			that is the breath of life.

	GUESTS applaud.

					FRANK (Moving to tank)
			You see, Brad and Janet, you are fortunate.
			For tonight is the night that my beautiful
			creature is destined to be born.

	Everybody applauds.  FRANK then pulls the cover from the tank.  RIFF 
	RAFF is at the control panel.

70	INT.	LABORATORY	NIGHT

	The tank is revealed.  There is something inside it is immersed in clear 
	fluid.  The GUESTS are astonished.

					FRANK
			Throw open the switches on the sonic 
			oscillator.

	RIFF RAFF flicks the switch to activate the oscilloscopes in the panel.

					FRANK
			And step up the reactor power input 
			three more points.

	RIFF RAFF presses a button three times then begins to unwind a wheel.

	FRANK watches excitedly from behind the tank as the chandelier is 
	lowered.  It spurts different coloured liquids into the tank.

	The liquids bubble and change colour.  The thing inside begins to look 
	like a human form.

					JANET
			Brad...

					BRAD
			It's alright Janet.

	The liquids drain away.  The form begins to move.

	FRANK climbs the ladder at one end of the tank, RIFF RAFF the other.

	ROCKY HORROR sits up, raises his arms, finally stands upright with both 
	arms outstretched.

	RIFF RAFF removes the bandage from ROCKY's head.  ROCKY looks at RIFF 
	RAFF then at FRANK.  With a gasp he leaps for the chandelier above.

	At the same time RIFF RAFF is down the ladder making for the handle.  He 
	winds up the chandelier and ROCKY.

71	INT.	THE LABORATORY	NIGHT

	SONG:		THE SWORD OF DAMOCLES.

	ROCKY HORROR with only his head unbandaged, is hanging on to the 
	chandelier which RIFF RAFF is winding upwards.

					ROCKY
			The Sword of Damocles is
			Hanging over my head.

	FRANK runs down the ladder and kicks RIFF RAFF who starts to lower the 
	chandelier.  FRANK climbs up the other steps to meet his creation coming 
	down.  MAGENTA & COLUMBIA cross to the tank.

					ROCKY
			And I've got the feeling
			Someone's going to be
			Cutting the thread.

			Oh, woe is me.
			My life is a misery.

			Oh, can't you see
			That I'm at the start
			Of a pretty big downer....

	As ROCKY gets level with him, FRANK lunges for him but lands inside the 
	tank....because...

	ROCKY simultaneously abandons the chandelier, lands between MAGENTA and 
	COLUMBIA who now each have a pair of scissors with which they will snip
	his arm and leg bandages.

					ROCKY
			I woke up this morning
			With a start
			When I fell out of bed.

					GUESTS (inc. Riff, Magenta & Columbia)
			That ain't no crime.

					ROCKY
			And left from my dreaming
			Was a feeling
			Of un-nameable dread.

					GUESTS
			That ain't no crime

					ROCKY
			My high is low.
			I'm dressed up
			With no place to go.

			And all I know
			Is I'm at the start
			Of a pretty big downer.

	FRANK, in the tank behind ROCKY, puts his arms round ROCKY's neck.  
	ROCKY spins away.  MAGENTA and COLUMBIA hang on to one end of his chest
	bandage so that it undoes as he goes.

					GUESTS (inc. RIFF RAFF, MAGENTA & COLUMBIA)
			Sha la la la
			That ain't no crime.

					ROCKY
			Oh, no no, no no.

					GUESTS
			Sha la la la
			That ain't no crime.

					ROCKY
			No no no, no no.

					GUESTS
			Sha la la la
			That ain't no crime -
			That ain't no crime.

	ROCKY is now unbandaged.  He strikes a pose.

	During the last sequence, FRANK climbs out of the tank onto RIFF RAFF'S 
	shoulders and purses ROCKY, but they fall.

72	INT.	STUDY	NIGHT

	NARRATOR reading from book.

					NARRATOR
			Rocky needed peace of mind.
			He didn't know
			He was doing just fine.

			He was the product
			Of another time.
			And as for feeling down -
			Well that's not a crime.

73	INT.	LABORATORY	NIGHT

	FRANK and RIFF RAFF are recovering from their fall.

	ROCKY makes a circuit of the GUESTS.

					GUESTS (Riff, Magenta & Columbia)
			That ain't no crime.

					ROCKY (To first group of guests)
			The sword of Damocles is
			Hanging over my head.

					GUESTS
			That ain't no crime.

					ROCKY (To second group)
			And I've got the feeling
			Someone's going to be
			Cutting the thread.

					GUESTS
			That ain't no crime.

					ROCKY (To third group)
			Oh, woe is me - 
			My life is a mystery.

			(To fourth group)
			Oh can't you see
			That I'm at the start
			Of a pretty big downer.

	ROCKY set off at a run as FRANK looms up again.

	(FRANK is chasing ROCKY round the lab.)

					GUESTS
			Sha la la la
			That ain't no crime.

					ROCKY
			Oh no no no no.

					GUESTS
			Sha la la la
			That ain't no crime.

					ROCKY
			No no no no.

					GUESTS
			Sha la la la
			That ain't no crime.
			That ain't no crime.

					GUESTS
			Sha la la la
			That ain't no crime.

					ROCKY
			No no no no.

					GUESTS
			Sha la la la
			That ain't no crime.

					ROCKY
			No no no no.

					GUESTS
			Sha la la la
			That ain't no crime -
			That ain't no crime.

	At the end of number, ROCKY has climbed up the ladder attached to the 
	end of the tank nearest the bridal chambers and FRANK is in a heap 
	below.  RIFF RAFF is behind the tank and MAGENTA and COLUMBIA in their 
	positions in front of it.

74	INT.	LABORATORY	NIGHT

	FRANK picks himself up.  ROCKY is sitting at the top of the ladder above 
	him, with his perfect limbs near Frank's face.

					FRANK
			Well.  That's no way to
			behave on your first day out.

	ROCKY looks hurt.

			But as you're such an
			exceptional beauty I'm
			prepared to forgive.

	FRANK crosses behind ROCKY to stand next to RIFF RAFF behind the tank.

			I just love success.

					RIFF RAFF (edging up to Frank)
			He is a credit to your
			genius, Master.

					FRANK
			Yes.

					MAGENTA (Moving to tank from controls)
			A triumph of your vill.

					FRANK
			Yes.

					COLUMBIA (Who is on opposite side of tank)
			He's o.k.

					FRANK
			O.K?  (Moving out behind tank towards 
			Janet and Brad)  I think we can do a 
			little better than that.

			You.  (To Janet)  What do you think?

					JANET
			Well.  (She looks at Brad)  I don't 
			like men with...er, with too many, muscles.

					FRANK
			I didn't make him for you

	JANET nods hastily.  FRANK moves towards microphone.

			He carries the Charles Atlas seal of 
			approval....And he didn't even take 
			the lessons.

74A	INT.	LABORATORY	NIGHT

	SONG:		CHARLES ATLAS (Pt. 1)

	As FRANK starts to sing, MAGENTA & RIFF RAFF collect one of ROCKY's 
	presents, the vaulting horse, and place it in front of the podium.
	COLUMBIA leads ROCKY down from the ladder.

					FRANK
			A weakling weighing
			Ninety eight pounds
			Will get sand in his face
			When kicked to the ground.
			And soon in the gym (ROCKY sits on horse)
			With a determined chin
			The sweat from his pores
			As he works for his ca-ha-hause

	MAGENTA & RIFF RAFF now bring the weights.

					FRANK
			Will make him glisten - thank you -
			And gleam.
			And with massage
			And just a little bit of
			Ste-he-he-he-hem...(laughs)
			He'll be pink.
			And quite clean.

					FRANK
			He'll be a strong man -
			Oh honey -

					GUESTS, RIFF, MAGENTA & COLUMBIA & FRANK.
			But the wrong man.

					FRANK
			He'll eat nutritious high protein
			And swallow raw eggs.
			Try to build up his shoulders,
			His chest, arms and legs.

			Such an effort -
			If he only knew of my plan.
			In just seven days,

					GUESTS, RIFF, MAGENTA & COLUMBIA & FRANK
			I can make you a ma-aa-a-a-an

	ROCKY throws down the weights and begins press ups.

					FRANK
			He'll do press-ups and chin-ups,
			Do the snatch, clean and jerk.

	FRANK crosses to JANET & BRAD

			He thinks dynamic tension
			Must be hard work.
			Such strenuous living
			I just don't understand.

	FRANK moves back to ROCKY who is still pressing up.

			When, in just seven days -
			Oh baby...(ROCKY jumps up.)

			I can make you
			A ma-a-a-a-an...(laugh).

75	INT.	LABORATORY: REFRIGERATOR	NIGHT

	The large refrigeration unit door slowly opens, falling like a 
	drawbridge.  Inside is a wall of ice and many CocaCola bottles.
	Through these bursts an icy EDDIE riding a Harley Davidson motor bike, 
	ex World War II, holding a Gibson guitar.

	Several guests are crushed to death.

					COLUMBIA
			Eddie!

					EDDIE
			Stay cool baby.

					JANET
			Who's Eddie?

					RIFF RAFF
			The delivery boy.

					MAGENTA
			His delivery wasn't good enough though.

	ROCKY looks terrified.

	JANET has fainted yet again.

	EDDIE comes to life.

76	SONG:		"WHAT EVER HAPPENED TO SATURDAY NIGHT"

					EDDIE
			Whatever happened to Saturday night
			When you dressed up sharp
			And you felt alright
			It don't seem the same since cosmic light
			Came into my life and I thought I was divine.

	COLUMBIA leaps on to the pillion seat.

			I used to go for a ride with a chick who'd go
			And listen to the music on the radio.

	The MOTORCYCLISTS GUESTS remember only too well.

			A saxophone was blowing on a rock and roll show
			And we climbed in the back
			And we really had a good time

	COLUMBIA rushes to the switchboard, flicks a lighting switch and all the 
	lights above the stairs start changing colour.

	The GUESTS go crazy and rock and roll all over the staircase.

	COLUMBIA dances with EDDIE.

	Even RIFF RAFF and MAGENTA step it out.

					ALL
			Hot patootie
			Bless my soul
			I really love that rock and roll
			(four times)

	EDDIE (more confident, less frozen) leaps onto the motorbike in a legs 
	apart guitar strumming pose.

	FRANK is getting furious.

	ROCKY is perplexed.

					EDDIE
			My head used to swim
			From the perfume I smelled.
			My hands kind of fumbled
			With her white plastic belt.
			I'd taster her baby pink lipstick,
			And that's when I'd melt.
			And she'd whisper in my ear,
			Tonight she really was mine.

			Get back in front and put
			Some hair oil on.
			Buddy Holly was singing
			His very last song.
			With your arms around your girl
			You tried to - ah - sing along
			It felt pretty good, whoo.
			Really had a good ti-i-ime.

	EDDIE slips onto the pedal starting the bike.  He takes off and roars 
	round the laboratory, even riding up and down the walls.

					ALL
			Hot patootie
			Bless my soul.
			I really love that rock and roll.

			Hot patootie
			Bless my soul.
			I really love that rock and roll.

			Hot patootie
			Bless my soul.
			You know I love that rock and roll.

			Hot patootie
			Bless my soul.
			I really love that rock and roll.

	4 bars instrumental (saxophone)

	FRANK steals towards the fridge where he collects an ice pick, 
	innocently.

					ALL			EDDIE
			Hot patootie		HOT PATOOTIE -
			Bless my soul.		BLESS MY SO-O-OUL.
			I really love that rock and roll.

			Hot patootie		HOT PATOOTIE
			Bless my soul.		I LOVE THAT ROCK & ROLL.
			I really love that rock and roll.

			Hot patootie		HOT PATOOTIE...
			Bless my soul.		I LOVE THAT ROCK & ROLL.

			Hot patootie		HOT PATOOTIE
			Bless my soul.		I LOVE-A-LOVE-A-LOVE-A
			I really love that rock and roll.
							THAT ROCK AND ROO-AHOUL!

	On the last chorus FRANK rushes to EDDIE with the ice pick, in a 
	demented fury.

	THE GUESTS are unbelieving.

	COLUMBIA covers her face with her hands.

	EDDIE is dead.  FRANK walks away from his body unconcerned.

	JANET screams and screams.

77	INT.	LAB	NIGHT

	DIALOGUE SEQUENCE

	MAGENTA is very bored and picking up ice cubes and placing them in the 
	ice bucket.

					FRANK
			One from the vaults.

	RIFF RAFF drags EDDIE's dismembered body back into the fridge.

			And so perish all those who reject my love!

	ROCKY cowers in terror.

			Oh no, my little Adonis -
			You're much too beautiful to be destroyed.
			He had a certain naive charm - but no muscle.

	ROCKY flexes.

	FRANK is thrilled.

78	INT.	LABORATORY	NIGHT

					FRANK
			But a deltoid
			And a bicep,
			A hot groin
			And a tricep
			Makes me - ooh -
			Shake.
			Makes me want
			To take
			Charles Atlas
			By the ha-and.

			In just seven days -
			Oh baby -

					GUESTS, RIFF RAFF, MAGENTA & COLUMBIA & FRANK
			I can make you a
			Ma-ha-ha-ha-haan.

			I don't want no dissension
			Just dynamic tension.

			In just seven days
			I can make you
			A ma-ha-ha-ha-haan.

			In just seven days

			A ma-ha-ha-ha-haaan.

79	INT.	BRIDAL SUITE	NIGHT

	RIFF RAFF presses a button and a wall opens revealing a bridal suite 
	done out in black silk.

	The GUESTS shout their approval.

	The end of the SONG turns into Mendelssohn's wedding march and FRANK 
	leads ROCKY to his bridal chamber.

	The GUESTS throw confetti.

	BRAD and JANET look at each other in amazement.

			There are some people who say that life

			a figment of our imaginations!  If this
			is so, then Brad and Janet are quite safe.
			However, the sudden departure of their
			host and his creation (into the seclusion
			of his sombre bridal suite) had left them
			feeling both apprehensive and uneasy.
			A feeling which grew as the other guests
			'departed' and 'they' were shown to their

	Only a soft glow of moonlight from a barred window.  ON the netting

					JANET
			Who is it?  Who's there?

	BRAD's voice from behind the door.

					BRAD'S VOICE
			It's only me, Janet.

	She relaxes.

					JANET
			Oh, Brad, come in, darling.

	A silhouette enters and crosses to the bed.  It moves onto the bed
	behind the net curtain.

					JANET
			Oh Brad - Mmmm - Oh yes, my darling -
			what if...

					BRAD
			It's alright Janet.  Everything's going
			to be alright.

					JANET
			Oh, I hope so my darling.  But let me

					BRAD
			No, don't do that.

					JANET
			Oh don't be so shy.

	She switches on the light to reveal FRANK.

					JANET
			YOU!

	FRANK sits up.

					FRANK
			I'm afraid so, Janet.  But isn't it nice?

	JANET beats his chest with her clenched fists.

					JANET
			You beast, you monster, what have you
			done with Brad?

					FRANK
			Nothing.  Why, do you think I should?

					JANET
			You tricked me - I wouldn't have -
			I've never - never

					FRANK
			I know.  But it wasn't all bad was it?
			In fact, I think you found it quite pleasurable.
			Mmmmm so soft, so sensual.

	He re-commences making love to her.

					JANET
			Oh - Oh - no - stop - I mean help.
			I - Brad - Oh.
				(she shouts)
			Brad.

	FRANK places a finger on her lips.

					FRANK
			Ssssh.  Brad's probably asleep by now.  
			Do you want him to see you like this?

					JANET
			Like this - like how?  It's your fault.
			You're to blame.

	We see ROCKY chained to the bed sleeping.

	In the background RIFF RAFF and MAGENTA in laboratory.

	ROCKY stirs and makes a sound.

	RIFF RAFF walks across to the door and stares at the sleeping body.

	His eyes are full of hate.

	He looks at MAGENTA.

	She nods to him.

	He releases the chains.

	ROCKY stirs.

	RIFF RAFF picks up a candelabra from the bedside table and taunts ROCKY.

	ROCKY jumps out of the bed, terrified.

	RIFF RAFF pushes the candelabra in his face.

	ROCKY crashes through the laboratory and escapes.

	RIFF RAFF turns to MAGENTA who is now standing in the doorway.

	RIFF RAFF puts down the candelabra and they exchange a strange sign.

	A shadowy figure moves across the room to the bed.

					JANET'S VOICE

			Oh Brad, it's no good here.  It will
			destroy us.

	BRAD takes her hand.

					BRAD
			Don't worry Janet, we'll be away
			from here in the morning.  Hmmmm,
			you smell so good.

	He gently lays her down on the bed and attempts to caress her.

					JANET
			Oh Brad.  Oh no.  Not till after
			the wedding, Darling.

	BRAD sits up.

					BRAD
			Alright, Janet.  I understand.

	The shadow rolls over.

					JANET
			Maybe we could try it this way.

					BRAD
				(surprised)
			Janet!  Oh!  Yes it's alright.  Janet.
			Everything's going to be alright.

					JANET
			I hope so my darling.

	BRAD reaches out to the light.

			No, don't put on the l...

	BRAD switches on the bedside lamp an realises he is making love to
	FRANK wearing a JANET wig.

					BRAD
			You!

					FRANK
			I'm afraid so, Brad.  But wasn't it nice?

	BRAD grabs FRANK around the throat.

					BRAD
			Why you - what have you done with Janet?

					FRANK
			Nothing.  Why do you think I should?

	BRAD lets him go and turns away humiliated.

					BRAD
			You tricked me.  I wouldn't have -
			I've never - never.

					FRANK
			I know, but it wasn't all bad was it?
			I think you found it quite pleasurable.
				(he caresses Brad)
			Oh so soft.  So sensual.

					BRAD
			Ahhh - no - stop - I mean Janet.
				(shouts)
			Janet.

					FRANK
			Shush.  Janet's probably asleep by now.
			Do you want her to see you like this?

					BRAD
			Like this.
				(throwing Frank aside)
			Like how?  It's your fault - you're to
			blame.  I thought it was the real thing.

					FRANK
			Oh come on, Brad, admit it.  It was
			enjoyable, wasn't it?  There's no crime
			in giving yourself over to pleasure.

					FRANK (Switches off light)
			Oh Brad, you have wasted so much time
			already.  Janet needn't know, I won't tell her.

					BRAD

			Yes Brad.  It's something we ourselves

			My God!  I can't take any more of this -

			I LOVED YOU - And what did it get me - 
			I'll tell you - a big nothing.
			You're like a sponge.  You take, take, 
			take, take!  You drain others of their 
			love and emotions.  Well, I've had enough.  
			You've got to choose between me and Rocky - 
			so named because of the rocks in his head.

	FRANK throws a switch, she turns to stone.

					FRANK
			It's not easy having a good time.

	He crosses over to RIFF RAFF and MAGENTA

			Even smiling makes my face ache.

	RIFF RAFF and MAGENTA nod sympathetically.

	He lies on the operating table.

	They massage.

					FRANK
			My children turn on me.  Rocky's behaving
			just as Eddie did.  Maybe I made a mistake
			in splitting his brain between the two of
			them.

					MAGENTA
				(massaging his temples)
			When will we return to Transylvania?
			I grow weary of this world.

					FRANK
			Magenta, I am indeed grateful to both
			you and your brother RIff Raff - you have
			both served me well - loyalty such as
			yours must be rewarded and you will
			discover when the mood takes me I can
			be quite generous.

	MAGENTA betrays her resentment by digging her fingernails into his neck.

					MAGENTA
			I ask for nothing, Master.

	FRANK leaps up from the table.

					FRANK
			And you shall receive it - in abundance.
				(he goes to the lift)
			Come.  We are ready for the floor show.

	is lovingly fitted with extravagant variations on the stocking and
	suspender belt variety of his own fantasies.

151	INT.	BALLROOM (INCLUDING STAGE)	NIGHT

	Footlights glowing on the curtains.

152	INT.	BACKSTAGE	NIGHT

	FRANK pulls a switch and the curtains open.

								CUT TO

153	INT.	BALLROOM STAGE	NIGHT

	Red velvet curtains open to reveal statues in front of silver drapes.
	The floor is covered with a light mist.

								CUT TO

154	INT.	BACKSTAGE	NIGHT

	FRANK beams and pulls lever.

								CUT TO

155	INT.	STAGE	NIGHT

	COLUMBIA's statue comes to life.

					COLUMBIA
			It was great when it all began
			I was a regular Frank fan.
			But it was over when he had the plan
			To start working on a muscle-man.
			Now the only thing that gives me hope
			Is my love of a certain dope
			Rose tints my world keeps me
			Safe from my trouble and pain.

								CUT TO

156	INT.	BACKSTAGE	NIGHT

	FRANK switches.	ROCKY leaps to life.

								CUT TO

157	INT.	STAGE	NIGHT

					ROCKY
			I'm just seven hours old
			Truly beautiful to behold
			And somebody should be told
			My libido hasn't been controlled
			Now the only thing I've come to trust
			Is an orgasmicÊrush of lust
			Rose tints my world keeps me
			Safe from my trouble and pain.

	BRAD animated by FRANK

158	INT.	STAGE	NIGHT

					BRAD
			It's beyond me
			Help me Mommy
			I'll be good you'll see
			Take this dream away
			What's this, let's see
			I feel sexy
			What's come over me
			Here it comes again.

								CUT TO

159	INT.	STAGE	NIGHT

	JANET animates.  She behaves like a sex goddess, completely out of
	control, as if performing in a burlesque show.

					JANET
			I feel released
			Bad times deceased
			My confidence increased
			Reality is here
			The game has been disbanded
			My mind has been expanded
			It's a gas that Frankie's landed
			His lust is so sincere.

160	INT.	STAGE	NIGHT

	We PULL BACK on the whole stage.  The velvets open to reveal the 20th
	Century Fox logo as a stage set.

	At the top of the staircase FRANK appears bathed in light.

	He wears a dazzling version of the national costume and a chiffon cloak
	which billows in the breeze from a wind machine.  He is reminiscent of
	a 30's film star.

					FRANK
			What ever happened to Fay Wray
			That delicate satin-draped frame
			As it clung to her thigh
			How I started to cry
			For I wanted to be dressed just the same.

								CUT TO

161	INT.	STAGE	NIGHT

	The floor opens to reveal a swimming pool glistening with chlorine
	and glitter.  He beckons the GUESTS.

	In their drugged state they comply with his every wish.


					FRANK
			Give yourself over to absolutely pleasure
			Swim the warm waters of sins of the flesh
			Erotic nightmares
			Beyond any measure
			And sensual daydreams
			To treasure forever.

	FRANK enters the pool.

			Can't you just see it.
			Can't you just see it.

	They begin to immerse themselves in the pool.

161A			Don't dream it.  Be it.

					ALL
			Don't dream it.  Be it.

	DR SCOTT animates belatedly.

	He observes the orgy occurring in the pool.

					DR. SCOTT
			Ach, we've got to get out of this trap
			before this decadence saps our wills.
			I've got to be strong and try to hang
			on.  Or else my mind, may well snap.

	The wind machine blows the blanked from his lap and we see legs, 
	stockings and a suspender belt.  As in a miracle he can walk again.

					DR. SCOTT
			Und my life will be lived,
			For the thri-i-i-i-ill...

	BRAD surfaces, his face betraying consternation.

					BRAD
			It's beyond me
			Help me Mo-ommy.

	He is pulled back into the pool.

	A thrilled JANET now emerges.

					JANET
			God bless Lilly Saint Cyr.

	FRANK breaks through the water on a lift from ROCKY.

	SONG:		FLOOR SHOW PT. 3 - WILD AND UNTAMED THING.

					FRANK
			My my my my
			I'm a wild and an untamed thing.
			I'm a bee with a deadly sting.
			Get a hit and your mind goes ping.
			Your heart'll thump and your blood will sing.
			So let the party and the sounds rock on.
			Gonna shake it till the life has gone.

			Rose tint my world
			Keep me safe from my trouble and pain.

	FRANK dives into the pool.

	During the chorus the whole group are diving in and out of the pool in
	a frenetic water ballet.

					ALL
			I'm a wild and an untamed thing
			I'm a bee with a deadly sting.
			Get a hit and your mind goes ping
			Your heart'll thump and your blood will sing.

	They emerge from the pool and form a kick line.

			So let the part and the sounds rock on
			Gonna shake it till the life has gone.
			Rose tint my world
			Keep me safe from my trouble and pain.

162	INT.	BALLROOM	NIGHT

	The doors at the opposite end of the ballroom open.

	SONG:		"RIFF RAFF'S RECIT"

	RIFF RAFF and MAGENTA now dressed in military style space suits, face
	FRANK from the opposite end of the ballroom.

	They applaud slowly.

	RIFF RAFF has a ray gun.

	The characters on stage freeze - terrified.

	It's a showdown across the ballroom.

					RIFF RAFF
			Frank N. Furter
			It's all over
			Your mission is a failure.

	FRANK looks stunned.

			Your life style's too extreme.

	FRANK is guilt-stricken.

			I'm your new Commander.
			You are now my prisoner.

	The GUESTS scramble for the safety of the wings.

			We return to Transylvania
				(he turns to Magenta)
			Prepare the transit beam.

	MAGENTA turns to leave.

					FRANK
			Wait!  I can explain.

163	INT.	STAGE	NIGHT

	SONG:		"I'M COMING HOME"

	FRANK moves slowly to centre stage.  During the song he adjusts 
	footlight controls to give him what effects he requires.

	The others help FRANK out by singing from the wings.  COLUMBIA operates
	a spotlight.

	BRAD closes silver curtains.

					FRANK
			On the day I went away.

					GUESTS
			Goodbye

					FRANK
			Was all I had to say

					GUESTS
			Now I

					FRANK
			Want to come again and stay

					GUESTS
			Oh my, my,

					FRANK
			Smile and that will mean I may

	He kicks on cloud projection.  Blue skies appear.

					FRANK
			I've seen blue skies
			Through the tears in my eyes
			And I realise
			I'm going home
			I'm going home

	FRANK falls on his knees.

			Everywhere it's been the same

					GUESTS
			Feeling

					FRANK
			Like I'm outside in the rain

					GUESTS
			Wheeling

					FRANK
			Free to try and find a game

					GUESTS
			Dealing

					FRANK
			Cards for sorrow,
			Cards for pain.

	DR SCOTT switches on wind machine.

			I've seen blue skies
			Through the tears in my eyes
			And I realise
			I'm going home
			I'm going home.
			I'm going home.

164	INT.	BALLROOM	NIGHT

	MAGENTA who during all this has been filing her nails, looks up at FRANK
	who is in an attitude of supplication.

					MAGENTA
			How sentimental.

	RIFF RAFF moves slowly to the stage.

					RIFF RAFF
			And also presumptuous of you.  You
			see when I said "we" were to return
			to Transylvania, I referred only to
			Magenta and myself.

	FRANK looks appalled.

	The GUESTS are deeply troubled, realising that they also are not part of
	the "We".

					RIFF RAFF
			You see, you are to remain here,
			in spirit anyway.

	He produces a ray gun.

					DR SCOTT
			Great Heavens, that's a laser.

					RIFF RAFF
			Yes, Dr Scott.  A laser capable of
			emitting a beam of pure anti-matter.

					BRAD
			You mean you're going to kill him?
			What's his crime?

					DR SCOTT
			You saw what became of Eddie.
			Society must be protected.

					RIFF RAFF
			Exactly, Dr Scott.  Now Frank N.
			Furter, your time has come.  Say
			goodbye to all this and hello to oblivion.

	FRANK raises himself to his full height.

					FRANK
			Do your worse - inferior one.

	As RIFF RAFF pulls the trigger, COLUMBIA dashes between them.

	She is killed instantly.

	RIFF RAFF fires again at FRANK.

	FRANK takes a leap fro the rope on the curtain.  The entire proscenium 
	crashes under the weight.  And FRANK is crushed to death among the
	velvet and glittered facia.

	ROCKY breaks down completely.  Although he despised FRANK, he was all he
	had in the world.

	He rushes to the body and cradles it in his arms.

	RIFF RAFF can stand no more.

	He fires a blast of laser beam at ROCKY who starts climbing the stairway
	towards the fox skyline.

	RIFF RAFF fires again and again.

	With the body of FRANK in his arms, ROCKY beats on his chest and lets
	out a wild sound like a giant beast of the jungle.

	RIFF RAFF fires a sustained beam.

	ROCKY climbs to the top of the Fox sculpture.

	RIFF RAFF fires again and again.

	They crash to their deaths.

					BRAD
			Good God.

					RIFF RAFF
			Yes.

					JANET
			You've killed them.

	MAGENTA has found the entire sequence of events quite distasteful.

					MAGENTA
			I thought you liked them.  They liked you.

					RIFF RAFF
			They didn't like me.  They never liked me.

					DR SCOTT
				(he tries a calming hand)
			You did right.

					RIFF RAFF
			A decision had to be made.

					DR SCOTT
				(the big sell-out)
			You're OK by me.

					RIFF RAFF
			Dr Scott I'm sorry about your nephew.

					DR SCOTT
			Yes, well perhaps it was for the best.

					RIFF RAFF
			You must leave now Dr Scott while it's
			still possible.  We are about to beam
			the entire house back to the planet of
			transexual in the galaxy of Transylvania.
			Go now.

	The GUESTS flee down the ballroom and out the door.

	We see the laughing figures of RIFF RAFF and MAGENTA making a special
	sign to each other.

								CUT TO

165	INT.	CASTLE CORRIDORS	NIGHT

	We see BRAD and JANET fleeing with DR SCOTT following behind.

165A	INT.	BALLROOM	NIGHT

	RIFF RAFF and MAGENTA's laughter has subsided.

					RIFF RAFF
			Our noble mission is almost completed my
			most beautiful sister, soon we will return
			to the moon-drenched shores of our
			"androgenous" planet.

					MAGENTA
			Ah - sweet Transexual - land of night -
			to sing and dance once more to your dark
			refrains.  To take that step to the right...

					RIFF RAFF
			But it's the pelvic thrust
			that really drives you insane.

					MAGENTA
			And our World will do
			the Time Warp again.

165B	EXT.	CASTLE	DAWN

	There is a huge explosion.

166	EXT.	CASTLE	DAWN

	We see the entire castle surrounded by a giant beam of light and then
	vanish into space.

	During the explosion sequence the film reverts optically to black and
	white.

								DISSOLVE TO

167	EXT.	THE CRATER	DAY

	SONG:		"SUPER-HEROES"

	BRAD, JANET, and DR SCOTT's bodies are scattered on three sides
	surrounding a crater where the castle once was.

	The scene is arid and deserted.  There are remnants of DR SCOTT's
	wheelchair, EDDIE's coffin and broken objects from the laboratory.

	BRAD, tattered and bleeding, lifts himself up.

					BRAD
			I've done a lot
			God knows I've tried
			To find the truth I've even lied
			But all I know is down inside.

	DR SCOTT drags himself to his knees.

					BRAD & DR SCOTT
			I'm bleeding.

					JANET
				(revives)
			And super heroes
			Come to feast
			To taste the flesh
			Not yet deceased
			And al I know
			Is still the beast

					TRIO
			Is feeding.

	The three of them stand shakily on the perimeter of the crater.

	All that is left is dust and sand and wind and the sun.

	The CAMERA PANS from face to face in a circular movement getting faster
	and faster as the trio sing a chorale of hopelessness.

								DISSOLVE TO

168	INT.	STUDY	NIGHT

	The CAMERA has spun into a blur but focusses on a spinning globe
	of the earth on the NARRATOR's desk.

	The NARRATOR puts his hand on the globe, stopping it.

	He is standing over his lectern reading from his book like a preacher
	in a pulpit.

					NARRATOR
			And crawling on the planet's face
			Some insects called the human race
			Lost in time, and lost in space
			And meaning.

	He turns and goes to the door of the study.

	He switches off the light.

					VOICES OFF
			Meaning.

	He leaves the study, shutting the door.

	It's almost dark in the study.  Only a sinister glow inside the globe
	of the earth remains.

169	CREDIT SEQUENCE

	SONG:		"SCIENCE FICTION, DOUBLE-FEATURE"

	The cast credits roll up.

					VOICE OVER
			Science Fiction - double-feature
			Frank has built and lost his creature
			Darkness has conquered Brad and Janet
			The servants gone to a distant planet
			Oh - at the late night double-feature
			Picture Show - I want to go - Ohh -
			To the late night double-feature picture show.

				MICHAEL WHITE PRODUCTIONS LTD
				-----------------------------
				THE ROCKY HORROR PICTURE SHOW
				-----------------------------

					Script Amendments			September 12, 1974
					-----------------

The following alterations involve discrepancies between the original 
screenplay and current script revisions and design decisions.

1/2	The film will now commence in Black and White on "ACADEMY"
	format.  It will extend to wide screen (1.1 - 85) at
	Sequence 41, while still remaining in black and white.  At
	Sequence 54 the film changes to colour.

15	Now read "Denton Episcopalian Church".

23	Brad and Janet will arrive at the gate entrance to Oakley Court.
	This deletes a later reference to gates in 33.  From hereon ignore
	all references to rock formations etc., as the grounds of
	Oakley Court are the only location involved in the approach to the
	house.

25	Three motorbikes drive past Brad and disappear around the house.

26	This window will be in turret in Oakley Court.  Ignore all
	references to adjoining 'massive lighted window'.

30	This shot will be of a Gryphem on the Oakley Court facade.

32	This will be of some similar detail to the above.

38	"Stairway" references now allude to the front entrance hall of
	Oakley Court.

40	Delete references to "mirrors reflecting to infinity".

47	Columbia now is astride a Juke Box.  The band are cut.

54a	Red streamers and Black and White balloons fall.  Not just
	streamers.

69	All future references to the operating table in the Lab now
	should be applied either to the TANK or the vaulting horse
	(part of the gymnasium equipment) - whichever is applicable.

75	Delete references to the Ice-block.  Eddie now crashes
	through a wall of Coca Cola bottles and ice.  He is also equipped
	with a saxaphone rather than a guitar.

87a	Rocky now escapes through the lift shaft.  This may involve
	a shot from the vestibule showing Rocky climbing out of lift
	cage and running out of the house.  It may also involve the
	double bed in the bridal suite collapsing during the escape
	sequence.

91	It is still raining.

92	Janet is now stumbling around the staircase in Oakley Court.

103	This sequence may now also involve Riff-Raff, Magenta,
	Columbia, Frank, Brad and selected Transylvanians.

106	Will now have Frank, Riff-Raff, and Brad entering the Lab
	in the lift cage.

108	It is still raining.

116	Dr Scott will now break through the tiled wall of the laboratory
	on the area of ramp above the control panel.

117	Magenta will now appear through the broken tile area created
	by Dr Scott.

122/140 This sequence will be altered to Dr Scott holding a
	photograph album containing a still photograph equivalent
	of the "flashbacks" referred to in this sequence.

143/4	All entrances to the Lab will be via the broken tiled entrance.

	Delete all references to the floor lowering.

147	The "secret passage" is now the broken tile entrance.

164	Frank tries to scale up the silver drapes which descend on
	him with Tab tracks, rope supports, etc.

MEMO:  SCRIPT ALTERATIONS

FROM:  JIM SHARMAN				9.12.74

TO:    ALL CONCERNED.


Sc. 148  INT. NARRATOR'S STUDY.N>

As scripted up to;  What further indignities were they
to be subjected to?

Then please add:	And what of the floor show that had been
spoken of?  In an empty house?  In the middle of the night.
What diabolical plan had seized Frank's crazed imagination?
What indeed?  From what had gone before it was clear that
this was to be no picnic.


Sc. 97.  INT. NARRATOR'S STUDY.  N.

Is replaced by the following:

Emotion is a powerful and irrational master, and, from what
Magenta and Columbia eagerly viewed on their television
monitor there seemed little doubt that Janet was indeed it's
slave.

          EXT. WHEAT FIELD - MORNING
          
          SAMANTHA DARKO (18) opens her eyes. She squints as the summer
          sun shrinks her pupils to pinhole size. She sits up slowly,
          looks around... and finds herself in midst of an endless
          wheat field.
          
          Sam is pretty and demure. Her coppery hair flows past her
          shoulders. Disoriented, she stands and gazes at the infinite
          golden shimmer. Amber waves of grain. Patches of forest in
          the distance. It's quiet. Serene. Beautiful...
          
          She smiles, and starts walking.
          
          
          EXT. ARKANSAS HIGHWAY 40 - MORNING
          
          She emerges at the shoulder of a rural stretch of highway in
          Arkansas. Adjacent to her position, on the other side of the
          deserted lanes, is a TRUCK STOP.
          
          
          EXT. TRUCK STOP - MORNING
          
          Amongst the TRACTOR-TRAILERS parked in the back lot is a
          white, late-80s model CHEVROLET CELEBRITY. Sam makes her way
          across the asphalt toward the vehicle...
          
          
          INT. COREY'S CHEVROLET - MORNING
          
          COREY RICHARDSON (18) is asleep, curled up in the reclined
          driver's seat of the car. She awakens when Sam gets in on the
          passenger side and slams the door shut.
          
          Corey has the look of a typical rebellious teen: dyed hair,
          piercings, a little grungy. She rubs the sleep from her eyes,
          greeting the new day with something less than enthusiasm. She
          finds a soft pack of CIGARETTES and lights one.
          
                              COREY
                    What time is it?
          
                               SAM
                    Early...
          
          Corey adjusts her seat. She takes a long drag and chokes,
          then spits out the window. She starts the car...
          
                                                                      2.
          
          
          I/E. COREY'S CHEVROLET/HIGHWAY 40, VARIOUS - DAY
          
          Corey's car cruises along the flat, open road. She cranks up
          the VOLUME on the car's CASSETTE DECK, nodding her head to
          early-90s ALT. ROCK (suggestion: Into Dust, by Mazzy Star)...
          
          Sam looks out the window at the passing scenery: FARMERS at
          work in the fields; a BILLBOARD advertising a local
          restaurant; ROADSIDE DITCHES filled with trash...
          
          She fixates on a MINIVAN travelling in the slow lane. It
          contains the all-American NUCLEAR FAMILY: MOTHER, FATHER and
          three SIBLINGS, one of them being a YOUNGSTER. The Youngster
          makes a face at Sam as they pass by...
          
          
          INT. COREY'S CHEVROLET - LATER - DAY
          
          Corey glances at the CONTROL PANEL when she HEARS the engine
          start to RATTLE. She sees that the TEMPERATURE GAUGE has hit
          the red and her CHECK ENGINE LIGHT is on.
          
                              COREY
                    Shit...
          
          
          EXT. OKLAHOMA HIGHWAY 40/COREY'S CHEVROLET - DAY
          
          By the time they pull over on the side of the empty highway,
          steam billows out from under the hood. Sam gets out of the
          car to check on it while Corey remains behind the wheel.
          
          Sam peeks under the hood, trying to clear the air of the
          steam. It sounds like someone is rhythmically TAPPING the
          inside of the engine with a hammer.
          
                              SAM
                    Turn it off.
          
                               COREY
                        (poking her head out the
                          WINDOW)
                    What?
          
                              SAM
                    Turn off the car.
          
          Corey does so.
          
                              SAM (CONT'D)
                    Doesn't look too good...
          
                              COREY
                    How do you know?
          
                                                                      3.
          
          
                              SAM
                    It smells funny.
          
          Sam looks up when she HEARS a PICK-UP TRUCK coming toward
          them. Corey watches as she steps out to wave it down...
          
          The pick-up pulls over ahead of them. CHRIS HOLT (24), a
          brawny, attractive young man, gets out. When Corey sees him
          she gets out too.
          
                               SAM (CONT'D)
                    Thanks for stopping. Our car's
                    messed up.
          
                              CHRIS
                    What happened?
          
                              COREY
                    My check engine light came on, then
                    it just started smoking, and
                    ticking and shit.
          
          As Chris pokes around under the hood, Sam and Corey exchange
          looks. Chris pops opens the COOLANT CAP and burns his hand on
          the steam explosion.
          
                              CHRIS
                        (shaking it off)
                    Blew your water pump. Can't drive
                    it.
          
                                 COREY
                    Fuck me...
          
                              CHRIS
                    El Reno's just a couple miles up
                    ahead. Can call for a tow there.
                    C'mon, I'll give you a lift.
          
          
          I/E. CHRIS' TRUCK/EL RENO, VARIOUS - DAY
          
          All three crammed into the cab of the pick-up, they drive
          through the center of El Reno, Oklahoma (population 16,000)
          and see some of the locals out and about [MUSIC MONTAGE
          fueled by early- to mid-90s era GRUNGE ROCK (suggestion: Come
          As You Are, by Nirvana) -- reminiscent of the `Middlesex
          Middle School Montage' in DONNIE DARKO]:
          
          AGATHA DOWDY (54), an employee of the local DINER, sits on a
          bench in front of the establishment smoking a cigarette. The
          manager, TED MONCTON (50), calls her back inside...
          
                                                                   4.
          
          
          RANDY EVANS (21), RUTH GIBBENS (18) and JEFF (21) and MIKE
          JIMENEZ (20) loiter in the parking lot of a LIQUOR STORE...
          
          TRUDY POTTER (39) flirts with FATHER HOMEIJER (54), a
          Catholic priest, outside the BANK. A BANK SIGN shows the TIME

          OFFICER RYAN O'DELL (31) has pulled over a PRETTY LADY and
          uses his uniform to impress more than intimidate...
          
          They come up on VIETNAM TOM (48), who ambles along the side
          of the road against traffic, and he waves to them as they
          pass. He wears old, weather beaten clothes and a multi-
          colored SKI MASK over his head and face...
          
          [END MONTAGE]
          
          Sam swivels her head to watch Tom. ANOTHER CAR passes and he
          waves to it as well. Chris picks up on her curiosity.
          
                              CHRIS
                    He waves to everybody... Just kinda
                    walks up and down.
          
                              COREY
                    Resident nutcase?
          
                              CHRIS
                    People call him Vietnam Tom.
          
                              SAM
                    He was in the war?
          
                              CHRIS
                    He thinks he was... kind of a joke,
                    ya know?
          
          Sam continues to stare until he disappears out of sight...
          PAN DOWN to a PUDDLE by the side of the road. As a CAR TIRE
          splashes through it, PAN UP TO FIND:
          
          
          I/E. DUSTY'S GARAGE/HOUSE - AFTERNOON
          
          Dusty's auto repair shop, which is nothing more than a big
          garage attached to his old two-story house. Corey's car has
          been towed there, and DUSTY GIBBENS (37; father of Ruth
          Gibbens), the lone mechanic, tinkers around under the hood.
          
          Sam and Corey sit on the front steps of the house waiting,
          bored as hell. A PIT BULL laps at a nameless treat wedged
          into a crack in the walkway. The girls are forced to get up
          when Ruth (from outside the liquor store) comes to the door.
          
                                                                   5.
          
          
                              RUTH
                    Can I get out?
          
          Sam and Corey move so that she can exit the house. Ruth's
          look is hardened, rough around the edges -- she appears older
          than her 18 years.
          
          The girls watch as she enters the garage to see her father.
          She whispers something in his ear, and Dusty hands her some
          CASH, which she pockets then kisses him on the cheek. After
          this, Dusty wipes his hands on his greasy jeans and comes
          outside to address Corey and Sam.
          
                              DUSTY
                    Yeah... it's the water pump.
          
                              COREY
                    So what do we do?
          
                              DUSTY
                    I can order you up a new one.
                    Probably be a couple days.
          
                              COREY
                    Great. This the only show in town?
          
                              DUSTY
                    Cheapest and the best. But you want
                    me to call the tow guy back here,
                    no problem. Probably charge you
                    another hundred bucks, but he'll
                    get ya wherever you wanna go.
          
                              COREY
                    Just go ahead and fix it.
          
          
          INT. MOTEL LOBBY - AFTERNOON
          
          Phil Coulter (48), the proprietor of a dingy little roadside
          motel, looks up from a hardcover copy of Stephen King's
          GERALD'S GAME when the girls enter. They each have a SMALL
          SUITCASE and a BACKPACK in tow.
          
                              PHIL
                    What can I do for you?
          
                              COREY
                    We need a room.
          
          He gets out a notebook and lays it out on the counter. Corey
          finds a pen and starts to fill out a registration form... A
          NEWS BULLETIN about the O.J. SIMPSON TRIAL plays at a LOW
          VOLUME on a TELEVISION in the b.g.
          
                                                                    6.
          
          
                              SAM
                    How much is it?
          
                              PHIL
                    $39 a night. How many you stayin'?
          
                              COREY
                    Just a couple, we hope.
          
          He takes the KEY to ROOM 15 off the rack.
          
                              PHIL
                    Well... welcome to El Reno.
          
          
          EXT. LIQUOR STORE - NIGHT
          
          Sam and Corey arrive at the liquor store, which is down the
          street from the motel. Ruth, Randy Evans, and Jeff and Mike
          Jimenez are loitering in the parking lot in a similar fashion
          to how they were earlier in the day.
          
                              RUTH
                    You get checked into the motel
                    alright?
          
                              COREY
                    Yep.
          
          Randy seems surprised that Ruth has already made their
          acquaintance. He wastes no time in introducing himself.
          
                              RANDY
                    My name's Randy. This is Mike and
                    Jeff. Guess you already know Ruth.
          
                              COREY
                    Corey.
          
                              SAM
                    I'm Samantha.
          
          They shake, and Corey seems at ease mingling with the
          strangers. Sam hangs back a little.
          
                              COREY
                    One of you guys mind pickin' us up
                    a bottle of something?
          
                              RANDY
                    I think I can manage that. What do
                    you want?
          
                                                                      7.
          
          
                              COREY
                    I don't know. Vodka, whiskey,
                    whatever.
          
          Corey looks to Sam, who produces some cash. Randy takes the
          money and heads for the store.
          
                              RANDY
                    Be right back...
          
          After he's gone, there's an uncomfortable moment of silence
          in which Mike and Jeff ogle the girls mischievously. Ruth
          stares at them in a different way. She seems somewhat
          resentful of their presence.
          
                              RUTH
                    From Virginia, huh?
          
                                COREY
                    Yep.
          
                              RUTH
                    I saw your plates...
          
          Corey and Sam both nod in mundane acknowledgment. Another
          beat of uncomfortable silence.
          
                                RUTH (CONT'D)
                    Where to?
          
                                COREY
                    What?
          
                              RUTH
                    Your obviously just passin' through
                    here.
          
                              SAM
                    We're on the way to Vegas.
          
          Ruth snickers.
          
                              RUTH
                    Well... you need anything besides
                    booze, you just lemme know.
          
          Randy comes out of the store with a bottle in a brown bag. He
          passes it off to Corey, along with some change.
          
                              COREY
                    Thanks a lot, man.
          
                                                                      8.
          
          
                              RANDY
                    No problem. You guys wanna come
                    back to my place for bit? Bring
                    your bottle, we got some weed...
          
          Corey looks like she's considering it, but --
          
                              SAM
                    I'm really tired.
          
          She takes Sam's signal.
          
                              COREY
                    Yeah, I think we'll just head back.
                    Been a long day, ya know?
          
                              RANDY
                    That's cool.
          
          
          EXT. BANK - LATER - NIGHT
          
          The clock on the BANK SIGN shows 3:30 AM -- then flashes to --
          JUNE 19, 1995... It changes again, this time to a countdown
          to the JULY 4TH FIREWORKS CELEBRATION: 15 DAYS, 17 HOURS, 29
          MINUTES, 57 SECONDS... 56 SECONDS... 55 SECONDS...
          
          
          INT. MOTEL ROOM 15 - NIGHT
          
          Sam awakens suddenly from a nightmare. She lies atop the
          blankets wearing a T-SHIRT and BOXER SHORTS. She looks over
          and sees Corey passed out on the other full-size bed.
          
          TWO PLASTIC CUPS, EMPTY SODA CANS, and the BOTTLE are on the
          nightstand between them, the liquor partially consumed.
          There's a digital CLOCK/RADIO that reads 3:30 AM.
          
          The TV is on, and a late night INFOMERCIAL for the GEORGE
          FOREMAN GRILL plays. Sam stares at the screen as the images
          WARP and RIPPLE in a way that coincides with an increasingly
          loud, rumbling TREMOR from outside...
          
          In a daze, she gets up and slowly walks closer to the
          television. She reaches out with her RIGHT HAND, about to
          touch it... A strange, abrupt HARD CUT TO:
          
          
          EXT. GRASSY FIELD BEHIND MOTEL - NIGHT
          
          Sam is in a grassy field behind the motel, moving away from
          the building. She wears a HOODED SWEATSHIRT, JEANS, and her
          RIGHT HAND is wrapped in some sort of MAKESHIFT BANDAGE.
          
                                                                      9.
          
          
          There's a GASH in the side of her forehead by her temple,
          with what looks to be a SHARD OF METAL partially embedded
          under the skin and protruding from the wound.
          
          She is without expression, and her movements are rhythmic and
          fluid. A tall AERMOTOR WINDMILL towers in the distance...
          
          
          SAM'S LUMINOUS POV - THE GRASSY FIELD
          
          A glimpse of the field through Sam's eyes shows a
          phosphorescent PLANE OF DESTINY -- an intricate grid in which
          objects organic and inorganic dwell in assigned positions,
          and move according to a framework of set paths.
          
          A JACKRABBIT follows a silvery VECTOR SPEAR like prophetic
          life-gel to its burrow... COSMIC ENERGY burns around a
          CLUSTER OF STONES... Miniature VECTOR SPEARS lead a SWARM OF
          INSECTS around in a circle and then BUZZING right past Sam's
          field of vision...
          
          It's infinitely complex, but Sam sees through it clearly. She
          has no vector spear of her own to guide her, but she is
          cognizant of her path... She moves toward the WINDMILL.
          
          
          EXT. WINDMILL - NIGHT
          
          Sam appears at the foot of the windmill tower. A giant WATER
          TANK squats beside it. Remaining stoic, she looks up and sees
          Vietnam Tom sitting atop the windmill platform, more than 30
          feet up, staring back down at her through the eyes holes of
          his ski mask...
          
          
          ANGLE: WINDMILL PLATFORM
          
          Tom peers over the edge of the small platform, the surface of
          which is littered with TATTERED CLOTHING, a WATER BOTTLE,
          CANS OF FOOD and SCRAPS OF A TARP. He cradles a RIFLE in his
          arms...
          
          His focus shifts from what is at the foot of the windmill to
          what is sitting right beside him --
          
          REVEAL Sam. Her legs dangle over the side of the platform,
          and she stares off into distance.
          
                              SAM
                    The sky's so beautiful here...
          
          Tom looks in the direction that she stares and then back at
          her. Sam turns to meet his gaze...
          
                                                                     10.
          
          
                              SAM (CONT'D)
                    But we can't stay.
          
          
          SAM'S LUMINOUS POV - VIETNAM TOM
          
          Sam sees through to the core of his physical being, the
          DYNAMIC CENTER of which lingers pulsating in a translucent
          circle around his chest.
          
          Magnified NEURONS in TOM'S BRAIN send ELECTRIC IMPULSES that
          release NEUROTRANSMITTERS, which excite OTHER NEURONS...
          
          Tom slowly reaches out to touch Sam, but an invisible FORCE
          FIELD makes contact impossible. RIPPLES swell throughout the
          clear plasma-like barrier from where he touched it, and his
          hand remains glued to the spot.
          
          Sam extends her bandaged right hand, and presses it to
          Vietnam Tom's as if she were touching a mirrored image of
          herself.
          
          The contact generates more RIPPLES, and as TREMORS begin to
          shake the windmill a DISTORTED VOICE echoes throughout the
          COSMOS:
          
                              DISTORTED VOICE (V.O.)
                    15 days... 18 hours... 45
                    minutes... 6 seconds. That is when
                    the world will end.
          
          A CYLINDRICAL PORTAL opens up below them, gaping and swirling
          like God's eye on the mouth of a liquid tornado. As Sam and
          Tom stand in unison to peer into it, a HEXAGONAL PLATE OF
          WHITE LIGHT emanates from within --
          
          
          EXT. BELOW WINDMILL - NIGHT
          
          They appear near the foot of the windmill, sprinting away
          from it together. Tom has his rifle, and he looks up to the
          sky as he runs...
          
          ...there's a brilliant flash of GREEN LIGHT -- deafening
          THUNDER -- a blinding EXPLOSION --
          
          
          EXT. BUS STOP - MORNING
          
          Sam awakens to the morning sun blinding her. She struggles to
          peer through the harsh whiteness at a looming figure that
          stands over her. Her eyes adjust to discover that it's a
          policeman -- Officer O'Dell.
          
                                                                     11.
          
          
                              OFFICER O'DELL
                    `Fraid you can't sleep here, miss.
          
          Sam sits up and realizes she's on a bench at a bus stop near
          the side of the road. O'Dell's tone is innocuous, and when
          she looks up at him again she sees that he's grinning.
          
                              OFFICER O'DELL (CONT'D)
                    Got anyplace to be?
          
          Sam manages to find her voice.
          
                                 SAM
                    The motel.
          
          She takes his hand and rises.
          
          
          I/E. O'DELL'S CRUISER/MOTEL - MORNING
          
          O'Dell's cruiser pulls into the motel parking lot, which is
          uncharacteristically full. A FIRE TRUCK is parked by the side
          of the road. Just then, a call comes in on the POLICE RADIO:
          
                              DISPATCH (V.O.)
                    We got some kinda situation at
                    Frank Haley's farm...
          
                              OFFICER O'DELL
                    Copy that. I'm here now...
          
          
          EXT. GRASSY FIELD BEHIND MOTEL - MORNING
          
          Where the towering windmill once stood is now only a CRATER
          about 5 feet deep and 10 feet in diameter, with charred bits
          of wood and metal strewn everywhere. GROUND WATER spurts from
          the broken WELL SEAL...
          
          And a cantaloupe-sized METEORITE sits in the center of the
          crater.
          
          Two FIREMEN haul out the meteorite with gloved hands as Sam
          and O'Dell arrive on the scene. Corey is already there
          looking on, as well as Chris Holt, who gave them a ride into
          town, Phil Coulter from the motel, and other local CITIZENS.
          FRANK HALEY (54), the farmer who owns the land, is fuming.
          
                              FRANK
                    Un-fuckin'-believable...
          
          The Firemen drop the porous, misshapen clod by his feet.
          
                                                                  12.
          
          
                              FIREMAN #1
                    It's still warm.
          
                              FRANK
                    You know how much it's gonna cost
                    me to replace this goddamn
                    windmill?
          
          Officer O'Dell steps up beside him and kicks the meteorite
          with his boot.
          
                              OFFICER O'DELL
                    Sell this thing off to some
                    meteorologist nerd club, I bet you
                    could do okay.
          
                                FRANK
                    Ya think?
          
          Sam looks down at a CAN OF FOOD on the ground amidst some
          scorched CLOTHING. O'Dell takes note of some other CANNED
          GOODS and SCRAPS OF TARP.
          
                              OFFICER O'DELL
                    What's all that stuff, Frank?
          
                               FRANK
                    That whack job Tom's been squattin'
                    up there the last couple a' months.
                    Thinks he's the goddamn town
                    watchman...
                        (BEAT)
                    You think he got blown up?
          
          Everyone scans the ground for signs of human remains until
          Phil pipes up:
          
                              PHIL
                    I saw him out in front of the motel
                    early this morning, alive and well.
          
                              FRANK
                        (SARCASTIC)
                    Oh, well, thank heavens...
          
          Sam turns and peers up at the WATER TANK. It's marred by BURN
          MARKS and DENTS from the explosion. As she tilts her head and
          looks closer, she can almost pick out a shape created by the
          damage -- a negative image like the Shroud of Turin...
          
          ...in the form of a bizarre, toothy-grinned FACE OF A GIANT
          MONSTER BUNNY.
          
                                                                  13.
          
          
          EXT. MOTEL - MORNING
          
          Sam and Corey are on their way back to the motel room when
          they turn and see that Chris has followed them.
          
                                 CHRIS
                    Hey...
          
                                 SAM
                    Hey.
          
                              CHRIS
                    So you guys stayed here last night?
          
                              COREY
                    One of us did.
          
          Sam gives Corey a look. Chris decides to ignore the comment.
          
                              CHRIS
                    What's up with your car?
          
                              COREY
                    It's gonna take a couple days.
          
                              CHRIS
                    For a water pump?
          
          Sam and Corey shrug.
          
                              CHRIS (CONT'D)
                    None of my business, but...
          
          He's distracted when a brand new `95 BMW pulls up and parks
          nearby. JEREMY FRAME (25), a thin, pale young man hops out
          and hustles into the field toward the crash site.
          
                                 SAM
                    What?
          
          Chris regains his train of thought:
          
                              CHRIS
                    I was just gonna say, if you
                    wanted, I could give you a ride
                    back.
          
          He looks right at Sam when he says this. He then glances over
          at Corey, as if just remembering she was there.
          
                              CHRIS (CONT'D)
                    You too. I mean, I could give you
                    both a ride.
          
                                                                    14.
          
          
                              COREY
                    To Middlesex, Virginia? Do you have
                    any clue how far that is?
          
                              CHRIS
                        (SHEEPISH)
                    I got some time...
          
          Sam looks as though she's about to say something but Corey
          overpowers her.
          
                              COREY
                    We're not goin' back. Even El
                    Reno's better than there.
          
          Chris makes eye contact with Sam again. She maintains it for
          a moment and then looks away.
          
          
          EXT. JUNKYARD - DAY
          
          Vietnam Tom explores a cluttered junkyard, gathering
          materials. He scours amongst the PILES OF REFUSE, RUSTY
          MACHINES and crumbling STORAGE SHACKS.
          
          He bends to pick up a SCRAP OF METAL and adds it to a
          collection he's making in a worn SATCHEL...
          
          
          EXT. DINER - DAY
          
          As Sam and Corey are about to enter the diner, Trudy Potter,
          a bank teller, is on her way out.
          
          The girls move to the side so she can exit, and take notice
          of a MISSING PERSONS SIGN posted next to the door -- BILLY
          MOORCROFT'S (10) dark, empty eyes stare at them from the
          BLACK & WHITE PHOTOGRAPH.
          
                              TRUDY (O.S.)
                    Isn't that just awful?
          
          Trudy has stopped and is looking over their shoulders.
          
                              TRUDY (CONT'D)
                    His poor mother...
          
          
          INT. DINER - DAY
          
          The girls sit at a booth, sipping Cokes.
          
                              COREY
                    How much money do we have left?
          
                                                                  15.
          
          
                              SAM
                    Not a whole lot.
          
                              COREY
                    I can't believe your fucking
                    parents wouldn't give you anything.
          
                              SAM
                    They totally flipped out that I was
                    even going. They weren't about to
                    give me money for the big trip.
          
                              COREY
                    We should've waited till the end of
                    the month when my mom gets her
                    check.
          
                              SAM
                    She wouldn't have given you
                    anything.
          
                              COREY
                    I know where she keeps her cash.
                    What's she gonna do, send her
                    boyfriend after me?
          
          Corey pokes at the crushed ice in her glass with her straw.
          
                               COREY (CONT'D)
                    Doesn't matter. As soon as we get
                    to Vegas, we'll be set. My cousin
                    said sometimes she makes two grand
                    in a week.
          
                                SAM
                    Jesus.
          
          Sam is impressed, but something about her subdued reaction
          exhibits reservations... Just then, Agatha Dowdy arrives with
          plates of BURGERS AND FRIES.
          
                              AGATHA
                    Here you go. Where'd you two say
                    you were from again?
          
                                SAM
                    Virginia.
          
                              AGATHA
                    You hear that, Ted?
          
          She calls to Ted Moncton, who is busy behind the counter.
          
                                                                  16.
          
          
                               TED
                    What?
          
                              AGATHA
                    These girls are from Virginia.
          
                              TED
                    I'll be damned. I'm from Reedville,
                    if you know where abouts that is...
          
          Neither Sam nor Corey give much of a hint as to a yes or no.
          
                              TED (CONT'D)
                    Well, have yourself some ice cream
                    when you're done, on the house.
          
                      COREY                               SAM
          Okay.                           Thank you.
          
                              AGATHA
                    Anything else you need, give a
                    holler.
          
          Agatha moves off, and Sam and Corey start to dig into their
          food...
          
          Momentarily, someone else enters and takes a seat at the
          counter by their booth. It's Jeremy Frame, the driver of the
          BMW. He raises a finger to alert Ted of his presence.
          
                              JEREMY
                    Just a coffee, please.
          
          Ted nods and pours him a cup... After he receives his coffee,
          Jeremy turns and stares at the girls. They both notice him
          doing it, but Corey is the first to speak.
          
                              COREY
                    Can we help you?
          
                              JEREMY
                    No, no... it's just that I
                    recognize you. I saw you by the
                    motel. Pretty amazing, huh?
          
                               COREY
                    I guess.
          
                              JEREMY
                    I just made a deal with Frank Haley
                    to buy it for seven-hundred fifty
                    dollars.
          
                                                                  17.
          
          
                              COREY
                    Whoop-dee-doo. What the hell are
                    you gonna do with a friggin'
                    meteor?
          
                              JEREMY
                    Meteorite, actually...
          
          Corey rolls her eyes at being corrected. Sam smirks and
          munches on a french fry -- she's enjoying their conversation.
          
                               JEREMY (CONT'D)
                    I'm gonna study it. I'm a grad
                    student at Redlands... we've
                    actually got a pretty cool geology
                    lab there.
          
          Corey focuses on her lunch, ignoring him, but Jeremy goes on.
          
                              JEREMY (CONT'D)
                    I've gotta do some tests, but if I
                    had to guess, I'd say it's a
                    siderite. They're composed
                    primarily of iron and nickel.
          
                                COREY
                    Have fun.
          
                              JEREMY
                    My name's Jeremy.
          
                              COREY
                    That's nice.
          
          Sam glances up at Jeremy, expecting him to be hurt or
          embarrassed by Corey's snub. But he's not. He's smiling at
          her, and she can't help but smile back.
          
          
          EXT. FATHER HOMEIJER'S HOUSE/CHURCH - AFTERNOON
          
          Each licking an ICE CREAM CONE, Corey and Sam walk past the
          home of Father Homeijer. The priest is outside working in his
          flower garden, wearing his CLERICAL COLLAR. An old CATHOLIC
          CHURCH rests on the same lot as his house, looming behind it.
          
          When Father Homeijer sees the girls walking by, he rises from
          his work, takes off his gloves and wipes sweat from his
          forehead. Sam and Corey both notice him eyeballing them.
          
                              COREY
                    What's his problem?
          
                                                                   18.
          
          
                              SAM
                    Just keep walking.
          
          Corey waves to him in a sarcastic, exaggerated manner... The
          priest doesn't wave back, but continues to gawk at them until
          they go around the corner.
          
                               COREY
                    Freak...
          
          
          EXT. JUNKYARD, STORAGE SHACK - AFTERNOON
          
          Vietnam Tom crouches in a decrepit SHACK covered by a piece
          of CORRUGATED ROOFING. He works with great focus, arranging
          VARIOUS BITS OF METAL into some sort of small SCULPTURE...
          
          
          EXT. LIQUOR STORE - LATER - AFTERNOON
          
          Having finished their ice creams, the girls pass the liquor
          store on the way back to the motel. They find Randy, Ruth,
          Jeff and Mike at their usual post.
          
                              RANDY
                    Hey, what's up?
          
                              COREY
                    Not much... just getting stared
                    down by creepy priest boy back
                    there.
          
                              JEFF
                    Father Homeijer?
          
                              MIKE
                    Don't worry, you're a little old
                    for his taste.
          
                              JEFF
                    Yeah, he's a fuckin' perv.
          
                              COREY
                        (to Randy)
                    You got an extra cigarette?
          
          Randy takes a pack from his pocket and offers her one.
          
                              RANDY
                    I'm throwin' a big party at my
                    house tonight, you guys should come
                    by. No excuses this time...
          
          Sam and Corey look at each other, considering.
          
                                                                   19.
          
          
                              RANDY (CONT'D)
                    You're gonna be stuck in El Reno,
                    you might as well have some fun,
                    right?
          
          
          EXT. RANDY'S HOUSE, BACKYARD - NIGHT
          
          The party at Randy's teems with LOCALS, ages ranging from
          early teens to late-20s. On the back deck is a KEG OF BEER
          and a BOOMBOX blasting MUSIC. There's a slimy-looking POOL,
          and a few people swim in the greenish water.
          
          Randy and Ruth make their rounds as a pair. They stop off so
          Ruth can sell a BAG OF WEED to some eager KIDS. Corey and Sam
          hang with Mike and Jeff, drinking beer.
          
                              COREY
                    You guys gotta come visit the club
                    when we get all set up. We'll give
                    you the VIP treatment, man...
          
          Mike and Jeff are both excited about this proposition.
          
                              MIKE
                    Sounds good to me.
          
                              COREY
                    Give us a little time, me and
                    Sam'll be runnin' that place, no
                    doubt... right?
          
                              SAM
                    Yeah. Definitely.
          
          Corey is relaxed, enjoying their newfound friends, while Sam
          appears more out of place. She drains the better part of her
          cup for some liquid courage.
          
          Randy and Ruth converge back on the group just as Officer
          O'Dell creeps into the backyard wearing plainclothes. Ruth
          notices him first.
          
                              RUTH
                    Fuck.
          
                              RANDY
                    What?
          
                              RUTH
                    That pig, O'Dell.
          
                                                                     20.
          
          
                              RANDY
                    Don't worry about Ryan. He might be
                    a cop, but he still likes to party.
          
          Randy's theory is proven when O'Dell takes a FLASK from his
          pocket and has a snort before approaching a pair of TEENAGE
          GIRLS... But Ruth is still not satisfied.
          
                              RUTH
                    I think that asshole knows I deal.
                    You know how fucked that is?
          
                              RANDY
                    From what I hear he's got a little
                    somethin' goin' on the side
                    himself.
          
                              RUTH
                    Fucking pig's a pig.
          
          They're all distracted when somebody does a cannonball into
          the pool and splashes them.
          
                      MIKE                               JEFF
          Fuck!                            Bastard!
          
                              SAM
                    What the hell...
          
          Sam bends to wipe some of the water from her pants. Ruth
          watches her, smirking.
          
                              RANDY
                    We might as well all go in now,
                    we're already wet.
          
                              RUTH
                    Good idea...
          
          Without warning, Ruth shoves Sam backwards into the pool --
          
          
          ANGLE: BENEATH THE WATER
          
          She sinks into the murky water in SLOW-MOTION. All SOUNDS are
          DROWNED OUT and everything is tranquil, completely detached.
          
          Through her blurred vision, Sam can see Randy's PORCH LIGHTS
          glimmering beyond the surface of the water... TRANSITION TO:
          
                                                                  21.
          
          
          INT. AUDITORIUM - NIGHT
          
          The SPOT LIGHTS are blinding from the perspective of the
          STAGE. Through the WHITE BLUR an auditorium full of PEOPLE
          can been seen...
          
          In SLOW-MOTION and perfect synchronicity, YOUNG SAMANTHA (11)
          and the "SPARKLE MOTION" GIRLS are in the midst of their
          dance performance... BACK TO:
          
          
          EXT. RANDY'S HOUSE, BACKYARD - NIGHT
          
          A HAND reaches into the pool, grabs onto Sam's arm and pulls
          her up --
          
          She breaches the surface of the water, gasping for breath --
          back to reality. She sees that Randy is the one responsible
          for pulling her out.
          
                              RANDY
                    You fall asleep down there?
          
          He, Ruth and the others are looking down at her, laughing.
          Sam is lost in thought, struck by her vision...
          
          She snaps out of it when she sees Corey tear off her top and
          jump into the pool beside her. Many of the PARTYGOERS hoot in
          approval, and Randy, Mike and Jeff strip down and leap in
          right behind her.
          
          Sam swims toward the far side of the pool where the steps
          are, and fewer people. When she arrives there, she's
          surprised to find Chris Holt waiting for her with a towel.
          
                              CHRIS
                    Thought you could maybe use this.
          
          As Chris hands her the towel, he notices a wide SCAR on the
          inside of Sam's RIGHT WRIST... but doesn't mention it. Sam
          wraps the towel around her sopping wet body.
          
          Corey looks over and sees her getting out...
          
          
          EXT. RANDY'S HOUSE, PORCH - MOMENTS LATER - NIGHT
          
          Chris and Sam stand by the keg with fresh beers.
          
                              CHRIS
                    So what's so wrong at home that you
                    had to take off?
          
          The question takes Sam by surprise.
          
                                                                  22.
          
          
                              CHRIS (CONT'D)
                    I'd love to get outta here someday
                    too... just don't know quite where
                    I'd go.
          
          Sam decides to open up a little.
          
                              SAM
                    I hate it there. It's like everyone
                    knows everything about me, but I'm
                    invisible at the same time. It's
                    like the worst of both worlds.
          
                              CHRIS
                    Small towns. How `bout your family?
          
                              SAM
                    They didn't want me to leave...
                    well, they did, but they wanted me
                    to go away to Harvard or something
                    like that, like my sister.
          
          Sam takes a big sip of her beer, showing signs of tipsiness.
          
                              SAM (CONT'D)
                    Sometimes I think it would've been
                    easier if... I just, after my
                    BROTHER-
          
          Sam stops herself.
          
                               CHRIS
                    What?
          
                              SAM
                        (changing gears)
                    That's why I love Corey, she just
                    doesn't give a shit. She does what
                    she wants and she doesn't care what
                    people think.
          
                              CHRIS
                    You just gotta be yourself, that's
                    all. What is it you wanna do
                    exactly?
          
                              SAM
                    I always thought I'd be a dancer,
                    like in a troupe or something...
          
          Sam is self-conscious after admitting this.
          
                              SAM (CONT'D)
                    That sounds kinda stupid probably.
          
                                                                   23.
          
          
                               CHRIS
                    No...
          
                              SAM
                    When I was younger, my dance team
                    was on Star Search.
          
                               CHRIS
                    Really?
          
                              SAM
                    Yeah... but I didn't go.
          
                               CHRIS
                    Why not?
          
                              SAM
                    I didn't end up dancing in the
                    talent show where they got
                    discovered... I didn't really feel
                    like it at the time anyway.
          
                               CHRIS
                    Huh...
          
                              SAM
                    But that's why we're going to
                    Vegas. There's lots of
                    opportunities there.
          
          Chris glances over to the pool where Corey is topless,
          splashing and goofing around with some BOYS.
          
                              CHRIS
                        (SMIRKING)
                    Yeah, good place for it. Gettin'
                    some practice on the way, too.
          
          Sam takes offense, getting drunk and sensitive.
          
                              SAM
                    Is that supposed to be like some
                    kind of judgement or something?
          
                              CHRIS
                    No, I was just-
          
          She takes her beer and storms away from him.
          
                              CHRIS (CONT'D)
                    Sam, wait... hey, come on...
          
                                                                  24.
          
          
          EXT. RANDY'S HOUSE, SIDE ENTRANCE - NIGHT
          
          Sam finds a STOOP at the side of the house where she can be
          alone. She can HEAR the PARTY going on in the backyard, but
          no one else is in sight.
          
          Still soaking wet, she plants herself on the stoop and starts
          to pound the rest of her drink...
          
          A strange, abrupt HARD CUT TO:
          
          
          EXT. STREET IN FRONT OF RANDY'S HOUSE - NIGHT
          
          Sam lies in the middle of the street in front of Randy's. A
          lone, flickering STREET LIGHT intermittently bathes her in an
          orange glow.
          
          She is completely dry, wearing her HOODED SWEATSHIRT and
          JEANS, with the MAKESHIFT BANDAGE wrapped around her right
          hand. The SHARD OF METAL protrudes from the GASH in her
          forehead...
          
          A CAR suddenly screams right past her prostrate form, missing
          her by inches. She sits up slowly and looks toward the front
          of Randy's house, which is about 20 yards away.
          
          
          SAM'S LUMINOUS POV - DRUNK GUYS
          
          Two DRUNK GUYS exit the house and enter the complex,
          phosphorescent grid that is Sam's field of vision. VECTOR
          SPEARS jut from their chests and precede all their movements
          as they open the gas tank of a PARKED CAR, insert a SIPHON,
          and begin to drain the gas into ANOTHER VEHICLE.
          
                              DRUNK GUY #1
                    Hurry up...
          
          Although she is close by, they take no notice of Sam
          whatsoever. ANOTHER CAR speeds by, again nearly crushing her,
          but she doesn't flinch...
          
          She stands, and turns deliberately to face the opposite side
          of the road where, unlike the Drunk Guys, there is someone
          who is completely focused on her -- Vietnam Tom crouches in a
          DITCH near a CULVERT --
          
          
          ANGLE: CULVERT
          
          Sam appears with him in the tenebrous ditch. Tom stares at
          her wide-eyed through the eyeholes of his ski mask.
          
                                                                    25.
          
          
          From one end of the broad, open culvert they can see straight
          through to the other side...
          
          A PORTAL starts to take shape within, swirling around the
          circumference. Soft, BLUE LIGHT touches their faces from the
          phosphorescent glow, and a gust of WIND is nearly strong
          enough to make them falter.
          
          On the opposite end of the culvert, a PLATE OF WHITE LIGHT
          flashes for an instant then transforms into an image of
          FATHER HOMEIJER'S CHURCH --
          
          
          EXT. CHURCH - NIGHT
          
          Tom and Sam stand outside the church. The STEEPLE reigns over
          them. Sam is stoic as she watches Tom climb the STONE STEPS
          and approach the great WOOD DOORS...
          
          
          INT. CHURCH - NIGHT
          
          Sam sits like a statue in one of the PEWS. Tom strides past
          her in a daze, moving toward the PULPIT...
          
          Beside the ALTAR stand THREE BARE CROSSES in imitation of
          Calvary, each standing over 4 feet tall.
          
          Sam looks up to a HIGH CORNER, above the pulpit to the right,
          where two walls and the ceiling meet...
          
          
          SAM'S LUMINOUS POV - CONVERGENCE POINT
          
          The three planes come together at an irregular angle, with
          the WALL ON THE RIGHT SIDE SLANTING INWARD, and the CEILING
          SLOPING SLIGHTLY DOWNWARD.
          
          PHOSPHORESCENCE burns in the three queerly pitches lines,
          with a concentration of heightened energy at the juncture.
          
          A VECTOR SPEAR bulges from Vietnam Tom's chest where he
          stands below it, reaching higher and higher...
          
          As Tom's SPEAR gets closer to the convergence point, the
          BIZARRE ANGLING becomes more exaggerated because the planes
          start to DIP and SWELL with impossible elasticity --
          
          
          ANGLE: BETWEEN THE WALLS
          
          Sam and Tom find themselves squeezed between the inner and
          outer walls. Claustrophobic, dusty and obscure.
          
                                                                  26.
          
          
          Dilapidated WIRING snakes around them, and Tom barely has
          enough space to reach forth and touch it with his finger...
          
          COSMIC ENERGY jolts through the WIRE. A SPARK. A BLUE
          FLAME...
          
          Heat and pressure build. The old dry wood begins to CREAK and
          SNAP -- FADE TO WHITE.
          
          
          OVER WHITE...
          
          The SHARP SOUNDS echo and fade away... then become present
          again. Louder now, and different. A BANGING...
          
          
          INT. MOTEL ROOM 15 - THE NEXT DAY
          
          Sam pulls back the CURTAIN OF WHITE -- a SHEET over her face.
          She's lying on the floor of the motel room in between the
          beds.
          
          She's alone, and naked except for the sheet. Her WET CLOTHES
          are in a heap beside her. Her head is throbbing...
          
          BANG! BANG! BANG! BANG! BANG!
          
          She scrambles to put something on so she can get the DOOR...
          
          
          I/E. MOTEL ROOM 15 - MOMENTS LATER - DAY
          
          Having thrown on some wrinkled clothes, Sam opens the door to
          find Phil, the motel owner. He does not look pleased.
          
                              PHIL
                    You plannin' on checkin' out today?
          
                              SAM
                        (GROGGY)
                    Uh... I, I don't know yet.
          
                              PHIL
                    Well, it's already way past
                    checkout time, so you'd better
                    figure it out quick.
          
                              SAM
                    I've just gotta find Corey... and
                    check on the car.
          
                                                                     27.
          
          
                              PHIL
                    You do whatever you have to, but if
                    you're stayin' another night I
                    wanna see some money up front.
          
          
          EXT. BANK - DAY
          
          Sam approaches the bank, and when she sees the tall SIGN with
          the digital clock, she stops and stares up at it. It strikes
          a chord but she doesn't know why...
          
          The sign reads 12:48 PM -- and then -- JUNE 20, 1995. It
          changes to the FIREWORKS COUNTDOWN: 14 DAYS, 8 HOURS, 11
          MINUTES, 22 SECONDS... 21 SECONDS...
          
          
          INT. BANK - DAY
          
          Sam enters the small bank, and as she approaches the counter
          she sees that Trudy Potter is in tears. Some of her FEMALE CO-
          WORKERS are consoling her.
          
                              TRUDY
                    I don't believe it... I still just
                    don't believe it.
          
                              FEMALE CO-WORKER
                    It's gonna be alright. You'll see.
          
          Trudy looks up and sees Sam waiting uncomfortably.
          
                              TRUDY
                        (dabbing at her eyes with
                         a tissue)
                    Can I help you?
          
                              SAM
                    Is everything okay?
          
                              TRUDY
                    No, it's not... Mount Calvary
                    burned to the ground last night.
          
                              SAM
                    Mount Calvary?
          
                              TRUDY
                    Father Homeijer's church.
          
                              SAM
                    Oh... How did it happen?
          
                                                          28.
          
          
                              TRUDY
                    The police are looking into it,
                    but... I know it was arson.
          
          Trudy leans in to talk quietly to Sam.
          
                               TRUDY (CONT'D)
                    It's no secret to me how people in
                    this town feel about Father
                    Homeijer. The horrible accusations
                    that have been made against him...
                    But it's just a lot of nonsense. El
                    Reno's changed so much since I was
                    a kid growing up here. The young
                    people nowadays...
                        (BEAT)
                    No offense.
          
          She places her hand on top of Sam's.
          
                              TRUDY (CONT'D)
                    But with all the drugs and the
                    crime... I just don't know what
                    this world's coming to anymore.
          
          Sam tries to redirect her focus.
          
                              SAM
                    Are you able to get money wired
                    here from my bank back home?
          
                              TRUDY
                    We don't usually work with other
                    banks like that.
          
                              SAM
                    I need to check my balance and get
                    my money out. How do I do that?
          
                              TRUDY
                    You'll have to call and arrange it.
                    You could always use Western Union.
                    Where's your bank?
          
                                SAM
                    Virginia.
          
                              TRUDY
                    Oh... `cause they're gonna need to
                    have a signature.
          
          Disappointed, Sam turns to leave...
          
                                                                  29.

          As she's on her way out, she notices a BULLETIN BOARD with
          another MISSING PERSONS SIGN for BILLY MOORCROFT.
          
          She stands before the picture, staring into the young boy's
          dark, empty eyes. Though it's just a low quality black &
          white photo, Billy's face emotes profound hopelessness and
          despair.
          
          
          EXT. BANK - DAY
          
          As Sam comes out of the bank Jeremy rolls up in his BMW and
          parks in the lot. He gets out and approaches her.
          
                                 JEREMY
                    Hi there.
          
                                 SAM
                    Hey.
          
                              JEREMY
                    I didn't get your name at the
                    diner.
          
                                 SAM
                    I'm Sam.
          
                                 JEREMY
                    Jeremy.
          
          They shake, and Jeremy holds her hand for a little longer
          than what is generally comfortable.
          
                              JEREMY (CONT'D)
                    So what are you up to?
          
                              SAM
                    Trying to get money... not very
                    successfully.
          
                              JEREMY
                    I've gotta pick up some cash too.
                    Need some supplies for the lab. I
                    don't think I've even slept since I
                    got my hands on that meteorite. You
                    should come by the lab with me and
                    check it out.
          
                                 SAM
                    I can't...
          
          Sam starts to walk away from him.
          
                                                                  30.
          
          
                              JEREMY
                    I could let you borrow some
                    money... if you need some.
          
                              SAM
                    I don't even know you.
          
                              JEREMY
                    That's okay. I trust you.
          
                              SAM
                    Thanks anyway.
          
                              JEREMY
                    You're sure you don't want to check
                    out the lab?
          
                              SAM
                    Sorry... I've gotta find Corey.
          
          Sam turns to leave.
          
                              JEREMY
                    Maybe some other time.
          
          
          I/E. RANDY'S CAR - AFTERNOON
          
          Corey rides shotgun in Randy's car, chewing on some greasy
          FAST FOOD, looking quite content. Randy is behind the wheel
          with a BEER in his hand, and Mike, Jeff and Ruth are packed
          into the back, passing around a JOINT.
          
                              MIKE
                    How many cheeseburgers did we get?
          
                              RUTH
                    Like eight.
          
          Mike passes the joint up to Corey and she takes a big hit,
          chases it with some beer...
          
                              JEFF
                    Wait, did we get smokes?
          
          Everyone in the car is stunned into momentary silence when
          they turn a corner and see what's left of the church.
          
                      MIKE                            RANDY
          Whoa!                           Jesus Christ...
          
                                                                    31.
          
          
          POV FROM THE CAR - THE CHURCH RUINS
          
          POLICE and FIREMEN swarm. Father Homeijer stands with Officer
          O'Dell, gazing at the soggy ruins. The only things standing
          amid the charred mess are the THREE BARE CROSSES of Mount
          Calvary. But they aren't completely intact --
          
          
          EXT. CHURCH RUINS - CONTINUOUS - ANGLE ON - DEFORMED CROSSES
          
          All three are bent drastically forward, sagging down toward
          the murky ground...
          
                              OFFICER O'DELL (O.S.)
                    Musta' melted from the heat.
          
          Father Homeijer looks down at the metamorphosis, beside
          himself with bitterness and sorrow.
          
                              FATHER HOMEIJER
                    They're made of silver-plated
                    steel. A simple fire couldn't do
                    that.
          
                              OFFICER O'DELL
                    What are you sayin'?
          
                              FATHER HOMEIJER
                    This is an extension of Satan's own
                    hand... I've seen it coming.
          
          Rolling his eyes, O'Dell walks away, leaving the priest to
          grieve for his church in private.
          
          
          EXT. JUNKYARD, STORAGE SHACK - AFTERNOON
          
          Vietnam Tom continues to toil over his SCULPTURE, but
          progress has been made...
          
          It has begun to take on a recognizable form: a GROTESQUE
          COUNTENANCE with TWO LONG EARS, BULGING EYES and a devilish,
          TOOTHY GRIN...
          
          
          EXT. RANDY'S CAR/STREET IN FRONT OF DEPARTMENT STORE -
          AFTERNOON
          
          Sam is walking in front of a DEPARTMENT STORE when Randy's
          car pulls up beside her. Corey sticks her head out the
          passenger side window.
          
                              COREY
                    What happened to you?
          
                                                                   32.
          
          
                              SAM
                    What happened to me...? Where the
                    hell've you been?
          
                              COREY
                    I crashed at Randy's. We just got
                    food. Want a burger?
          
                              SAM
                    My stomach's fucked up.
          
                      JEFF                             MIKE
          Awww...                         Poor tummy...
          
          Jeff and Mike taunt her from the back. Ruth leers.
          
                              SAM (CONT'D)
                    We gotta talk about what we're
                    gonna do.
          
                              COREY
                    Don't worry about it so much.
          
                              SAM
                    The motel guy came to the room this
                    morning all pissed off. We're
                    probably not even gonna have enough
                    money to pay for the car.
          
          Corey sighs, debating weather or not to get out. Before she
          can reach a decision, something in the department store's
          parking lot catches her eye: a LITTLE BOY with dark hair,
          wearing a BIRTHDAY HAT...
          
          But she blinks and he's gone, having disappeared between two
          parked vehicles.
          
          Confused, Corey rubs her eyes and gets out of the car.
          
                              RANDY
                    Should I wait a minute?
          
                              JEFF
                    We gotta get some smokes...
          
                              COREY
                    Just go ahead. I'll catch up with
                    you later on.
          
                              RANDY
                    Alright. Later.
          
          Corey gets out and shuts the door. Randy speeds off toward an
          intersection about 20 yards ahead...
          
                                                                     33.
          
          
          INT. DEPARTMENT STORE - AFTERNOON
          
          Chris is at work, stocking shelves inside the department
          store...
          
          He checks his watch, stops what he's doing and grabs a PACK
          OF CIGARETTES from his breast pocket -- time for a smoke
          break.
          
          
          EXT. INTERSECTION NEAR DEPARTMENT STORE - AFTERNOON
          
          Sam and Corey meander toward the intersection where Randy's
          car is stopped at a red light.
          
                              SAM
                    We just gotta figure out what we're
                    gonna do. I don't think-
          
                              COREY
                        (ABRUPT)
                    Lemme guess, you wanna go home.
          
                              SAM
                    What?
          
                              COREY
                    You wanna run back to mommy and
                    daddy and say sorry so they can put
                    you through college. Well that's
                    real big of you, Sam, but I don't
                    have that option.
          
                              SAM
                        (taken aback)
                    What are you talking about?
          
                              COREY
                    I'll go home and get the shit
                    kicked out of me, and get my ass
                    grabbed by my mom's boyfriend...
          
          They're almost to the light, which is still red, and coming
          up on Randy's car. Jeff, Mike and Ruth stare out at them from
          the backseat, smelling the drama.
          
                              COREY (CONT'D)
                    I knew you'd bail on me eventually,
                    but not this quick.
          
                              SAM
                    I'm not bailing on you. Would you
                    JUST-
          
                                                                     34.
          
          
                               COREY
                     You can fucking sleepwalk back to
                     Middlesex for all I care. I'm not
                     driving you... you're a fucking
                     drag.
          
          The light turns green, and Randy's car peels across the
          intersection, making a left...
          
                               SAM
                     Fuck you, Corey.
          
          Sam wheels on her and steps out into the street, storming
          straight across. Corey starts to follow... but something
          stops her in her tracks: BILLY MOORCROFT.
          
          He stands on the opposite side of the intersection, in the
          trajectory that Sam is walking -- but Sam doesn't see him.
          
          Billy wears a BIRTHDAY HAT, SLACKS and COLLARED SHIRT. He
          looks pale and weak, and is covered with BRUISES. He stares
          right back at Corey, as transfixed as she is... TIME SLOWS
          DOWN. [Note: Sam's position is in the middle of the road.
          Randy's car has made the left but is still in the vicinity of
          the intersection.]
          
          Bewildered, Corey tries to step out into the street but
          something blocks her -- an invisible FORCE FIELD makes
          forward progress impossible.
          
          RIPPLES swell like waves throughout the barrier where she hit
          it. She looks up, following the ripples with her eyes, and
          watches as they disappear beyond her realm of vision, into
          infinite space.
          
          She reaches forth with her hand, wanting to feel the barrier
          once again... Just as she touches it... REAL TIME RESUMES --
          
          KA-BOOM!
          
          FROM OUT OF NOWHERE AN OLD JALOPY SAILS RIGHT IN FRONT
          RANDY'S CAR! He jerks the wheel -- and the JALOPY hits on the
          front passenger side -- completely smashing it in --
          
          Sam spins when she HEARS the deafening CRUNCH...
          
          Randy careens into the opposite lane, and an ONCOMING CAR
          smacks him dead on. The inertia from the oncoming vehicle
          plows his car into a FIRE HYDRANT by the side of the road.
          
          The hydrant goes flying through the air like a bullet --
          
          -- AND STRIKES SAM RIGHT IN THE HEAD!
          
                                                                     35.
          
          
          The world goes SILENT.
          
          CHRIS RUNS TOWARD THE DESTRUCTION, DROPPING HIS CIGARETTE...
          
          WATER ERUPTS LIKE A GEYSER FROM THE PIPE WHERE THE HYDRANT
          USED TO BE...
          
          SAM'S BODY IS CRUMPLED IN THE STREET, MOTIONLESS...
          
          BILLY MOORCROFT IS GONE. THE FORCE FIELD IS GONE. COREY
          STANDS FROZEN, HORRIFIED... IN UTTER SHOCK.
          
          
          INT. POLICE STATION - AFTERNOON
          
          Corey signs her STATEMENT on Officer O'Dell's desk, the
          expression of shock still glued to her face. O'Dell sits
          facing her.
          
                              OFFICER O'DELL
                    You're sure you didn't see a
                    driver?
          
                              COREY
                    No...
          
          He takes the statement from her.
          
                              OFFICER O'DELL
                    Well, you're one lucky girl to have
                    gotten outta the car when you did.
                    Front passenger side was wiped
                    right out. Coulda' been two dead
                    girls today instead of one.
          
          Corey nods, taking this in.
          
                              OFFICER O'DELL (CONT'D)
                    I talked to Randy and sent him home
                    a little while ago. He's pretty
                    shook up.
          
          Corey doesn't respond. O'Dell leans in to speak to her in
          confidence.
          
                              OFFICER O'DELL (CONT'D)
                    Both of us know he'd been doin'
                    some drinkin' today. But we also
                    know he's not at fault here. That
                    old beater cut right in front him.
          
                              COREY
                    Can't you just look up the license
                    plates?
          
                                                                  36.
          
          
                              OFFICER O'DELL
                    No plates on the vehicle. We're
                    investigating the VIN, but that
                    could take a little more time,
                    depending on the history of
                    ownership. We'll find him.
          
          Corey seems somewhat hesitant to bring up the next subject:
          
                              COREY
                    What about the missing boy?
          
          O'Dell shifts in his chair.
          
                              OFFICER O'DELL
                    You really think it was him, huh?
          
                              COREY
                    He was on the side of the road
                    right before the accident.
          
                              OFFICER O'DELL
                    I'm no psychiatrist, but I do know
                    sometimes shock does funny
                    things...
          
                              COREY
                    You think I was hallucinating?
          
                              OFFICER O'DELL
                    We were on the scene five minutes
                    after the accident. I think
                    somebody woulda noticed a little
                    boy wandering around.
          
          He sees how troubled Corey is.
          
                              OFFICER O'DELL (CONT'D)
                    Why don't you stop in and see Dr.
                    Peters on your way out... right
                    down the hall there. She'll give
                    you somethin' to make you feel
                    better.
          
          Corey nods and gets up to leave. As she's on her way out,
          O'Dell's voice stops her.
          
                              OFFICER O'DELL (CONT'D)
                    Oh, uh... is there anything you
                    wanted to say to Samantha's
                    parents?
          
          Corey's expression is blank.
          
                                                                  37.
          
          
                                 COREY
                    Like what?
          
          
          EXT. POLICE STATION, BACK PARKING LOT - AFTERNOON
          
          Corey walks out of the police station and finds herself in a
          secluded back parking lot. She holds a PRESCRIPTION for anti-
          depressants.
          
          She is frightened when she notices a PAIR OF EYES staring at
          her from the bushes close by -- it's Vietnam Tom. He's
          wearing his ski mask and he's got his rifle.
          
          Corey backs away as Tom slowly creeps toward her... She's
          about to scream for help when Chris Holt comes out of the
          police station behind her.
          
                              CHRIS
                    Get the hell outta here.
          
          Grateful for his presence, Corey moves to stand behind Chris.
          Tom shuffles away.
          
                              CHRIS (CONT'D)
                    Should know better than to be
                    carrying his rifle around town like
                    that...
          
          Corey takes a breath, recovering from her scare.
          
                                 CHRIS (CONT'D)
                    You okay?
          
                              COREY
                    What're you doing here?
          
                              CHRIS
                    I had to put in a statement too.
                    Can I give you a lift?
          
          
          I/E. CHRIS' TRUCK/MOTEL - EVENING
          
          Chris and Corey pull up to the motel in his pick-up. They've
          gotten Corey's prescription filled, and she has the BOTTLE OF
          PILLS in her hand.
          
                              CHRIS
                    I'm real sorry about Sam.
          
          Corey nods.
          
                                                                  38.
          
          
                              CHRIS (CONT'D)
                    It's such a waste. Just a horrible,
                    freak thing.
          
                              COREY
                    I said some pretty shitty things to
                    her right before it happened.
          
                              CHRIS
                    I'm sure she knew you didn't mean
                    it.
          
          Corey gets out of the car and walks toward the motel room.
          
          
          INT. MOTEL ROOM 15 - EVENING
          
          Corey swallows two of her PILLS with some liquor from a
          plastic cup. She sits down on one of the full-size beds where
          Sam's belongings are spread out.
          
          She opens Sam's backpack and discovers THE PHILOSOPHY OF TIME
          TRAVEL book, by Roberta Sparrow...
          
          As Corey studies the cover, her image is reflected by the
          CLOSET DOOR MIRRORS. The angle of the mirrors creates double
          image reflections for other objects in the room. Strangely,
          Corey's reflection is only present in one of the panes.
          
          The digital CLOCK/RADIO shows 6:30 PM...
          
          There are PICTURES of Sam's family tucked away inside the
          book, between the pages: Sam with her mother and father, ROSE
          and EDDIE DARKO; YOUNG SAM with ELIZABETH and DONNIE; an old
          photo of the whole Darko family together -- Young Sam holds
          ARIEL, a STUFFED TOY UNICORN.
          
          Corey removes the pictures and sets them on the nightstand...
          She then looks down and notices that the book is open to:
          CHAPTER THREE - THE FRAGMENTARY UNIVERSE.
          
                              COREY
                    Fragmentary Universe...
          
          She pours over the text, some of which reads: When the fabric
          of the fourth dimension within a Tangent Universe becomes
          corrupted, a highly unstable and volatile Fragmentary
          Universe can occur, sustaining itself for no longer than
          several days... FADE TO BLACK.
          
                                                                    39.
          
          
          INT. MOTEL ROOM 15 - LATER - NIGHT
          
          Corey awakens to the sound of a little boy CRYING. She sits
          up in bed. The clock/radio reads 3:30 AM. The CRYING is faint
          but steady and sorrowful, and sounds as though it's coming
          from outside...
          
          
          EXT. MOTEL - NIGHT
          
          Corey follows the distinctive CRYING toward the VENDING
          MACHINES on the side of the building...
          
          ...until Billy Moorcroft emerges from behind them. Corey
          freezes a few feet away from the boy, who wears the BIRTHDAY
          HAT, SLACKS and COLLARED SHIRT. He is pale and bruised.
          
          Corey sees that he is not crying -- it's coming from
          elsewhere in the cosmos, far away. The WAILS taper off to a
          faint, DISTORTED WHISPER as Billy speaks:
          
                              BILLY MOORCROFT
                    You need to save me, Corey.
          
          Corey stares at him in disbelief.
          
                              BILLY MOORCROFT (CONT'D)
                    You need to save me... and save the
                    world.
          
                              COREY
                    Why can't anyone see you?
          
                              BILLY MOORCROFT
                    If you tell them about me they'll
                    think you're a dummy.
          
                               COREY
                    Why me?
          
                              BILLY MOORCROFT
                    I didn't pick you. Just like you
                    didn't pick me either.
          
          Corey stands before him in awe, transfixed.
          
                              BILLY MOORCROFT (CONT'D)
                    We shouldn't even be here. Nobody
                    should...
          
          Corey takes notice of the vending machines behind him. Where
          the prices should be, NUMBERS flash in a rhythm that seems to
          coincide with the ululations of the distant CRYING: 2...
          10... 16... 44... -end-... 2... 10... 16... 44... -end-...
          
                                                                     40.
          
          
                              BILLY MOORCROFT (CONT'D)
                    You don't have much time.
          
          Corey is about to respond when the sound of a DOOR OPENING
          stops her. The FLASHING NUMBERS on the vending machines go
          back to normal PRICES, the CRYING SOUND CEASES, and Billy
          disappears.
          
                              PHIL (O.S.)
                    What's goin' on out here?
          
          Corey looks over and sees Phil dressed in nightclothes,
          having come out of a room near the lobby. She's dumbstruck.
          
                              COREY
                    Nothing... I-I don't know.
          
                              PHIL
                    Go back to your room and get some
                    sleep. You've had a tough day.
          
          Phil goes back inside, leaving her alone.
          
          
          INT. DEPARTMENT STORE - DAY
          
          Corey wanders through the aisles of the department store,
          looking peaked and jittery. She comes upon Chris stocking
          some shelves near the back of the store.
          
                              CHRIS
                    Hey... how ya feelin'?
          
                              COREY
                    Not so good.
          
                              CHRIS
                    Is there anything I can do?
          
                              COREY
                    I need some cigarettes... and maybe
                    some food. But I don't really have
                    any money right now.
          
                               CHRIS
                    I'm off at 3:30. Meet me out behind
                    the store.
          
          
          EXT. BEHIND THE DEPARTMENT STORE - LATER - AFTERNOON
          
          Corey waits on the cement steps by the loading dock. She
          shoots up when Chris comes out the back entrance with a
          PLASTIC BAG...
          
                                                                  41.
          
          
          Corey takes it from him and looks inside: CANDY BARS, a BAG
          OF CHIPS, some PEANUTS, a pack of CIGARETTES.
          
                              COREY
                    Thanks.
          
          She tears open the cigarettes and lights one. Chris lights up
          one of his own, and notices Corey's hands are shaking.
          
                              CHRIS
                    Shouldn't you go back home?
          
                              COREY
                    There's nothing for me to go home
                    to. Trust me.
          
                              CHRIS
                    What about Sam's funeral?
          
          Corey looks conflicted, but she takes a harsh stance:
          
                              COREY
                    What's the point? She's gone,
                    that's it. Nothing's gonna change
                    that...
          
          Chris lets it go.
          
                              COREY (CONT'D)
                    Is there a library around here?
          
                              CHRIS
                        (PUZZLED)
                    Yeah... you need a book?
          
                              COREY
                    Is it walking distance?
          
                              CHRIS
                    I can take you.
          
                              COREY
                    I think I'd rather walk.
          
          
          EXT. STREET - AFTERNOON
          
          Corey and Chris stroll together along a quiet street.
          
                              CHRIS
                    So you guys were real close, huh.
          
                                                                  42.
          
          
                              COREY
                    When I moved to Virginia Sam was
                    like the only person I could even
                    stand to talk to.
          
                              CHRIS
                    How long had you been plannin' your
                    trip together?
          
                              COREY
                    Not too long... kind of a last
                    minute thing. It was good timing,
                    `cause I don't like to stay in one
                    place for too long, ya know?
          
                              CHRIS
                    Huh...
          
                              COREY
                    I was really surprised when Sam
                    wanted to come, actually. I just
                    kinda brought it up one day, and
                    she was down...
          
          Corey reflects for a beat.
          
                              COREY (CONT'D)
                    If it wasn't for me, she'd still be
                    alive right now.
          
                              CHRIS
                    You can't think like that.
          
                              COREY
                    It's true, isn't it?
          
          Chris doesn't respond.
          
          
          INT. LIBRARY, MICROFICHE RESEARCH BOOTH - AFTERNOON
          
          Corey and Chris sit before a screen in a cramped, dim booth
          near the back of the library. They stare at a MICROFILM
          ARTICLE from 1988 about DONNIE DARKO'S DEATH.
          
                              CHRIS
                    That was Sam's brother?
          
                              COREY
                    Yeah.
          
          On the screen is a PHOTOGRAPH of the DARKO HOUSE with many
          PEOPLE gathered in front of it. A JET ENGINE is being lifted
          away by a CRANE.
          
                                                                  43.
          
          
                              CHRIS
                    Her parents must be going through
                    hell.
          
                              COREY
                    Sam said once she wished it landed
                    on her room instead of Donnie's.
          
          Chris thinks on this.
          
                              CHRIS
                    I saw something on Sam's wrist the
                    other night... it looked like a
                    scar.
          
                              COREY
                    She told me it was from some
                    accident. Put her hand through a
                    window or something.
          
                              CHRIS
                    Did you believe her?
          
          Corey doesn't answer. She pulls up ANOTHER ARTICLE, one that
          chronicles a MAN who was IMPALED BY A METAL PIPE with no
          known origin...
          
          A THIRD ARTICLE is about a LITTLE GIRL who was DECAPITATED BY
          A MANHOLE COVER that was inexplicably flying through the
          air...
          
                              CHRIS (CONT'D)
                    God...
          
          Chris is horrified. Corey is totally engrossed.
          
          She brings up a FINAL ARTICLE that tells the story of a BOY
          who was CRUSHED BY A DUMPSTER that fell from the sky. A
          PICTURE shows his legs sticking out from under it like the
          Wicked Witch of the East when Dorothy's house fell on her in
          Munchkinland.
          
                              CHRIS (CONT'D)
                    I don't understand why we're
                    lookin' at this stuff.
          
                              COREY
                    They still never found a driver to
                    that car that hit Randy... I was
                    standing right there. I didn't see
                    anyone.
          
                                                                  44.
          
          
                              CHRIS
                    I was pretty close too, but
                    everything was all crazy. Whoever
                    it was must've jumped out and took
                    off.
          
                              COREY
                    I found this book in Sam's backpack
                    last night. There's a chapter where
                    it talks about stuff like this
                    happening. Like a guy being killed
                    by an arrow that nobody shot, and a
                    swordsmith getting killed by a
                    sword he hadn't made yet.
                    Unexplainable things, but it says
                    there's a reason why they happen.
          
                              CHRIS
                    A book...? I don't get what your
                    talkin' about. What was the reason?
          
                              COREY
                    It didn't say.
          
          Corey thinks, trying to figure out the right way to express
          something...
          
                              COREY (CONT'D)
                    Last night, and right before the
                    accident, I saw...
          
                               CHRIS
                    What?
          
                               COREY
                    Nothing.
          
          Corey sighs and turns back to the screen.
          
                              COREY (CONT'D)
                    You already think I'm a freak show.
          
          
          INT. LIBRARY, FRONT DESK - AFTERNOON
          
          As Chris and Corey are on the way out, they notice Jeremy
          Frame at the counter checking out a STACK OF BOOKS.
          
          In putting them down, he accidentally drops half of them onto
          the floor. He looks frazzled as he begins to pick them up,
          and he scratches compulsively at his LEFT FOREARM...
          
                                                                  45.
          
          
          I/E. DUSTY'S GARAGE/HOUSE - AFTERNOON
          
          Chris and Corey pull up to Dusty's auto repair shop in Chris'
          truck.
          
          They get out and start to walk up to the garage, but they're
          cut off by the unchained PIT BULL -- it's growling and
          barking in a frenzy --
          
                                RUTH (O.S.)
                    Darielle!
          
          The dog heels at the sound of the voice, and Ruth bolts out
          of the house and takes her by the collar. She's got a bandage
          over a cut on her forehead.
          
                              RUTH (CONT'D)
                    Come to check on your car?
          
                                COREY
                    Yeah...
          
          Hearts still thumping in their chests, they follow Ruth into
          the garage... COREY'S CHEVROLET is parked in the same spot it
          was when she left it the other day. The hood is propped open.
          
                              RUTH
                    Randy's been a wreck since the
                    accident.
          
                              CHRIS
                    He should be. He was driving around
                    shit-faced and somebody got killed.
          
                              RUTH
                    You can just fuck off...
          
          She gets right up in his face with such intensity that Chris
          retreats a step or two.
          
                              RUTH (CONT'D)
                    Prima donna motherfucker think your
                    shit don't stink?
          
          Corey steps in:
          
                              COREY
                    She's right...
          
          Chris gives her a look.
          
                              COREY (CONT'D)
                    I mean, there's nothing Randy
                    could've done.
          
                                                                  46.
          
          
          Ruth turns and goes into the house through a GARAGE ENTRANCE.
          
                              RUTH
                    I'll get my dad.
          
          The door slams shut behind her, and Corey and Chris glance at
          each other...
          
          Momentarily, Dusty comes out, a partially eaten SANDWICH in
          hand.
          
                              DUSTY
                    Got some bad news for you...
          
          He walks them over to the car, finishing off his sandwich and
          wiping his hands on his greasy jeans.
          
                              DUSTY (CONT'D)
                    Your engine seized up when your
                    water pump blew.
          
                              COREY
                    I need a new engine now?
          
                              DUSTY
                    I can get one in there for you.
                    Cost you about fifteen hundred.
          
          Corey's face drops.
          
                              COREY
                    I don't have anywhere near that
                    much money.
          
                              CHRIS
                    That's probably as much as the
                    car's worth.
          
                              DUSTY
                    I understand. But, I already
                    ordered the water pump, and I'll
                    have to get paid for my time. That
                    comes to about three-hundred total.
          
                              COREY
                    I don't have that much either.
          
          Dusty is perturbed.
          
                              DUSTY
                    You think I do this for charity?
          
                                                                   47.
          
          
                              CHRIS
                    You didn't do anything. What's she
                    want a water pump for if she
                    doesn't have an engine?
          
                              DUSTY
                    I see how it is... couple a' punks.
                    You don't plan to pay what you owe,
                    you can get the hell off my
                    property right now.
          
          Corey glares at him, furious, but Chris takes her by the arm.
          
                              COREY
                        (under her breath)
                    Asshole.
          
                              CHRIS
                    Let's go...
          
          
          I/E. CHRIS' TRUCK/MOTEL - AFTERNOON
          
          Chris' truck pulls up in front of the motel and parks. At the
          same time, Father Homeijer and Trudy come out of the FRONT
          OFFICE carrying a COLLECTIONS JAR.
          
          As they approach the truck Chris slowly rolls down the
          window.
          
                              FATHER HOMEIJER
                    Good afternoon.
          
                              TRUDY
                    We're taking collections to help
                    rebuild Mount Calvary after the
                    tragic fire.
          
                              FATHER HOMEIJER
                    Any small amount you could manage
                    would really help.
          
                              CHRIS
                    Sorry.
          
          Father Homeijer and Trudy look over to Corey in the passenger
          seat but she just stares back at them.
          
                              FATHER HOMEIJER
                    God bless you.
          
          They turn and walk away, and Chris rolls his window back up.
          
                                                                    48.
          
          
                              CHRIS
                    Everybody wants somethin'...
          
                              COREY
                    What about you?
          
                              CHRIS
                    What do you mean?
          
                              COREY
                    You wouldn't give me stuff and
                    drive me around if you didn't want
                    something in return.
          
                               CHRIS
                    Why not?
          
                              COREY
                    `Cause that's just not how it
                    works.
          
                              CHRIS
                    Maybe you're wrong about that.
          
          Corey nods, but still doesn't believe him.
          
                               COREY
                    See ya.
          
          She gets out, and Chris eyes her as she walks to her room.
          
          
          INT. MOTEL ROOM 15 - NIGHT
          
          Corey lays on her stomach in bed, her head buried in The
          Philosophy of Time Travel book. The TELEVISION is on in the
          b.g. (out of focus), playing a repeat of the FOREMAN GRILL
          INFOMERCIAL...
          
          Suddenly, there is a slight TREMOR from outside and RIPPLE
          runs over the TV screen.
          
          Corey looks around, taking no notice of the odd change on the
          television -- instead of GEORGE FOREMAN'S VOICE, HULK HOGAN
          is HEARD promoting the brand new HULKSTER GRILL...
          
          Just then, there is a KNOCK at the door. She gets up to
          answer it and finds Randy -- he looks distraught.
          
                              RANDY
                    Do you hate me?
          
                               COREY
                    Huh?
          
                                                                     49.
          
          
                              RANDY
                    You think it's my fault she's dead.
          
                              COREY
                    No...
          
                              RANDY
                    You mean it?
          
                              COREY
                    Yeah... it wasn't your fault.
          
          Randy sighs as if a big weight has been lifted.
          
                              RANDY
                    What's that?
          
          Corey looks down and realizes that she's still holding The
          Philosophy of Time Travel book in her hand.
          
                              COREY
                    Oh, it's just... something of
                    Sam's.
          
          Randy nods. Corey tosses the book onto the bed.
          
                              RANDY
                    You wanna get outta here for a
                    while? I got my dad's car.
          
          
          I/E. RANDY'S DAD'S CAR/LOOKOUT - NIGHT
          
          RANDY'S DAD'S CAR navigates a DIRT ROAD up a WOODED HILL to a
          VANTAGE POINT where the whole of El Reno can be seen. SPARSE
          LIGHTS flicker over about 80 square miles of civilization.
          
          There are a few OTHER VEHICLES parked at the lookout, most
          containing COUPLES with MUSIC playing low.
          
          Randy pulls into a more SECLUDED CLEARING, away from the
          other cars but still with a nice view.
          
                              RANDY
                    I've been comin' up here since I
                    was a kid. Good place when you
                    wanna just get away from
                    everything.
          
          Randy pushes in a TAPE (suggestion: River of Deceit, by Mad
          Season), then takes a JOINT from his pocket and sparks it up.
          
                              COREY
                    Is Ruth your girlfriend?
          
                                                             50.
          
          
          Randy passes the joint to Corey and she hits it.
          
                              RANDY
                    Naw, we're just friends. She's
                    pretty weird sometimes. Too like...
                    intense, or something.
          
                              COREY
                    Seems like you guys are pretty
                    close.
          
                              RANDY
                    Yeah... don't worry about Ruth.
          
          Randy takes another hit and holds it in.
          
                              COREY
                    Do you ever have a hard time
                    telling what's real and what's not
                    real?
          
          Randy exhales and looks over at her, perplexed.
          
                              RANDY
                    Sometimes... sometimes something
                    can feel really real, but it's just
                    your mind playing tricks on you.
          
                              COREY
                    I've got so much shit in my head
                    right now... I've never felt so
                    outta control. I think I'm really
                    goin' psycho.
          
          He passes her the joint.
          
                              RANDY
                    I got some acid from my buddy one
                    time... this like flying eagle
                    pyramid shit. I took two hits, and
                    man... next thing I knew I was on
                    the floor, curled up in ball, and
                    Mike and Jeff were just standing
                    there lookin' down at me. I could
                    see this like glowing grid cutting
                    through my brain, and I knew when
                    it got all the way through I'd be
                    this sketched out vegetable. I
                    could picture my dad staring down
                    at me in the hospital in my
                    straightjacket, crying and shit...
          
          Corey blows out a hit, captivated...
          
                                                                   51.
          
          
                              RANDY (CONT'D)
                    The whole time my esophagus was
                    like twisting and turning in my
                    throat and cutting off my air
                    supply... it was terrible.
          
                              COREY
                    Jesus.
          
                              RANDY
                    I can still slip back into it
                    sometimes, but I know now that my
                    brain is what's making it real...
                    and that's like a blessing and a
                    curse, man, `cause that means you
                    have to decide what's real and
                    what's not.
          
                              COREY
                    The things that feel the most real
                    right now are... impossible. More
                    like a dream.
          
          Corey passes him the joint and he stamps out the roach in the
          car's ashtray.
          
                              RANDY
                    I know what you mean. The scariest
                    part is thinking you're not the
                    same person anymore. Something's
                    changed... like your identity.
          
                              COREY
                    What if the change is for the
                    better?
          
          Randy finds an INHALER in his pocket and takes a puff.
          
                              RANDY
                    That's fucked up.
          
                              COREY
                    I don't think I even care if I'm
                    crazy.
          
          Corey turns and looks into his eyes. Randy leans forward...
          They're about to kiss, when --
          
                              COREY (CONT'D)
                    What the fuck?
          
          A DARK SHAPE scurries to an enclosed area at the edge of the
          forest where there's a TARP, some WATER BOTTLES, CANS OF FOOD
          and a RIFLE...
          
                                                                    52.
          
          
          It's Vietnam Tom, and he's brought some supplies to his NEW
          SQUATTING GROUND.
          
                              COREY (CONT'D)
                    That fucking guy again...
          
          Randy and Corey both laugh, relieving the tension. But Tom's
          proximity has spoiled the mood.
          
                              RANDY
                    Let's get outta here.
          
          
          INT. RANDY'S HOUSE, LIVING ROOM - NIGHT
          
          Mike, Jeff and Ruth sit on a ratty couch in Randy's living
          room, watching BEAVIS AND BUTT-HEAD on MTV. Some EMPTY BEER
          CANS and a HOMEADE BONG litter a coffee table. When the FRONT
          DOOR OPENS and Corey and Randy enter, none of them budge.
          
          As Corey and Randy walk to Randy's bedroom, Ruth follows them
          with her eyes...
          
          
          INT. RANDY'S HOUSE, BEDROOM - CONTINUOUS
          
          Randy shuts the door to his messy room. A TAPESTRY hangs from
          the ceiling. Corey is drawn to a DESK next to the bed. Above
          it is a DEATH SHRINE to KURT COBAIN -- MAGAZINE CUTOUTS,
          POSTERS and TICKET STUBS arranged decoratively.
          
          A large BLACK & WHITE POSTER showing a CLOSE   UP of COBAIN'S
          FACE is the centerpiece, and a sloppy BULLET   HOLE drawn in
          RED MARKER marks the center of his forehead.   The words `I'M
          NOT AFRAID OF DYING' are scrawled across the   bottom of the
          poster in the same BRIGHT RED.
          
                              COREY
                    This is cool.
          
                              RANDY
                    Thanks.
          
          Randy puts his hands on her hips, running them up her torso.
          Corey turns to face him...
          
          They kiss...
          
          ...and fall back onto the bed...
          
                                                                     53.
          
          
          INT. RANDY'S HOUSE, BEDROOM - LATER - NIGHT
          
          A DIGITAL CLOCK on Randy's DESK shows 3:30 AM. There's a
          SLIGHT TREMOR and the numbers shift, changing briefly to
          01:10:23:08, then back again to 3:30.
          
          Corey wakes suddenly from a nightmare. She sits up and looks
          around, remembering where she is. She discovers Randy asleep
          by her side. She finds a pile of clothes on the floor beside
          the bed and grabs her shirt...
          
          ...after she pulls it on over her head, she freezes --
          because Billy Moorcroft is standing right there in his
          BIRTHDAY HAT, staring at her.
          
                              BILLY MOORCROFT
                    Only one day left.
          
          Corey turns and looks down to Randy. He's still fast asleep.
          
                              COREY
                    What am I supposed to do?
          
          As soon as she utters her question she notices a silvery,
          liquid VECTOR SPEAR protruding from the center of her chest.
          
          Billy is now gone, but her SPEAR beckons her out of the room,
          elongating to illustrate her path. Corey is in awe...
          
          
          INT. RANDY'S HOUSE, LIVING ROOM - NIGHT
          
          Her SPEAR leads her through the living room, and past the
          sleeping bodies of Mike, Jeff and Ruth. Following her path
          leads her to step on RUTH'S FOOT as she goes by...
          
          Corey doesn't even notice, but one of Ruth's eyes pop open as
          she treads out the door...
          
          
          EXT. STREET - NIGHT
          
          Corey follows Billy, who walks in the middle of the road
          about 15 yards ahead of her. The residential street is
          guarded by great, OLD TREES on either side.
          
          The dark sky above starts to BEND and WARP, and a BUCKLE in
          space-time materializes.
          
          There's a simultaneous flash of LIGHTING and sharp CRACK OF
          THUNDER, and Corey looks up to the VORTEX -- a massive,
          swirling MAELSTROM gapes open like a tunnel to the inter-
          dimensional realm of darkest night.
          
                                                                     54.
          
          
          The VOID brightens, and ominous STORM CLOUDS and TORRENTIAL
          RAINS are visible within...
          
          Corey peers up into the MOUTH of it and sees DUSTY'S HOUSE
          AND AUTO REPAIR SHOP being doused and beaten by the STORM --
          
          
          INT. DUSTY'S GARAGE - NIGHT
          
          In contrast to the street, all is nearly SILENT in Dusty's
          garage. Corey watches as Billy moves along the perimeter
          WITHOUT SOUND, ghostly... JUMP CUTS and TIME CUTS.
          
          Her CHEVROLET sits in the bay. Some of the PARTS have already
          been harvested -- the CATALYTIC CONVERTER sits next to it on
          the floor.
          
          Corey approaches a UTILITY SINK next to a SHOWER in the

                              BILLY MOORCROFT
                    You can do it.
          
                                 COREY
                    How?
          
                                 BILLY MOORCROFT
                    It's easy.
          
          Corey focuses on the sink, and it begins to tremble. The
          pipes beneath it CREAK and MOAN. WATER starts to bubble up
          from the sink drain, also in the shower...
          
          Billy stands atop her car, watching her. His perpetually
          morose expression transforms into a smile.
          
          The SINK BASIN suddenly cracks from pressure. As Corey stares
          into the drain... WE PLUNGE DOWN INTO THE PIPE --
          
          
          POV OF TELEKINETIC ENERGY - INSIDE THE PIPE
          
          We travel through meters and meters of DANK PIPING until we
          hit the WATER MAIN. There's a sound like a TIDAL WAVE
          CRASHING --
          
          
          EXT. STREET/DUSTY'S GARAGE/HOUSE - LATER - DAWN
          
          -- WATER POURS out from under the garage door down to the
          street. PULL BACK TO REVEAL --
          
                                                                   55.
          
          
          The entire driveway and the street in front of the house are
          covered with water. FIRE TRUCKS, POLICE CARS and an AMBULANCE
          are gathered in front of the property.
          
          
          ANGLE: DOWN THE STREET
          
          Ruth runs toward her house. When she turns a corner and it
          comes into view, she stops dead in her tracks. Her face shows
          sheer terror --
          
          Because her father Dusty is handcuffed and being loaded into
          the back of a cruiser by Officer O'Dell and another
          policeman, OFFICER HINES...
          
          ...the PIT BULL struggles against it's CHAIN, growling and
          barking frantically.
          
          ...and Billy Moorcroft, half-naked, soaking wet and
          shivering, is wrapped in a blanket and being tended to by
          PARAMEDICS.
          
                              FIREMAN #2
                    Lucky I heard him screamin', else
                    he woulda drowned down there.
          
          Ruth keeps to the shadows and slinks toward a BACK DOOR...
          
          
          INT. DUSTY'S HOUSE, FOOT OF THE STAIRS - DAWN
          
          She sloshes through four inches of water and skips up the
          stairs...
          
          
          INT. DUSTY'S HOUSE, RUTH'S BEDROOM - DAWN
          
          Without turning on the lights, Ruth desperately rifles
          through her closet until she finds a SHOEBOX.
          
          Inside it are several PLASTIC BAGS -- some filled with
          MARIJUANA, others with COCAINE...
          
          
          INT. DUSTY'S HOUSE, UPSTAIRS BATHROOM - DAWN
          
          Hands shaking, Ruth dumps a bag of coke into the toilet and
          flushes it. The WHITE POWDER disappears down the swirling
          SPIRAL OF CLOUDY LIQUID...
          
          But the bowl doesn't refill.
          
                              RUTH
                    Shit!
          
                                                                    56.
          
          
          She begins to stuff the other bags down her pants...
          
          
          EXT. DUSTY'S GARAGE/HOUSE - DAWN
          
          Having deposited Dusty in the back of the cruiser and shut
          the door, O'Dell's attention turns to an upstairs window of
          the house when he sees MOVEMENT.
          
          
          INT. RANDY'S HOUSE, BEDROOM - MORNING
          
          Randy rolls over in bed, opening his eyes to the new day. He
          looks around for Corey, disappointed to find her gone.
          
          
          INT. DEPARTMENT STORE - DAY
          
          Corey walks down an aisle of the department store. She finds
          Chris assisting a CUSTOMER.
          
                              CUSTOMER
                    I just checked aisle three.
          
                              CHRIS
                    They're there. At the front, by the
                    Trapper Keepers.
          
          The Customer moves off and Chris turns to find Corey standing
          beside him.
          
                              COREY
                    I'm outta cigarettes.
          
          
          EXT. BEHIND THE DEPARTMENT STORE - DAY
          
          Corey waits behind the store until Chris comes out. She
          eagerly accepts TWO PACKS.
          
                              CHRIS
                    D'ya hear the news?
          
                              COREY
                    What?
          
                              CHRIS
                    They found that Billy Moorcroft
                    kid. He was at Dusty's house...
          
          Corey is floored.
          
                                                                   57.
          
          
                              CHRIS (CONT'D)
                    Sick bastard had him locked up in
                    the basement. I can't believe we
                    were just over there yesterday.
          
          Corey can't help it... A grin spreads across her face.
          
                              CHRIS (CONT'D)
                    I guess he's gonna be okay-
          
                              COREY
                    Everything's gonna be okay.
          
          Corey cuts him off, and Chris looks at her strangely.
          
                              COREY (CONT'D)
                    I'm not crazy. I think everything's
                    gonna be okay.
          
          
          INT. MOTEL ROOM 15 - NIGHT
          
          Corey lays on her stomach in bed, studying The Philosophy of
          Time Travel. The book is open to: CHAPTER SIX - THE LIVING
          RECEIVER... The Living Receiver is chosen to guide the
          Artifact into position for its journey back to the Primary
          Universe. No one knows how or why a Receiver will be
          chosen...
          
          She flips through the onion skin pages to: CHAPTER TEN - THE
          MANIPULATED DEAD... The Manipulated Dead are more powerful
          than the Living Receiver. If a person dies within the Tangent
          Dimension, they are able to contact the Living Receiver
          through the Fourth Dimensional Construct...
          
          Corey glances over at the CLOSET MIRROR and sees Billy's
          image reflected. She flips over and finds him standing at the
          foot of the bed, clad in the same garb as all her visions.
          
                              COREY
                    I already saved you.
          
                              BILLY MOORCROFT
                    It's not over.
          
          He points to the CLOSET MIRROR... She stares into her own
          reflection as BILLY'S DISAPPEARS.
          
          HER IMAGE starts to FADE as well, and then the SURFACE OF THE
          MIRROR TRANSFORMS into a three-dimensional vision of a PARK.
          The focus is a SWING SET... and one of the SWINGS in
          particular, which rocks slowly back and forth. Empty. Void of
          life.
          
                                                                     58.
          
          
                                 COREY
                           (CONFUSED)
                    Why?
          
          
          INT. BILLY MOORCROFT'S HOUSE, DINING ROOM/DEN - DAY
          
          Inside Billy Moorcroft's quaint, sanitary-looking home is a
          small gathering to celebrate his return. STREAMERS hang over
          a table supporting a partially eaten CAKE. A BANNER that
          reads `WELCOME HOME BILLY!' is draped across the archway
          connecting the DINING ROOM to the DEN.
          
          BILLY'S MOTHER (32), with her fair complexion and dark hair,
          is an older female version of Billy himself.
          
          As she brings a POT OF COFFEE and a STACK OF CUPS into
          BILLY'S FATHER (35), BILLY'S AUNT and UNCLE, and a CHILD
          PSYCHOLOGIST who is moderating (50s; male) in the den, she
          looks as though she's barely keeping it together.
          
                              CHILD PSYCHOLOGIST
                        (between bites of cake)
                    The place for Billy to be right now
                    is at home with his family...
          
          Billy's Mother interrupts as she sets the coffee down.
          
                                 BILLY'S MOTHER
                    Excuse me.
          
                              CHILD PSYCHOLOGIST
                    Oh, thank you.
          
          The Psychologist accepts a cup.
          
                              CHILD PSYCHOLOGIST (CONT'D)
                    It'll take years for him to work
                    through what happened, but the best
                    way to open those doors is to
                    surround him with things that are
                    familiar...
          
          Billy's Mother passes her husband a cup, and they hold a
          long, painful moment of eye contact.
          
          
          INT. BILLY MOORCROFT'S HOUSE, BREAKFAST NOOK - MOMENTS LATER -
          DAY
          
          Billy sits at a table in the sunny, HEXAGONAL ROOM. He wears
          the BIRTHDAY HAT, SLACKS and COLLARED SHIRT.
          
                                                                     59.
          
          
          He appears clean and groomed, but his face and neck are
          marred by BRUISES and other ABRASIONS. Before him is a packet
          of COLORED PENCILS and some sheets of PAPER.
          
          His Mother walks up behind him, and peeks over his shoulder
          at the DRAWING that he's working on.
          
                               BILLY'S MOTHER
                    Are you sure you don't want some
                    more cake?
          
          Billy nods. His mother caresses his head as she watches him
          color. After a moment she sits down in a chair beside him and
          tries to get his attention.
          
                              BILLY'S MOTHER (CONT'D)
                    Billy... I-
          
          Before she can go on, she's interrupted by the DOORBELL.
          Billy never looks up.
          
          
          I/E. BILLY MOORCROFT'S HOUSE, FRONT DOOR - DAY
          
          Billy's Father answers the door and finds Corey.
          
                              BILLY'S FATHER
                    Only family and close friends are
                    welcome here today.
          
          Billy's Mother hovers behind her husband, curious about and
          wary of the stranger.
          
                              COREY
                    I understand... I just wanted to
                    say that I'm sorry about everything
                    that happened to Billy. And I know
                    it doesn't seem like it, but
                    everything happens for a reason...
                    and it'll all work out in the end.
          
          Billy's Father stares her down until she turns to leave
          uncomfortably. Billy's Mother starts to cry... CUT BACK TO:
          
          
          INT. BILLY MOORCROFT'S HOUSE, BREAKFAST NOOK - DAY
          
          ...the breakfast nook. Billy is gone.
          
          Left on the table is his completed DRAWING. It's a neatly
          executed rendition of a SWING SET -- identical to the one
          from Corey's vision in the closet door mirror.
          
                                                                     60.
          
          
          EXT. PARK - DAY
          
          Billy walks through the empty park, still wearing his
          birthday hat. He makes his way past a SAND PIT with a JUNGLE
          GYM.
          
          Balanced on one of the jungle gym's bars is a PRESCRIPTION
          BOTTLE...
          
          Billy picks it up. The name on the prescription is COREY
          RICHARDSON. JUMP CUT TO:
          
          The SWING SET. Billy leans back as far as he can as momentum
          propels his body forward and back through space. He looks up
          to the sky where SUPERNATURAL BLACK CLOUDS are forming...
          
          He swings back and forth... back and forth...
          
          
          ANGLE: PARK BENCH
          
          Corey sits nearby on a park bench, watching Billy. He looks
          back at her, showing no signs of recognition... JUMP CUT TO:
          
          The SWING. No longer a little boy sitting in it. It dangles
          erratically from the ropes, still gripped by inertia...
          
          PAN DOWN to the sandy ground below -- FIND the bottle of
          pills, now empty. Billy's unmoving, OPEN HAND...
          
          
          EXT. OKLAHOMA HIGHWAY 40/EL RENO EXIT - AFTERNOON
          
          A TRACTOR-TRAILER TRUCK gets off the highway and heads into
          El Reno. It's load is a batch of beat up, OLD CARS.
          
          The JALOPY is on the TOP RACK, CLOSEST TO THE END...
          
          
          EXT. MOTEL ROOM 15 - AFTERNOON
          
          Randy peeks in the window of Corey's motel room but sees
          nothing. He pounds on the door and calls for her:
          
                               RANDY
                    Corey...
          
          
          EXT. INTERSECTION NEAR DEPARTMENT STORE - AFTERNOON
          
          Corey arrives near the intersection where the accident took
          place. The BLACK CLOUDS overhead have become more vast and
          oppressive. A cold WIND blows...
          
                                                                     61.
          
          
          The TRACTOR-TRAILER TRUCK breaches the crest of a hill and
          comes into view, descending on the intersection.
          
          Above it the CLOUDS begin to transform and take the shape of
          an ASTRONOMICAL WORMHOLE that reaches down toward the
          earth...

          EXT. RANDY'S CAR/STREET IN FRONT OF DEPARTMENT STORE -
          AFTERNOON
          
          Sam is walking in front of the department store when Randy's
          car pulls up beside her. Corey sticks her head out the
          passenger side window.
          
                              COREY
                    What happened to you?
          
                              SAM
                    What happened to me...? Where the
                    hell've you been?
          
                              COREY
                    I crashed at Randy's. We just got
                    food. Want a burger?
          
                              SAM
                    My stomach's fucked up.
          
                      JEFF                               MIKE
          Awww...                           Poor tummy...
          
          Jeff and Mike taunt her from the back. Ruth leers.
          
                              SAM (CONT'D)
                    We gotta talk about what we're
                    gonna do.
          
                              COREY
                    Don't worry about it so much.
          
                              SAM
                    The motel guy came to the room this
                    MORNING-
          
                              COREY
                        (INTERRUPTING)
                    I don't give a fuck.
          
                                 SAM
                    Excuse me?
          
                                                                     63.
          
          
                              COREY
                    I said, I. Don't. Give. A. Fuck...
          
          She annunciates every word like a true bitch.
          
                              COREY (CONT'D)
                    I'm tired of listening to you whine
                    about everything.
          
          Giggles from the peanut gallery in the car.
          
                              SAM
                    Corey, you're still drunk. Don't be
                    a fuck-ass.
          
                              JEFF
                    Did she just call her a fuck-ass?
          
                              MIKE
                    What's a fuck-ass?
          
          Everyone cracks up, including Corey. Sam is humiliated. She
          backs away from the car, anger burning in her eyes. Randy
          revs the engine, expressing his will to take off.
          
                              COREY
                    See ya later, Sam.
          
          Sam says nothing, but watches as Randy's car peels off toward
          the intersection. She's confused and hurt, frozen to the spot
          where she's standing.
          
          As Corey stares back at Sam from the car, her smile fades...
          
          
          INT. RANDY'S CAR - CONTINUOUS
          
          Corey turns to face the approaching intersection. Resolute.
          
          
          INT. DEPARTMENT STORE - AFTERNOON
          
          Chris is at work, stocking shelves inside the department
          store...
          
          He checks his watch, stops what he's doing and grabs a PACK
          OF CIGARETTES from his breast pocket -- time for a smoke
          break.
          
                                                                  64.
          
          
          EXT. INTERSECTION NEAR DEPARTMENT STORE - AFTERNOON
          
          Randy's car is stopped at the red light. Sam strolls toward
          it ever so slowly. Jeff, Mike and Ruth gawk at her from the
          backseat.
          
          She slows down even more, having no interest in subjecting
          herself to any more of their mockery...
          
          The light turns green, and Randy's car peels across the
          intersection, making a left. Sam's still 10 or 15 feet away
          from stepping into the street...
          
          She quickens her pace, almost there when --
          
          KA-BOOM!
          
          FROM OUT OF NOWHERE AN OLD JALOPY SAILS RIGHT IN FRONT
          RANDY'S CAR! He jerks the wheel -- and the jalopy hits on the
          front passenger side -- completely smashing it in --
          
          Sam spins when she HEARS the deafening CRUNCH...
          
          Randy careens into the opposite lane, and an ONCOMING CAR
          smacks him dead on. The inertia from the oncoming vehicle
          plows his car into a FIRE HYDRANT by the side of the road.
          
          The hydrant goes flying through the air like a bullet and
          skitters harmlessly across the intersection --
          
          The world goes SILENT.
          
          CHRIS RUNS TOWARD THE DESTRUCTION, DROPPING HIS CIGARETTE...
          
          WATER ERUPTS LIKE A GEYSER FROM THE PIPE WHERE THE HYDRANT
          USED TO BE...
          
          THE JALOPY IS FLIPPED OVER ONTO ITS SIDE...
          
          SAM STANDS PEERING AT THE WRECKAGE... THE AREA OF THE CAR
          WHERE COREY WAS SITTING IS VIRTUALLY NONEXISTENT. SHE DROPS
          TO HER KNEES.
          
          
          INT. POLICE STATION - AFTERNOON
          
          Sam signs her STATEMENT on Officer O'Dell's desk, her eyes
          red and puffy from crying. O'Dell sits facing her.
          
                               OFFICER O'DELL
                     I just gotta ask you one more
                     time... you're sure you didn't see
                     a driver?
          
                                                                    65.
          
          
          Sam shakes her head no, and he takes the statement from her.
          
                              OFFICER O'DELL (CONT'D)
                    Well, we'll find him, one way or
                    another.
          
          Sam nods in acknowledgement. O'Dell sees how much this has
          traumatized her.
          
                              OFFICER O'DELL (CONT'D)
                    Why don't you stop in and see Dr.
                    Peters on your way out... right
                    down the hall there. She'll give
                    you somethin' to make you feel
                    better.
          
          
          EXT. POLICE STATION, BACK PARKING LOT - AFTERNOON
          
          Sam walks out of the police station and finds herself in the
          secluded back parking lot. She holds a PRESCRIPTION for anti-
          depressants...
          
          A pair of eyes peek out of the bushes close by -- it's
          Vietnam Tom. He's wearing his ski mask and he's got his
          rifle. He sees Sam, but she doesn't see him.
          
          Sam wells up with emotion, about to breakdown, and Tom
          watches her with empathy. It looks as though he's about to go
          to her when something stops him -- Chris comes out the door.
          
                                CHRIS
                    You okay?
          
          Sam is still too choked up to speak. Tom sneaks away
          unnoticed...
          
          
          INT. CHRIS' TRUCK - AFTERNOON
          
          Sam sits in the passenger side of Chris' truck and cries and
          cries. Major emotional release.
          
          Chris looks like he wants to say something, but doesn't have
          the words.
          
          
          I/E. CHRIS' TRUCK/MOTEL - EVENING
          
          Chris and Sam pull up to the motel in his pick-up. They've
          gone to get her prescription filled, and Sam has the BOTTLE
          OF PILLS in her hand.
          
                                                                  66.
          
          
                              CHRIS
                    I'm really sorry, Sam.
          
          She doesn't respond.
          
                              CHRIS (CONT'D)
                    It's horrible... but sometimes
                    these things can happen for a
                    reason. Sometimes good can come of
                    it... growth, ya know?
          
                              SAM
                    What the fuck are you talking
                    about?
          
          Sam's benumbed expression doesn't change, but her tone is
          caustic.
          
                              CHRIS
                    All I meant was, sometimes-
          
                              SAM
                    I know what you meant, and it's
                    bullshit. When someone dies for no
                    reason you can't just make one up
                    to fill the void and make yourself
                    feel better. It sucks, and it fucks
                    everything up, but it doesn't mean
                    shit beyond that.
          
                              CHRIS
                    I'm sorry, I-
          
                              SAM
                    You've obviously never lost anybody
                    like I have, `cause if you did
                    you'd already know that.
          
          Chris doesn't try anymore. Sam immediately feels bad.
          
                              SAM (CONT'D)
                    Thanks for the ride.
          
          She gets out of the car and slogs toward her room.
          
          
          INT. MOTEL ROOM 15 - EVENING
          
          Sam swallows her PILLS with some water, and sits down on one
          of the full-size beds by her BACKPACK...
          
          She reaches inside and pulls out THE PHILOSOPHY OF TIME
          TRAVEL book, by Roberta Sparrow. As she studies the cover,
          her image is reflected by the CLOSET DOOR MIRRORS.
          
                                                                  67.
          
          
          The angle of the mirrors creates double image reflections for
          other objects in the room... and Sam's reflection is present
          in both of the panes.
          
          The digital CLOCK/RADIO shows 6:30 PM...
          
          She looks at the PICTURES OF HER FAMILY tucked away inside
          the book: Sam with her mother and father; Sam as a child with
          her sister and brother; an old photo of the whole Darko
          family together...
          
          Tears come to her eyes as she focuses on an image of Donnie,
          and she puts them all down. She touches the SCAR on the inner
          part of her right wrist...
          
          She then glances down and notices that the book is open to:
          CHAPTER NINE - REMNANTS.
          
                              SAM
                    Remnants...
          
          A portion of the text includes: Like Dreams that the
          Manipulated can have after journeys into Tangent or
          Fragmentary Universes, sounds and images may be transferred
          from one Tangent or Fragmentary Universe to another, as all
          corruptions exist on relative cosmic planes...
          
          
          EXT. JUNKYARD - NIGHT
          
          Sam wanders through the junkyard clad in her HOODED
          SWEATSHIRT and JEANS, with the MAKESHIFT BANDAGE wrapped
          around her right hand. The SHARD OF METAL protrudes from the
          GASH by her temple.
          
          
          SAM'S LUMINOUS POV - THE JUNKYARD
          
          She sees the junkyard as the phosphorescent DESTINY PLANE.
          DEAD CARS, MACHINERY and piles of SCRAP METAL glow as
          stationary objects within the complex grid. A PAIR OF RATS
          follow their VECTOR SPEARS as they shimmy up the side of a
          RUSTY TRACTOR...
          
          Sam treads effortlessly through the darkness, past the heaps
          of junk toward the decrepit STORAGE SHACK marked by the
          CORRUGATED ROOFING...
          
          
          ANGLE: STORAGE SHACK
          
          She stands before the shack, having discovered Vietnam Tom.
          He squats in the darkened corner of the scrappy shelter, and
          looks back at her through the eyeholes of a new mask --
          
                                                                    68.
          
          
          He wears on his face the SCULPTURE made of SCRAP METAL, which
          has been formed into the COUNTENANCE OF THE MONSTER BUNNY.
          
                              SAM
                    Hi, Tom. I like your new mask.
          
          Tom trembles like the frightened animal he personifies as Sam
          runs her fingers down one of the LONG, METALLIC EARS, down to
          one of the SHARPENED INCISORS of the EVIL-LOOKING GRIN...
          
                              SAM (CONT'D)
                    Are you scared?
          
          As this contact is made the tarnished metal becomes
          transparent, and the NEURONS in TOM'S BRAIN can be seen
          sending ELECTRIC IMPULSES, in turn RELEASING
          NEUROTRANSMITTERS and exciting OTHER NEURONS...
          
                              SAM (CONT'D)
                    I know you can hear me...
          
          A PORTAL forms around the shelter like a giant cylinder,
          enclosing them. Tom rises, afraid... Sam takes his hand...
          
          The PORTAL shrinks and squeezes the walls until they bend
          inward, then begin to CREAK and RUMBLE --
          
          
          EXT. BENEATH OVERPASS - THE NEXT MORNING
          
          Sam awakens to a fierce RUMBLING overhead.
          
          It happens again, and when she looks around she realizes that
          she's underneath a highway overpass in BOXER SHORTS and a T-
          SHIRT, barefoot, lying on a FLAT AREA atop the CEMENT SLOPE
          that leads down to the road below.
          
          Alarmed by both the height and sanitation of her current
          position, she shifts her body and starts to slide down the
          SLOPE...
          
          Once on even ground, she notices a brand new `95 BMW coming
          toward her.
          
                                 SAM
                    Perfect...
          
          Jeremy pulls up next to her and rolls down his window.
          
                              JEREMY
                    Sam? Are you okay? What are doing?
          
                              SAM
                    I'm... yeah, I'm okay.
          
                                                                    69.
          
          
          Jeremy gets out of the car and puts his hand on her shoulder.
          
                              JEREMY
                    You shouldn't be out here like
                    this. C'mon, get in.
          
          She allows herself to be led to the passenger side...
          
          
          INT. JEREMY'S BMW - MORNING
          
          Sam leans her head back against the headrest as Jeremy
          drives.
          
                              JEREMY
                    You do that a lot?
          
                              SAM
                    I think it's genetic or something.
          
                              JEREMY
                    That's interesting... I've never
                    heard of a specific genetic marker
                    for sleepwalking.
          
                               SAM
                    It's just that my brother used to
                    do it too.
          
                              JEREMY
                    He doesn't anymore?
          
                              SAM
                    No.
          
                              JEREMY
                    I think it's more common in
                    children. When did your brother
                    stop?
          
                              SAM
                    When he died.
          
          
          EXT. FIELD BEHIND MOTEL - MORNING
          
          Some WORKERS are in the process of   rebuilding the WINDMILL. A
          MAN WITH A HOSE sprays the side of   the WATER TANK in an
          attempt to wash off the burn marks   resembling the nearly
          imperceptible image of the MONSTER   BUNNY'S FACE...
          
                                                                   70.
          
          
          I/E. JEREMY'S BMW/MOTEL - MORNING
          
          Jeremy pulls into the motel parking lot. Sam hesitates for a
          moment before getting out.
          
                              JEREMY
                    I heard about your friend...
          
          Sam doesn't say anything, so he goes on.
          
                              JEREMY (CONT'D)
                    I wasn't gonna say anything... but
                    then I thought I probably should,
                    because if I didn't, it might be
                    inconsiderate.
          
                              SAM
                    Well... okay. Thanks.
          
          A beat.
          
                              JEREMY
                    So... what are you gonna do?
          
                              SAM
                    I don't know yet.
          
          Sam brushes her mussed hair out of her face, still not
          wanting to go inside the motel room.
          
                              SAM (CONT'D)
                    Do you believe that everything
                    happens for a reason?
          
                              JEREMY
                    I know that for every action
                    there's an equal and opposite
                    reaction.
          
                              SAM
                    Yeah... I learned that in science.
          
                              JEREMY
                    And everything in the universe is
                    in constant motion, as the universe
                    is constantly expanding...
          
                              SAM
                    Yeah, but do you believe that
                    everything happens for a reason,
                    like in life?
          
                              JEREMY
                    You mean like destiny?
          
                                                                  71.
          
          
          Jeremy thinks on this for a moment.
          
                              JEREMY (CONT'D)
                    I think everyone has a purpose.
                    Something they're meant to do. Like
                    potential, but more clear-cut. For
                    instance, I was destined to get my
                    hands on the meteorite.
          
                                 SAM
                    Really.
          
                               JEREMY
                    I'm making amazing discoveries
                    every day, practically sleeping at
                    the lab...
          
          While he talks and becomes more excited he scratches
          nervously at his left forearm. It draws Sam's attention away
          from what he's saying.
          
                              JEREMY (CONT'D)
                    I'm still doing some tests, but
                    there's a metallic substance that's
                    not showing up on the elemental
                    CHARTS-
          
                              SAM
                    What happened to your arm?
          
          Jeremy stops scratching. A small area on the inner part of
          his wrist is RAW and RED, partially SCABBED OVER.
          
                              JEREMY
                    It's just a rash.
          
          Sam starts to get out of the car.
          
                              JEREMY (CONT'D)
                    Sam, wait. Here...
          
          He offers her a wad of cash. Sam hesitates.
          
                                 SAM
                    BUT-
          
                              JEREMY
                    I know you need it. It's no big
                    deal.
          
          She accepts the money.
          
                                 SAM
                    Thank you.
          
                                                                    72.
          
          
          INT. LAUNDROMAT - DAY
          
          Sam shoves a load of her wet clothes into an industrial
          DRYER. She plugs in some quarters, presses the button, and
          sits back in a chair in front of the machine.
          
          As she stares into the whirling cylinder, her eyes defocus
          and she goes into a daze... TRANSITION TO:
          
          
          INT. BEDROOM - NIGHT - CLOSE UP - TOY UNICORN
          
          ARIEL, the STUFFED TOY UNICORN spins on a ROTATING CHAIR...
          
                              YOUNG SAMANTHA (V.O.)
                    Donnie!
          
                              DONNIE DARKO (V.O.)

                    The Last Unicorn, by Samantha
                    Darko!
          
                              YOUNG SAMANTHA (V.O.)
                    Give it back!
          
                              DONNIE DARKO (V.O.)
                    There was once a unicorn named
                    Ariel...
          
          The SOUND of CRINKLING PAPER.
          
                              YOUNG SAMANTHA (V.O.)
                    Donnie! You wrinkled it.
          
                              DONNIE DARKO (V.O.)
                    It's not wrinkled Sam. Just, ya
                    know, flatten it in a book or
                    something...
          
          The chair is re-spun by an O.S. hand... and the UNICORN
          topples off onto the floor. BACK TO:
          
          
          INT. LAUNDROMAT - DAY
          
          Sam snaps out of her vision when she hears Trudy and Father
          Homeijer going around, asking for change.
          
                              FATHER HOMEIJER
                    Any small amount you could manage
                    would really help.
          
          They hover over a FAT MAN, holding out the COLLECTIONS JAR.
          
                                                                     73.
          
          
                              FAT MAN
                    Piss off...
          
                              FATHER HOMEIJER
                    God bless you.
          
          As they move down the line and approach Sam, she tenses up.
          Trudy is about to go into her spiel when she recognizes her.
          
                              TRUDY
                    Oh... hello.
          
          She smiles at Sam politely, trying not to be too awkward. It
          doesn't work.
          
          Aware of Sam's financial situation, she gives Father Homeijer
          the hint to move on. He follows her lead.
          
                              FATHER HOMEIJER
                        (to Sam)
                    God bless you.
          
          Sam watches as they move on to the next person, suddenly
          filled with sadness...
          
          
          EXT. PAYPHONE OUTSIDE BUILDING - AFTERNOON
          
          Sam stands outside at a payphone, listening to it RING...
          Someone on the other end finally picks up:
          
                                ROSE DARKO (V.O.)
                    Hello?
          
          When Sam HEARS her MOTHER'S VOICE, it brings tears to her
          eyes. As if feeling her emotion over the phone line, Rose can
          be HEARD starting to WHIMPER.
          
                                ROSE DARKO (V.O.) (CONT'D)
                    Samantha?
          
                              EDDIE DARKO (V.O.)
                        (in the background)
                    Who is it, Rose?
          
                               ROSE DARKO (V.O.)
                        (CRYING)
                    Is that you?... if it's you, please
                    come home.
          
                                EDDIE DARKO (V.O.)
                    Rose?
          
          Although it looks like she wants to, Sam doesn't speak.
          
                                                                  74.
          
          
          EXT. LOOKOUT, VIETNAM TOM'S SQUATTING GROUND - NIGHT
          
          Vietnam Tom sits at his new squatting ground, looking out
          over all of El Reno. He peers at the twinkling lights through
          his scrap metal BUNNY MASK, and cradles his RIFLE in his arms
          like a soldier at rest.
          
          He slowly turns and sees that Sam is sitting right next to
          him, facing the landscape. She wears her HOODED SWEATSHIRT,
          JEANS and the BANDAGE. The SHARD OF METAL is lodged in her
          forehead.
          
                              SAM
                    You wanna know what happens when
                    you die?
          
          Tom shakes his head no.
          
                              SAM (CONT'D)
                    I wish it was me.
          
          She looks at Tom.
          
                              SAM (CONT'D)
                    I really want... to die.
          
          Tom aims his gun at her face...
          
          He realizes that a FORCE FIELD has formed in between them,
          because when the barrel of the gun touches it, the barrier
          bends and becomes slightly opaque.
          
          Sam is expressionless. Tom's finger trembles as he places it
          on the trigger.
          
          He aims down the gun's sights, directly at Sam's RIGHT EYE,
          and sees a PHOSPHORESCENT GRID take shape like a coordinate
          system on the force field. Sam's eye is in the CENTRAL
          QUADRANT...
          
          Tom pulls the trigger. TIME SLOWS DOWN.
          
          A liquid VECTOR SPEAR shoots out of the gun barrel.
          Immediately after, a BULLET is discharged and follows it...
          
          The VECTOR SPEAR passes cleanly through the grid, but when
          the BULLET reaches it, the entire force field curves to
          accommodate the penetrating force...
          
          The spear juts out until it nearly touches Sam's eye... but
          then it stops. The bullet catches up and freezes at the same
          spot, centimeters from her face --
          
                                                                  75.
          
          
                               SAM (CONT'D)
                        (DISAPPOINTED)
                    Not today.
          
          
          I/E. MOTEL ROOM 15 - DAY
          
          A HAND bangs on the door to room 15...
          
          After a beat, Sam opens it. She's got some makeup on, and has
          spent more time on her hair than usual.
          
                                SAM
                          (SURPRISED)
                    Hi.
          
          Chris lingers in front of the door, looking slightly
          uncomfortable.
          
                              CHRIS
                    I just stopped by to see how you
                    were holdin' up.
          
                                SAM
                    I'm okay.
          
                              CHRIS
                    Sorry about the other night... I
                    DIDN'T-
          
                              SAM
                    I was just upset. I shouldn't have
                    snapped at you like that.
          
          Chris nods, grateful for her forgiveness.
          
                              CHRIS
                    So what are you still doin' here? I
                    figured you woulda hopped on a bus
                    by now.
          
                              SAM
                    I'm gonna be taking off soon, I
                    think. I just gotta figure some
                    stuff out. It's quiet here.
          
                              CHRIS
                    I don't know if you're doin'
                    anything later on, but...
          
          He trails off when he HEARS a CAR pull up and park by his
          truck. He turns and sees that it's Jeremy in his BMW.
          
                                                                  76.
          
          
                              SAM
                    I was just on my way out. What were
                    you gonna say?
          
                                 CHRIS
                    Nothin'.
          
                              SAM
                    Okay, well... I'll see you later?
          
                              CHRIS
                    Yeah, sure.
          
          He steps out of the way so Sam can shut and lock the door.
          
                                 SAM
                    Bye.
          
                                 CHRIS
                    Bye.
          
          Chris stares down Jeremy as Sam gets into his car and they
          drive off together.
          
          
          INT. LAB - DAY
          
          Jeremy turns on the overhead florescent lights in the lab.
          There are ROWS OF DESKS with MICROSCOPES and some PRECISION
          ROCK SLICING EQUIPMENT.
          
          As he walks to a desk near the back, he can barely contain
          his excitement. Sam follows, taking note of a LARGE RABBIT in
          an extremely SMALL CAGE...
          
                              JEREMY
                    Here's my station.
          
          He unlocks a drawer in the lower portion of the desk and
          retrieves a BOX containing a tiny SLICE OF ROCK with a grid-
          like PATTERN OF METALLIC CRYSTALS embedded in it.
          
                                 SAM
                    That's it?
          
                              JEREMY
                    The rest is locked away somewhere
                    else... somewhere safe. Everyone's
                    gonna want a piece of this thing
                    pretty soon.
          
          He takes it over to an SCANNING ELECTRON MICROSCOPE and turns
          it on. He places the meteorite slice in the microscope's
          VACUUM COLUMN through an AIRTIGHT DOOR.
          
                                                                  77.
          
          
                              JEREMY (CONT'D)
                    You ever seen one of these?
          
                               SAM
                    No.
          
                              JEREMY
                    It's a scanning electron
                    microscope. It uses electrons
                    instead of light to scan the image.
          
          A BLACK & WHITE IMAGE appears on the microscope's MONITOR --
          it's a geometric collage of all shapes and shades.
          
                              JEREMY (CONT'D)
                    At first I thought it was a
                    siderite, but then I saw it was
                    more than that. Much more. It does
                    have a percentage of nickel and
                    iron in it as I first suspected.
                    But it also has something else.
          
          He waits for Sam to take the bait.
          
                              SAM
                    And what's that?
          
          He points to cluster of BRIGHT WHITES on the monitor. Their
          shapes are strangely different than the others surrounding
          them.
          
                              JEREMY
                    An unrecognizable element. I've
                    done all the tests. It doesn't
                    exist on the periodic table.
          
          Jeremy is practically beaming.
          
                              SAM
                    So this is pretty major.
          
                              JEREMY
                    This is history. I'm thinking of
                    calling it framium.
          
                               SAM
                    Framium?
          
                              JEREMY
                    For my last name... Frame.
          
                                                                    78.
          
          
                              SAM
                    What if it's like... proof of some
                    alien life-form from another galaxy
                    or something.
          
          Jeremy's tone becomes serious, and he starts to scratch at
          his left forearm as he talks.
          
                              JEREMY
                    It's very important you promise me
                    you won't tell anyone else what
                    I've showed you. I have to wait
                    till just the right moment. NASA,
                    or some secret government
                    organization could come in here and
                    take it away from me...
          
          As Jeremy gets more worked up, he scratches harder...
          
                              JEREMY (CONT'D)
                    And then later on, years from now,
                    take credit for the discovery
                    themselves.
          
                              SAM
                    I won't say anything.
          
                              JEREMY
                    Good.
          
          Sam stares at him for a long beat, as if examining him.
          
                              SAM
                    There's this book I think you'd
                    like... I got it from my physics
                    teacher in high school.
          
                              JEREMY
                    The study of physics has unraveled
                    some of the most profound mysteries
                    of the universe.
          
                              SAM
                    It's called The Philosophy of Time
                    Travel.
          
                              JEREMY
                    Time travel?
          
                              SAM
                    Yeah, but it's not really that.
                    It's more like one scenario, or one
                    type of scenario. I don't
                    completely understand it...
          
                                                                     79.
          
          
          Sam gazes at the cluster of white shapes on the monitor.
          
                              SAM (CONT'D)
                    Another mystery.
          
                              JEREMY
                    What do you mean?
          
                              SAM
                    My life seems to be full of them.
          
                              JEREMY
                    Mysteries are what make life
                    interesting...
          
          Sam doesn't agree or disagree. She's become tense, because
          Jeremy's face is now in close proximity to hers.
          
                              JEREMY (CONT'D)
                    You're a mystery to me, Samantha.
          
          He goes in for a kiss, but Sam gently pushes him away.
          
                              JEREMY (CONT'D)
                    Ow...
          
          Jeremy retreats, shielding his left arm. Sam looks down and
          sees that the red, raw area has turned into a much bigger
          RASH, covering a large part of his wrist and extending onto
          his forearm.
          
                              SAM
                    That doesn't look good.
          
                              JEREMY
                    I should get some Hydrocortisone.
          
          He looks pathetic, and Sam feels sorry for him.
          
                               SAM
                        (regarding the attempted
                         KISS)
                    Sorry about that.
          
                              JEREMY
                    I'm sorry. I should've know better.
                    You barely know me, right?
          
                              SAM
                    And nobody really calls my
                    Samantha. Just my mom and dad.
          
          Jeremy manages a smile, and Sam smiles back.
          
                                                                     80.
          
          
          INT. DEPARTMENT STORE - AFTERNOON
          
          Chris is at work, stocking shelves inside the department
          store...
          
          He checks his watch, stops what he's doing and grabs a PACK
          OF CIGARETTES from his breast pocket -- time for a smoke
          break.
          
          
          EXT. INTERSECTION NEAR DEPARTMENT STORE - AFTERNOON
          
          The TRACTOR-TRAILER TRUCK carrying the JALOPY breaches the
          crest of the hill, descending on the intersection...
          
          
          EXT. DEPARTMENT STORE - CONTINUOUS
          
          Chris lights up a cigarette...
          
          
          CHRIS' POV - TRACTOR-TRAILER TRUCK
          
          He watches as the TRACTOR-TRAILER hits the pothole, but
          passes safely through the intersection, making a right.
          
          Something about the sight of this strikes Chris so much that
          his cigarette falls out of his mouth.
          
          
          EXT. NEIGHBORHOOD - DAY
          
          Father Homeijer and Trudy stroll down a quiet street with
          their COLLECTIONS JAR, and arrive at a fork in the road.
          
                              FATHER HOMEIJER
                    You take this street, I'll take
                    that one?
          
          Without warning, Trudy kisses him on the cheek.
          
                                 TRUDY
                    Good luck.
          
          Father Homeijer blushes, but Trudy smiles at him in a
          friendly manner. They move off in separate directions...
          
          
          EXT. DUSTY'S GARAGE/HOUSE - DAY
          
          Father Homeijer raps on the door of Dusty's house. No answer.
          
                                                                  81.
          
          
          INT. DUSTY'S GARAGE - MOMENTS LATER - DAY
          
          The priest lets himself into the garage, which is open but
          deserted. He notices COREY'S CHEVROLET. He steps up to the
          GARAGE ENTRANCE and knocks...
          
          No one comes to the door, but he notices that it's slightly
          ajar.
          
                              FATHER HOMEIJER
                    Dusty?
          
          He can hear COUNTRY MUSIC playing low within.
          
                              FATHER HOMEIJER (CONT'D)
                    Are you home, son?
          
          He lets himself inside...
          
          
          INT. DUSTY'S HOUSE, KITCHEN - DAY
          
          Father Homeijer walks into the dingy kitchen. The SINK is
          full of DIRTY DISHES. A coating of GRIME over everything.
          
          
          INT. DUSTY'S HOUSE, LIVING - CONTINUOUS - ANGLE ON - PIT BULL
          
          The sleeping PIT BULL stirs...
          
          
          INT. DUSTY'S HOUSE, KITCHEN - CONTINUOUS
          
          The priest sees that the COUNTRY SONG is coming from a STEREO
          that sits on the kitchen counter.
          
                              FATHER HOMEIJER
                        (calling out)
                    Dusty? I'd like to trouble you for
                    a small donation...
          
          The COUNTRY SONG comes to a close, and the tape runs out.
          With the music gone, the priest cocks his head to a new sound
          -- soft, distant CRYING.
          
          He looks curiously toward the CELLAR DOOR... [Note: The
          CRYING SOUND should be identical to the one that drew Corey
          out of the motel room.]
          
                                                                     82.
          
          
          INT. DUSTY'S HOUSE, BASEMENT - DAY
          
          Father Homeijer slowly descends the rickety BASEMENT STEPS.
          At the bottom, he finds a STRING that connects to a bare
          overhead BULB...
          
          He creeps along the dusty cement floor, past an old
          WASHER/DRYER, continuing toward the source of the CRYING,
          which has become more pronounced. He wrinkles his nose at a
          foul smell...
          
                              FATHER HOMEIJER
                    Who's there?
          
          He rounds a corner, and when he sees Billy Moorcroft he's
          nearly frozen in shock --
          
          The boy is locked inside a large, METAL DOG'S CAGE. He sits
          on the floor of the cage, rocking back and forth.
          
          He is pale, bruised and slick with sweat, clothed only in a
          pair of SOILED BRIEFS. Beside him is an aluminum WATER BOWL
          and some scraps of WHITE BREAD. The floor beneath him is
          soaked with URINE and scattered FECES.
          
          Father Homeijer makes the sign of the cross.
          
          
          EXT. DUSTY'S GARAGE/HOUSE - LATER - DAY
          
          Dusty's place is surrounded by FIRE TRUCKS, POLICE CARS and
          an AMBULANCE. Billy Moorcroft is wrapped in a blanket and
          being tended to by PARAMEDICS.
          
          Father Homeijer stands near the boy, being interviewed by a
          DETECTIVE.
          
          Dusty is handcuffed and being loaded into the back of a
          cruiser by Officer O'Dell and another policeman, OFFICER
          HINES (28).
          
                              OFFICER O'DELL
                    Get in there, you sick fuck...
          
          Dusty says nothing as O'Dell shoves him in and slams the
          door...
          
          The two officers turn when they see RANDY'S DAD'S CAR pull up
          next to the property. Randy is in the driver's seat, looking
          confused. Ruth hops out of the passenger seat and darts
          toward the house --
          
          -- but she is cut off and grabbed by a POLICEMAN. ANOTHER
          OFFICER goes to talk to Randy in the car.
          
                                                                   83.
          
          
          Wheels turning, O'Dell addresses Hines:
          
                              OFFICER O'DELL (CONT'D)
                        (regarding Dusty)
                    Let him rot in there for a few
                    minutes, maybe till the news guys
                    show up... I'm gonna go finish
                    checkin' upstairs.
          
          
          INT. DUSTY'S HOUSE, RUTH'S BEDROOM - DAY
          
          O'Dell lets himself into Ruth's bedroom. It's a mess -- her
          CLOTHES are all over the floor, and crinkled ROCK POSTERS
          litter the walls.
          
          Next to her bed is a FRAMED PICTURE of she and Randy. O'Dell
          starts to rifle through her desk drawers, one after another --
          
          He tosses the closet, throwing out clothes and shoes... until
          he finds the SHOEBOX. He opens it up, satisfied...
          
          
          ANGLE: OUTSIDE THE BEDROOM DOOR
          
          Officer Hines stands by the door, looking in at O'Dell
          covertly.
          
          
          INT. MOTEL ROOM 15 - MORNING
          
          Sam lies in bed in front of the television. A NEWS BULLETIN
          comes on about Billy's Moorcroft's rescue:
          
                              TELEVISION ANCHOR
                    We have an update this morning on
                    our breaking news of Billy
                    Moorcroft, the El Reno youth who
                    was kidnapped over 15 months ago,
                    and rescued yesterday afternoon by
                    Father Homeijer of Mount Calvary
                    Church. Billy's condition at this
                    time is considered stable...
          
          Sam stares at the television, dumbfounded. The news cuts to
          the scene of the rescue, where Father Homeijer is being
          INTERVIEWED:
          
                              FIELD REPORTER
                    Father, what led you to this
                    particular house on this particular
                    day?
          
                                                                  84.
          
          
                              FATHER HOMEIJER
                    I was out collecting donations in
                    order to help rebuild my church,
                    Mount Calvary, which recently
                    burned down. Clearly the Lord works
                    in mysterious ways. This is nothing
                    less than divine intervention...
          
          
          EXT. MOTEL - MORNING
          
          As Sam's walking away from the motel, she looks up to the sky
          at a PASSING JET...
          
                              AGATHA (V.O.)
                    No matter how well you think you
                    know somebody, you just never
                    really know...
          
          
          INT. DINER - MORNING
          
          Sam sits at the booth where she and Corey sat before, and
          Agatha sets down a glass of ORANGE JUICE.
          
                              AGATHA
                    Dusty Gibbens has been comin' in
                    here for coffee ever since I can
                    remember... gives me the shivers.
          
          Ted pipes up from behind the counter:
          
                              TED
                    They should hang guys like that.
                    Only thing bothers me is how many
                    of `em are still out there...
          
          Chris enters the diner and catches the end of Ted's rant.
          
                              TED (CONT'D)
                    Hang `em all.
          
                               AGATHA
                        (to Sam)
                    I'll be right back with your
                    breakfast.
          
          As Agatha moves off, Chris sees Sam and approaches her table.
          
                                 CHRIS
                    May I?
          
                                 SAM
                    Sure.
          
                                                                  85.
          
          
                              CHRIS
                    I guess you heard.
          
                              SAM
                    Yeah.
          
                              CHRIS
                    It's so messed up... I feel bad
                    that I recommended him now.
          
          Agatha notices that Chris has sat down with Sam.
          
                              AGATHA
                    What can I get you, honey?
          
                              CHRIS
                    Uh... sausage, eggs, coffee,
                    please.
          
                              AGATHA
                    White or wheat?
          
                              CHRIS
                    Wheat toast, please...
          
          He refocuses his attention back on Sam.
          
                              CHRIS (CONT'D)
                    If I had kids, I'd be worried sick
                    about `em in a world like this. I'm
                    sure your parents must be.
          
                              SAM
                    Hey, you could've been some crazy
                    rapist serial killer.
          
          Agatha is there with his coffee just in time to hear this
          last part. She gives Chris and Sam each an odd look before
          setting the coffee down and leaving.
          
                              SAM (CONT'D)
                    You turned out okay.
          
                              CHRIS
                    Yeah, but everybody doesn't.
          
                              SAM
                    I can take care of myself.
          
                              CHRIS
                    I'm sure you can... but I wouldn't
                    feel right if I didn't tell you
                    about Jeremy.
          
                                                          86.
          
          
                              SAM
                    What about him?
          
                              CHRIS
                    I don't know what you have goin'
                    with him... but you shouldn't be
                    hangin' around him. Let's just
                    leave it at that.
          
                              SAM
                    What makes you think you can tell
                    me who I can and can't hang around
                    with?
          
                              CHRIS
                    It's just that I know him better
                    than you do. He lived in my
                    neighborhood when we were kids.
          
                              SAM
                    So?
          
                              CHRIS
                    So he used to do weird stuff... to
                    animals.
          
          Sam waits for him to go on.
          
                              CHRIS (CONT'D)
                    My sister lost her pet rabbit once,
                    and we went all over the
                    neighborhood lookin' for it. We
                    were just about to call it quits
                    when we heard something comin' from
                    Jeremy's garage. He'd stuck it in a
                    trash can and put the lid on.
          
          Sam looks shocked and a little disgusted.
          
                              CHRIS (CONT'D)
                    It was half starved by the time we
                    got it home. Died just a few days
                    later.
          
                              SAM
                    How old was he?
          
                              CHRIS
                    I don't know, just a couple years.
                    Cute little black and white-
          
                              SAM
                    No. Jeremy.
          
                                                                  87.
          
          
                              CHRIS
                    He was like nine, probably.
          
                              SAM
                    He was just a kid, he didn't know
                    what he was doing.
          
                              CHRIS
                    When you were nine years old did
                    you know it was wrong to put a
                    living creature in the trash can
                    and leave it there?
          
          Sam's had enough.
          
                              SAM
                    Chris... you're a nice guy, but you
                    don't have to be looking out for
                    me. You're not my dad, you're not
                    my big brother...
          
          Chris hangs his head, frustrated.
          
          
          INT. JAIL CELL - AFTERNOON
          
          O'Dell stands at the bars of Dusty's jail cell. Dusty lies on
          his cot and stares up at the ceiling.
          
                              OFFICER O'DELL
                    You know what they do to faggot-ass
                    perverts like you in maximum
                    security, dontcha?
          
          O'Dell chuckles, enjoying this immensely.
          
                              OFFICER O'DELL (CONT'D)
                    Disgusting fuckin' piece a' shit
                    like you...
          
          
          EXT. POLICE STATION, BACK PARKING LOT - EVENING
          
          O'Dell, now dressed in plainclothes, is on the way to his CAR
          in the far corner of the back lot. He HEARS someone come out
          the door behind him, but doesn't turn until he HEARS his
          VOICE.
          
                              OFFICER HINES
                    Hey, O'Dell...
          
                              OFFICER O'DELL
                    I'm on my way out... what do you
                    need?
          
                                                                   88.
          
          
          Hines catches up with him and they walk and talk.
          
                              OFFICER HINES
                    I'm not gonna bullshit ya.
          
                               OFFICER O'DELL
                    Okay...
          
                              OFFICER HINES
                    I saw you snatch the drugs outta
                    that house.
          
          O'Dell's face grows cold but he doesn't slow his pace.
          
                              OFFICER O'DELL
                    I don't think I know what the hell
                    you're talkin' about.
          
                              OFFICER HINES
                    Don't bullshit me either...
          
          Hines grabs his shoulder to stop him. O'Dell eyes his hand.
          
                              OFFICER HINES (CONT'D)
                    I don't wanna turn you in.
          
                              OFFICER O'DELL
                    Then what do you want?
          
                              OFFICER HINES
                    How much you think you'll get when
                    you unload it?
          
          O'Dell keeps cool, but resents being muscled.
          
                               OFFICER O'DELL
                    Depends.
          
                              OFFICER HINES
                    I'll take forty percent this time,
                    but from now on it's fifty-fifty.
          
                              OFFICER O'DELL
                    What do you mean from now on?
          
                              OFFICER HINES
                    I got a pretty good idea this ain't
                    the first time you done this. Won't
                    be the last, will it?
          
          Hines extends his hand and smiles. O'Dell shakes it.
          Grudgingly...
          
                                                                  89.
          
          
          After Hines turns on him and jogs back to the station house,
          O'Dell kicks the ground angrily.
          
                              OFFICER O'DELL
                    Shit!
          
          When he looks up, he's startled by a pair of eyes that peer
          from the bushes nearby. Upon closer inspection, he sees that
          it's Vietnam Tom in his SKI MASK.
          
          Nervous about how much he's heard, O'Dell takes an aggressive
          stance.
          
                              OFFICER O'DELL (CONT'D)
                    Come on outta there. Now!
          
          He becomes tense when Tom emerges, because he sees that he's
          got his RIFLE.
          
                              OFFICER O'DELL (CONT'D)
                    What the fuck you doin' carryin'
                    that around in the town proper?
          
          O'Dell realizes that he's not holding it in a threatening
          manner, but cradling it in his arms.
          
                              OFFICER O'DELL (CONT'D)
                    Hand it over. Right now!
          
          Tom steps toward him ever so slowly. O'Dell reaches out and
          Tom hands him the gun, stock first.
          
                              OFFICER O'DELL (CONT'D)
                    I should arrest you and throw you
                    in jail, you know that? Crazy
                    sonofabitch...
          
          Tom looks at the ground, hunched over meekly.
          
                              OFFICER O'DELL (CONT'D)
                    Get the fuck outta my sight.
          
          O'Dell looks around as Tom shuffles off, making sure no one
          witnessed the transaction.
          
          
          EXT. LOOKOUT - SUNSET
          
          Sam trudges up the wooded hill to the vantage point, carrying
          The Philosophy of Time Travel book. It's quiet and peaceful,
          and everything's bathed in golden light.
          
                                                                  90.
          
          
          EXT. LOOKOUT, VIETNAM TOM'S SQUATTING GROUND - SUNSET
          
          She comes upon Tom's new squatting ground in a secluded area
          near the lookout, and looks around before approaching.
          
          When she sees the handmade BUNNY MASK lying among his things,
          she puts the book under her arm and reaches down to pick it
          up.
          
          She runs her fingers down the long, shiny ears, nose, and
          jagged teeth...
          
          She doesn't realize that Tom is standing close behind her.
          When she senses his presence she's startled.
          
                               SAM
                    Sorry...
          
          She sets the BUNNY MASK down where she found it. Tom says
          nothing. He seems neither surprised nor irritated to find her
          there. He walks up beside her and sits, facing the view.
          
          After a long beat, Sam sits down beside him. To her surprise,
          Tom begins to speak:
          
                               VIETNAM TOM
                    My mom told me someday everybody
                    would understand. She said it was
                    my job to look out for the town...
                    so that's what I do. That's what I
                    always do.
          
          Sam listens to him intently.
          
                              VIETNAM TOM (CONT'D)
                    They don't know why. They don't
                    even want me here, but I still have
                    to protect them.
          
                              SAM
                    They're lucky to have someone to
                    protect them.
          
                              VIETNAM TOM
                    I'm used to it... I'm lucky to have
                    a job to do. Some people don't have
                    any reason to be here at all.
          
                              SAM
                    I know what you mean...
          
          Tom turns and looks at her strangely.
          
                                                                  91.
          
          
                              VIETNAM TOM
                    You're more important than all of
                    us.
          
          Sam peers into Tom's pale blue eyes through his ski mask.
          Without knowing why, she reaches out and touches the mask...
          
          When she starts to pull it off Tom grabs her hand, stopping
          her -- not too rough, but forceful.
          
          Sam's scared for a moment, but Tom lets her go. His eyes
          drift down to The Philosophy of Time Travel book by her side.
          Sam sees him staring, so she picks it up and hands it to him.
          
          When Tom sees the cover, his cold eyes are filled with
          emotion. Sam sees how struck he is, but doesn't understand.
          
                              SAM
                    Do you like to read?
          
          Tom says nothing.
          
                              SAM (CONT'D)
                    You can borrow it...
          
          Again, Tom does not speak. After a beat, Sam gets up slowly
          and walks away, leaving Tom with the book.
          
          
          INT. DEPARTMENT STORE - DAY
          
          Jeremy is at the department store in the FIRST AID SECTION,
          picking out some GAUZE and DISINFECTANT. When he looks down
          the aisle and sees Sam, he moves toward her quickly...
          
          He disturbs her while she's looking at some FEMININE HYGIENE
          PRODUCTS.
          
                              JEREMY
                    Sam...
          
          When he sees the items that she's shopping for, he seems much
          more embarrassed than she does.
          
                              SAM
                    Oh, hi Jeremy.
          
                              JEREMY
                    Hi... sorry.
          
                              SAM
                    That's okay, what's up?
          
                                                           92.
          
          
                               JEREMY
                    Nothing... just that I haven't see
                    you around for the past few days. I
                    was worried. I thought you might've
                    taken off.
          
                              SAM
                    No... I've been around. Going for
                    lots of walks.
          
                              JEREMY
                    I stopped by the motel.
          
          Sam finds his manner a bit odd.
          
                              SAM
                    Like I said, I've been in and out.
          
                               JEREMY
                    Well, there's something I wanted to
                    ask you. You know that book you
                    mentioned?
          
                              SAM
                    Yeah...
          
                              JEREMY
                    I'd really love to check it out.
          
                              SAM
                    Oh...
          
          Sam's face darkens, and Jeremy picks up on it.
          
                              JEREMY
                    You said you'd show it to me
                    sometime, and I've got a hunch it
                    could really help me in some of my
                    studies related to-
          
                              SAM
                    I don't have it anymore.
          
                              JEREMY
                    What?
          
                              SAM
                    I kind of... gave it to someone.
          
                              JEREMY
                    To who? Why?
          
                                                                    93.
          
          
                              SAM
                    I'm sorry. I just... forgot that I
                    said you could borrow it, and this
                    GUY-
          
                                JEREMY
                    What guy?
          
                              SAM
                    Well... that Vietnam Tom guy.
          
          Jeremy is furious.
          
                              JEREMY
                    Vietnam Tom!? You gave away the
                    book to Vietnam Tom!?
          
          Sam backs away from him. He's getting louder and out of
          control.
          
                              JEREMY (CONT'D)
                    I don't fucking believe what you're
                    telling me!
          
                              SAM
                    It's just a book...
          
                              JEREMY
                    He's a fucking bum! And you chose
                    him over me!?
          
                              SAM
                    No... I just-
          
          Suddenly, a hand comes down on Jeremy's shoulder. He turns
          and finds Chris standing behind him.
          
                              CHRIS
                    That's enough.
          
          Sam is relieved. Jeremy glares at Chris.
          
                              JEREMY
                    This is none of your business.
          
                              CHRIS
                    It is, actually. You're disturbing
                    my customers. Get out.
          
          Jeremy brushes past Sam as he leaves, and she and Chris are
          left alone. There's a definite "I told you so" aura.
          
                                                                  94.
          
          
                              SAM
                        (MUTTERING)
                    You didn't have to do that.
          
                              CHRIS
                    Just doin' my job.
          
          Sam starts to walk away, at first forgetting the products she
          needed. She comes back to get them, slightly flustered. Chris
          turns and leaves her in peace.
          
                              CHRIS (CONT'D)
                        (as he's walking away)
                    You're welcome.
          
          
          INT. FATHER HOMEIJER'S HOUSE, LIVING ROOM - AFTERNOON
          
          Father Homeijer and Trudy are sitting on the couch in the
          living room of his quaint house, sharing a BOTTLE OF
          CHAMPAGNE.
          
                              TRUDY
                    I never had any doubts in you, or
                    in the Lord.
          
                              FATHER HOMEIJER
                    I know that. And we both truly
                    appreciate all your faith and hard
                    work...
          
          They sip their champagne. Trudy glows.
          
                              FATHER HOMEIJER (CONT'D)
                    We needed a miracle, but we got two
                    instead.
          
          Trudy grabs the bottle and tries to refill his glass, but the
          priest puts his hand over it.
          
                              FATHER HOMEIJER (CONT'D)
                    I think I've had enough.
          
                              TRUDY
                    One more glass won't hurt you. You
                    deserve it, Father...
          
          
          I/E. O'DELL'S CAR/ABANDONED WAREHOUSE - NIGHT
          
          O'DELL'S CAR pulls up to an old warehouse and parks.
          
                              OFFICER HINES
                    Where the hell are they?
          
                                                                  95.
          
          
          Hines is nervous. He lights a cigarette.
          
                              OFFICER O'DELL
                    They'll be here. Just take it easy.
          
          
          EXT. DEPARTMENT STORE - LATE NIGHT
          
          Tom wears his metal BUNNY MASK. Sam wears her HOODED
          SWEATSHIRT and JEANS, and her right hand is BANDAGED. The
          METAL SHARD is embedded under the skin of her forehead...
          
          They move slowly and methodically until they reach the center
          of the empty lot. There are lights on in the closed
          department store, but the parking lot is mostly dark.
          
                              VIETNAM TOM
                    Why do you talk to me?
          
          TOM'S VOICE is MUFFLED behind his mask.
          
                              SAM
                    Same reason you talk to me...
          
          Tom cocks his head, unsure of the answer.
          
                              SAM (CONT'D)
                    Because I can see how special you
                    are.
          
                              VIETNAM TOM
                    Why can't other people?
          
                              SAM
                    They will. Only one day left.
          
          They both turn toward an area in the lot where the SHOPPING
          CARTS are stored. The METAL STORAGE RACK starts to tremble
          and burn with COSMIC ENERGY...
          
          
          INT. FATHER HOMEIJER'S HOUSE, LIVING ROOM - AFTERNOON
          
          Father Homeijer finishes his glass of champagne. Trudy is
          already done with hers, and she takes his glass and sets it
          on the coffee table. She moves closer to him on the couch...
          
                               FATHER HOMEIJER
                    Trudy...
          
          She puts her hand on his leg.
          
                                                                    96.
          
          
                              TRUDY
                    I see the way you look at me,
                    Father...
          
          She moves in closer... He looks uncomfortable.
          
                              TRUDY (CONT'D)
                    I want you too.
          
          She's about to kiss him, but Father Homeijer stops her.
          
                              TRUDY (CONT'D)
                    I can't do this. I'm a man of the
                    cloth... and you'd regret it.
          
          He takes her by the hand, reminding her of the WEDDING BAND
          on her finger.
          
          
          EXT. DEPARTMENT STORE - LATE NIGHT
          
          SHOPPING CARTS start to roll out of the RACK by themselves,
          following their own liquid VECTOR SPEARS.
          
          Tom stands staring at them. He is flanked by Sam...
          
          
          EXT. ABANDONED WAREHOUSE - NIGHT
          
          Officer Hines walks to the edge of the woods beside the
          warehouse and unzips his pants...
          
          
          ANGLE: O'DELL'S CAR
          
          With GLOVED HANDS, O'Dell grabs VIETNAM TOM'S RIFLE out of
          the trunk...
          
          
          INT. FATHER HOMEIJER'S HOUSE, LIVING ROOM - AFTERNOON
          
          Trudy's head is buried in her hands and she bawls.
          
                              TRUDY
                    I feel like such an idiot...
          
          Father Homeijer doesn't know what to say.
          
          
          EXT. ABANDONED WAREHOUSE - NIGHT
          
          Hines finishes relieving himself and comes out into the open
          from the side of the building. O'Dell is waiting for him.
          
                                                                    97.
          
          
                              OFFICER HINES
                    What the fuck-
          
          BOOM!
          
          O'Dell shoots him in the chest. He is cool and calm. He
          throws the rifle down on the ground...
          
          
          EXT. DEPARTMENT STORE - LATE NIGHT
          
          The SHOPPING CARTS whirl in an circle of ever-increasing
          speed around Vietnam Tom and Sam. The RUBBER WHEELS squeal on
          the cement until they start to melt...
          
          The VECTOR SPEARS lead the carts in a spiral that hones in
          closer and closer to the two of them. Sam is stoic. Tom is in
          awe...
          
          
          EXT. THE ETHER - NIGHT - POV INSIDE PORTAL
          
          We travel at breath-taking speed through a PORTAL as it
          weaves through millions of STARS, then an ATMOSPHERIC
          BARRIER...
          
          
          EXT. DEPARTMENT STORE - LATE NIGHT
          
          When it looks like they'll be crushed by the scudding metal,
          or combusted by the cosmic energy, the WORM-LIKE PORTAL from
          the sky reaches down and encloses Tom and Sam like a vacuum.
          
          There's a brilliant FLASH OF LIGHT -- TRANSITION TO:
          
          
          EXT. DEPARTMENT STORE - THE NEXT MORNING
          
          CHRIS' TRUCK pulls into the lot early in the morning, and he
          gets out wearing his work uniform. Still groggy, he's about
          to walk into the store when something catches his eye...
          
          CRANE UP to FIND a STRUCTURE made of all the SHOPPING CARTS,
          as chilling and impressive as a crop circle, in the shape of
          an immense FIBONACCI SPIRAL. The metal of the carts has been
          fused together, and they're stacked in an ascending manner
          that reaches an apex in the center, like a cone.
          
          Chris is mystified... CUT TO:
          
          
          EXT. STREET - DAY
          
          Two POLICE CRUISERS speed down a street in town...
          
                                                                  98.
          
          
          EXT. PARK - AFTERNOON
          
          COPS, including Officer O'Dell, converge on Vietnam Tom in
          the park, where he sits on the SWING in his ski mask...
          
                              COP #1
                    Get down on the ground!
          
          Tom looks up at them calmly, without fear.
          
                              COP #1 (CONT'D)
                    Get down on the ground, now!
          
          He obeys them and two Cops jump on him and put him in cuffs.
          One of them pulls up his head and rips off his ski mask --
          
          Tom's face is a mass of SCARS. Both his cheeks, forehead and
          chin are marred by scar tissue born from long, deep gashes.
          
          O'Dell looks into his sad, blue eyes...
          
          
          INT. POLICE STATION, VARIOUS - AFTERNOON
          
          Tom is slammed against a table. An OFFICER takes his hand
          roughly and sticks his fingers into some ink to take his
          prints -- JUMP CUT TO:
          
                                 POLICEMAN (V.O.)
                    Name?
          
          Tom stands for his booking photos -- JUMP CUT TO:
          
                              POLICEMAN (CONT'D)
                        (getting angry)
                    What's your name?
          
          The POLICEMAN stands over Vietnam Tom, who sits defeated in a
          chair. A YOUNG OFFICER approaches.
          
                              YOUNG OFFICER
                    We found this on him...
          
          He passes the Policeman a set of DOG TAGS on a CHAIN. The
          name on the tags is: THOMAS WARD SPARROW.
          
          
          EXT. MOTEL - EVENING
          
          Sam walks toward the motel, wearing JEANS and a T-SHIRT...
          
          When she sees JEREMY'S BMW parked in the lot she stops short.
          But it's too late -- he's already seen her and is getting out
          of the car. He's got a bouquet of FLOWERS.
          
                                                          99.
          
          
                                 JEREMY
                    Hi, Sam...
          
          He passes her the flowers.
          
                              JEREMY (CONT'D)
                    I hope you can forgive the way I
                    acted.
          
                              SAM
                    That was pretty weird.
          
                              JEREMY
                    I know. I just...
          
          Jeremy is awkward and shy.
          
                              JEREMY (CONT'D)
                    I've been so wrapped up with the
                    meteorite. I haven't been eating or
                    sleeping much. I think I'm just
                    drained... but that's no excuse.
          
                              SAM
                    It's alright.
          
                              JEREMY
                    I was wondering if you'd let me
                    make it up to you.
          
                              SAM
                    You don't need to-
          
                              JEREMY
                    Please... let me take you to watch
                    the fireworks tonight.
          
                              SAM
                    I don't think so.
          
                              JEREMY
                    It's gonna be spectacular. There's
                    gonna be a meteor shower that
                    coincides with the show... I mean,
                    how often does that happen?
          
          Sam still isn't sure.
          
                              JEREMY (CONT'D)
                    I just wanna be your friend.
          
                              SAM
                    I was supposed to see `em with
                    Chris, but... he's stuck at work.
          
                                                                   100.
          
          
                              JEREMY
                    So, what do you say? Will you go
                    with me?
          
                              SAM
                    Gimme a sec. Lemme grab my
                    sweatshirt...
          
          Jeremy beams.
          
          
          EXT. DEPARTMENT STORE - EVENING
          
          Chris is in the department store parking lot with a crew of
          EMPLOYEES. They work together to pry apart the numerous
          SHOPPING CARTS with CROWBARS. They've made some progress, but
          still a long way to go.
          
          Chris is distracted by JEREMY'S BMW as it cruises through the
          nearby intersection...
          
          After it passes, Chris looks up at some OMINOUS CLOUDS
          congregating in the darkening sky.
          
          From the CLOUDS above the store -- PAN DOWN TO FIND:
          
          
          EXT. LOOKOUT - EVENING
          
          The lookout, and Jeremy's car riding up the hill. There are
          OTHER CARS parked to watch the upcoming display, but Jeremy
          drives to a more SECLUDED AREA... (Music suggestion: 4th of
          July, by Soundgarden.)
          
          
          EXT. WOODED GROVE NEARBY - EVENING
          
          Jeremy spreads a blanket on the ground of a private grove. He
          wears a LIGHT JACKET, and sets down a GROCERY BAG. Sam has
          her HOODED SWEATSHIRT tied around her waist.
          
                              SAM
                    Shouldn't we go back out there
                    where we can see?
          
                              JEREMY
                    No, this'll be perfect. See right
                    there?
          
          He points to an area near the tops of the trees.
          
                              JEREMY (CONT'D)
                    That's right where the fireworks'll
                    come up.
                              (MORE)
          
                                                                 101.
          
                              JEREMY (CONT'D)
                    And we can see the meteors better
                    without all the lights from the
                    town.
          
          Sam sits down on the blanket and checks her watch. Jeremy
          pokes around in the grocery bag.
          
                              SAM
                    So what's in the bag?
          
                              JEREMY
                    You'll see...
          
          Sam takes her HOODED SWEATSHIRT from around her waist and
          puts it on to fight the cold...
          
                              JEREMY (CONT'D)
                    There's one!
          
          Sam spots a METEOR as it streaks across the sky --
          
          
          EXT. WOODED GROVE NEARBY - LATER - NIGHT
          
          JEREMY'S HAND holds a flaring ROMAN CANDLE --
          
                              JEREMY (O.S.)
                    Here it goes!
          
          A SPARKLING GREEN BALL shoots out of the stick into the air.
          Sam looks up at it and smiles. Jeremy shoots off colorful
          ball after ball, aiming in different directions.
          
                              SAM
                    They're pretty.
          
          After his stick fizzles out:
          
                              JEREMY
                    You wanna try one?
          
          Sam shrugs... He grabs another out of the grocery bag, and
          Sam gets up slowly. He passes her the ROMAN CANDLE, and she
          accepts it with her RIGHT HAND...
          
                              JEREMY (CONT'D)
                    Just hold it straight up.
          
          Sam holds it and Jeremy flicks his LIGHTER. The WICK
          catches...
          
                              JEREMY (CONT'D)
                    It's goin'!
          
                                                                   102.
          
          
          Sam smiles and holds the stick as far away from her face as
          possible. She closes her eyes...
          
          But the wick burns down extremely fast. The FIRST BALL gets
          stuck at the top and implodes, causing the whole thing to
          catch fire.
          
                               SAM
                    Ow!
          
                               JEREMY
                    Drop it!
          
          He runs over and stamps it out as quickly as he can...
          
                              JEREMY (CONT'D)
                    Fucking faulty one...
          
          Sam nurses her burned hand.
          
                              JEREMY (CONT'D)
                    Are you okay?
          
                              SAM
                    I think so...
          
          Jeremy inspects her hand -- there's a large BLISTER.
          
                              JEREMY
                    You need to get that covered...
          
          Jeremy takes off his jacket. He then removes his T-shirt and
          starts to tear off a piece.
          
                              SAM
                    What are you doing?
          
                              JEREMY
                    It's okay...
          
          
          EXT. BANK - NIGHT
          
          The bank sign shows 8:59 PM. The display flashes to: JULY 4,
          1995... It changes to the countdown: 00 DAYS, 00 HOURS, 00
          MINUTES, 03 SECONDS... 02 SECONDS... 01 SECONDS...
          
          
          EXT. WOODED GROVE NEARBY - NIGHT
          
          Jeremy finishes wrapping the piece of his T-shirt around
          Sam's hand, creating the MAKESHIFT BANDAGE.
          
                                                                 103.
          
          
                              JEREMY
                    How's it feel?
          
                              SAM
                    A little better...
          
          The FIREWORKS suddenly begin, and fill the sky above the
          grove with bursts of bright, multi-colored lights. Sporadic
          METEORS rain down at the same time. It's magnificent.
          
          After a beat, Sam looks over at Jeremy...
          
          The fireworks illuminate his torso, and she is appalled to
          see that the raw, reddish RASH has spread to cover the
          greater part of it.
          
                              SAM (CONT'D)
                    Good God...
          
          Jeremy looks down as if he'd forgotten, then quickly picks up
          his jacket and puts it back on.
          
                              SAM (CONT'D)
                        (ALARMED)
                    Is that from the meteorite?
          
                              JEREMY
                    I barely even notice it anymore.
                    I'm sure it'll go away soon.
          
          He zips up his jacket tight.
          
                              SAM
                    Are you fucking kidding me?
          
                              JEREMY
                    Do you think I'm disgusting?
          
          The question takes Sam by surprise.
          
                              SAM
                    No... I just think you should get
                    it looked at-
          
          Before Sam can finish, Jeremy crams his mouth into hers for a
          forceful kiss...
          
          Sam shoves him away sharply.
          
                              SAM (CONT'D)
                    What the hell are you doing?
          
                                                                   104.
          
          
                              JEREMY
                    So you do find me disgusting. Which
                    is it, Sam, I can't take much more
                    of this shit!
          
                              SAM
                    Jesus Christ...
          
          He tries to grab her, but Sam turns and runs --
          
                                 JEREMY
                    Come here!
          
          
          EXT. WOODS - NIGHT
          
          Sam tears through the woods, Jeremy close behind her. The
          FIREWORKS CRACK and POP in the sky above...
          
                                 JEREMY
                    Sam! Stop!
          
          Sam jumps over a fallen log in the dark... Jeremy hits it
          dead on with his shins and goes head over heels --
          
                                 JEREMY (CONT'D)
                    FUCK!
          
          He picks himself up and charges even faster --
          
          
          INT. JAIL CELL - NIGHT
          
          Tom sits alone in his jail cell, morose, staring at the
          floor. He looks up when he senses someone approaching...
          
          
          EXT. LOOKOUT, VIETNAM TOM'S SQUATTING GROUND - NIGHT
          
          Sam sprints by the area of Vietnam Tom's squatting ground.
          FIREWORKS continue to EXPLODE and shower overhead, and some
          PEOPLE can be HEARD LAUGHING and SHOUTING from the main
          parking area, not far away...
          
          Sam runs toward the VOICES --
          
          But Jeremy grabs her from behind and spins her around!
          
                              SAM
                    Why are you doing this?
          
                              JEREMY
                    I just wanna talk to you!
          
                                                                 105.
          
          
          She struggles against his grip. The EXPLOSIONS and the RUCKUS
          from CROWD mask their noise.
          
                               JEREMY (CONT'D)
                    Stop it!
          
          Sam raises her knee and connects hard with his groin. He
          starts to double over, but recovers quickly and smacks her
          across the face --
          
                              JEREMY (CONT'D)
                    Fucking bitch!
          
          Sam is stunned, and Jeremy takes her by the shoulders and
          shoves her hard --
          
          Sam stumbles backwards and falls, cracking her head on the
          metal BUNNY MASK. She rolls over onto her back, REVEALING the
          SHARD OF METAL that protrudes from the GASH by her temple...
          
          She struggles no more.
          
          
          INT. JAIL CELL - NIGHT
          
          Tom stands in his cell to meet the entity that approaches...
          
          
          EXT. DEPARTMENT STORE - NIGHT
          
          Chris and the other Employees stop working and look up at the
          sky, now roiling with sinister, SUPERNATURAL CLOUDS...
          
          
          EXT. LOOKOUT, VIETNAM TOM'S SQUATTING GROUND - NIGHT
          
          Jeremy slowly creeps to where Sam lies... Her eyes are open
          and she is completely still.
          
                               JEREMY
                    Sam?...
          
          Jeremy crouches beside her, and when he puts two fingers to
          her neck to feel for a pulse, he starts to tremble...
          
          The raining METEORS and FIREWORKS illuminate the SMOKE and
          the BLACK CLOUDS overhead...
          
          
          INT. JAIL CELL - NIGHT
          
          Vietnam Tom walks up to the CELL BARS...
          
          He comes face to face with Sam.
          
                                                                  106.
          
          
          She stares back at him through the bars from the other side.
          She wears her HOODED SWEATSHIRT and the BANDAGE. Light glints
          off the METAL lodged in her HEAD WOUND.
          
          
          I/E. JEREMY'S BMW/LOOKOUT - NIGHT
          
          Jeremy speeds frantically down the hill, away from the
          parking area and the continuing fireworks display. Tears
          stream down his cheeks...
          
          He cuts the wheel when a pair of HEADLIGHTS blind him and a
          vehicle cuts him off. His car skids out, and he sees it's
          CHRIS' TRUCK that has almost hit him.
          
          Chris jumps out, yanks open Jeremy's door and grabs him by
          the shirt collar. He yells over the FIREWORKS:
          
                              CHRIS
                    Where the hell is Sam?
          
                              JEREMY
                        (FRANTIC)
                    I don't know... I don't know...
          
          Jeremy stomps on the gas pedal, and Chris is forced to unhand
          him as his BMW navigates around the truck and barrels down
          the hill...
          
          
          EXT. LOOKOUT, VIETNAM TOM'S SQUATTING GROUND - LATER - NIGHT
          
          As Chris approaches Vietnam Tom's squatting ground, the
          FIREWORKS DISPLAY is in the midst of the GRANDE FINALE.
          Showers of light BURST and CRACKLE in steady succession.
          PEOPLE SCREAM in approval from the parking area nearby...
          
          Chris comes upon Sam's lifeless form.
          
                              CHRIS
                    No...
          
          He stoops by her, picks her up and hugs her limp body
          close...
          
          As he does this, Vietnam Tom approaches from behind him.
          Chris turns to face him but says nothing, still holding Sam.
          The WIND picks up and blows in gusts around them...
          
          Tom looks down at the two of them for a moment, then reaches
          down and picks up his BUNNY MASK. The EVIL GRIN is red with
          SAM'S BLOOD, and one of the teeth is missing...
          
                                                                    107.
          
          
          The last of the fireworks display occurs, leaving the night
          full of SMOKE, HELLISH CLOUDS and an increasing number of
          bright-tailed METEORS -- the APOCALYPSE.
          
          Amongst the churning clouds, a tornado-like PORTAL cuts
          through the sky and touches down somewhere in the town. It's
          swirling and vast, stretching down from limitless space...
          
                              SAM (V.O.)
                    15 days... 18 hours...
          
          Tom puts on the BUNNY MASK...
          
               SAM (V.O.) (CONT'D)                 VIETNAM TOM
          45 minutes... 6 seconds...      45 minutes... 6 seconds...
          
          And focuses on a single METEOR that plummets toward the
          yawning VORTEX, using telekinetic power to guide it...
          
          
          EXT. THE ETHER - NIGHT - POV INSIDE PORTAL

          INT. MOTEL ROOM 15 - NIGHT
          
          Sam awakens suddenly from a nightmare. She lies atop the
          blankets wearing a T-SHIRT and BOXER SHORTS. She looks over
          and sees Corey passed out on the other full-size bed.
          
          TWO PLASTIC CUPS, EMPTY SODA CANS, and the BOTTLE are on the
          nightstand between them, the liquor partially consumed. The
          CLOCK/RADIO reads 3:30 AM.
          
          
          EXT. WINDMILL PLATFORM - NIGHT
          
          Vietnam Tom sits atop the platform, more than 30 feet up,
          wearing his ski mask and holding his rifle. The surface of
          the platform is littered with TATTERED CLOTHING, a WATER
          BOTTLE, CANS OF FOOD and SCRAPS OF A TARP.
          
          Relaxed and at peace, Tom looks up to the clear night sky. As
          a TREMOR starts to build, he takes off his ski mask and gazes
          out over his town...
          
          He smiles.
          
          Suddenly, there's a brilliant flash of GREEN LIGHT --
          deafening THUNDER -- a blinding EXPLOSION -- CUT TO:
          
          
          CHARACTER MONTAGE
          
          Dusty sits and stares at his CELLAR DOOR... Trudy holds a
          PICTURE OF FATHER HOMEIJER and cries... Ruth snorts some COKE
          in her room... Jeremy scratches his LEFT FOREARM in his
          sleep... Billy Moorcroft shivers from the chill in his
          CAGE... Officer O'Dell sits alone in his patrol car,
          fingering the trigger of his PISTOL... TRANSITION TO:
          
          
          EXT. FIELD BEHIND MOTEL - THE NEXT MORNING
          
          Where the towering windmill once stood is now only a CRATER
          about 5 feet deep and 10 feet in diameter, with charred bits
          of wood and metal strewn everywhere. Ground water spurts from
          the broken well seal.
          
          A cantaloupe-sized METEORITE sits in the center of the
          crater...
          
          Two FIREMEN haul out the meteorite as Sam and O'Dell arrive
          on the scene. There are PARAMEDICS, a CORONER and other
          POLICEMEN there as well, and a large area has been cordoned
          off with POLICE TAPE.
          
                                                                 109.
          
          
          Corey is there looking on, as well as Chris Holt, Phil
          Coulter, and other local CITIZENS. TOM'S REMAINS are carried
          off in a BLACK BAG...
          
                              SAM
                    Oh my God...
          
          Sam moves to stand by Corey. The overall mood is grim, and
          Frank stands peering at the wreckage with a long face.
          
                              FRANK
                    I don't believe it...
          
          The Firemen drop the porous, misshapen clod by his feet.
          
                              FRANK (CONT'D)
                    This is just a tragedy.
          
          Officer O'Dell steps up beside him and kicks the meteorite
          with his boot.
          
                              OFFICER O'DELL
                    Sell that thing off to some
                    meteorologist nerd club, I bet you
                    could do okay.
          
                              FRANK
                    Do I look like the type of guy
                    that's gonna try and profit off
                    another man's death? You should be
                    ashamed of yourself.
          
                              OFFICER O'DELL
                        (EMBARRASSED)
                    I was just sayin'...
          
          Sam looks down on the ground and sees Tom's multi-colored SKI
          MASK...
          
          She picks it up.
          
                              COREY
                    What are you doing?
          
          As she caresses the fibers with her fingers, she is filled
          with unwarranted emotion...
          
          
          EXT. MOTEL - MORNING
          
          Sam and Corey are on their way back to the motel room when
          they turn and see that Chris has followed them.
          
                                                                 110.
          
          
                                 CHRIS
                    Hey...
          
                                 SAM
                    Hey.
          
                              CHRIS
                    So you guys stayed here last night?
          
                              COREY
                    One of us did.
          
          Sam gives Corey a look. Chris decides to ignore the comment.
          
                              CHRIS
                    What's up with your car?
          
                              COREY
                    It's gonna take a couple days.
          
                              CHRIS
                    For a water pump?
          
          Sam and Corey shrug.
          
                              CHRIS (CONT'D)
                    It's none of my business, but...
          
          He's distracted when JEREMY'S BMW pulls up and parks. He hops
          out and hustles across the field toward the crash site...
          
                                 SAM
                    What?
          
          Chris regains his train of thought:
          
                              CHRIS
                    I was just gonna say, if you
                    wanted, I could give you a ride
                    back.
          
          He looks right at Sam when he says this. He then glances over
          at Corey, as if just remembering that she were there.
          
                              CHRIS (CONT'D)
                    You too. I mean, I could give you
                    both a ride.
          
                              COREY
                    To Middlesex, Virginia? Do you-
          
                              SAM
                        (INTERRUPTING)
                    I'll go.
          
                                                                 111.
          
          
                              COREY
                        (PISSED)
                    What?
          
                              SAM
                    I think I wanna go.
          
                              COREY
                    Things get a little tough, you're
                    just gonna give up?
          
                              SAM
                    It's not like that... You should
                    come too.
          
                              COREY
                    Fuck that. I'll wait for my car and
                    stick to the plan. Do whatever the
                    fuck you want.
          
          Corey turns and goes inside the room.
          
                               SAM
                    Corey...
          
          Sam looks back to Chris, who is uncomfortable for causing the
          conflict.
          
                              CHRIS
                    Sorry to screw you guys up.
          
                              SAM
                    It's alright. She can take care of
                    herself... she's good at it. I've
                    gotta go home.
          
          
          INT. FRANK'S BARN - DAY
          
          The METEORITE sits in a dark corner of the barn, collecting
          dust...
          
          
          INT. CHRIS' TRUCK - DAY
          
          Sam leans her head against the window of Chris' truck as they
          cruise along the highway...
          
          She gazes up at the bright, open sky.
          
          
          
          THE END

          EXT. CLASSROOM - DAY

          It's a group of twelve-year-olds, serious and well dressed.
          They sit on their heels under a sparsely elegant tent, small
          wooden desks with embedded screens in front of them. The
          tent is on a lawn surrounded by lush foliage. People walk
          about and vehicles glide quietly overhead. A utopian vista.

          GIRL
          Now that the war's over, our
          soldiers get to come home, yes?

          TEACHER
          Some of them. Some will be
          stationed on the rim planets as
          Peace Enforcers.

          BOY
          I don't understand. Why were the
          Independents even fighting us?
          Why wouldn't they look to be more
          civilized?

          TEACHER
          That's a good question. Does
          anybody want to open on that?

          GIRL
          I hear they're cannibals.

          ANOTHER BOY
          That's only Reavers.

          ANOTHER GIRL
          Reavers aren't real.

          ANOTHER BOY
          Full well they are. They attack
          settlers from space, they kill
          them and wear their skins and rape
          them for hours and hours --

          TEACHER
          (in Chinese)
          

          (CALMER)
          It's true that there are...
          dangers on the outer planets. So
          let's follow up on Borodin's
          question. With all the social and
          medical advancements we can bring
          to the Independents, why would
          they fight so hard against us?

          RIVER
          We meddle.

          TEACHER
          River? 
          RIVER is a dark, intense little girl, writing with one hand
          and "typing" with the other. (Typing consists of holding a
          long wooden stylus and tapping either end down different
          columns of chinese characters on her desktop screen.) She is
          a good two years younger than the other kids.

          RIVER
          People don't like to be meddled
          with. We tell them what to do,
          what to think, don't run don't
          walk we're in their homes and in
          their heads and we haven't the
          right. We're meddlesome.

          TEACHER
          (gently taking her

          STYLUS)
          River, we're not telling people
          what to think. We're just trying
          to show them how.
          She violently PLUNGES the stylus into the girl's forehead

          INT. LAB - NIGHT

           And we FLASH CUT to the actual present: a 16 year old RIVER
          sitting in a metal chair, needles stuck in her skull (one
          right where the teacher had stuck her) being adjusted by a
          technician. A second monitors her brain patterns.
          The lab is cold, blue, steel. Insidiously clean.

          2ND TECHNICIAN
          She's dreaming.

          FIRST TECHNICIAN
          Nightmare?

          2ND TECHNICIAN
          Off the charts. Scary monsters.

          DOCTOR MATHIAS
          Let's amp it up. Delcium, eight-
          drop.
          DOCTOR MATHIAS is not instantly likable -- nor gradually, for
          that matter. A cold man, and more than a little satisfied
          with himself.

          

          

          

          

          4.
          Behind him stands a GOVERNMENT INSPECTOR, observing. And
          making him a little nervous.
          The Inspector is in shadow, but his uniform indicates
          -- no
          substantial rank, as does the eagle-crested baton
          longer than a ruler -- that he clutches in one gloved hand.

          DOCTOR MATHIAS

          (CONTINUING)
          See, most of our best work is done
          when they're asleep. We can
          monitor and direct their
          subconscious, implant
          suggestions...
          River starts convulsing, mewing in misery. The Inspector
          starts forward, slowly.

          DOCTOR MATHIAS

          (CONTINUING)
          It's a little startling to see,
          but the results are spectacular.
          Especially in this case. River
          Tam is our star pupil.
          The Inspector steps into the light. He is rigid, cold,
          staring at the girl with no emotion at all. His name, as we
          will very soon learn, is SIMON.

          SIMON
          I've heard that.

          DOCTOR MATHIAS
          She's a genius. Her mental
          capacity is extraordinary, even
          with the side-effects.

          SIMON
          Tell me about them.

          DOCTOR MATHIAS
          Well, obviously, she's unstable...
          the neural stripping gives them
          heightened cognitive reception,
          but it also destabilizes their own
          reality matrix. It manifests as
          borderline schizophrenia... which
          at this point is the price for
          being truly psychic.

          SIMON
          (moves toward her)
          What use do we have for a psychic
          if she's insane?

          5.

          DOCTOR MATHIAS
          I don't have to tell you the
          security potential of someone who
          can read minds. And she has lucid

          ask if there's some reason for
          this inspection.

          SIMON

          (TURNING)
          Am I making you nervous?

          DOCTOR MATHIAS
          Key members of Parliament have
          personally observed this subject.
          I was told their support for the
          project was unanimous. The
          demonstration of her power --

          SIMON
          (turns back to her)
          How is she physically?

          DOCTOR MATHIAS
           Like nothing we've seen. All our
          subjects are conditioned for
          combat, but River... she's a
          creature of extraordinary grace.

          400

          SIMON
          Yes. She always did love to dance.
          He drops to one knee, slamming his baton to the floor.

          ANGLE: THE BATON
          As the top pops off like a bouncing betty (the grenade),
          flying up over Simon and River's heads and then bursting
          forth in a flat circle of blue energy that bisects the room,
          flowing through the staff's heads and knocking them out.
          Simon rushes to River, gently removes the probes from her
          head and swabs her, whispering:

          SIMON

          (CONTINUING)
          River. Wake up. Please, it's
          Simon. River. It's your brother.
          Wake up...
          She begins to stir as a noise moves him to the door, looking
          out and removing his uniform to reveal an orderly's tunic
          beneath.

          River is suddenly next to him. He jumps a little.

          RIVER
          Simon.
          A beat, as they face each other, Simon fighting emotion.

          RIVER

          (CONTINUING)
          They know you've come.

          INT. GUARD STATION - CONTINUING

          As a guard looks at a monitor. He mostly resembles a secret
          service man -- more bureaucrat than thug. A second man rolls
          into frame on a chair behind him, also watching the screen.

          INT. RESEARCH CENTER CORRIDOR - CONTINUING

          Simon walks River through the corridor. They approach a pair
          of double doors.

          SIMON
          We can't make it to the surface
          from inside.
          Simon turns suddenly as he hears footsteps, people heading at
          them from the other side of the doors.

          But River has, impossibly, scampered up over some lab
          equipment to the dark top of the corridor, where she holds
          herself in a perfect split, feet against the walls and
          outstretched hand holding the sprinkler for support.
          The doors burst open and two doctors pass by, hardly noticing
          the lone orderly. Passing right under River.

           EXT. VENTILATION SHAFT - MOMENTS LATER

          It's small, 15 feet by 15 feet. Goes a long way up and a
          long way down. One wide hinged window looks in on the hall
          inside. Simon and River approach with quiet haste.
          They slip through the window. Simon shuts it, wedges his
          baton into the handle as the SECURITY AGENTS APPROACH. They
          fire at the glass, but their lasers have no effect.
          Wind whips River's hair about as she looks up to see a small
          patch of daylight visible ten stories up. Sees the sky
          blotted out by a small ship that hovers above them.

          ANGLE: THE SHIP is floating over the grass of rolling hills,
          the city gleaming far beyond. This facility is well hidden.
          A gurney-sized section of the ship's belly detaches and drops
          down ten stories, cables spooling it out of the ship. It
          comes to Simon and River and stops suddenly.

          SIMON
          Get on!
          He is standing by the window -- and the Security Agent is
          right behind him, PUNCHING the window with all his might.
          Simon helps River onto the gurney, then jumps on himself as
          the Security Agent cracks the glass. The two are whisked up
          in the gurney, River on her knees, Simon standing beside her
          holding one of the cables --

           THE OPERATIVE (O.S.)
          Stop.
          The action freezes.

           THE OPERATIVE (0.S.)

           (CONTINUING)
          Lovely. Lovely. Backtrack.
          The action REVERSES, taking us back to the moment of Simon
          and River on the gurney just before it rises.

          THE OPERATIVE (O.S.)

          Stop.
          There is a motionless beat, River frozen in that crouch, and
          he steps through what we now see is a hologram of the event.
          The Government's man. We'll just call him THE OPERATIVE.
          He is thoughtful, a little removed. Wire-rimmed glasses, a
          suit too nondescript to be a uniform, too neat to be casual
          wear. He is in:

          INT. INSTITUTE RECORDS ROOM - DAY

          -- which is long and bare but for drawers of holographic
          records, a set-up for watching recordings (where the image of
          Simon and River floats), and a table with computer and chair.
          The Operative crosses to the table, looks over some papers.

          graduation, security photo from his medical internship --
          over one lens of the Operative's glasses.

          Remarkable children.
          Doctor Mathias storms in, two security men (not the ones from
          the opening) and a nervous young female intern following.
          Mathias looks greyer and more gaunt than when we saw him last.

          DOCTOR MATHIAS
          Excuse me! No one is allowed in
          the records room without my
          express permission.

          THE OPERATIVE
          (over this, quietly)
          Enter the doctor.
          (to Mathias)
          Forgive me. I prefer to see the
          event alone, without bias.
          Mathias looks at the hologram -- realizes which one it is.

          DOCTOR MATHIAS
          I need to see your clearance.

          THE OPERATIVE
          You're right to insist. I know
          you've had security issues here.
          He places his hand on a screen as he says it. Mathias looks
          at the readout, and drops the bluster.

          DOCTOR MATHIAS
          Apologies. An Operative of the
          Parliament will of course have
          full cooperation.
          (looks at screen)
          I'm not sure what... I see no
          listing of rank, or name.

          THE OPERATIVE
          I have neither. Like this
          facility, I don't exist. The
          Parliament calls me in when...
          when they wish they didn't have
          to. Let's talk about the Tams.

          DOCTOR MATHIAS
          I assume you've scanned the status
          logs...

          THE OPERATIVE
          River was your greatest success.
          A prodigy -- A phenomenon. Until
          her brother walked in eight months
          ago and took her from you.

          DOCTOR MATHIAS
          It's not quite so simple.

          THE OPERATIVE
          I'm very aware of that.

          DOCTOR MATHIAS
          He came in with full creds. He
          beat the ap-scan, the retinal...
          There was no way I could --

          THE OPERATIVE
          No, no. Of course. The boy spent
          his fortune developing the
          contacts to infiltrate this place.

          DOCTOR MATHIAS
          Gave up a brilliant future in.
          medicine as well, you've probably
          read. Turned his back on his
          whole life. Madness.

          THE OPERATIVE
          Madness, no. Something a good
          deal more dangerous. Have you
          looked at this scan carefully? At
          his face?
          Mathias looks uncertain.

          THE OPERATIVE

          (CONTINUING)
          It's love, in point of fact. He
          loved his sister and he knew she
          was in pain. So he took her
          somewhere safe.

          DOCTOR MATHIAS
          Why are you here?

          THE OPERATIVE
          I'm here because the situation is
          even less simple than you think.
          (eyeing him)

          It's pride.
          He touches the computer screen and the hologramic image jumps
          to the Doctor and Simon in the lab, Mathias repeating:

          DOCTOR MATHIAS
          Key members of Parliament have
          personally observed this subject.
          I was told their support --

          Key members of Parliament. Key.
          The minds behind every diplomatic,
          military and covert operation in
          the galaxy, and you put them in a
          room with a psychic.

          DOCTOR MATHIAS
          She was... she read cards, nothing
          more.

          THE OPERATIVE
          It's come to our attention that
          River became much more unstable,
          more... disturbed, after you
          showed her off to Parliament. Did
          she see something very terrible in
          those cards?

          DOCTOR MATHIAS
          Whatever... secrets she might have
          accidentally gleaned... it's
          probable she doesn't even know she
          knows them. That they're buried
          beneath --

          THE OPERATIVE
          But they are in her. Her mind is
          unquiet. It's the will of the
          Parliament that I kill her. And
          the brother. Because of your sin.

          THE OPERATIVE
          (continuing; moving
          to his briefcase)
          You know, in certain older
          civilized cultures, when men
          failed as entirely as you have,
          they would throw themselves on
          their swords.

          DOCTOR MATHIAS
          (fed up)
          Well, unfortunately I forgot to
          bring a sword to --
          The air rings crisply as the Operative pulls out his sword.

          THE OPERATIVE
          The Parliament has no further
          interest in psychics. They
          represent a threat to the harmony
          and stability of our Alliance.

          DOCTOR MATHIAS
          I would put that down right now if
          I were you.

          THE OPERATIVE
          Would you be killed in your sleep,
          like an ailing pet? Whatever your
          failings, I believe you deserve
          better than that.
          The agents move. He slices the throat of the one behind him
          with true grace, thrusting at the second as he's pulling out
          his gun and pinning his hand. A moment, and the dying agent
          reflexively squeezes the trigger, shooting his own arm.
          The Operative pulls out the sword and the agent falls as
          quietly as the first.
          Mathias bolts but the Operative pins him to the wall. He
          bunches his fingers and jabs the side of the Doctor's spine.
          Mathias stiffens, suddenly, agonizingly immobile.
          The Operative steps back, observes the Doctor's rigid grimace
          for a moment. Almost ceremoniously, he drops to one knee and
          holds the blade out to one side, hilt to the floor and point
          tilted toward the doctor. The Doctor stares at it in horror
          as his paralyzed body begins to tip over toward it.
          The Operative turns toward the terrified intern at the door.

          triggers. We'll have to reach out
          to River Tam, and help her to come
          back to us. No matter how far out
          Simon has taken her, we can --
          He's almost startled when the Doctor's body drops into frame,
          slowed suddenly by the sword. It squeaks down the blade, the
          Doctor unable to cry out, as the Operative whispers to him:

          THE OPERATIVE

          (CONTINUING)
          This is a good death. There's no
          shame in this, in a man's death.
          A man who's done fine works.
          We're making a better world. All
          of them, better worlds.
          Mathias is dead. The Operative pulls the sword out as the
          body rolls over. As he wipes the sword down:

          THE OPERATIVE

          (CONTINUING)
          Young miss, I need you to get to

          We move away from the ship. The name is on the nose, under
          the bridge. It sticks out from the body of the ship like a
          craning neck. The body is bulbous, with propulsion engines
          on either side and a giant glowing back. There are two small
          shuttles tucked in over the 'wings' of the engines. It's not
          the sleekest ship in the 'verse, to be sure.
          As it hits atmo, the propulsion engines take over and she
          starts to rock a bit, noise filling our ears. Camera comes
          around the front, at the windows and into the bridge, to see
          the Captain, MALCOLM 'MAL' REYNOLDS, standing and watching.
          At that moment, a small piece of the nose breaks off and goes
          flying past the window.

          in one extended STEADICAM shot.]
          The bridge is small: two pilot seats on either side, and a
          tangle of wires and machinery all about.
          Mal wears the knee-length brown coat and boots of an old
          Independent. Gun at his hip. He's not unlike the ship --
          he's seen a bit of the world and it left him, emotionally at
          least, weathered. Right now, though, he's mostly startled.

          What was that?
          He's addressing the pilot, WASH. Flight gear and a hawaiian
          shirt, toy dinosaurs populating his station -- no old

          The hulking mercenary JAYNE is coming up out of his bunk as

          on bringing? You only got the two
          arms...

          JAYNE
          I just get excitable as to choice,
          like to have my options open.

          MAL
          I don't plan on any shooting
          taking place during this job.

          JAYNE
          Well, what you plan and what takes
          place ain't ever exactly been
          similar.

          MAL
          No grenades.
          (Jayne groans)
          No grenades.
          First Mate ZOE enters from the lower level. Her mode of
          dress and military deference mark her as a war buddy of Mal's.

          ZOE
          Are we crashing again?

          MAL
          Talk to your husband. Is the mule
          prepped?

          ZOE
          Good to go, sir. Just loading her
          up.
          (to Jayne)
          Are those grenades?

          JAYNE
          Cap'n doesn't want 'em.

          J

          

          

          

          

          16.

          ZOE
          We're robbing the place. We're
          not occupying it.
          All that plays in the background as we lead Mal into the:

          INT. DINING ROOM - CONTINUING

          It's the communal space of the ship, homey and messy. There
          is food left lying on the table. Mal swipes a dumpling from
          a plate, pops it in his mouth as another jolt rocks him and
          sends most of the tableware clattering to the floor.

          MAL
          (calling out)
          Kaylee!
          He enters:

          INT. AFT HALL/ENGINE ROOM - CONTINUING


          MAL
          (still calling)
          Kaylee, what in the sphincter of
          hell are you playing at?
          The hall leads to the rust-brown chaos that is the engine
          room. Working around the engine in a forest of wires, sparks
          and smoke is the sweetly pretty mechanic, KAYLEE. She passes
          Mal with a slightly impatient smile as he stands in the
          doorway, raising his voice above the din.

          MAL

          (CONTINUING)
          We got the Primary Buffer

          KAYLEE
          Everything's shiny, Cap'n. Not to
          fret.

          MAL
          You told me --

          (JOLT)
          You told me the entry couplings
          would hold for another week!

          KAYLEE

          (WORKING)
          That was six months ago, cap'n.

          MAL
          My ship don't crash. If she
          crashes, you crashed her.

          

          

          

          

          17.
          Steam and electricity shoot at him, backing him up.
          He turns to see Simon behind him. Simon is more seasoned
          than before, but still contrasts the Captain entirely in
          dress and manner. He is implacably proper. Also pissed.

          MAL

          (CONTINUING)
          Doctor. Guess I need to get
          innocked 'fore we hit planetside.
          Simon nods, the ship jolting again.

          MAL

          (CONTINUING)
          Bit of a rockety ride. Nothing to
          worry about.

          SIMON
          I'm not worried.

          MAL
          Fear is nothing to be ashamed of,
          Doc.

          SIMON
          This isn't fear. This is anger.

          MAL

          4 (LAUGHS)
          Well, it's kinda hard to tell the
          one from t'other, face like yours.

          SIMON
          I imagine if it were fear, my eyes
          would be wider.

          MAL
          I'll look for that next time.

          SIMON
          You're not taking her.

          MAL
          (brushing past him)
          No no, that's not a thing I'm
          interested in talking over with --

          SIMON
          She's not going with you. That's
          final.

          4

          

          

          

          

          18.

          MAL
          (turning back)
          I hear the words "that's final"
          come out of your mouth ever again,
          they truly will be.
          (turning away again)
          This is my boat. Y'all are guests
          on it.
          He heads down a side corridor that has steps leading down to:

          INT. PASSENGER DORM - CONTINUING

          Simon is right on his heels as we lead them down the stairs.

          SIMON
          Guests? I earn my passage,
          Captain --

          MAL
          And it's time your little sister
          learned from your fine example.

          SIMON
          I've earned my passage treating
          bullet holes, knife wounds, laser
          burns...

          MAL
          Some of our jobs are trickier than
          others --

          SIMON
          And you want to put my sister in
          the middle of that.

          MAL
          Didn't say 'want'. Said 'will'.
          It's one job, Doc. She'll be fine.
          The passenger dorm has a time-worn warmth that most of the
          ship shares. Except, of course, for the sterile blue of:

          INT. INFIRMARY - CONTINUING

          Into which the two men step.

          SIMON
          She's a seventeen year old girl.
          A mentally traumatized sevente--

          J

          

          

          

          

          19.

          MAL
          She's a reader. Sees into the
          truth of things; might see trouble
          before it's coming. Which is of
          use to me.

          SIMON
          And that's your guiding star,
          isn't it? What's of use.

          MAL

          (LAUGHS)
          Honestly, doctor, I think we may
          really crash this time anyway.
          Simon jabs the inoculation needle into Mal's arm.

          SIMON
          Do you understand what I've gone
          through to keep River away from
          the Alliance?

          MAL
          I do, and it's a fact me and mine
          have been courteous enough to keep
          to our own selves.

          SIMON
          Are you threatening to --

          MAL
          I got one purpose here: keep this
          boat in the air. I take the jobs
          I get -- which is less and less,
          case you ain't been keeping track.
          He starts away, Simon still keeping pace.

          MAL

          (CONTINUING)
          Every year since the war the
          Alliance pushes just a little
          further out towards the rim.
          Makes it a chore for naughty men
          like us to slip about -- and
          keeping you two on board means
          working twice as hard to avoid the
          law. Means turning down a score
          of honest jobs.

          J

          

          

          

          

          20.

          INT. CARGO BAY - CONTINUING

          They enter the biggest space on the ship. Giant doors sit at
          the front, which will open upon landing to reveal a lowering
          ramp. Catwalks surround the space, leading up at the front to
          the foredeck hall. We've come all the way through Serenity.

          MAL
          So here is us, on the raggedy
          edge. Don't push me and I won't
          push you. 
          Simon starts up the stairs as Mal calls to him:

          MAL

          (CONTINUING)
          Things get gritty I will keep her
          from the fray, but she's coming.
          Best you get her ready.
          As Mal walks on, we tilt up to see the Mule, a four-man
          hovercraft hanging from chains near the ceiling. Jayne and
          Zoe are tossing duffle bags into it.

          MAL

          (CONTINUING)
          Zoe, is Wash gonna straighten this
          boat out before we get flattened?

          ZOE
          Like a downy feather, sir. Nobody
          flies like my mister.
          The camera picks up Simon's feet as they enter foreground on
          the catwalk, and track with them to find:

          SIMON
          River...
          She's lying on her side, looking straight at us. A loose
          summer dress draped over her small frame.

          RIVER
          I know. We're going for a ride.

          EXT. LILAC -- DESERT GULCH - DAY

          Serenity settles gently down as the cargo bay door opens.

          INT. CARGO BAY - CONTINUING

          The chains are hoisted back up into the ceiling of the ship.
          The mule floats just above the floor, Jayne piling in next to
          River in the back:

          

          

          

          

          21.

          SIMON
          Now, River, you stay behind the
          others. If there's fighting you
          drop to the floor or run away.
          It's okay to leave them to die.
          River puts on a huge pair of goggles, looks at her brother.

          RIVER
          I'm the brains of the operation.

          ZOE
          We should hit town right during
          Sunday worship. Won't be any
          crowds.

          MAL
          If Fanty and Mingo are right about
          the payroll, this could look to be
          a sunny day for us.

          SIMON

          (APPROACHING)
          Captain, I'll ask you one last
          time...

          MAL
          Doctor, I'm taking your sister
          under my protection here. If
          anything happens to her, anything
          at all, I swear to you I will get
          very choked up. Honestly. There
          could be tears.
          He peels out, leaves Simon fuming. Kaylee sidles up to him...

          KAYLEE
          Don't mind the Captain none,
          Simon. I know he'll look out for
          her.

          SIMON
          It's amazing. I bring River all
          the way out to the raggedy edge of
          the 'verse so she can hide from
          the Alliance by robbing banks.

          KAYLEE
          It's just a little Trading
          Station. They'll be back 'fore
          you can spit.
          (as he stalks off)
          Not that you spit...

          

          

          

          

          22.
          Kaylee watches him go, a tad forlorn.

          EXT. LILAC - DAY

          We see the town sprawled before us, as the mule heads in.
          The town embodies the lives of folk out here: adobe and wood
          mix with metal and plastic -- whatever's on hand to build
          with. Right now the streets are mainly empty.

          EXT. TRADING STATION - CONTINUING

          The mule pulls up, Zoe hitching it as they speak:

          JAYNE
          What are we hoping to find here
          that equals the worth of a turd?

          MAL
          Alliance payroll. There's peace
          enforcing squads stationed all
          about this quadrant. Can't use
          credits out here -- they got to
          pay their boys in cashy money.
          Which once a month rests here.

          ZOE
          Something about stealing from the
          Alliance just warms a body like
          whiskey in winter.

          JAYNE
          (cocks his gun)
          Shiny. Let's be badguys.
          Mal turns back to River.

          MAL
          You ready to go to work, darlin'?

          RIVER
          There's no pattern to the pebbles
          here, they're completely random.
          I tried to count them but you
          drove too fast. Hummingbird.

          MAL
          (never mind)
          Right. Great. Let's go.

          INT. TRADING STATION - DAY

          We are in a camera's eye view, right above the door.

          J

          

          

          

          

          23.
          The door slams open, Mal and Jayne stride in, Zoe following
          and whipping her hogleg right at camera without looking.
          Reverse to see the camera is also a small screen with
          "Welcome to Lilac" on it for the millisecond before it's
          blown to bits.
          There's maybe fifteen people in the place: store workers,
          farm-folk and a couple dirt-poor kids. It's a combination
          post-office, general store, bank, and most other things.

          MAL
          Hands and knees and heads bowed
          down! Everybody, now!
          Two men who appear to be farm folk rush Mal and the others.
          Mal draws on the elder one and he stops dead in his tracks.
          Mal's gun is long, not unlike Civil War era issue, but very
          much new in design.
          The other tries to tackle Jayne, which is not necessarily a
          great idea. Jayne clotheslines him so hard he spins right
          upside-down -- and Jayne grabs him by the legs and CRACK! --
          bounces his head right off the floor, knocking him out cold.

          MAL

          (CONTINUING)
          Y'all wanna be looking very
          intently at your own belly
          buttons. I see a head start to
          rise, violence is gonna ensue.
          The guy who rushed Mal complies along with everyone else.
          Jayne dumps his catch on the floor and rips open his dirty
          shirt to reveal the purple of an Alliance uniform.

          JAYNE
          Looks like this is the place.
          He looks up at Mal, who motions for Zoe to open the front
          door. She does, and River steps in.
          ANGLE: RIVER'S BARE FEET -- walking slowly among the hunched-
          over customers as Mal addresses them.

          MAL
          You've probably guessed we mean to
          be thieving here, but what we are
          after is not yours. So let's have
          no undue fussing.
          As he is speaking, Jayne is scrambling to the back office,
          finding the small vault locked.

          1410

          

          

          

          

          24.

          JAYNE
          She's locked up.
          River suddenly looks around, perturbed.
          CLOSE ON: a young tough.
          River looks up at Zoe, alarmed, and silently points to the
          young man. He is slowly reaching for the weapon in his belt.
          He finds Zoe's sawed-off nuzzling his cheek.

          ZOE
          You know what the definition of a
          hero is? It's someone who gets
          other people killed. You can look
          it up later.
          He drops his weapon, slides it across the floor.
          Mal moves to the Trade Agent. Hauls him up, tosses him
          toward the vault. Zoe and Jayne follow.

          TRADE AGENT
          This is just a crop moon, don't
          think you'll find what you --

          MAL
          (in Chinese)
          140 
          The old man punches in the code. What opens is a tiny wall
          safe. Bundles of bills, some scattered coin. Unimpressive.
          Jayne and Zoe are behind the captain, peering in.

          ZOE
          At last. We can retire and give
          up this life of crime.
          Mal reaches in, pulls a lever and the floor opens, a six foot
          hole appearing, stairs leading to a corridor, all gleaming
          metal and blue light. Zoe smiles. Jayne peers down as Mal
          addresses the Trade Agent.

          MAL
          Is there a fed down there? Be
          truthful.

          TRADE AGENT

          (NODDING)
          Y'all are Browncoats, hey? Fought
          for independence?

          VJ

          

          

          

          

          25.

          MAL
          War's long done. We're all just
          folk now.
          (calls down)
          Listen up! We are coming down to
          empty that vault!
          The voice of a young Alliance GUARD comes up from below.

          GUARD (O.S.)
          You have to give me your
          authorization password!
          Jayne impatiently fires a burst of machine-gun fire down into
          the hole. A beat...

           GUARD (O . S . )

           (CONTINUING)
          Okay...
          Mal looks at Zoe and they head down into:

          INT. VAULT - CONTINUING

          Which is as modern as something off the Central Planets. A
          short corridor leads to a real vault door, that the guard is
          already opening. Behind that door, a few bags of the real
          deal: neatly stacked cash, waiting to be robbed.

          INT. TRADING STATION - CONTINUING

          We move in on River as something crosses her face. Worry.

          EXT. TOWN - DAY

          A WOMAN carrying a bucket and her nine year old SON are
          looking at the trading station a few buildings away.

          SON
          Repeater.

          WOMAN
          Did sound summat like gunblast...
          Maybe you aught run tell Lawman...
          She turns and right by her, in the shadows, is a man.
          Mostly. He is hideously disfigured, a combination of self-
          mutilation and the bubbling red of radiation poisoning. His
          clothes are rags, his eyes pinpoints of glazed madness.
          A blade blurs through frame...

          INT. TRADING STATION - CONTINUING

          River SCREAMS and flops onto her back, pinned by revelation.
          Others look at her, concerned, as Jayne makes his way to her.

          JAYNE
          What the hell is up? You all
          right? What's goin' on?
          He holds her, as she whispers, wide-eyed...

          RIVER
          Reavers.

          INT. VAULT - MOMENTS LATER

          Zoe is hauling out the last of five bags as Mal talks to the
          guard, holding his gun at him:

          MAL
          Leg's good, it'll bleed plenty and
          we avoid any necessary organs...

          GUARD
          I was thinking more of a graze..

          MAL
          Well you don't want it to look
          like you just gave up...

          JAYNE (O.S.)

          MAL!

          MAL
          (to himself)
          Every heist, he's gotta start
          yelling my name --

          JAYNE
          (barreling in)
          Mal! Reavers! The girl's
          pitchin' a fit. They're here or
          they're comin' soon.
          He is already loading up with bags as Mal thinks quickly.

          MAL
          (to Zoe and Jayne)
          Get on the mule.
          (to the guard,
          pointing to the

          VAULT)
          Does that open from the inside?

          J

          

          

          

          

          27.

          GUARD
          Whah -ah- yes...

          MAL
          You get everyone upstairs in there
          and you seal it. Long as you got
          air you don't open up, you
          understand?

          GUARD
          I -- Buh I --
          Mal is in his face, dark and huge:

          MAL

          GET THEM INSIDE THE VAULT.

          EXT. TRADING STATION - DAY

          The doors burst open, Jayne and Zoe coming out first, Mal
          behind with River in hand. She is freaked, in her own space.
          Jayne and Zoe throw the bags on --

          MAL
          Zoe take the wheel --

          JAYNE
          You see 'em? Anybody see 'em?
          1J -- and jump on themselves, Mal scanning the area as he hands
          River up to Jayne's care. As the craft powers up, slowly
          moving, the young man Zoe kept from trying to pull his weapon
          bursts out of the station, grabbing the back of the mule.

          YOUNG MAN
          Take me with you!

          MAL
          Get in the vault with the others --

          YOUNG MAN
          I can't stay here! Please!

          MAL
          It's too many. Drive, Zoe.
          A Reaver craft ROARS over their heads. It's nearly the size
          of Serenity. Torn apart, belching smoke -- a welded
          conglomeration of ruined ships, painted for war. Predator,
          pure. It disappears over the rooftops.

          YOUNG MAN

          PLEASE!

          

          

          

          

          28.

          MAL
          Drive!
          Zoe's face is set with unhappy determination as she floors
          it, shooting out and leaving the young man in the dust.
          As they move from him, four Reavers jump out of the shadows
          and grab the young man. Mal unhesitatingly draws his gun.
          He nudges a lever with his thumb and a cartridge pops back.
          Mal fires twice. The young man takes both bullets in the
          chest, slumps down dead.

          ANGLE: THE EDGE OF TOWN
          As the mule shoots past the last building, we see a skiff
          shoot out from behind the buildings of the adjacent street,
          right abreast of our gang.

          ANGLE: THE CENTER OF TOWN
          We see the church as the first ship and an even larger one
          come to hover over it, Reavers dropping down on cable lines
          to swarm into it.

          EXT. DESERT - CONTINUING

          The mule and the skiff are booking through the rocky terrain.
          The skiff swings closer, but Jayne peppers it with automatic
          fire and it swings away. There is sporadic return fire.

          JAYNE
          How come they ain't blowing us out
          of the air?

          MAL
          They wanna run us down. The up-
          close kill.
          River is squashed down on her back, being very small.

          RIVER
          They want us alive when they eat
          us.

          JAYNE
          Boy, sure would be nice if we had
          some grenades, don'tchya think?
          Mal says nothing, keeps firing.

          ZOE
          Wash, baby can you hear me?

          VO

          INT. SERENITY: BRIDGE - CONTINUING

          Wash is in a frenzy of switchflipping, prepping for take-off.

          WASH
          We're moments from air. You got
          somebody behind you?
          We intercut Wash and Zoe at this point:

          EXT. DESERT - CONTINUING


          ZOE
          Reavers.

          WASH

          (BLANCHING)
          

          ZOE
          We're not gonna reach you in time.

          WASH
          Just keep moving, honey. We're
          coming to you.

          EXT. SERENITY - CONTINUING

          As she lifts off and starts heading toward the others.

          EXT. DESERT - CONTINUING

          Zoe gets the mule in front but a harpoon thwinngs through the
          air from the skiff and S} NK! Goes through Jayne's leg.. The
          harpoon grips the leg and pulls --
          Jayne goes flying off the back of the Mule, Mal just grabbing
          him as the harpoon line reels slowly tighter --

          MAL
          Grab on!
          Jayne grabs the Mule, legs dangling, pulled out between the
          two vessels as Mal slams a new cartridge into his pistol.

          JAYNE
          I won't get et! You shoot me if
          they take me!
          Mal steadies himself and takes aim, seemingly at Jayne --

          JAYNE

          (CONTINUING)
          Well don't shoot me first!

          J

          

          

          

          

          30.
          Mal fires. Again. Steadies himself for one more...
          The line holding the harpoon is split by Mal's third shot.

          V0V
          The mule surges forward as Jayne drags on the ground. Mal
          hauls him in as River bounds into the front to make room.

          JAYNE

          (CONTINUING)
          Rutting pigs! Where's --
          And River is holding out his weapon before he can ask for it.

          EXT. ANOTHER PART OF THE DESERT - CONTINUING

          Serenity rushes across the desert floor, not much higher off
          it than the smaller crafts.

          WASH
          (to Zoe)
          Get some distance on 'em. You come
          to the flats, I want you to swing
          round. Gonna try a Barn Swallow.

          INT. BRIDGE - CONTINUING

           Wash hits the com.

           WASH
          J Simon! Open the loading dock!

          INT. CARGO BAY - CONTINUING

          Simon moves next to the huge sliding doors at the front, hits
          a couple of buttons. The doors pull open, as the huge ramp
          beyond them opens down, letting in a rush of wind and light.

          EXT. DESERT - CONTINUING

          The mule reaches the flats, away from the rocks.

          WASH (O.S.)
          (in Zoe's ear)
          Okay, baby, we've talked this
          through...

          ZOE
          Talkin' ain't doin'.
          She throws the wheel and the mule comes hard about,
          fishtailing slightly as it faces the oncoming skiff.

          WASH (O.S.)
          Don't slow down!

          ANGLE: THE SKIFF
          As it heads for the mule --

          ANGLE: THE MULE
          As it heads for the skiff -- and Serenity swoops down out of
           the sky, bay doors open, and comes right up behind it -- The
          Mule swallowed by the bigger ship --

          INT. CARGO BAY - CONTINUING

           And only its forward momentum keeps it from being squashed as
           it flies backwards into the bay, narrowly missing Simon and
           smashing back into the staircase, sparks and people flying --

          EXT. DESERT - CONTINUING

          Serenity tries to get altitude -- but slams right into the
          oncoming skiff, tearing it apart --

          INT. CARGO BAY - CONTINUING

          A flaming portion of the top flies in, skids to the floor as
          small fires erupt from the mule as well -- Simon pulls a
          lever and jets of C02 shoot out of the floor.
          Simon hits the button to start the outer ramp closing, then
          runs to the mule. The C02 stops and he finds River sitting
          in her seat, completely unharmed. Zoe is climbing painfully
          out of the other seat, Mal and Jayne both having been thrown.

          SIMON
          River?

          RIVER
          I swallowed a bug.
          Kaylee runs in to see how everyone is. She goes to Simon.

          KAYLEE
          Are you okay?

          MAL
          Is he okay?
          A bloodied Reaver POPS into frame from under the skiff-top.
           He lunges for Mal, baring sharpened teeth --
           Mal spins and draws, fires into his belly as Jayne and Zoe
           both fire at the same time. The freak takes too long to go
           down, but down he goes. Dies sitting against the s i op.
          4 Everybody takes a moment to look at each other.

          Hello?

          First thing, I want these bod --
          Simon suddenly punches him in the face, causing Mal to
          stumble back, and Simon to shake his hand in pain.

          MAL

          You stupid, selfish, son of a

          I'm a hair's breadth from riddling
          you with holes, Doctor --

          SIMON
          "One simple job! She'll be fine!"

          MAL
          She IS fine! Except for bein'
          still crazy, she's the picture of
          health!

          ZOE
          Wasn't for River, we'd probably be
          left there. She felt 'em coming.

          giving orders on my boat.

          SIMON
          Well sleep easy 'cause we're off
          your boat. Just as soon as River
          gets her share of the "bounty".

          KAYLEE
          Well let's not do anything hasty...

          MAL
          No, shiny! I'm sick a' carrying
          tourists anyhow. We'll be on
          Beaumonde in ten hours time, you
          can pick up your earnings and be
          on your merry. Meantime you do
          your job. Patch up my crew.
          A beat.

          RIVER
          He didn't lie down. They never
          lie down.
          She is looking at the Reaver. Everyone does, for a moment.

          Mal and Zoe enter from below.

          ZOE
          No, I think things'll glide a deal
          smoother for us without River and
          Simon on board... but how long do
          you think they'll last?

          MAL
          Doc made his call. They's as
          babes in a basket when we took 'em
          in; we sheltered 'em plenty. Man
          has to cut loose, learn to stand
          on his own.

          Like that man back in town?
          They stop by Mal Is room.

          begging us to bring him along...
          vo,

          MAL
          We couldn't take the weight.
          Woulda slowed us down.

          ZOE
          You know that for certain

          MAL
          Mule won't run with five. I

          Or Jayne?

          (CONSIDERING)
          Well, Jayne...

          ZOE
          Coulda tossed the payload.

          MAL
          And go to Fanty and Mingo with air
          in our mitts, tell 'em "here's
          your share"? They'd set the dogs
          on us in the space of a twitch,
          and there we are back in mortal
          peril. We get a job, we gotta
          vo make good.
          Washenters from the bridge.

          ZOE
          Sir, I don't disagree on any
          particular point, it's just... in
          the time of war, we woulda never
          left a man stranded.

          MAL
          Maybe that's why we lost.
          She's not happy with the reply. Mal climbs down to his room
          as Wash reaches Zoe, slides his arms around her.

          INT. MAL'S ROOM - CONTINUING

          Once alone, Mal lets his own disappointment show. He pulls
          off his holster and drops it over a chair. Kicks the toilet
          closed and sits on his bunk.
          The place resembles a submarine cabin, with charts and
          clutter, ancient maps on the walls.

          INT. INARA'S SHUTTLE

          We're close on a beautiful woman who looks at us with amused
          exasperation. Behind her is an opulently dressed little
          shuttle.

          INARA
          Kaylee, are you ever gonna put
          that capture down?

          KAYLEE (0.5.)
          We gotta have records of
          everything. A bona fide Companion
          entertained clients on this very
          ship! In this very bed!
          The picture pans over to the bed -- which River is bending
          over and sniffing curiously. Inara is packing things up.

          KAYLEE (O.S.)

          (CONTINUING)
          For one sweet second, we was
          almost classy.

          INARA
          4 You promised to help me pack.

           KAYLEE (O.S.)
          Honest, Inara, why do you have to
          leave?
          Inara shoots an uncertain look at the camera -- and the
          picture freezes, goes back to the beginning.
          During all this, Mal has picked it up. He looks at it a
          moment, tosses it aside. Looks around at nothing much.

          JAYNE (V.0.)
          I do not get it. How's a guy get
          so wrong?

          INT. CARGO BAY - LATER

          We see the doors in the floor slide open, a second set below.
          Pan to see, for a moment, the dead Reaver's face.
          Kaylee is opening the doors with a keypad on a cable. Jayne
          drags the corpse closer to the doors as he continues:

          JAYNE
          Ain't logical. Cuttin' on his own
          face, rapin' and murdering -- I
          mean, I'll kill a man in a fair
          fight... or if I think he's gonna
          start a fair fight, or if he
          bothers me, or if there's a woman,
          or I'm gettin' paid -- mostly only
          when I'm gettin' paid. But these
          Reavers... last ten years they
          just show up like the boageyman
          from stories. Eating people
          alive? Where does that get fun?
          He dumps the body in, she starts the doors closing.

          Shepherd Book said they was men
          that reached the edge of space.,
          saw a vasty nothingness and just
          went bibbledy over it.

          JAYNE
          Hell, I been to the edge. Just
          looked like more space.

          KAYLEE
          I don't know. People get awful
          lonely in the black. Like to get
          addlepated ourselves, we stay on
          this boat much longer. Captain'll
          drive us all off, one by one.

          JAYNE
          You're just in a whinge cuz that
          prissy doc is finally
          disembarking. Me I says good
          riddance. He never belonged here,
          and his sister's no saner than one
          of them Reavers.

          KAYLEE
          That ain't even so! River's a
          dear heart and a boon to this
          crew! You just don't like her
          'cause she can read your mind and
          everything you think is mean.

          JAYNE
          Well, there is that.

          J

          

          

          

          

          37.

          KAYLEE
          Her and Simon could have a place
          here. Now they're leaving us.
          Just like Shepherd Book.
          She looks up toward one of the shuttles.

          KAYLEE

          (CONTINUING)
          Just like Inara...

          INT. COMPANION TRAINING HOUSE - DAY

          And here she is, moving back and down into frame, her eyes
          half closed in passion. She settles on a cluster of brocaded
          pillows, and we see another head lowering in for a kiss...
          Come around to see it's another lovely young woman -- and
          that there is a group of ten others watching intently, all in
          saris, on their knees. Two handsome young men with shaved
          heads in the back, also on their knees.
          Inara stops before the kiss, smiling and coming back up. She
          speaks to the girls (We hear only soft music) as she
          repositions the one she's with, lowering again; showing her
          the motion of surrender as if it were a dance step.

          A WOMAN'S VOICE (V.0.)
          They love you.

          410

          EXT. COMPANION TRAINING HOUSE - DUSK

          Inara looks out at the mountains. The space she's in
          resembles a Tibetan monastery, if slightly more opulent.
          Widen to see she is with SHEYDRA, a somewhat older Companion,
          the woman whose voice we heard. She hands Inara a drink.

          SHEYDRA
          The girls. They've learned more
          from you these last months than
          the rest of us could show them in
          two years.

          INARA
          They're very sweet. But they're
          not Companions.

          SHEYDRA

          (WRYLY)
          You've no hope for them? Junk the
          lot, start anew?

          J

          

          

          

          

          38.

          INARA
          On Sihnon we started training at
          twelve. Years of discipline and
          preparation before the physical
          act of pleasure was even
          mentioned. Most of these girls --

          SHEYDRA
          They're all of good family, the
          highest academic standards --

          INARA
          Control. Was the first lesson.
          And the last and these worlds are
          not like the Central Planets.
          There is barbarism dressed up in
          the most civil weeds. Men of the
          highest rank who don't know the
          difference between a Companion and
          a common whore. It's unsafe.

          SHEYDRA
          All the more reason the girls look
          to you. You came out here alone,
          before the Alliance ever thought
          to establish a House this remote.
          You've seen so much. You're a
          figure of great romance to them.
          4d INARA
          Great romance has nothing to do
          with being a Companion, Sheydra.
          You should know better.

          SHEYDRA
          I'm not the one who had a torrid
          affair with a pirate.
          Inara nearly spills her drink.

          INARA
          A who? With a what?

          SHEYDRA

          (SMILING)
          It's the talk of the House. The
          girls all trade stories in the
          dorms at night.

          INARA
          I didn't... have a pirate...

          J

          

          

          

          

          39.

          SHEYDRA
          In one of the stories you make
          love in a burning temple. I think
          that's my favorite.

          INARA

          (SITTING)
          This is unbearable. Captain
          Reynolds is no pirate; he's a
          petty thief. And he never laid a
          finger on me. All he ever did was
          rent me a shuttle and be very
          annoying.
          (mutters in Chinese)
          

          SHEYDRA
          A year on his shuttle and he never
          laid a finger on you. No wonder
          you left.

          INARA

          (BRIDLING)
          I left because -- go away. We're
          no longer friends. You're a
          stranger to me now.

          SHEYDRA
          104 I do love to watch you boil.
          Don't worry. The stories will
          fade. And your Captain Reynolds
          has probably gotten himself blown
          up by this time.

          INARA
          (looking away again)
          Yes. That would be just like him.

          EXT. BEAUMONDE: ATOLL PLAZA - EVENING

          Serenity touches down on the crowded atoll amidst a number of
          other, equally disreputable ships. The place is filled with
          every kind of immigrant culture and shop imaginable.

          EXT./INT. SERENITY - EVENING

           The ramp is open and everyone is filing out, ready to hit the
           town. Kaylee is talking to Simon, who has River in hand.

           KAYLEE
           Don't talk to the barkers -- only
           the captains.

          (MORE)

          

          

          

          

          40.
           KAYLEE (cont'd)
           You look the captain in the eye,
           know who you're dealing with.

          40 SIMON
          â¢ I wish there was...
          Since he doesn't know what to say, she rattles on:

          KAYLEE
          You shouldn't aughta be so clean.
          It's a dead giveaway you don't
          belong, you always gotta be tidy.
          Don't pay anybody in advance. And
          don't ride in anything with a
          Capissen 38 engine, they fall
          right out of the sky.

          SIMON
          Kaylee.
          She turns and heads off. Simon starts in the other
          direction, but River looks after her and the others.

          SIMON

          (CONTINUING)
          River... do you want to stay with
          them?

          4 RIVER
          It's not safe.

          SIMON
          No, I fear it's not safe anymore.
          He's heading off and doesn't hear:

          RIVER
          For them.

          INT. THE MAIDENHEAD - CONTINUING

          We start on a CorVue screen, showing a news report. On the
          screen is a shot of the town our gang robbed, now half of it
          a smoking ruin.

          NEWSPERSON (V.O.)
          that it was a band of Reavers
          remains unconfirmed. The only
          survivors of the massacre
          apparently locked themselves in
          the Trade Station vault until --

          40

          

          

          

          

          41.
          During this we come around to see that the screen has a
          blinking light behind it, come THROUGH the wiring of the back
          to look out at the bar, with the word "recording" in the
          corner. Every screen is a camera, even down here.

          40
          We pick up Mal and Kaylee heading down into the bar. Cutting
          away from the camera's view, we can looks two stories
          straight down as they go, to a close group of dark tables and
          booths and a second screen playing in the corner.

          MAL
          It's not my fault the Doc's got no
          stomach for Rim living --

          KAYLEE
          It is entirely and for all your
          fault! If you'd given Simon a
          moment, just a moment where he
          didn't think you were gonna throw
          them off or turn them in, he
          might've --

          MAL
          What? Swept you into his cleanly
          arms? Made tidy love to you?
          They have reached the guncheck, where Jayne and Wash have
          already checked their guns. It works like a lunch automat:
          Mal sticks his gun in a drawer, pulls out a chit -- the
          q0 drawer closes and rotates, revealing another empty one. A
          large bouncer with a shockrod watches impassively.

          KAYLEE
          (as they continue

          DOWN)
          Don't you dare joke! You know how
          much I pined on Simon. And him
          fair sweet on me, I well believe,
          but he's so worried about being
          found out --

          ZOE
          Captain didn't make 'em fugitives.

          KAYLEE
          But he coulda made 'em family!
          Steada driving them off. Steada
          keeping Simon from seein' I was
          there, when I carried such a torch
          and we coulda -- goin' on a year
          now I ain't had nothin' twixt my
          nethers weren't run on batteries!

          40

          

          

          

          

          42.

          MAL
          Oh god! I can't know that!

          JAYNE
          40 I could stand to hear a little
          more...

          KAYLEE
          If you had a care for anybody's
          heart you woulda --

          MAL

          (ENOUGH)
          You knew he was gonna leave. We
          never been but a way station to
          those two. And how do you know
          what he feels? He's got River to
          worry on but he still coulda shown
          you... if I truly wanted someone
          bad enough, wouldn't be a thing in
          the 'verse could stop me from
          going to her.

          KAYLEE
          Tell that to Inara.
          For a moment, Mal is too shocked to react. Kaylee storms out.

          MINGO
          4 Domestic troubles?
          MINGO is young, tough -- somewhere between a gangster and a
          fur-trader. Sounds lower-class British, or something like it.

          FANTY
          Domestic troubles?
          FANTY moves out from behind Mingo to reveal that he is
          Mingo's identical twin. Apart from slight differences in
          dress, they are indistinguishable.

          MINGO
          'Cause we don't wanna interrupt.

          FANTY
          A man should keep his house in
          order.

          MAL
          (greets them each)
          Mingo. Fanty.

          14

          

          

          

          

          43.

          MINGO
          (pointing at his

          BROTHER)
          He's Mingo.
          ,do

          MAL
          He's Fanty. You're Mingo.

          MINGO
          Ghahh! How is it you always know?

          MAL
          Fanty's prettier.
          (pulling out a chair)
          Feel to do some business?

          MINGO
          (re: Mal Is gang)
          Bit crowded, isn't it? As you
          see, we come unencumbered by thugs.

          MAL
          Which means at least four of the
          guys already in here are yours.
          All's one. I'll just keep Jayne
          with me.

          ZOE
           Sir, are you sure you don't --

          4

          MAL
          Go. Go get yourselves a nice
          romantic meal.

          WASH
          Those are my two favorite words!
          (to Zoe)
          Honey... "Meal..."

          MAL
          (to Zoe)
          It's business. We're fine.
          They leave and the four remaining men sit. Fanty tosses a
          few coins to a saloon-girl, who does a little fan-dance...
          ANGLE: THE CORVUE CAMERA'S POV of the men is conveniently
          blocked by her little dance.
          Mal's foot nudges a duffel bag of money to Mingo's foot.

          MINGO
          Quite a crew you've got.

          4

          

          

          

          

          44.

          MAL
          Yeah, they're a fine bunch of
          ruebens.

          MINGO
          How you keep them on that crap
          boat is the subject of much musing
          tween me and Fanty.

          FANTY
          We go on and on.

          MAL
          So I'm noticing. Is there a
          problem I don't know of? You got
          25% of a sweet take kissing your
          foot, how come we're not
          dispersing?

          FANTY
          Our end is forty, precious.

          JAYNE
          My muscular buttocks it's forty --

          MINGO
          It is as of now. Find anyone
          around going cheaper.

          J FANTY
          Find anyone around going near a
          sorry lot like you in the first
          instance.
          ANGLE: RIVER has entered, is looking about.
          Jayne sees her, nudges Mal, who looks and turns back to
          business. We stay on her as she wanders around the perimeter
          of the bar, vaguely listening in on Mal's deal.

          FANTY

          (CONTINUING)
          You're unlikable, Mal. You got no
          respect for us above you, you got
          enemies in every quadrant, and
          your ship's older than the
          starting point of time. You's
          charity cases to such as us.

          

          

          

          

          45.

          MAL
          Well here's a foul thought. I
          conjured you two were incompetent;
          sent us out not knowing there were
          V0 Reavers about. Now I'm thinking
          you picked us out because you did.

          MINGO
          That were a sign of faith, boy.
          And it doesn't affect our forty
          per. Danger is, after all, your
          business.

          JAYNE
          Reavers ain't business, double
          dickless.
          This is all background noise to River, who has moved to the
          CV screen, on which is a commercial. It's animated, goofy,
          cartoon animals and anime-style Asian girls all transforming
          to insane fantasy figures as they sing about:

          COMMERCIAL

          FRUITY OATY BARS, POW! HEY! FRUITY

          BARS, MAKE A MAN OF A MOUSE, MAKE

          YOU BUST OUT YOUR BLOUSE, EAT THEM

          NOW, BANG! PING! ZOW! -- TRY

          FRUITY, OATY BARS.
          We push in, the light from the CV on River's face, pushing to
          EXTREME CLOSE UP, all noise but the jingle fading out,
          finally that as well, just the hum in River's ears.
          And she whispers:

          RIVER
          Miranda.
          She turns and looks back at the crowd.
          What happens next happens very fast.
           She strides silently to the first table -- two men drinking
          quietly -- and she slams her foot into one's face, then whips
           it back into the other's, knocking them both unconscious as --
           people are turning, just registering that this girl --
          kicks the table into a card player even as she sweeps a
          bottle off it behind her -- the bottle hits a man behind her
          square in the face, a man she never even looked at -- people
          are rising, fleeing or pushing forward --

          V0

          

          

          

          

          46.

          MAL
          River...

          JAYNE
          V0 Whuhuh?
          She's taking out a group of four, high kicks and perfect
          precision -- Two men come from either side, one whipping out
          a knife -- she does a perfect split, grabs his wrist above
          her head, using his momentum to stab the other one --
          Mal fights to get back to the gunrack. The bouncer reaches
          her and she wrests his shockrod from him, uses it on him, on
          Fanty and Mingo -- the fan-dancer is bolting and River hurls
          the rod at her head, knocks her cold...
          She's everywhere. On tables, chairs, under your legs, using
          the room itself to take out every single person there. One
          man hides behind a wall -- impossibly, she swings her leg
          around the corner and nails his face.
          Jayne grabs her from behind --

          JAYNE

          (CONTINUING)
          Gorrammit, girl, it's me!
          She grabs his crotch and squeezes -- his grip loosens and she
          spins, facing him, and flat-heels his nose with her palm,
          V0 twirling into a gut kick that doubles him over, dispatching
           of another while she cracks Jayne's head with a small table --
          Somebody pulls a gun and she snaps his elbow, causing him to
          scream out even before he shoots himself in the gut --
          Mal frantically wrests a gun from the vending locker as River
          knocks the other guy's gun in the air, kicks someone else and
          then catches it, whips it around just as Mal comes up with
          his, they are pointed right at each other --

          SIMON
          Eta Kooram Nah Smech!
          And River drops to the ground, fast asleep.
          There is a beat. Mal looks around the bar. He and Simon,
          who has run up to the entrance, are the only ones standing.
          He looks down at River. She lies unconscious, helpless.

          MAL
          I think maybe we ought to leave.

           We see two sleek warships glide silently into frame, followed
           by a third, bigger ship. This is the operative's vessel, and
          10 it is everything Serenity is not: sleek, predatory, icy cool.

          The operative is looking at the Maidenhead security feed --
          and River is staring right at him.

          THE OPERATIVE

          (CAPTIVATED)
          Hello again. Yes, it's me. I'm
          glad you've finally asked for me.
          An Ensign is revealed looking at a separate monitor:

          ENSIGN

          carrying her out is Malcolm
          Reynolds, captains a Firefly-class

          He looks over at the Ensign with a small, strange smile on
          his lips -- as his glasses are covered by text.

          ENSIGN
          Sir?

          THE OPERATIVE
          Serenity Valley. Bloodiest battle
          of the entire war. The
          Independents held the valley for
          seven weeks, two of them after
          their high command had
          surrendered. 68% casualty rate.

          River is still asleep, Mal finishing chaining her wrists.
          She lies on her side, breathing evenly.
          Mal stares at her a moment, then:

          He exits to find the whole group waiting for him, sans Wash.

          SIMON
          May I see her?

          MAL
          She's still napping just now. And

          Start with the part where Jayne

          ZOE
          Do we know if anyone was killed?

          It's likely. I know she meant to

          You feel to elaborate on what that

          Simon looks at Kaylee, the truth of Mal's words hitting him.

          SIMON
          I thought she was getting better.

          JAYNE
          And I thought they was gettin' off!

          Mal looks at Jayne, at all of them. Doesn't have an answer.

          Mal steps aside. Simon enters the locker.

          JAYNE
          She goes woolly again, we're gonna
          have to put a bullet to her.

          The camera swoops in at a sparking ion cloud, then through

          communications complex. Giant satellite dishes everywhere.

          Inside, we find an unkempt young man. Also sleep-deprived,

          is alone but for his mannikin-like Love-bot, Lenore.
          He's surrounded by screens, computers, feeds -- machinery
          that looks both ultra-modern and long neglected. All the
          screens play different images -- it's a mediaverse.

          As he watches the security feed of River's fight his image
          becomes a vidscreen. He's addressing Wash, Mal and Zoe.

          Whose death?
          And she starts laughing. Quietly at first, then louder, then
          almost uncontrollably, screaming in his face:

          INT. CAVE - DAY

          It's pitch black here, til Serenity's lights throw a hard
          relief on the rocky wall. She flies in after, slow and
          steady, revealing herself to be in a huge mineshaft.

          ANGLE: THE RAMP lowers to reveal Shepherd BOOK, a working-
          class preacher and former crew member. He smiles as they

          EXT. MINING CAMP - DAY

          We see the camp: a few shacks and a working mine, as our
          group come down to it, greeted by a few miners, including an
          eight year old boy that rushes to Kaylee...
          ANGLE ON: A CANNON mounted at the edge of town. The guy
          manning it sees them arrive, also goes to greet them.

          We see the gang sitting and eating. Comfortable, even
          laughing a bit. Jayne presents Book with a couple of cigars.
          Kaylee hoists the boy on her lap.

          BOOK (O.S. )

          Inara stands waiting, her back to us, in front of the very
          vista we first saw her before.

          The Teacher from the very beginning is standing in front of
          River, whose desktop screen depicts a single, dark planet.

          TEACHER
          River?
          Eight-year-old River is working away, not paying attention.

          TEACHER

          River, you look tired. I think
          everybody's a little tired by now;
          why don't we all lie down.
          River looks up, scared. All the other children wordlessly
          get up from their seats and lie on the floor next to them.

          A little peace and quiet will make

          MAL
          You could use a gun hand?

          INARA
          I'm hoping not. But if you were
          close at all, you -- the crew --
          could take your ease here a
          while... and there'd be payment...

          MAL
          Payment is never not a factor. I
          could sound out the crew... This
          pot like to boil over soon?

          Soon. Not right away.

          MAL
          Well, it would be, I mean I would

          your stuff in a trunk, never did

          The room is sparsely lush -- not as opulent as the shuttle
          where she entertained men, but still beautifully furnished
          and draped. A lace curtain hangs in front of the light,
          casting its pattern in shadow over everything. Including the

          68.

          MAL
          Way I remember it, albatross was
          a ship's good luck... til some
          idiot killed it.
          (to Inara)
          Yes, I've read a poem. Try not to
          faint.
          The Operative moves further into the room. Whenever he
          moves, Mal counters.

          THE OPERATIVE
          I've seen your war record. I know
          how you must feel about the
          Alliance.

          MAL
          You really don't.

          THE OPERATIVE
          Fair to say. But I have to hope
          you understand you can't beat us.

          MAL
          I got no need to beat you. I just
          wanna go my way.

          THE OPERATIVE
          And you can do that, once you let
          me take the girl back home. Give
          me the opportunity to help you.

          MAL
          All I gotta do is let you take one
          more thing away from me. I've had
          a lot of things taken in my time.
          And it may just be that this is
          one too many.

          THE OPERATIVE
          This psychotic, potentially
          murderous girl who can't have the
          slightest awareness of your
          protection. This is where you
          "draw the line".

          MAL
          Well I'm a whimsical soul.

          THE OPERATIVE
          There's a number of lives that
          hang in the balance here. Lives
          under your care. Are they as
          whimsical as yourself?

          

          

          

          

          69.

          MAL
          I got no notion that I'm being
          heroical at all. Any more than I
          think you're really just a
          harmless bureaucrat come to help
          me out. You move like a killer.
          The Operative is stopped by this. Unhappily, he continues:

          THE OPERATIVE
          I have a warship in deep orbit,
          Captain. We locked on to
          Serenity's pulse beacon the moment
          you hit atmo. I can speak a word
          and send a missile to that exact
          location inside of three minutes.
          Mal pulls a small device, clipped wires sticking out all
          around it, and tosses it to the Operative.

          MAL
          You do that, best make peace with
          your dear and fluffy lord.

          THE OPERATIVE
          Pulse beacon.

          MAL
          Advice from an old tracker: you
          J wanna find someone, use your eyes.

          THE OPERATIVE
          How long do you think you can
          really run from us?

          MAL
          Oh, a jack-rabbit, me. 'Sides, I
          never credited the Alliance with
          an over-abundance of brains. And
          if you're the best they got...

          THE OPERATIVE
          Captain Reynolds, I should tell
          you so that you don't waste your
          time: You can't make me angry.

          INARA
          Oh please. Spend an hour with him.
          Mal smiles -- then glares at Inara, mouthing "Hey!"

          

          

          

          

          70.

          THE OPERATIVE
          I need her, Captain. River is...
          my purpose and I will gather her
          to me. The brother as well.
          Whatever else happens is
          incidental. In the greater scheme.

          MAL
          Why is it that the greater scheme
          always makes everything not that
          great?

          THE OPERATIVE
          I want to resolve this like
          civilized men. I'm not
          threatening you. I'm unarmed.

          MAL
          Great!
          He draws and shoots the Operative in the chest. The
          Operative goes down as Mal grabs Inara, moves for the-doorway.
          The Operative is on him in a second, choke-hold from behind.

          THE OPERATIVE
          I am of course wearing full body
          armor. I'm not a moron.
          He tosses Mal hard against a wall, spinning and blocking a
          blow from Inara -- she is clearly trained in martial arts,
          but he flat-heels her to the ground within seconds.
          Mal is going for his gun again, turning, and the Operative
          kicks him in the face, sends him back, gun flying. Mal gets
          to his feet and they square off. Mal breathing hard, nose
          dripping blood. The Operative perfectly poised, waiting.

          MAL
          No back up? We're making an awful
          ruckus...

          THE OPERATIVE
          They'll come when they're needed.

          MAL
          I'd start whistling.

          THE OPERATIVE
          Captain, what do you think is
          going to happen here?
          They come at each other. The Operative is the much better
          trained -- he's fluid, his blows sparse and deadly.

          40

          

          

          

          

          71.
          Mal is more bluster and determination, and the operative's
          precision is wearing Mal down.
          Mal punches wild -- the Operative counters with a spin-kick
          V0 to the head that sends Mal to the ground not far from Inara,
          breathing hard. He tries to rise again, painfully, but Inara
          places her hand on his arm.
          The Operative goes to his briefcase by the door, pulls out
          his sword. His face has taken on that remote kind of
          fascination as he looks at it.

          THE OPERATIVE

          (CONTINUING)
          Nothing here is what it seems.

          INARA
          I know.

          THE OPERATIVE
          He's not the plucky hero. The
          Alliance isn't some evil empire.
          This isn't the grand arena.

          INARA
          And that's not incense.
          He turns to look: the incense stick burns away -- rather like
          a fuse -- and FLASHES in an explosion of light and sound.

          40
          It's a flash-bomb: The Operative sails back as everything
          goes smoky white and the sound dies to a tiny buzz.
          The Operative tries to get his bearings -- and four armored
          soldiers are in his face, asking him for orders... Mal and
          Inara are gone. He motions for the men to follow them.

          THE OPERATIVE
          Just a flash bomb. Go! Go!

          INT. COMPANION TRAINING HOUSE - CONTINUING

          Inara leads Mal (who is reholstering his gun) down some steps
          and along a corridor. The sound is still tinny and weird.

          MAL
          .I had him...

          INARA
          What?

          MAL
          (deafly loud)
          I think that I was winning!

          EXT. SIDE OF MOUNTAIN, BY MAL'S SHUTTLE - DAY

          Mal and Inara move quickly down the mountain. They look to
          see that Mal's shuttle has four Alliance guards waiting by
          V0 it. Mal ducks back out of sight, pulls a fancy-looking
          grenade out of his pocket. Pops the top and hurls it over at
          the foursome.
          CLOSE ON: THE GRENADE, as a series of bars of light go out
          one by one, counting down --

          ALLIANCE SOLDIER
          Grenade!
          Everybody dives for cover. The moment they do, Mal and Inara
          race into the shuttle, Mal sweeping up the grenade just as
          the last light goes out and nothing happens.
          One soldier turns to look and Mal shoots him back down as the
          door shuts on him and Inara.

          INT. SHUTTLE - CONTINUING

          Inara pushes into the pilot's seat.

          INARA
          Hang on to something.

          MAL
          4 You sure you remember how it --
          He nearly falls over as:

          EXT. MOUNTAIN RANGE - CONTINUING

          The shuttle shoots straight up, spinning and heading out.

          INT. SHUTTLE - CONTINUING

          Inara stares straight ahead, relaxing her grip on the
          controls. Mal is gone.

          INARA
          I told you to hang on.

          MAL (O.S. )
          (in great pain)
          I'm fine...

          EXT. SPACE - LATER

          We are below Serenity as her bay doors are closing, six
          little objects floating out of her belly like roe.

          4

          

          

          

          

          73.
          These objects are roughly the size of pony-kegs, and clearly
          home-made, parts welded together almost haphazardly. They
          all spark silently to life -- and shoot off in six different
          directions, as Serenity herself fires up her Firefly effect
          and burns away from us.

          INT. COMPANION TRAINING HOUSE - DAY

          The Operative sips tea and rubs his temple.

          THE OPERATIVE
          (into a com)
          Forget the pulse beacon, there has
          to be another way to track the
          ship -- get a read on the nav sat.
           It's a registered transport, you
           must be able to locate --

           ENSIGN (O.S.)
          Sir?

          THE OPERATIVE
          Have you found a nav sat
          trajectory?

          ENSIGN (O.S.)
          Sir... we've found seven.
          The Operative looks more unhappy than angry.

          THE OPERATIVE
          (to himself)
          Does he think this is a game?

          EXT. CLASSROOM - DAY

          The teacher and students sleep as River -- as we saw her in
          the institute, older, with blood seeping from the needle-
          holes in her head -- makes her way through them.
          Slowly she walks to the floating lecture screen. On it is
          the solar system, glowing lines connecting all the stars and
          planets. She becomes wide-eyed, breathing hard as it pushes
          in to one system, one planet...
          She looks over to one side of the tent, and we see:

          INT. LAB - CONTINUING

          Her POV is of the lab. There stand some five older men in
          formal dress. They stare at her, impassive.
          We see flashes of corpses, lying in houses, in city
          streets -- and a Reaver's screaming face --

          .00

          

          

          

          

          74.

          INT. STORAGE LOCKER - DAY

          And River awakens. A moment to get her bearings, then her
          eyes narrow with intent.

          INARA (V.0.)
          We have every reason to be afraid.

          INT. PASSENGER DORM - CONTINUING


          JAYNE
          Why, 'cause this guy beat up Mal?
          That ain't so hard --

          MAL
          He didn't beat me up --

          INARA
          Because he's a believer.

          INT. THE OPERATIVE'S SHIP, A DARK CABIN

          As Inara continues, we see: Fanty and Mingo, tied to chairs.
          Light spills onto their bruised faces as the Operative enters.

          INARA (V.0.)
          He's intelligent, methodical and
          devout in his belief that killing
          River is the right thing to do.

          INT. PASSENGER DORM - CONTINUING


          INARA
          I honestly think the only reason
          we haven't been blown out of the
          air is that he needs to see her.

          SIMON
          Needs to see her why?

          INARA
          I'm uncertain. I would say to be
          sure of the kill, but... I just
          know he'll kill us all to get to
          her.

          JAYNE
          So no hope of a reward, huh?

          ZOE
          Did he mention a deal of any kind?

          IWO

          

          

          

          

          75.

          MAL
          (looking at Simon)
          Give the two of them up. Go my
          way.

          JAYNE
          Which you was all ready to do not
          a day ago. What went sour?

          MAL
          Cutting them loose ain't the same
          as handing them over.

          JAYNE
          That so? 'Cause the corpse I'm
          about to become is having trouble
          telling the difference.

          SIMON
          (to Inara)
          Did he say anything about a
          "Miranda"?

          INARA
          What is that?

          MAL
          Don't know who or what, but it's
          on River's mind. Conjure it might
          be the reason he's after her.

          INARA
          You think maybe it poses some kind
          of threat to the Alliance?

          WASH
          Do we care? Are we caring about
          that?

          JAYNE
          You dumbass hogs, the only people
          she's a threat to is us on this
          boat!

          INT. STORAGE LOCKER - CONTINUING

          River is near the ceiling, keeping herself up in a split
          again, feet against the walls. There is a wire mesh cover to
          the light, and she has bent part of it out, is working it
          inside the lock of her shackles.

          Look, we get back to Haven in a
          'r/ few hours time --

          JAYNE
          Hiding under the Shepherd's
          skirts, that's a manful scheme --

          MAL
          You wanna run this ship?

          JAYNE
          Yes!

          MAL
          (small beat)
          Well you can't!

          JAYNE
          Do a damn sight better job'n you.
          Getting us lashed over a couple of
          strays...
          (to Simon)
          No offense, Doc, I think it's
          noble as a grape the way you look
          to River, but she ain't my sister
          (to Mal)
          and she ain't your crew. Oh, and
          neither is she exactly helpless!
          So where's it writ we gotta lay
          down our lives for her, which is
          what you've steered us toward.

          MAL
          I didn't start this.

          JAYNE
          No, the Alliance starts the war --
          and then you volunteer. Battle of
          Serenity, Mal: besides Zoe here,
          how many --
          (Mal turns away)
          -- I'm talkin' at you -- how many
          men in your platoon came out of
          there alive?
          Mal stares at him.

          ZOE
          (dead cold)
          You wanna leave this room.

          JAYNE
          You're damn right I do.
          He stalks upstairs. There's a quiet moment.

          INARA
          This isn't the war, Mal.
          Mal turns, eyeing her.

          MAL
          Are you telling me that because
          you think I don't know --

          INARA
          You came to the training house
          looking for a fight.

          MAL
          I came looking for you.

          INARA
          I just want to know who I'm
          dealing with. I've seen too many
          versions of you to be sure.

          MAL
          I start fighting a war I guarantee
          you'll see something new.

          TO
          Mal walks out into the cargo bay, Inara following, over:

          SIMON
          We'll get off. River and I'll get
          off at Haven and find some --

          KAYLEE
          Nobody's saying that.

          that.

          He moves to the aft hall, shuts and locks the door. Goes
          40 back to the locker and starts to unlock it, pulling his gun.

          JAYNE

          No trouble now, little crazy
          person... we're going for a nice

          shuttle ride --
          He opens the door and she is on him in an instant, whip blow
          to the throat, the nose -- he fires wildly as she jumps on
          him, wraps her arms around his neck and topples him back --

          INT. AFT HALL - MOMENTS LATER

          The crew enters, drawn by the shots. Mal is first -- can't
          open the door. Looks in to see an unconscious Jayne...

          MAL
          The other way! Find her and-do
          not engage!
          Everyone piles out the other way. Simon remains, to look in
          the window.

          ANGLE: SIMON'S POV: There is Jayne, not moving -- and River
          pops up right in front of us.
          He starts, then waits as she opens the door.

          NO

          SIMON
          It's gonna be oka --
          She elbows his throat viciously. He drops to his knees,
          shocked and gasping, as she spin-kicks him to the ground. He
          doesn't move. She looks at him a moment, then takes off.

          INT. CARGO BAY - MOMENTS LATER

          Mal is throwing his shoulder against the bolted door to the
          upstairs. He gives up, looking around.

          ZOE
          She's sealed off the bridge. I do
          not like her there.

          KAYLEE
          Cap'n!
          She tosses him a bolt remover. He starts pulling a bolt out
          of a panel on the wall, tells Zoe:

          MAL
          Check the shuttles. She coulda
          40 snuck in.
          He pops the panel off and starts wriggling in among the wires.

          INT. FOREDECK HALL/BRIDGE - LATER

          A floor panel hinges open, Mal pulling himself up. He moves
          quietly to the bridge, gun drawn.
          He enters to find River frantically punching up coordinates
          on a big Cortex screen she's pulled out by the copilot's
          seat. She whips Jayne's gun at his face, never looking at
          him. A moment, and Mal lowers his own gun.

          MAL
          The government's man, he says
          you're a danger to us. Not worth
          helping. Is he right? Are you
          anything but a weapon? I've
          staked my crew's life on the
          a - person-,-- -
          actual and whole, and if I'm wrong
          you'd best shoot me now.

          INT. BRIDGE - LATER

          Everyone has gathered. Wash is piloting now, as they are in
          atmosphere. River is by Simon. She moves restlessly, upset.

          KAYLEE
          How can it be there's a whole
          planet called Miranda and none of
          us knowed that?

          MAL
          Because there isn't one. It's a
          blackrock. Uninhabitable.
          Terraforming didn't hold, or
          somesuch. Few settlers died.

          RIVER
          (to Simon)
          I had to show them. I didn't know
          if you were going to make me sleep.

          SIMON
          (hoarse whisper)
          You could've asked...

          KAYLEE
          (re: planet)
          Wait a tick, yeah! Some ten years
          back, before the war. There was
          call for workers to settle on
          Miranda, my daddy talked about
          going. I should've recalled...

          WASH
          But there's nothing about it on
          the Cortex -- History,
          Astronomy... it's not in there.

          MAL
          Half of writing history is hiding
          the truth. There's something on
          this rock the Alliance doesn't
          want known.

          INARA
          That's right at the edge of the

          WASH

          She hits some commands on the screen, pulls back to reveal a
          couple of other planets near Miranda.

          ZOE
          This is us, see? And here's
          Miranda. All along here, this
          dead space in between, that's
          Reaver territory.

          the scene, not one of them moving. There's a grounded
          Alliance ship not far from the cannon that shot it down.

          INT. BRIDGE - CONTINUING

          We see Mal's face as the sight hits him like a gut-punch.

          The crew pours out even as the ramp lowers, going off in all
          directions, calling out to people...
          Kaylee heads for the burning church.

          KAYLEE
          Shepherd? Shepherd Book!
          She stops, looking at the ground by the steeple. There is
          the body on the ground, face down. The child she played with
          at dinner. Kaylee stares, at first uncomprehending.
          ANGLE: MAL, moving in the other direction, approaches the
          cannon, Jayne behind him. He stops and sees:
          Book, lying by the cannon, torn up badly from the waist down.

          Silence.
          Every Cortex screen is on, each looking at a different place.
          Every one shows fire, destruction or the snow of an
          interrupted signal.
          Mal stands alone amidst the screens, saying nothing. After
          a long moment, all of the screens hitch, the images replaced
          by identical images of the Operative. He looks solemn.

          THE OPERATIVE
          V0 I'm sorry. But I cannot let you
          hide and I cannot let you run.
          Things become... extreme. And we
          wish for another way.

          MAL
          Don't talk at me like a righteous
          man. You are a killer of children.

          THE OPERATIVE
          When God wanted Pharaoh to release
          His people from bondage -- you
          know the story? He didn't ask.
          He sent his plagues down upon
          Egypt. That's me, Captain. The
          path to peace is paved with
          corpses. It's always been so.

          I'm not going to live there. How
          could you think -- there's no
          place for me there, any more than
          40 there is for you. Malcolm, I'm a
          monster. What I do is evil, I've
          no illusions about it. But it
          must be done.

          MAL
          Why? Do you know why?

          THE OPERATIVE
          It's not my place to ask.

          MAL
          You will never see River Tam. I'm
          telling you this.

          THE OPERATIVE
          Maybe not. But you'll keep her
          close now, and when I blow
          Serenity out of the air, this will
          be ended. You're so terribly out
          of your depth, Captain. Your old
          boat can't take the pressure.

          MAL
          She ain't buckled yet. And the
          40 only reason you're talking such a
          lot is you can't get a fix on us.

          THE OPERATIVE
          Yes, your scrambler's code is too
          old for our seekers. You love
          that, yes? The small triumph over
          modernity. You really are the
          noble savage.

          MAL
          Nobody -- ever -- calls me noble.

          THE OPERATIVE
          But that's what's going to kill
          you, Malcolm. Nobility. It
          confuses your text, which is
          self-interest. And sin.

          Mal, watching, with Zoe behind and Wash at the helm.
          And we pull back out to see the whole of Serenity for the
          first time: It is hardly recognizable. Charred corpses on
          the nose, Cannon atop with a space-suited corpse draped
          within, long scars, welded-on parts and war paint... the
          trail of green light burns out with sporadic bursts of vapor.
          It looks, for all the world, like a Reaver ship.

          She puts it down and crosses to the bed. He sits by her.

          MAL
          You don't have to stay in the
          shuttle, you know. There's empty
          rooms, if you wanna sleep awhile.

          The group make their way toward the bridge. Those close
          enough to get a view out the window are looking freaked --
          those already on the bridge are stock still. Pressed up
          against the glass of the window is River, just staring.

          EXT. SPACE - CONTINUING

          Reverse to see: an armada.
          The black sky is filled with what must be ninety ships in a
          vague cluster, as Serenity breaks frame headed toward them.
          Most of them hang still in the air. Some move swimmingly
          about. Some turn in gentle drifts, as though looking around.
          Vd INT. BRIDGE - CONTINUING
          They all wait, tensed up, as they approach the armada...

          EXT. SPACE - CONTINUING

          And arrive, moving slowly through the ranks of ships.
          Serenity passes a large, bizarrely shaped ship. It turns, as
          though watching her. But lets her pass.
          Another minute, and Serenity is through the Armada, headed
          for the small planet just beyond.

          ZOE
          Every reading I'm getting says
          normal. Oceans, land masses... no

          As she touches down, filling the frame. After a moment Mal,
          Zoe and Jayne emerge from the airlock in full suits, armed.
          Zoe reads a handheld scanner...

          Out of their suits now, Mal, Zoe and Jayne take point as the
          entire crew walks along the street, looking about them.

          ZOE
          Ho.
          She moves rapidly, gun out, to:

          ANGLE: A SKELETON
          Face-down on the ground, clothes tattered. She examines it
          as Mal approaches, waving the others back.

          ANGLE: RIVER is quietly becoming more and more upset.
          CLOSE ON: KAYLEE walks in front of an office building,
          staying away from the cars as she hears:

          KAYLEE
          GAAAAaaoh God --
          -- and steps back, horrified, as the others approach.
          It's an office. About half the employees are there, in
          chairs or on the ground, all in the same state as the first
          fellow. We see ANGLES of the corpses as the gang evaluates...

          How come they're preserved?

          What're they doing? What's

          pain...

          But they didn't fall down. None

          They notice River now, in the middle of the street, keening.
          She drops to her knees, clutching her head.

          Let's get to the beacon.

          EXT. LANDING STRIP - DAY

          It's small -- landing is easier in cities with flying
          vehicles. At the end of a short runway, tipped and damaged,
          is an Alliance Research Vessel. The gang makes its way
          towards it.

          INT. RESEARCH VESSEL - DAY

          It's a mess, doors pried open, signs of violence but no
          bodies. The gang walks through it, looking around.
          River pulls away from Simon, suddenly determined. She
          approaches a console, and a small cylindrical object. She
          turns it slightly --
          A hologram squawks to life amidst them all. First we see
          images that resemble the flashes from River's mind: Corpses,
          everywhere. We hear and then see DOCTOR CARON standing
          exactly where she was when she recorded this message...
          (As she speaks, we see angles of everyone watching, taking it
          in.. River silently mouths every word.)

          -- just a few of the images we've
          recorded, and you can see it
          isn't.. it isn't what we thought.
          There's been no war here, and no
          terraforming event. The
          environment is stable. It's the
          Pax, the G-32 Paxilon Hydroclorate
          that we added to the air
          processors. It's...
          (tearing up)
          .well it works... it was
          supposed to calm the population,
          weed out aggression. Make a
          peaceful... it worked. The people
          here stopped fighting. And then
          they stopped everything else.
          They stopped going to work,
          stopped breeding... talking...
          eating...
          (trying for control)
          There's thirty million people here
          and they all just let themselves
          die. They didn't even kill
          themselves. They just... most
          starved. When they stopped
          working the power grids, there
          were overloads, fires -- people
          burned to death sitting in their
          V0 chairs. Just sitting.
          There is a loud bang somewhere behind her -- she starts,
          gathers herself.

          CARON

          (CONTINUING)
          I have to be quick. There was no
          one working the receptors when we
          landed, so we hit pretty hard. We
          can't leave. We can't take any of
          the local transports because...
          The bang again.

          CARON

          There are people... they're not
          people... about a tenth of a
          percent of the population had the
          opposite reaction to the Pax.
          Their aggressor response
          increased... beyond madness.

          She doesn't notice the reactions to her sudden clarity --
          she's still somewhat in her own world.

          WASH
          Still got the Reavers, and
          probably the Alliance between us
          and him.

          ZOE
          It's a fair bet the Alliance knows
          about Mr Universe. They're gonna
          see this coming.

          MAL
          No.
          He takes a long moment, his jaw tightening imperceptibly.

          Serenity is taking off, leaving the dead place behind.

          INT. MR UNIVERSE'S HQ - CONTINUING

          He's talking with Mal and Wash again, very animated.

          MR UNIVERSE
          It's no problem! Bring it on
          bring it on bring it on! From
          here to the eyes and ears of the
          'verse, that's my motto, or it
          might be if I start having a motto.

          MAL (ON SCREEN)
          We won't be long.

          MR UNIVERSE
          You're gonna get caught in the ion
          cloud, it'll play merry hob with
          your radar, but pretty pretty
          lights and a few miles after
          you'll be right in my orbit.

          MAL (ON SCREEN)
          You'll let us know if anyone else
          comes at you?

          DROP BACK WIDE to see: The Operative and ten soldiers are in
          the room, visible to Mr Universe but not to the screen.

          MR UNIVERSE
          You'll be the first.
          CLOSE ON: the Operative's sword, as he unsheathes it.

          EXT. SPACE - NIGHT

          We are amongst the Reaver armada. Serenity slices quietly
          through the ships, as we come around and see Miranda receding
          in the distance.
          Serenity drifts through the armada -- and suddenly another
          ship fires up, running next to her...
          The two ships pace each other, another vessel coming about as
          though staring at Serenity, who comes closer and closer to
          frame, till we see the suited corpse draped on the cannon.
          It suddenly moves: it's Mal.
          He swings the cannon round and fires at the ship pacing them.
          It BLOWS, fragmenting into burning bits that spiral into
          other ships, causing two smaller ones to blow as well.
          Mal swings around and fires at another ship.

          EXT. SATELLITE - NIGHT

          In close orbit waits the Alliance force, at least fifty
          strong, and clearly with high tech firepower. We move in on
          the Operative's ship, in the middle of the cluster.

          INT. THE OPERATIVE'S SHIP - BRIDGE - CONTINUING

          As the Operative waits with the others.

          EXT. SPACE - CONTINUING

          It's the Operative's POV: the swirling Ion cloud as Serenity
          breaks through and heads at us, fully Reavered out.

          INT. THE OPERATIVE'S SHIP - BRIDGE - CONTINUING

          He looks confused, then smiles at the ruse. Hits the com:

          EXT. SPACE - CONTINUING

           As Serenity get a bit closer, FIFTY REAVER SHIPS suddenly
           burst from the cloud, also heading straight at us.

          INT. THE OPERATIVE'S SHIP - BRIDGE - CONTINUING

          The Operative -- and everyone around him - goes big-eyed.

          THE OPERATIVE
          That's not good...

          HELMSMAN

          EXT. SPACE - CONTINUING

          Serenity suddenly lists hard to port -- until she's almost
          upside down -- the Alliance ships FIRE, missing Serenity but
           tagging a few Reaver ships, none of whom have slowed down --

          INT. BRIDGE - CONTINUING

          Mal is back on the bridge as we look out at the upside down
          Alliance fleet, missiles just passing us --

          MAL
          We're too close for them to arm --

          ZOE

          I am a leaf on the wind, watch how
          I soar.

          EXT. SPACE - CONTINUING

          Serenity slips right under the Operative's ship and ducks and
          weaves between dozens more. The Reaver force hits the
          Alliance head on -- and several ships do just that, smashing
          into bigger ships kamikaze-style, everything exploding --
          The fleet mobilizes, blasting Reaver ships, circling around,
          and an air war begins, a frenzied, balletic ecstasy of
          destruction that the camera hurtles through as ships and
          parts of ships fly at and past it.

          ANGLE: SERENITY
          She nearly makes it all the way through the alliance fleet
          before a barrelling chunk of debris -- which is twice their
          size -- forces them to come hard about and remain in the fray.

           Chickens come home to roost...

          EXT. SPACE - CONTINUING

          Serenity makes her way past the carnage and heads down toward
          the tiny satellite moon.

          INT. THE OPERATIVE'S SHIP - CORRIDOR - CONTINUING

          As the vessel shakes, clearly breached, The Operative moves
          to a door marked: DART. He puts his thumb to a panel and the
          door slides up to reveal a standing, almost formfitting one-
          man cockpit.

          EXT. THE OPERATIVE'S SHIP - CONTINUING

          The Dart disengages and bullets down towards the surface. As
          it moves from the Operative's ship, we see that a Reaver
          vessel has smashed into the main viewshield, and the ship is
          spinning, explosions popping silently all over it.

          EXT. SERENITY - CONTINUING

          She continues down, the metallic expanse of Mr Universe's
          little moon complex sprawling below them. A moment after
          Serenity blows through frame, so does a Reaver ship.
          It fires an electronic pulse at Serenity and sparks fly.

           INT. BRIDGE - CONTINUING

           Kaylee jumps back as she is electrocuted -- Simon runs in and
           pulls her out, slams the door shut on the erupting fires.

          EXT. LANDING STRIP - CONTINUING

          We can see it, a long strip, which halfway along becomes a
          kind of hanger. Serenity arcs at it uncomfortably fast.

          INT. BRIDGE - CONTINUING

          Wash is fighting the stick with extreme concentration as Zoe
          pulls out a seat as well, straps in.

          INT. AFT HALL - CONTINUING

          Jayne, Simon and Inara pull harnesses not unlike "Batman the
          Ride" seats from the ceiling, help the others in.

          EXT./INT. LANDING STRIP/HANGER - CONTINUING

          -40 And Serenity HITS the ground -- the landing gear folds and
          snaps under the weight -- the ship keeps going, now inside
          the hanger, heading towards the entrance to the facility,
          slowing, fishtailing and coming about a full one eighty -- it
          goes beyond the strip and crashes down into the pedestrian
          area, so that the nose is sticking back out at the runway but
          the body of the ship is hidden from it.

          INT. BRIDGE - CONTINUING

          There is a moment of quiet.

          WASH
          I am a leaf on the wind. Watch --
          A massive harpoon CRASHES through the windshield and impales
          him to his chair. It's as thick around as a telephone pole.
          Wash has time to open his mouth in surprise before he is dead.

          WASH!
          She moves to him --

          VW please --
          Mal rips her away and to the floor as another projectile
          slams through the window into the wall above them.

          EXT. LANDING STRIP - CONTINUING

          We see the ship that has fired the harpoons as Reavers start
          out of it. A second Reaver vessel enters frame from above,
          about to land next to it.

          EXT. SERENITY - MOMENTS LATER

          The cargo bay door opens -- just the little door housed
          inside the ramp -- and Jayne comes out with his biggest gun.
          He looks up, toward the edge of the runway, but no Reavers
          have arrived yet.

          JAYNE
          Go!
          The entire crew piles out, all heavily bedecked with weapons.

          Head inside!

          INT. BLACK ROOM/INNER HALL - MOMENTS LATER

          A small double-sized doorway leads to the "Black Room", which
          is the entrance proper to the facility.
          Mal hits a button and huge, thick, blast doors open from the
          sides AND the top and bottom, creating the effect of a square
          hole getting bigger. The hall itself is smaller than the
          black room, but still has the arrows on the ceiling, that
          point to an elevator some fifty feet away.

          MAL
          Come on. Jayne, rearguard.
          Zoe slows, looking around her.

          back there's the blast doors.

          KAYLEE
          I can rig 'em so they won't re-

          Then shut 'em and hide til --

          ZOE
          We need to draw them til it's
          done. This is the place. We'll
          buy you the time.

          JAYNE
          (to the others)
          Move those crates back there for
          cover -- and make sure they ain't
          filled with anything goes boom.

          KAYLEE
          Wait, Wash -- where's Wash?
          Nobody (but River) realized he wasn't there. Zoe is dead calm.
          ,No ZOE
          He ain't comin'.
          Everybody takes that in, Kaylee's eyes welling up.

          JAYNE
          Move the gorram crates! Come on!
          We hear savage SCREAMS from the hanger -- they're
          approaching. Mal moves to the door, Jayne beside him.

          ANGLE: HIS POV
          Reavers rush toward them.
          He turns to Jayne.

          MAL
          Tell me you brought 'em this
          time...
          Jayne smiles grimly, tosses Mal a grenade as he pops his own
          and fastballs it at the Reavers.

          It explodes in their midst, smoke and man-parts flying about.
          Mal rolls his a shorter distance, then slams the door shut.

          ANGLE: THE GRENADE

          40
          Explodes, raining a bunch of equipment -- and part of a
          catwalk -- right in front of the door.
          In the black room, the door nearly buckles from the
          explosion. Everyone takes positions behind the crates. Zoe
          stands calmly, her back to the door, loading her sawed-off.

          MAL
          (continuing; moving
          back to Zoe)
          Zoe... are you here?
          She looks up at him.

          ZOE
          Do the job, sir.

          MAL
          You hold. Hold till I'm back.
          He takes off -- passes Inara, the two of them holding a look
          for as long as they can. Then he's in the elevator and gone.
          Jayne moves over to Zoe.

          10

          JAYNE
          Captain's right. Can't be

          get through this.

          ZOE
          You really think any of us are
          gonna get through this?
          He looks back at their army: A companion, a doctor, a
          mechanic and a more-than-usually out of it River. A beat,
          and he looks back at Zoe with forlorn hope:

          The elevator stops and Mal makes his way to the island of

          The first thing he takes in is that every broadwave port has
          been destroyed. The second:

          from his chair.

          Mal comes close. Nothing. He starts to move away again and
          the lovebot turns her head, her eyes focusing with an audible
          whir. She speaks with surprisingly realistic expressiveness,
          and a warped, computery version of Mr Universe's voice.

          Mal stops.

          LOVEBOT

          (CONTINUING)
          Guy killed me, Mal. He killed me
          with a sword. How weird is that?
          I got... a short span here... they
          destroyed my equipment but I have
          a back-up unit... bottom of the
          complex, right over the generator.
          Hard to get to. I know they
          missed it. They can't stop the
          signal, Mal. They can never stop
          the signal.

          (BEAT)
          Okay this is painful. On many
          levels. I'm not --

          A beat, and Mal takes off.

          INT. BLACK ROOM - CONTINUING

          Inara is on her knees, unwrapping the oilcloth we saw in her

          Jayne moves past them to Zoe, takes position by her.

          JAYNE
          She picked a sweet bung of a time
          to go helpless on us.

          ZOE
          (calls out)
          Jayne and I take the first wave.
          Nobody shoots less they get past
          our fire.
          Simon moves to Kaylee, who is shaky as hell. The bangs on
          the door continue.

          KAYLEE
          Oh, I didn't plan on going out
          like this. I think we did right,
          but...

          SIMON
          I never planned... anything. I
          just wanted to keep River safe.
          Spent so much time on Serenity
          trying to find us a home I never
          realized I already had.
          She looks at him with soft surprise.

          140

          SIMON

          (CONTINUING)
          My one true regret in all this is
          never being with you.

          KAYLEE
          With me? You mean to say, as, sex?

          SIMON

          (SMILES)
          I mean to say.
          Kaylee snaps her cartridge home with way more precision than
          we might expect from her, takes steady aim at the door.

          KAYLEE
          Hell with this. I'm gonna live.
          Simon looks at her a moment, then turns his attention to the
          door.
          Inara come up into frame with the contents of the oilcloth:
          a bow and arrow, which she pulls back with focused grace.
          ANGLE: THE DOOR starts to come off its hinges.

          INT. MR UNIVERSE'S HQ - CONTINUING

          A panel is kicked in from the ceiling and the Operative drops
          down, having clearly entered from a different location.
          He looks around, carrying a laser-pistol. He moves past Mr
          Universe and Lenore --

          LOVEBOT

          MAL
          (The Operative turns)
          Guy killed me, Mal.

          INT. BASEMENT, OVER THE GENERATOR - CONTINUING

          Mal has reached it and surveys the situation.
          Before him is a railing, and he can look down on the
          generator shaft. It's miles deep, with machines rotating and
          grinding, and arcs of electricity ricochetting around it.
          On the other side is a platform, with the broadwave console
          sitting behind a clear plastic partition. Cables and chains
          run along the ceiling, around a series of ladder rungs.

          MAL
          Hard to get to. That's a fact.

          INT. BLACK ROOM - CONTINUING

          lwï¿½
          The door is pried partially open -- enough for one Reaver to
          squeeze through and charge.
          Zoe stands up and shoots him in the head. He arcs back hard
          as the second comes, Zoe shoots him, calmly walking toward
          the door --

          JAYNE
          Zoe... Gorramnit...
          But she is in a trance, and we see beneath the calm, to the
          bubbling magma of rage that keeps her firing, single shots,
          each one a kill, till five men down and she's out of ammo.
          The sixth comes at her swinging a blade and she blocks, the
          precision of military training still in her as she flips him,
          wresting the blade free and swinging it down out of frame,
          bringing it up bloody, swinging again as the door bursts open
          and she's rushed from behind ---
           But Jayne totes an automatic, sprays killing fire on the lot,
          moving forward himself --

          J

          

          

          

          

          JAYNE

          (CONTINUING)
          ZOE! Get yer ass back in the line!
          voï¿½ She looks up, almost confused -- and one of Jayne's targets
          comes back off the ground and slices at her back with a
          blade, she screams as he cuts deep -- and an arrow lodges in
          his neck.
          Inara pulls up a fresh arrow, shaking only slightly.

          INT. BASEMENT, OVER THE GENERATOR - LATER

          Mal is on the railing, reaching for the 'rungs' on the
          ceiling just above him. He can almost get them -- one wrong
          move and he pitches into the jaws of death...
          A laser shot nails him in the lower back -- he arches, legs
          sliding off the rail -- he falls and hits the rail with the
          backs of his legs, flipping painfully onto his face as he
          falls, mercifully, back onto the platform.
          The Operative comes around some equipment for a closer shot
          as Mal gets shakily up.

          MAL
          (in pain)
          Shot me in the back. I haven't...
          made you angry, have I?
          I s

          THE OPERATIVE
          There's a lot of innocent people
          in the air being killed right now.

          MAL
          You have no idea how true that is.
          There's no wise-ass attitude in him now. They stand, facing
          off at ten paces.

          MAL

          (CONTINUING)
          I know the secret now. The truth
          that burned up River Tam's brain
          and set you after her. And the
          rest of the 'verse is gonna know
          it too. 'Cause they need to.

          THE OPERATIVE
          You really believe that?

          MAL
          I do.

          THE OPERATIVE
          You willing to die for that belief?

          MAL

          V0
          I am.
          The Operative raises his gun -- but Mal is the quickdraw
          master, shoots the gun out of the Operative's hand and gets
          two hits to the chest (armored) before he makes it to cover.

          MAL

          (CONTINUING)
          Of course, that ain't exactly plan

          A..
          He drops out his cartridge and slams another in.
          The Operative hides behind some machinery. Tries to peek out
          at Mal -- and more shots send him scrambling back to cover.
          Mal holsters his gun and jumps for the rung above him, starts
          going hand over hand to the island, moving as fast as he can.
          The Operative sees his moment, dives for his gun -- but it's
          been ruined by Mal's shot. He looks over at Mal with death
          in his eyes. He runs at the railing, vaults off it, and
          grabs a chain -- it snaps and he swings, grabbing another.
          He reaches Mal and double kicks him from behind -- Mal flies
          4 off the rung but grabs a chain -- he tries to kick at the
          Operative, but the guy is frikkin' Tarzan, he climbs up and
          pulls a lever releasing one end of Mal's chain -- Mal goes
          swinging, smacks into the wall six feet below the platform.
          He scrambles up just as the Operative swings himself toward
          the platform from above.

          INT. BLACK ROOM/INNER CORRIDOR - CONTINUING

          Jayne is still firing continuously as he drags Zoe back to
          the barricades. Simon moves to help -- Kaylee firing now,
          squinting with effort -- and pulls open the cut back of Zoe's
          shirt, checks the wound.

          SIMON
          Spine's intact --

          ZOE
          Just gimme a bandage.
          Simon pulls a spraycan from his bag, sprays the wound with a
          foam that hardens instantly into an elastic covering.

          113.
          There are a few gun shots (as well as nail-balls and blades)
           from the Reavers. Jayne switches weapons, tossing another to
          Zoe and opening fire --

          A0

          JAYNE
          Oh, now you're likin' guns, huh?
          Cheaters!
          He takes a hit in the shoulder, grimaces and keeps firing.
          River watches, the gun limp in her hand. Kaylee grabs it and
          starts another round -- but she's peppered with dart-like
          projectiles. She screams and drops the weapon, pulling the
          projectiles from her -- Inara helps her up, pulls her back as
          Zoe shouts:

          ZOE
          Everybody fall back! Fall back!
          Everyone stumbles or is dragged into the inner corridor.
          Inara hits the controls and the doors start to close, from
          each side and above and below. Then, when the hole is maybe
          four by four, they stop.

          ZOE

          (CONTINUING)
          Jayne! Grenade!

          JAYNE
          Very last one...
          He tosses it through the hole. Zoe doesn't even flinch from
          the blast as she thinks.

          ZOE
          They're gonna get in --

          KAYLEE
          Can close it... from outside...

          ZOE
          No one's coming back from that...
          She tries to stand, fails.

          ZOE

          (CONTINUING)
          How much ammo do we have?

          JAYNE
          We got three full cartridges and
          my swingin' cod. That's all.
          Inara is by the elevator, pounding for it to come.---

          Lift isn't moving...

          ZOE
          When they come, try to plug the
          hole with 'em...
          Kaylee cries out and Simon moves to her.

          KAYLEE
          I'm starting to lose some feeling
          here... I think there's something
          in them darts they throwed at me.

          SIMON
          Lie still. I'm gonna give you
          something to counteract the --
          He stands, looking around him. His bag is over by Zoe.

          SIMON

          (CONTINUING)
          My bag.
          and SHKOWW!, the bullet takes him in the belly -- everything
          suddenly moving very slowly as he spins slightly, one foot
          lifted, a confused expression on his face -- then speeding
          right back up as he slams down on his back, gasping for air.
          River's mouth opens in a scream she doesn't make.
          Blood spreads from Simon's belly. Inara rushes to him, grabs
          cloth and puts pressure on the wound, puts Simon's hand on it.

          INARA
          Keep pressure here...

          SIMON
          My bag. Need... adrenaline... and
          a shot of calaphar for Kaylee...
          I can't... River...?
          She is by his side, takes his hand. She has a kind of
          serenity to her, like she understands something now.

          SIMON

          (CONTINUING)
          River... I'm sorry...

          RIVER
          No. No.
          The lights go out. Everyone looks about them. Jayne fires
          again, but all the sound has bled out save these two.

          SIMON
          I hate to... leave...

          RIVER
          You won't. You take care of me,
          Simon. You've always taken care
          of me.
          She stands as the emergency lights come on, giving her face
          an unearthly glow as she looks down at him.

          RIVER

          (CONTINUING)
          My turn.
          She's running so fast, nobody has time to react til she DIVES
          through the hole in the doors, then Simon SCREAMS her name,
          the scream following us back into the Black Room where River
          lands in a perfect roll, comes up in a room full of Reavers.
          Without a moment's hesitation she makes it to the panel, gets
          the doors closing. She dodges a blade, but a blow to,the
          back of the head shakes her. She weaves around a couple of
          Reavers to get to the closing doors, but at the last second
          her ankle is grabbed and pulled out from under her.
          The last thing we see is her being dragged back as they swarm
          over her.
          ANGLE: THE BLAST DOORS, as they shut with a shuddering RLUNG.

          INT. BASEMENT, OVER THE GENERATOR - CONTINUING

          Mal gets up the chain to the platform. The Operative is on
          Mal before he gets his footing, tackles him as Mal's gun goes
          skittering over the edge into oblivion. There is a railing
          here or Mal would go over as well -- but he comes back with
          a couple of hammer blows, gets the Operative off him.
          They square off, Mal stumbling back into a tool chest,
          knocking over tools and computer parts.
          The Operative reaches behind him and pulls his sword
          gracefully from the holster under his jacket.
          Mal produces his weapon: a tiny screwdriver.
          He hurls a toolbox at the Operative and rushes him, gets
          inside sword range and tries for the neck with the
          screwdriver -- the Operative blocks it and works the sword
          point against the edge of Mal's stomach. Starts pushing
          slowly, despite Mal's resistance, and breaks skin.

          116.
          Mal looks at the Operative a moment -- and the sword slides
          all the way through Mal's belly. Mal's eyes go wide.

          THE OPERATIVE
          You know what your sin is, Malcolm?

          MAL
          (shaky smile)
          Aw hell, I'm a fan of all seven.
          He headbutts the Operative viciously, then punches him so
          hard he staggers back, losing his grip on the sword. The
          Operative responds with a spin kick -- Mal holds up the
          screwdriver and the Operative swings his foot right into it,
          gasping as Mal pulls the screwdriver -- and leg it's stuck
          in -- back as he rockets his fist into the Operative's chin.
          The Operative goes down hard, dazed, as Mal grabs the sword
          still in his belly.

          MAL

          (CONTINUING)
          But right now...
          He pulls the sword out, grimacing. Holds it over the
          Operative. The smile gone.

          MAL

          (CONTINUING)
          vao I'm gonna have to go with Wrath.
          He stabs down at his foe's face -- but the Operative rolls
          out of the way, kicks Mal from the ground and is up in a
          second, grabbing Mal's sword hand -- the sword drops -- and
          punching him repeatedly in his stomach wound.

          INT. INNER HALL - CONTINUING

          The gang is subdued -- because they are all of them injured
          and Simon is slipping away. Jayne looks at Zoe.

          JAYNE
          You suppose he got through? Think
          Mal got the word out?

          ZOE
          (almost convincingly)
          He got through. I know he got
          through.

          INT. BASEMENT, OVER THE GENERATOR - CONTINUING

          Mal goes down hard, spitting up blood. He sees the sword,
          moves -- but the Operative kicks him in the face. Picks him
          lod up, Mal too tired to throw a decent punch.

          THE OPERATIVE
          I'm sorry.
          The Operative spins him and DIGS his bunched fingers right
          into the same nerve cluster that he paralyzed Doctor Mathias
          with. Mal goes rigid, his face a rictus of pain.
          The Operative goes near the railing and retrieves his sword.
          Mal trembles, trying to move -- but nothing happens.

          THE OPERATIVE

          (CONTINUING)
          You should know there's no shame
          in this. You've done remarkable
          things. But you're fighting a war
          you've already lost.
          He lunges -- and Mal twists gracefully out of the way,
          grabbing the Operative's swordhand and pulling it forward --
          while driving his elbow into the Operative's neck with
          staggering force.

          MAL
          Iwo Well, I'm known for that.
          The Operative drops the blade, mouth open, stumbling back,
          unable to make a sound.
          Mal spins him, grabbing both his arms and working his own
          through them in a twisted full nelson -- then bringing his
          arms up suddenly, the Operative's mouth going wider as we
          hear his arms crack.
          Mal drops him sitting against the railing, picks up his
          sword, saying:

          MAL

          (CONTINUING)
          Piece a shrapnel tore up that
          nerve cluster my first tour. Had
          it moved.
          He squats down, looks the Operative in the face.

          Sorry 'bout the throat. Expect
          you'd wanna say your famous last
          MW words now. Just one trouble.
          He reaches over the railing, pulls the back of the
          Operative's jacket through and shoves the sword through the
          fabric, pinning the Operative in his sitting position.

          MAL

          (CONTINUING)
          I ain't gonna kill you.
          He moves to the console, starts prepping it.

          MAL

          (CONTINUING)
          Hell, I'm gonna grant your
          greatest wish.
          He inserts the cylinder, turns it slightly. It hums to life.

          MAL

          (CONTINUING)
          I'm gonna show you a world without
          sin.
          He hits "send all". The cylinder lights up and the broadcast
          V0 begins. Here it is projected as a two-dimensional image on
           the clear plastic partition, right in front of the Operative.
           There are images first of the city -- of bodies, on the
           street, in homes and offices... image after image, jus.t as
           we saw on the research vessel -- and in River's mind.

           CARON (V.0.)
          These are some of the first sites
          we scouted on Miranda. There is

          There is no one...
          Mal hits the controls and a ramp extends towards the other
          side. He begins to cross. Never even looks back.
          On the Operative, trapped, watching in growing horror...

          INT. BLACK ROOM - CONTINUING

          CLOSE ON: A Reaver in EXTREME SLOW MOTION. Face full of
          fury, he is swinging his blade in a frenzy of hate.

          the Reaver clearing frame to reveal:

          She is bloodied, but not killed. She's as she was in the
          bar -- moving faster and more efficiently than anyone can,
          ducking and weaving and gutting and kicking and there are
          piles of Reavers already, she never breaks concentration as
          she uses their own blades against them, throws them, does
          everything in her power to stay one step ahead of -- or
          above -- the mob.
          She slams backwards into a wall opposite the blast doors --
          and a grappling hook punches through it, just missing her.

          INT. BASEMENT, OVER THE GENERATOR - CONTINUING

          The Operative watches the end of the broadcast. We are on
          his face through the clear plastic, so the images projected
          on it blur right before him: the Reaver, Dr. Caron -- and her
          screaming doesn't stop til something is shoved in her mouth.

          INT. INNER HALL - CONTINUING

          The gang is still trying to patch themselves together when
          the elevator doors open. Mal staggers out, holding his
          bleeding side.

          ZOE
          Sir?

          140 MAL
          It's done. Report?
          Zoe looks at the badly wounded Simon, is about to give a
          report -- and the doors start to open behind her.
          Everyone turns to look, those who can feebly raising weapons,
          as the square iris of the opening blast doors widens to
          reveal River, standing alone. She is holding two Reaver
          blades, is bloody but unbowed. And the only one alive.
          We hold on her a moment, then the wall behind her is ripped
          completely away.
          Behind it, grappling hooks chained to a huge tractor pull the
          wall away as through the smoke come some fifteen Alliance
          soldiers, who line up, rifles trained on our gang...

          SOLDIER
          Drop your weapons! Drop 'em now!

          ANOTHER SOLDIER
          Do we engage? Do we engage?

          120.
          Mal and the others tense up. River turns slowly to face the
          soldiers, blades still gripped... A soldier levels his gun at
          her, sweaty and frantic... others still shouting...
          vp INT. BASEMENT, OVER THE GENERATOR - CONTINUING
          The Operative sits in silence, the voices coming over his com:

          SOLDIER (O.S.)
          Targets are acquired! Do we have
          a kill order? Do we have an order?

          INT. BLACK ROOM - CONTINUING


          CLOSE ON: THE SOLDIER'S FINGER, SQUEEZING THE TRIGGER...

          BLACK OUT.

          EXT. DESERT PLANET - SUNSET

          We are close on a gravestone. It is rounded, looks more like
          a bell than a headstone. It is topped by a jar built'into
          the stone. The jar is weathered tin at top and bottom, but
          glass in the middle. Inside the glass we can see one of
          those slightly moving photos. It is of Mr Universe and his
          lovebot, and the name Mr Universe is carved roughly in the
          stone beneath.
          The camera moves to the right and we see another such stone,
          40 this one bearing the image and inscription: Shepherd Derrial
          Book.
          The third is Hoban Washburne. Wash.
          The camera continues moving right, but the next stone houses
          a small home-made rocket with pieces of paper taped to it
          instead of a picture-jar. And fixing another slip of paper
          to it is River.
          She moves away from the stone as Mal does likewise. They're
          flanked by the crew: Jayne, Inara (to whom Mal moves),
          Simon, who stands holding River before him and hand in hand
          with Kaylee. He has a crutch supporting his other side.
          There is a moment, then they all move aside, saying nothing.
          Between them walks Zoe, in a simple white funeral gown,
          holding a burning taper.
          She stands at the stones a moment, then holds the taper to
          the rocket fuse. Stands back with the others.
          The rocket shoots up into the darkening sky. They all watch
          its sputtering tail a moment, then it it explodes in a series
          of fireworks.

          121.
          WIDE ON the group, as the fireworks go off over their heads.
          We are close on another explosion when it becomes:
          CLOSE ON: A BLOWTORCH spitting sparks. Widen to see:

          EXT. REPAIR YARD/SERENITY - DAY

          Zoe is harnessed to the nose of the ship, welding on a
          replacement for the very window the harpoon that impaled Wash
          came through.

          INT. DUCT INSIDE SERENITY - DAY

          We are close on River as she works inside a crawlspace just
          above the engine room, replacing wires. Some of them run to
          a computer screen that she checks and adjusts.

          EXT. REPAIR YARD/TOP OF SERENITY - DAY

          Mal and Jayne hold onto the cannon as a crane is lifting it
          off the top of the ship.
          Close on Mal as he watches it go...

          WIDER ANGLE:

           EXT. REPAIR YARD - CONTINUING

          t f o And here we see the whole ship for the first time, harnessed
          by the wings above the ground so she can be worked on all
          over. The cannon is being hoisted away from her as a crew of
          repairmen wheel new landing gear under her belly.

          INT. ENGINE ROOM - DAY

          Kaylee, deeply greasy, tweaks a part on the engine and
          crosses to the back where Simon, shirtless and not entirely
          ungreasy himself, is wrenching a bolt into place above his
          head. A moment looking at him and she can't help herself -
          she slides her arms around his chest...

          EXT. SERENITY - DAY

          On a scaffold, Inara repaints the name on the nose with
          elegant precision.

          INT. ENGINE ROOM - DAY

          Kaylee and Simon are just making out like fiends, work
          completely forgotten. With nothing resembling elegant
          precision, they sink out of frame to the floor.

          122.
          A beat, and River's head appears from the crawlspace above,
          looking down at them with detached curiosity.

          EXT. REPAIR YARD/SERENITY - DAY

          It's raining as Mal is hauling in the last of the repair
          equipment. The camera moves around him, skirting the ground
          of the junkyard, till it lands on a figure in foreground,
          standing watching him from some twenty feet away.
          Mal stops, doesn't turn. Hand near his gun.

          MAL
          If you're here to tell me we ain't
          finished... then we will be real
          quick.
          The Operative stands just under the canopy of the nose of the
          ship, framed by the rain behind.

          THE OPERATIVE
          Do you know what an uproar you've
          caused? Protests, riots -- cries
          for a recall of the entire
          Parliament.

          MAL

          (TURNING)
          We've seen the broadwaves.

          THE OPERATIVE
          You must be pleased.

          MAL
          'Verse wakes up a spell. Won't be
          long 'fore she rolls right over
          and falls back asleep. Taint my
          worry.

          THE OPERATIVE
          I can't guarantee they won't come
          after you. The Parliament. They
          have a hundred men like me and
          they are not forgiving.

          MAL
          That don't bode especially well
          for you... giving the order to let
          us go, patching up our hurt...

          THE OPERATIVE
          I told them the Tams were no
          longer a threat -- damage done.

          THE OPERATIVE (cont'd)
          They might listen, but... I think
          they know I'm no longer their man.

          W MAL
          They take you down, I don't expect
          to grieve overmuch. Like to kill
          you myself, I see you again.

          THE OPERATIVE
          You won't. There is...
          (small, grim smile)
          .nothing left to see.
          Mal looks at him a moment, then picks up his gear to head
          inside. The Operative starts away into the rain, then stops
          to look up at the nose of the ship.
          ANGLE: the newly painted Serenity, standing tall in the rain.

          THE OPERATIVE

          (CONTINUING)
          "Serenity". You lost everything
          in that battle. Everything you
          had, everything you were... how
          did you go on?
          Mal hits the button to close the inner doors, steps inside as
          they slide together. Glances at the Operative, unimpressed.

          VAO

          MAL
          You still standing there when the
          engine starts, you never will
          figure it out.
          The Operative watches the door shut. A moment, and he goes.

          INT. CARGO BAY - CONTINUING

          Mal stows the gear as Zoe approaches.

          MAL
          (to himself)
          What a whiner...

          ZOE
          Sir, we have a green light.

          A beat between them before:

          MAL
          Make sure everything's secure.
          Could be bumpy.

          ZOE
          Always is.
          She takes off and Mal heads up the stairs.

          INT. FOREDECK HALL - CONTINUING

          Mal comes in and runs into Inara. Jayne passes through as
          they talk, heading down into his bunk. Pays them no mind.
          Neither do Simon and Kaylee, in the dining room stowing
          supplies.

          MAL
          We're taking her out. Should be
          about a day's ride to get you back
          to your girls.

          INARA
          Right.

          VW

          MAL
          (moving past her)

          INARA
          I, uh...
          (he stops)
          I don't know.
          He looks at her, a smile in his eyes.

          MAL
          Good answer.
          He turns and heads into the bridge.

          INT. BRIDGE - CONTINUING

          Mal eases himself into his seat. Takes a moment to adjust
          one of Wash's dashboard dinosaurs, then looks to his left.

          V0 River is in the copilot's seat, looking intently at the
          screens and buttons.

          RIVER
          That's the plan.

          MAL
          Think you can work out how to get
          her in the --
          She is flipping switches without even looking, as the ship
          hums to life.

          EXT. SERENITY - CONTINUING

          Her engines fire up and tilt. She lifts gently off the
          ground.

          INT. BRIDGE - CONTINUING

          Mal looks slightly, only slightly nonplussed.

          MAL
          Okay, clearly some aptitude for
          the... but it ain't all buttons
          A0 and charts, .
          You know what the first rule of
          flying is? Well, I suppose you
          do, since you already know what
          I'm about to say.

          RIVER
          I do. But I like to hear you say
          it.
          He looks out at the rain on his windows, at his screens,
          taking her up as he says:

          MAL
          Love. You can learn all the math
          in the 'verse, but you take a boat
          in the air you don't love, she'll
          shake you off just as sure as the
          turning of worlds. Love keeps her
          in the air when she oughta fall
          down, tells you she's hurting
          'fore she keens. Makes her a home.
          River also looks out at the sky.

        

          126.

          RIVER
          Storm's getting worse.

          MAL
          We'll pass through it soon enough.

          EXT. SERENITY - CONTINUING

          As we shoot up with her through sheeting rain, towards the
          top of the sky.

          EXT. SPACE - MOMENTS LATER

          We are looking down on the stormclouds as Serenity bursts out
          of them, comes at us, flared by the sun behind the planet as
          she passes us, her Firefly effect lighting up, about to shoot
          off into the heavens --
          There is a spark and a piece of paneling pops off, whips at
          camera, blacking out the frame.

          MAL (0. S . )
          What was that?

               EXT. STARLINER TOWERS APARTMENT COMPLEX -- MORNING

               Starliner Towers is seen in LS through the windshield of a 
               moving car. The car approaches the complex and stops near 
               the main doors of the West Tower.

               Out of the car climb Kresimir and Benda Sviben, a gawky newly 
               wed young couple. Kresimir elaborately opens the door for 
               Benda, his new wife, and they walk with hands intertwined up 
               the steps of the West Tower.

               INT. LOBBY -- MORNING

               As the Svibens approach the main doors, the doorman leaps up 
               from his chair beside the intercom switchboard and opens the 
               door for them. The doorman, like most security guards, does 
               not look capable of handling a serious crisis. He is about 
               fifty, of average height but slightly built, wears thick 
               glasses and seems almost embarrassed by the revolver on his 
               hip.

                                     DOORMAN
                         Morning, folks. Can I help you?

                                     KRESIMIR
                         Yes, please. I... er, we... are 
                         looking for the rental agent here. 
                         We have an appointment.

                                     DOORMAN
                         OK, I'll just give him a little buzz 
                         and he'll come out and show you the 
                         way in.

               The doorman presses a button on the intercom board. As he 
               turns back to the Svibens, he catches his holster on the 
               board.

                                     DOORMAN
                              (freeing holster)
                         Darned thing.

                                     BENDA
                         Do you ever use that?

                                     DOORMAN
                         This? No, never even had it out of 
                         the holster. A rival company has 
                         'em, so we gotta have 'em. Just an 
                         advertising gimmick.

               INT. ANNABELLE'S APARTMENT -- MORNING

               Dr. Emil Hobbes, a huge, florid, bearded man, is strangling 
               Annabelle Horsefield. Despite the difference in their sizes -- 
               Annabelle is tall and slender, about seventeen -- Hobbes is 
               not having an easy time of it. Hobbes is wearing overlarge 
               blue jeans and a red plaid shirt; Annabelle is in a private 
               girls' school outfit -- white blouse, dark blue tie, blue 
               knee socks, pleated gray skirt.

               Annabelle fights back fiercely; Hobbes has tears in his eyes. 
               The struggle takes them all over her apartment, which, 
               although sparsely furnished, presents enough objects in their 
               way to cause a lot of crashing around. At one point Annabelle 
               breaks loose and Hobbes has to chase her.

               Annabelle slips and Hobbes manages to pin her to the ground, 
               where he has the advantage of leverage. He strangles her 
               quickly and with tremendous, crazy energy. Blood oozes from 
               her mouth. Hobbes places his hand over her mouth as though 
               trying to prevent her from speaking, or to prevent something 
               from leaving her body.

               He reaches over to his leather doctor's bag, which has spilled 
               some of its contents on to the floor, finds a surgical clamp, 
               and clamps Annabelle's lips together. He then picks up her 
               body, carries it over to the dining-room table and sweeps 
               the few cups and bottles on it off on to the floor. He then 
               places her body with great tenderness on the table and begins 
               to undress it.

               INT. LOBBY -- MORNING

               The doorman leaves the Svibens to open the door for the 
               Spergazzis, an elderly Italian couple who both use aluminum, 
               four-pronged canes to help them walk. The Svibens watch the 
               old couple as they enter and then glance at each other 
               significantly -- 'We'll be together when we're as old as 
               they are.'

               Mr. Spergazzi tips his hat to the doorman, who opens the 
               inner door for him.

               As the Spergazzis make their way shakily toward the elevators, 
               Mr. Merrick, the rental agent, appears from around a corner. 
               He is slick, mustachioed, and wears a wide paisley tie. He 
               extends his hand for a handshake even though he is still 
               fifty feet from the inner doors. The doorman keeps the door 
               open for him.

                                     DOORMAN
                         Here's Mr. Merrick. He'll take you 
                         on in.

                                     MERRICK
                              (ingratiatingly)
                         Welcome to Starliner Towers. And you 
                         are...?

                                     KRESIMIR
                         Kresimir and Benda Sviben.

                                     MERRICK
                         Eh? Oh yes, of course. Mr. and Mrs. 
                         Sweden. Come right this way. Sorry 
                         to keep you waiting. Now, are we 
                         talking about one or two bedrooms? I 
                         assume we're not talking about 
                         bachelors, eh? Ha, ha. Now, I have 
                         several floor plans all laid out for 
                         you, and all you have to do is take 
                         your choice and we'll trot right on 
                         up there and take a look at 'em...

               The three disappear around a corner.

               The doorman pulls a Harlequin Nurse Romance out of his jacket 
               and sits down to continue reading it.

               INT. ANNABELLE'S APARTMENT -- MORNING

               Hobbes ties a green surgical mask over his mouth and nose, 
               snaps on rubber gloves.

               He turns to Annabelle's corpse on the dining-room table, 
               legs hanging over the edge, now naked -- the private girls' 
               school clothes in a heap on the floor. Hobbes takes a scalpel 
               from the top of the radiator where he has laid out his 
               surgical instruments. He feels Annabelle's stomach until he 
               has found what he wants, then cuts her open with one smooth, 
               confident stroke of the scalpel.

               He then quickly douses the inside of her abdomen with some 
               clear fluid in a squeeze bottle, lights a wooden match, and 
               drops it into her abdominal cavity. The corpse bursts into 
               flame.

               Hobbes steps back to watch. Tears spring into his eyes. He 
               picks up another scalpel and perfunctorily sticks it into 
               his neck. Blood spurts into his mask and soaks through to 
               the other side. Hobbes sinks to his knees before the blazing 
               corpse and struggles to draw the scalpel through the tendons 
               of his neck.

               INT. RENTAL OFFICE -- MORNING

               Merrick and the Svibens sit across from each other at a long 
               table strewn with floor plans and maps. The river which 
               surrounds the complex can be seen through the glass walls of 
               the office. Merrick taps one plan with his finger and slides 
               it over to Benda.

                                     MERRICK
                         Now you take a look at that one, 
                         Brenda, and tell me if it doesn't 
                         suit you down to the ground. That 
                         one has the big view, the panoramic 
                         view...

               INT. TUDOR'S APARTMENT -- MORNING

               In his bathroom, Nicholas Tudor is cleaning his teeth with 
               microscopic attention to detail using an elaborate compressed-
               water device called a water-pick. Tudor is thirty-nine, not 
               happy with his work as an insurance appraiser, and has 
               recently adopted a general air of terse, sullen desperation 
               as his primary mood.

               His wife, Janine, calls to him from the kitchen, where she 
               is just putting the finishing touches on breakfast.

                                     JANINE (V.O.)
                         Breakfast is just about ready, Nick.

               Tudor pointedly doesn't answer, but continues with the water-
               pick until he is completely satisfied. He carefully packs 
               the machine away, then leaves the bathroom.

               In the dining room, Janine is putting breakfast on the table. 
               Tudor sits down without a word and begins to eat. Janine 
               returns to the kitchen and comes back with a cup of coffee 
               in each hand. She puts one cup in front of Tudor, sits down, 
               starts to drink the other one. After a pause, she speaks.

                                     JANINE
                         Can I call you at the office?

                                     TUDOR
                         What do you want to call me at the 
                         office for?

                                     JANINE
                         I don't know. I just thought I might 
                         want to call you. I don't know.

                                     TUDOR
                         I won't be at the office except to 
                         sign in.
                              (he eats heartily, 
                              not looking directly 
                              at Janine)
                         I've got a lot of claims to check 
                         out. All over the place. Garages and 
                         more garages.
                              (noticing Janine's 
                              silence, he finally 
                              looks up)
                         I'll come home right after work.

               Janine continues to toy with the food in her plate. She shrugs 
               once, as if to say, 'Big deal, so what?' Tudor ignores her 
               and finishes breakfast.

               INT. A HALLWAY -- MORNING

               Tudor leaves his apartment, closing the door behind him (we 
               see the number clearly).

               He walks down the hallway on automatic pilot, obviously 
               preoccupied, turning the corner leading to the elevators 
               without perceiving what he is seeing.

               At the elevators he hesitates for a moment, then presses the 
               UP button. When the door opens, he steps in.

               INT. ELEVATOR -- MORNING

               In the elevator are Merrick, the rental agent, and the 
               Svibens.

                                     MERRICK
                         We're going up.

                                     TUDOR
                         Oh. Well, I'll go along for the ride.

                                     MERRICK
                              (after a pause, to 
                              the Svibens, 
                              indicating the 
                              elevator)
                         Wood-grain paneling, strong, silent, 
                         fireproof, fast, cushioned ride. 
                         Everything you could want in an 
                         elevator.

               Nobody says another word until the doors spring open and 
               Merrick, after a wink at Tudor, hustles the Svibens out of 
               the elevator.

               As the doors close, Merrick's voice floats back to Tudor.

                                     MERRICK (V.O.)
                         Notice how the entranceways to all 
                         the apartments are recessed and 
                         individually lit... Nope, it's down 
                         that way, Brenda. That's it... 
                         Recessed and individually lit...

               Once the door has closed, Tudor presses the button for the 
               top floor. As the elevator ascends, he takes out his wallet 
               and removes a key from a zippered compartment.

               INT. HALLWAY -- MORNING

               Tudor fits the key into the lock of Annabelle's apartment. 
               He knocks gently and then opens the door. After a pause he 
               steps in and closes the door behind him, not wanting to be 
               seen by anyone who might know him.

               INT. ANNABELLE'S APARTMENT -- MORNING

               As soon as he is inside the apartment, Tudor knows that 
               something is seriously wrong. Smoke hangs in the air and the 
               smell of burned flesh attacks Tudor's nostrils. He is on his 
               way to the bedroom when he sees Hobbes's foot around the 
               corner of the dining room.

               Tudor approaches the dining room with his hand over his nose 
               and mouth.

               Annabelle's corpse is still smoking where it lies on the 
               dining-room table. Hobbes's body is twisted into the fetal 
               position at the foot of the table, one hand still clutching 
               the scalpel stuck in its neck, the floor beneath it bright 
               with blood.

               Tudor winces as though stuck with a pin. Blinking rapidly, 
               he edges around the room until his angle of vision is such 
               that he can see the head of the corpse on the table. It is 
               definitely Annabelle, eyes still staring, surgical clip still 
               attached to her lips, purple bruises on her neck.

               Tudor turns, his body contracting around the pit of his 
               stomach. After a moment he manages to straighten up and 
               stagger from the apartment, having at least enough presence 
               of mind to take his attaché case, which he left by the door, 
               and to close the door behind him.

               INT. ANNABELLE'S APARTMENT -- AFTERNOON

               Dr. Roger St. Luc, tall, thin, dark, not bad-looking, stands 
               over the table staring at the corpse of Annabelle. As he 
               watches, two ambulance men throw a sheet over her and begin 
               to lift her down on to a stretcher on the floor. The voice 
               of the superintendent of the building drifts over to him 
               from the other end of the apartment.

                                     SUPER (V.O.)
                         Like I said to the police officer, 
                         he paid the rent, Dr. Hobbes did. 
                         And he came around and chatted a lot 
                         with everyone here, the staff, I 
                         mean. Nice guy. Not a high and mighty 
                         type. But it was her name on the 
                         residency list and the buzzer board: 
                         Annabelle... what was it again?... 
                         Annabelle Horsefield. She never 
                         complained about anything, not to 
                         me, anyway.

               The super, a small, unshaven, harassed little man with a lot 
               of energy, is talking to a large beefy detective who writes 
               everything down in a notebook.

                                     DETECTIVE
                              (pointing to 
                              Annabelle's corpse, 
                              which is just being 
                              carried out the door)
                         And that was her. Annabelle Horse... 
                         field.

                                     SUPER
                         Far as I know, yeah, that was her.

               The detective now turns to St. Luc, who is crouched on the 
               floor examining the chalk outline around where Hobbes's body 
               had lain.

                                     DETECTIVE
                         Is that the man who called you up 
                         here?

                                     SUPER
                         Yeah, that's Dr. St. Luc. He's the 
                         head of our little medical clinic 
                         here.

                                     DETECTIVE
                         Medical clinic?

                                     SUPER
                         Yeah. This is an island, you know? 
                         Takes too long to get into the city. 
                         We gotta have everything right here 
                         or somebody complains.

                                     DETECTIVE
                         Well, let's go talk to your doctor.

               The detective walks over to St. Luc and the super follows. 
               St. Luc rises to meet him. He is wearing very informal summer 
               clothes, a bit rumpled.

                                     DETECTIVE
                         Dr. St. Luc? Detective-Sergeant 
                         Heller. I'd like to ask you a few 
                         questions.

                                     ST. LUC
                              (obviously a bit dazed 
                              by what he has been 
                              seeing)
                         Sure.

                                     DETECTIVE
                         You're the one who found the bodies?

                                     ST. LUC
                         Yes.

                                     DETECTIVE
                         Did you touch anything? Move anything 
                         before we got here?

                                     ST. LUC
                         No, nothing.

                                     DETECTIVE
                         You knew these people?

                                     ST. LUC
                         I knew the man, Emil Hobbes, a doctor 
                         and a professor at university. I saw 
                         the girl around the building but I 
                         didn't know her. She never came to 
                         the clinic.

                                     DETECTIVE
                         So you just came up to visit this 
                         Hobbes and you found them like that?

                                     ST. LUC
                         Oh, no. I haven't seen Dr. Hobbes 
                         since I was in medical school. He 
                         taught me... he was my prof in urology 
                         and... I think he conducted a few 
                         seminars in psychopharmacology. That 
                         was it. I had no idea he'd ever set 
                         foot in Starliner Towers until today.

                                     DETECTIVE
                         I see. Then what brought you up here?

               St. Luc begins to pace about as he talks.

                                     ST. LUC
                         It was very strange. He called me at 
                         six this morning. Hobbes called me. 
                         I thought I was dreaming. I haven't 
                         heard that voice for so long. He 
                         told me who it was, then he said 
                         something like, 'Meet me at apartment 
                         1208 at noon. I want you to go out 
                         for lunch with me. It's time you 
                         furthered your education.' Then he 
                         laughed and hung up. I went back to 
                         sleep. He called me again at eight 
                         to remind me to come.

                                     DETECTIVE
                         How did he sound this time? Was he 
                         nervous? Depressed?

                                     ST. LUC
                         He sounded fine.

               The telephone rings. The super, who has been fiddling with a 
               window with a cracked pane of glass, grabs the phone 
               instinctively without looking at the detective, who probably 
               would have answered it himself.

                                     SUPER
                              (pause)
                         Who? No, that's not me. You got the 
                         wrong guy. Just a sec.
                              (looks up at St. Luc 
                              and holds out the 
                              phone to him)
                         It's for you. Somebody wants to know 
                         how come you didn't show up for lunch.

               The detective looks suspiciously at St. Luc, who simply looks 
               dazed.

               INT. ROLLO LINSKY'S LABORATORY -- AFTERNOON

               Next to a shallow porcelain tray full of immense and grotesque 
               marine worm specimens lies a large parcel wrapped in brown 
               paper. Rollo's plump fingers eagerly open the package to 
               reveal a large variety of delicatessen sandwiches and 
               accessories.

               Rollo offers some to St. Luc while stuffing one in his own 
               mouth. There are Cokes and old coffees everywhere, plus 
               mustard, relish, and ketchup dispensers of all kinds. Rollo 
               and St. Luc sit around Rollo's desk, a very sleek metal 
               affair.

               Rollo's lab itself is a combination of modern office and 
               biology room in a museum of natural history. Specimens of 
               all kinds, in bottles and cases, mounted on glass and wood, 
               floating in preservative baths, are everywhere. There are 
               also a few cages of living insects, moldy aquaria and lab 
               cultures in various stages of neglect.

               There are also clippings from magazines and newspapers 
               sporting furious underlinings and circlings in red ink which 
               are stuck to walls, doors, bookshelves.

               Despite the potential for chaos, however, there is an 
               underlying order which reflects Rollo's own real discipline, 
               which is not always immediately apparent. And the microscopes 
               and glass slides, the stainless-steel gynecological table 
               complete with stirrups, metal drug and instrument cabinet, 
               etc., are spotless and in good shape.

               Rollo is rotund, soft-faced, and a manic-depressive. In his 
               manic phase he is a joker and an elbow-nudger, and his general 
               style, even when discussing medical matters in medical jargon, 
               is broad North-American Jewish. In his depressive phase, he 
               becomes a sullen kid who has an oddly sinister aspect to his 
               character.

               Rollo detaches himself from his baby beef in order to comment 
               on the food that, not so secretly, he loves best of all.

                                     ROLLO
                         Not exactly the kind of lunch Hobbes 
                         would have laid on you, Rog, but 
                         it's all I got, and...
                              (places hand on heart, 
                              leans over 
                              confidentially)
                         ...all I got I share with you. Go 
                         ahead. Take all you want.

                                     ST. LUC
                         You touch my spleen, Rollo.
                              (they giggle at an 
                              old medical-school 
                              reference)
                         And here all the time I was thinking -- 
                         if I ever bothered to think about 
                         the good old days -- well, at least 
                         there's Rollo. He's in VD and he's 
                         happy.

                                     ROLLO
                         I'm still a VD man under the skin, 
                         Rog. You know me. I'm a down-to-earth 
                         kinda guy, right?

                                     ST. LUC
                         Well, at least you still talk the 
                         same.

                                     ROLLO
                         So who changes?

                                     ST. LUC
                         But you gave up your private practice. 
                         Suddenly you're into pure research 
                         and you... you're what, a 
                         parasitologist?

                                     ROLLO
                         That was my father's idea... private 
                         practice. He wanted to set me up -- 
                         I couldn't say no. But he's dead 
                         now. And me, I'm still a snoop, I 
                         gotta do research. Look at that 
                         beautiful stuff...
                              (gestures everywhere)
                         ...lookit it!

               He jams a final piece of sandwich into his mouth and jumps 
               to his feet, smiling broadly.

                                     ROLLO
                              (with great enthusiasm, 
                              indicating the entire 
                              lab)
                         This is the 'Satyr's Tongue'!

               He pulls a book off a shelf with a bookmark in it. He opens 
               the book at the marked page and hands it to St. Luc. As St. 
               Luc looks at the picture of a satyr with his tongue hanging 
               out and reads the brief note on how medieval alchemists 
               thought the ground-up tongue of the satyr could cure any 
               disease, Rollo continues to talk.

                                     ROLLO
                         The note includes a warning against 
                         swallowing the tongue whole, but we 
                         don't see the rest of this caution. 
                         'Satyr's Tongue' was Hobbes's code 
                         name for our project. What we were 
                         trying to do was to find an 
                         alternative to organ transplants.

               As Rollo speaks, he walks all over the place, picking up and 
               discarding various charts, specimens, bottled and diseased 
               human organs, etc.

               As he moves around, we catch glimpses of Letrasetted signs 
               that Rollo has tacked up: 'Sex is the invention of a clever 
               venereal disease -- Hobbes'; 'Dr. Hobbes's prescription: 
               starve a fever, feed an obsession'; 'The road of excess leads 
               to knowledge'; plus several pictures of satyrs with their 
               tongues sticking out, being cut off by alchemists, etc.

                                     ROLLO
                         I know. You're bored already. 
                         Transplants are yesterday's kishkas, 
                         right?

                                     ST. LUC
                              (shaking his head in 
                              protest)
                         Did I say anything?

                                     ROLLO
                              (excited, waving 
                              specimens of parasites 
                              and diseased organs 
                              around)
                         Look. You got men, you got parasites 
                         that live in, on, and around men. 
                         Now. Why not breed a parasite that 
                         does something useful? Eh? Why not 
                         breed a parasite capable of taking 
                         over the function of any one of a 
                         bunch of human organs? Why not, for 
                         example, a parasite living in the 
                         human abdominal cavity that plugs 
                         into the circulatory system and 
                         filters the blood like a kidney? If 
                         it takes a little blood for itself, 
                         so what? Be generous! You can afford 
                         it.

               He is now in full flight. He leans over St. Luc and begins 
               to demonstrate what he says by drawing things on St. Luc's 
               stomach with his fingers. St. Luc can't hide his amusement.

                                     ROLLO
                         You put the bug into the body of a 
                         man with a diseased kidney, the bug 
                         attacks the bad kidney, dissolves 
                         it, it's assimilated by the body, 
                         and now you got a perfectly good 
                         parasite where you used to have a 
                         rotten kidney. I know what you're 
                         gonna say. You're gonna say it's 
                         crazy.

                                     ST. LUC
                              (laughing)
                         It's crazy.

               Rollo throws himself back into his chair and grabs a pickle.

                                     ROLLO
                         Right. It's crazy. But here's the 
                         beauty part. Ready?
                              (leans forward for 
                              emphasis)
                         Who cares?

                                     ST. LUC
                         I don't get it.

                                     ROLLO
                         You know and I know that Hobbes was 
                         a lousy teacher, eh? Lousy. Dry, 
                         academic, afraid of women, lousy. 
                         But he was always a genius at one 
                         thing -- getting grants. Could he 
                         get grants for crazy projects?

               St. Luc is about to say something, but Rollo answers his own 
               rhetorical question with a flip of the hand, effectively 
               silencing St. Luc.

                                     ROLLO
                         You know who pays the rent here? Eh? 
                         The Northern Hemisphere Organ 
                         Transplant Society. And that's for 
                         something that's supposed to put 
                         them outta business. And they're not 
                         the only ones. We got grant money 
                         coming out of our ears.

               He leaps up again and pulls a sheaf of reprints from medical 
               journals like the Journal of Venereal Disease, etc. He shoves 
               them under St. Luc's nose, then grabs a jar with a 
               disintegrating octopus-like creature in it and a sandwich at 
               the same time. He smacks down the sandwich in front of St. 
               Luc by mistake, then retrieves it and substitutes the jar 
               with the specimen.

               St. Luc sifts through the papers and glances at the specimen.

               As St. Luc looks at the papers, Rollo breathes heavily down 
               his neck and points out things of interest.

                                     ROLLO
                         See? There? You take a little of 
                         this... that's a very rare venereal 
                         disease you get in the nomadic Crinua 
                         people, Northeast Asia and Japan.
                              (points to a sexy 
                              picture of a Japanese 
                              lady in heat)
                         Oo. That one's got it bad. They call 
                         it Batinh. That means 'kiss' or 
                         'caress.' When you get it it makes 
                         your lips itchy, ya wanta kiss 
                         everything. I even had it once. I 
                         always get everything at least once 
                         so I know what the patient's talking 
                         about.
                              (he laughs but he's 
                              serious)
                         And there... you take a little of 
                         that... that's beautiful, isn't it? 
                         That's Flexipes, the world's only 
                         cephalopod parasite.
                              (indicating the jar)
                         That's him right there. Not a very 
                         good specimen. Related to squids and 
                         octopuses. See? He lives in the guts 
                         of whales and big dolphins.
                              (wiggles a finger at 
                              the specimen)
                         Ya like 'em big 'n hot 'n wet, don't 
                         ya? Yeah.

               He walks away from the desk. His manner is now more subdued 
               and reflective. It seems as though everything he says provokes 
               a dozen unspoken thoughts. His depressive phase is beginning.

                                     ROLLO
                         We don't do it all here, we send out 
                         to have tricky stuff done... the 
                         cell fusion, enucleation, chromosomal 
                         fission, all that fancy close work.

               Rollo sighs heavily. St. Luc gently shoves all the papers 
               aside.

                                     ST. LUC
                         Rollo, how come Hobbes killed himself?

               Rollo toys with the gynecological examination table, sliding 
               the stirrups in and out on their adjustment bars.

                                     ROLLO
                              (shrugging)
                         Funny in the head. High suicide rate 
                         in the medical profession. Too much 
                         body, alla time bodies, bodies.

               He now gets close to St. Luc, putting an arm around his 
               shoulder.

                                     ROLLO
                         Rog, I gotta talk serious to you. 
                         Really. Listen. Ya listening? OK. I 
                         want you to come into this with me. 
                         To tell the honest-to-God truth, I'm 
                         lonely.
                              (begins to pace around 
                              again)
                         All Hobbes ever did was run around 
                         getting money and phone me in the 
                         middle of the night. He wanted you 
                         in anyway. That's why we were gonna 
                         get together, the three of us. We 
                         would have enough to keep us going 
                         for at least five years, even with 
                         inflation.

                                     ST. LUC
                              (a bit uncomfortable 
                              being put on the 
                              spot)
                         Rollo, you know me. Once a GP, always 
                         a GP.

                                     ROLLO
                              (almost angrily)
                         You want to help sick people for the 
                         rest of your life? God forbid I should 
                         talk you out of it.

                                     ST. LUC
                         You oughta be careful yourself. Might 
                         end up cutting your throat.

                                     ROLLO
                         It was women did it to Hobbes. 
                         Couldn't handle them. That girl, 
                         that Annabelle -- talk about crazy 
                         projects.

                                     ST. LUC
                         Who was she?

                                     ROLLO
                              (reluctant to talk)
                         Aw, he met her when he was lecturing 
                         at some private girls' school. They 
                         caught him examining her little tits 
                         for breast cancer in the faculty 
                         lounge. She was twelve. Don't ask. 
                         It was craziness, believe me.
                              (indicating the 
                              gynecological table)
                         They used to come here sometimes.
                              (shakes his head)
                         Don't ask.

               He starts to run down like a spring-wound toy at the end of 
               its run. He glances at a picture of Annabelle stuck in a 
               corner, which St. Luc just notices for the first time.

                                     ROLLO
                         I'll never really understand how he 
                         could do what he did to her.

               St. Luc looks at his watch and gets up out of his chair for 
               the first time.

                                     ST. LUC
                         Well, Rollo Linsky... I gotta go 
                         open up the store. It's been great 
                         to see you again.

               He moves toward the door. Rollo trails after him, head down, 
               obviously dejected.

                                     ROLLO
                         Yeah, sure.

               They shake hands. St. Luc has to open the door himself -- 
               Rollo is really preoccupied. Finally he looks St. Luc in the 
               eye.

                                     ROLLO
                         But you'll think about what I said 
                         about working together, huh?

                                     ST. LUC
                         OK. I'll think about it.

               Rollo manages a smile. St. Luc leaves, closing the door behind 
               him.

               INT. TUDOR'S APARTMENT -- MORNING

               In his bathroom, Nick Tudor cleans his teeth with the water-
               pick as usual. The sounds of Janine bustling about with 
               breakfast filter into the bathroom. Tudor hums tunelessly.

               Suddenly, he doubles over in a soundless spasm of pain. The 
               water-pick writhes in the sink, shooting water on to the 
               mirror and over the floor.

               After a moment he straightens up and begins to press around 
               the area of his navel, obviously looking for lumps which it 
               seems -- from his expression -- he has already found and is 
               overly familiar with.

               The water-pick continues to rattle around in the sink. Janine 
               pokes her head around the corner to investigate. Tudor tries 
               to cover up, grabs the water-pick, and begins to work on his 
               teeth again, hiding the occasional twinge that hits him.

                                     JANINE
                         You say something?

                                     TUDOR
                         Nope. Damned thing wriggled out of 
                         my hands. That's all.

               Janine waits for Tudor to say something else. He ignores 
               her.

                                     JANINE
                              (after a pause)
                         You sure you're OK, Nick?

               Tudor continues to ignore her. Janine sighs in a very obvious 
               way and disappears. Tudor waits for a second, turns off the 
               water-pick, then checks out his stomach again.

               INT. WOMEN'S SAUNA -- AFTERNOON

               Janine sits in the middle of a bench, towel around her head 
               and middle. Next to her sits Betts, who is in her early 
               forties, attractive in a tough kind of way, and wears her 
               hair short for efficiency's sake. In her relationship with 
               Janine she plays the role of tough, worldly older sister. 
               She has the poise and confidence of a woman who has created 
               her own success and position in life, a marked contrast to 
               the neurotic vivacity of Janine, who is ten years her junior 
               and has never known independence.

               They are both watched by the only other occupant of the sauna, 
               Benda Sviben, now a full-fledged resident of Starliner Towers. 
               She is huddled in a corner, very shy and looking particularly 
               thin, mousy, and ineffectual in the presence of the other 
               two full-bodied women.

               Betts is in the middle of giving Janine advice about Tudor's 
               disease.

                                     BETTS
                         ...probably nothing at all. It's 
                         probably just a bunch of, I don't 
                         know, fatty cysts. You can have them 
                         removed in a doctor's office. Has 
                         Nick seen a doctor?

                                     JANINE
                         He hates doctors. Doctors and lawyers. 
                         He never goes to doctors.

                                     BETTS
                         Well, look. How's this? You go on 
                         down to the clinic and tell that 
                         nice Dr. St. Luc...
                              (pauses to work it 
                              out)
                         ...you tell him that Nick's ill, 
                         he's got these lumps, and he can't 
                         get out of bed. Tell him to come 
                         when you're sure Nick'll be home. 
                         And don't tell Nick anything. Let 
                         the two of them fight it out.

                                     JANINE
                              (not displeased with 
                              the idea)
                         He'll be really mad.

                                     BETTS
                              (with a conspiratorial 
                              smile)
                         So? You'll find out what's wrong and 
                         then you'll be able to relax a little 
                         bit. Let him be the uptight one for 
                         a change.

               She stretches out full length on the bench, her toes bumping 
               Benda's thigh. Betts notices Benda for the first time.

                                     BETTS
                              (to Benda)
                         Oops, sorry. Hi. Haven't seen you 
                         here before, have I?

               Benda draws her towel around her, wide-eyed, completely 
               intimidated by Betts. She manages a nervous smile.

               INT. TUDOR'S OFFICE -- AFTERNOON

               Tudor's secretary, a lumpy and motherly lady named Mrs. 
               Wheatley -- she has a nameplate on her desk -- is shuffling 
               some papers when the telephone rings.

               Her small cubicle of an office is appended to Tudor's only 
               slightly larger office in a huge downtown office building. 
               The door leading to Tudor's office is closed.

                                     MRS. WHEATLEY
                         Ashen & Gaunt, Insurance Appraisals. 
                         Mr. Tudor? One moment, please. I'll 
                         buzz him.

               She places the caller on 'hold' and presses the inter-office 
               buzzer. She directs her attention for a moment to the papers 
               on her desk. When, after a pause, she notices that Tudor 
               hasn't answered the phone, she releases the caller from 'hold' 
               and picks up the receiver.

                                     MRS. WHEATLEY
                         I'm sorry to keep you waiting. I'll 
                         put you on 'hold' again and see if I 
                         can find Mr. Tudor.

               Mrs. Wheatley pushes the 'hold' button and gets out of her 
               chair. She knocks gently on the door.

                                     MRS. WHEATLEY
                         Nicholas? There's a call for you.

               Perplexed by Tudor's failure to respond, Mrs. Wheatley 
               gingerly opens the door.

                                     MRS. WHEATLEY
                         Nicholas? It's that man whose 
                         Lamborghini caught fire on St. 
                         Catherine Street and burned to the 
                         ground. He's very angry...

               She catches a glimpse of Tudor rolling around on the floor 
               behind his desk, his swivel chair tipped over on to its side.

                                     MRS. WHEATLEY
                         Nicholas! What happened?

               She rushes over to Tudor and helps him to his feet. Tudor is 
               breathing heavily and has to support himself by leaning on 
               the desk while Mrs. Wheatley straightens up the chair for 
               him.

               Tudor collapses into the chair, mumbling and rolling his 
               head from side to side. Mrs. Wheatley pulls a Kleenex from 
               her sleeve and dabs away a small trickle of blood coming 
               from one corner of Tudor's mouth.

                                     MRS. WHEATLEY
                         We're going to get you to a hospital. 
                         That's what we're going to do.

                                     TUDOR
                              (beginning to come 
                              around)
                         No, no. I'll be all right. I'm all 
                         right.

               Mrs. Wheatley shows Tudor the spot of blood on her Kleenex.

                                     MRS. WHEATLEY
                         Do you see this? This is blood. It 
                         came from your insides. That means 
                         it's serious. Probably an ulcer. You 
                         executives are all the same.

               Tudor shoves her hand away and sits straight at his desk, 
               still pretty wobbly.

                                     MRS. WHEATLEY
                              (smoothing the hair 
                              back from Tudor's 
                              forehead in a very 
                              motherly fashion)
                         Now, Nicholas, it doesn't cost 
                         anything to be sure everything's all 
                         right. I think you should definitely 
                         go to the emergency ward and...

                                     TUDOR
                              (abruptly, swiveling 
                              away from Mrs. 
                              Wheatley's hand)
                         Call me a cab, will you please, Mona? 
                         I'm going home for the day.

                                     MRS. WHEATLEY
                         Nicholas, I think...

                                     TUDOR
                         I don't care what you think. Please 
                         call me a cab. Now.

               Mrs. Wheatley steps away from the desk, obviously hurt by 
               Tudor's brusqueness.

                                     MRS. WHEATLEY
                              (mollifyingly)
                         All right, Nicholas. All right.

               She leaves, closing the door behind her.

               Tudor sighs, taking a deep breath. He is suddenly hit by 
               another twinge of pain. He clutches his stomach. Blood 
               trickles out of the corner of his mouth. After a pause, he 
               licks the blood off his lips with the tip of his tongue.

               INT. CLINIC RECEPTION AT STARLINER TOWERS -- AFTERNOON

               The Starliner Towers Medical Clinic is small but complete. 
               Dr. St. Luc and his nurse, Forsythe, are backed up by a 
               secretary-receptionist who sits behind a desk surrounded by 
               filing cabinets at the end of the hallway which serves as 
               reception area. There are chairs lined up against one wall, 
               flanked by coffee tables piled high with the traditional two-
               year-old magazines.

               Three or four people sit waiting to see St. Luc, among them 
               the aging but sprightly Mr. Parkins and Janine Tudor. Parkins, 
               who considers himself something of a ladies' man, is talking 
               to Janine when St. Luc appears and looks at the list of 
               patients who have signed in.

                                     PARKINS
                         ...and this Kriedler seems to think 
                         that mega-vitamin therapy may be the 
                         answer to the question of aging. 
                         That's not to suggest that the aging 
                         process is in any way reversible -- 
                         I don't think for a minute that it 
                         is -- but it may be stoppable, and 
                         that's where mega-vitamins come in...

               St. Luc gestures to Janine to follow him into his office. 
               Janine gets up, excusing herself to Mr. Parkins.

                                     JANINE
                         Excuse me, Brad. Gotta go.

               She follows St. Luc into his office. He closes the door behind 
               her.

               INT. TAXICAB -- AFTERNOON

               The cab carrying Tudor pulls up at the main doors of the 
               Towers. Tudor, still a bit unsteady, signs a chit for the 
               driver and gets out of the car.

               INT. LOBBY -- AFTERNOON

               The doorman opens both doors for Tudor as he enters the 
               building.

                                     DOORMAN
                         Afternoon, Mr. Tudor.

               INT. ST. LUC'S OFFICE -- AFTERNOON

               Janine sits opposite St. Luc, who has a file open before him 
               on his desk.

                                     ST. LUC
                         Well, there's certainly nothing here 
                         in this check-up I did for your 
                         husband's company last year. Blood 
                         pressure a touch high, cholesterol 
                         count nice and low...
                              (looking Janine in 
                              the eye)
                         I just can't see cancer developing 
                         that fast, Janine, not the way you've 
                         described it. Could be swollen glands 
                         or something, I don't know.

                                     JANINE
                              (a bit relieved but 
                              still tense)
                         You'll come up and take a look at 
                         him?

                                     ST. LUC
                              (standing up)
                         If he can't make it down here... 
                         sure. That's what I'm here for. But 
                         it won't be until, oh...
                              (checking his watch)
                         ...9.30, say 10.00. OK? Not too late?

               Janine smiles and shakes her head. Just gotta have time to 
               put the clinic to bed for the night and grab some supper.

                                     JANINE
                         That's great, Doctor. Thanks.

               Janine gets up, opens the door to the reception area, and 
               leaves, closing the door behind her.

               St. Luc keeps staring at Tudor's file, shifts something from 
               one side of the folder to the other. Something bothers him.

               The door to one of the examination rooms opens and Forsythe 
               pops her head around the corner.

                                     FORSYTHE
                         Mrs. Ementhal's ready and waiting, 
                         Doctor.

                                     ST. LUC
                         Mm? OK. Be with you in a sec.

               Forsythe disappears. St. Luc studies Tudor's file.

               INT. TUDOR'S APARTMENT -- LATE AFTERNOON

               Tudor enters his apartment and throws his jacket and attaché 
               case on to a chair. He loosens his tie and makes himself a 
               drink, then sits down on the sofa and switches on the TV 
               set.

               After only a short moment of relative calm, Tudor suddenly 
               contracts into the fetal position, spilling his drink on to 
               the floor. He rolls on to the floor, eyes staring out of his 
               head, mouth opening and closing like that of a fish out of 
               water, tendons in his neck bulging with tension.

               He soon manages to struggle to his feet, the primary spasm 
               of pain apparently over. He keeps both hands clamped over 
               his mouth as though in a vain attempt to forestall a bout of 
               vomiting and stumbles into the bathroom.

               Once in the bathroom, Tudor throws himself over the side of 
               the bathtub, knees on the bath mat, head well down into the 
               tub itself.

               He gags and vomits into the tub and collapses, exhausted, on 
               the floor, mouth bloody. In the tub, a trail of blood-streaked 
               slime leads into the drain.

               INT. RECEPTION AREA -- LATE AFTERNOON

               Forsythe comes out to the reception area from an examination 
               room, checks out the patient list, and beckons to Mr. Parkins.

                                     FORSYTHE
                         I'm ready for you now, Brad.

               Parkins gets up and follows Forsythe into one of the 
               examination rooms.

               INT. EXAMINATION ROOM -- LATE AFTERNOON

               Once inside the examination room, Forsythe closes the door 
               and hands Parkins a hospital tunic.

                                     FORSYTHE
                         Now, you just take off all your 
                         clothes, put this on, and hop up on 
                         to the table over there, OK? Doctor'll 
                         be in to see you in a few minutes.

                                     PARKINS
                              (as Forsythe begins 
                              to leave)
                         You don't have to go. I'm not shy.

                                     FORSYTHE
                         Don't be a tease, Brad. I'm still 
                         working, you know.

               Forsythe leaves. Parkins chuckles to himself -- 'still life 
               in the old boy yet' kind of feeling -- and begins to undress.

               INT. TUDOR'S LIVING ROOM -- NIGHT

               Tudor staggers into the living room from the bathroom, wiping 
               his mouth with a facecloth. He sits down on a chair facing 
               the sliding glass door which leads to the apartment's balcony.

               He breathes heavily, gasping for air. His expression is a 
               dazed one and he mumbles incoherently. After a moment's rest 
               he rises, opens the glass door, and steps out on to the 
               balcony.

               EXT. TUDOR'S BALCONY -- NIGHT

               Tudor hangs on to the railing of the narrow concrete balcony, 
               gulping down the air, scanning the lights of the tower 
               opposite.

               Suddenly the muscles of his neck go tense again, his mouth 
               seems to gape open at the extreme limits imposed by muscle 
               and jawbone, his hands fly up to his mouth in an attempt to 
               keep down whatever is about to come up.

               Hanging over the railing of the balcony like an ocean traveler 
               in a rough sea, Tudor finally gives up the struggle and hangs 
               on for dear life as he retches, gags, moans, and finally 
               vomits.

               EXT. GROUNDS BELOW TUDOR'S BALCONY -- NIGHT

               Two elderly women, Vi and Olive, are taking a leisurely 
               evening stroll at the base of Tudor's tower. They both hold 
               small transparent umbrellas over their heads and walk gingerly 
               along the path bordering the lawn.

               Suddenly the liquid, fleshy thwack of the parasite vomited 
               by Tudor from high above hitting one of the umbrellas is 
               heard. A large splotch of blood spatters the first lady's 
               umbrella just off center, as though it has been hit by a 
               heavy, blood-soaked sponge. The force of the blow almost 
               twists the umbrella from the first lady's frail hand, and 
               she gives a little cry of surprise.

               Her companion extends a hand to help the first lady keep her 
               balance, then gives a slightly more startled cry when she 
               sees the blood.

               The first lady examines her umbrella as well, but does not 
               react with such surprise.

                                     FIRST LADY
                              (examining the bloodied 
                              umbrella)
                         Aw. Poor birdie. They're always 
                         crashing into tall buildings. It's 
                         such a shame, such a shame. The 
                         windows fool them, you know.

               The creature, the second parasite to emerge from Tudor's 
               body, lies in the grass, away from the bright cones of light 
               thrown by the tower's lawn lamps. We can barely make out its 
               bloody, twitching form.

               Beyond the parasite is a basement window through which is 
               visible a large laundry room complete with washers and dryers. 
               The window has been propped open a couple of inches by a bar 
               of laundry soap.

               The first lady makes a move to find the injured creature, 
               but her companion tightens her grip on the old lady's arm.

                                     COMPANION
                         Come along, Olive.

                                     FIRST LADY
                         Oh, Vi! Maybe the poor thing's just 
                         been hurt. Maybe we should look for 
                         him!

                                     COMPANION
                              (pulling Olive along)
                         Don't be silly, dear. It's in heaven 
                         now, whatever it is. Won't help at 
                         all for you to get into a fuss and 
                         muddle over it. Now come along and 
                         let's finish up our little evening 
                         stroll and get you tucked up in bed 
                         in front of the color TV.

               The two women walk off down the path, Vi's voice fading away 
               in the shadows.

                                     COMPANION
                         You know what a restless night you 
                         have if you don't get your two hours 
                         of color TV, dear, so let's bustle 
                         along and get our walk over with, 
                         shall we...?

               INT. ST. LUC'S EXAMINATION ROOM -- NIGHT

               St. Luc is examining Mr. Parkins. Parkins sits on the 
               examination table with the hospital tunic on.

               St. Luc presses gently around Parkins' abdomen in the area 
               of the navel.

                                     PARKINS
                         Ow! Better take it easy. There's a 
                         lot of pressure in there!

               St. Luc stops pressing and takes up his stethoscope. He begins 
               to percuss the old man's abdomen.

                                     PARKINS
                         Want me to breathe deeply?

                                     ST. LUC
                         Just breathe normally.

               St. Luc finishes percussing, removes the stethoscope from 
               his ears, and stands back thoughtfully.

                                     PARKINS
                              (confidentially)
                         Good shape for an old man, eh?

                                     ST. LUC
                              (after a pause)
                         Mr. Parkins, what makes you think 
                         you caught these lumps of yours from 
                         a young lady?

                                     PARKINS
                         She had a couple just like them. 
                         Right here near her belly button. 
                         You could push 'em around. I thought 
                         they were kinda sexy, myself.

                                     ST. LUC
                         Didn't she ever have these lumps 
                         looked at by a doctor?

                                     PARKINS
                              (shrugs)
                         Didn't seem worried about them.

                                     ST. LUC
                         Was this girl from Starliner Towers?

                                     PARKINS
                         Yep. She lived in 1208. But we usually 
                         went to my place. Bigger liquor 
                         cabinet, bigger bed.
                              (chuckles, then gets 
                              serious)
                         She was gone when I got back from my 
                         last Florida trip. Too bad. Had a 
                         beautiful tan.
                              (smiles again)
                         Must have gone home to mother.

                                     ST. LUC
                         Was her name Annabelle Horsefield?

                                     PARKINS
                         That's the one.

               St. Luc sits down at the counter beneath the medicine cabinet 
               and begins to write in Parkins' file.

                                     ST. LUC
                         OK, you can get dressed now, Mr. 
                         Parkins.

               The old man begins to put his shirt and tie back on.

                                     ST. LUC
                              (handing Parkins a 
                              slip of paper)
                         I'm going to send you to the hospital 
                         to have a few X-rays taken. I want 
                         to find out exactly what you're hiding 
                         in there, OK? Give them this. The 
                         address is right there under 
                         Radiology.

                                     PARKINS
                         Gonna cut me open?

                                     ST. LUC
                         Well, let's wait for the X-rays.

                                     PARKINS
                         Used to know a doctor who said he 
                         got to know his patients better than 
                         their wives did.
                              (chuckles)
                         Cutting a man open sure does expose 
                         more of him than pulling down his 
                         pants, gotta admit that.

               St. Luc smiles politely, his mind obviously elsewhere.

               INT. LAUNDRY ROOM -- NIGHT

               A bar of laundry soap props open the window of the laundry 
               room. The presence of the wounded parasite is indicated only 
               by the glistening slime trail which streaks the section of 
               wall immediately below the window.

               The hand of an old woman, puckered and wrinkled from many 
               hours submerged in hot soapy water, reaches up, and yanks 
               the bar of soap out of the jaws of the window. The window 
               swing shut. The woman's hand slides the bolt home, locking 
               the window from the inside.

               The old woman is short, dumpy, puffy-faced, in her late 
               sixties. Her hair is carelessly tied in a bun on top of her 
               head.

               She sniffles, shakes her head, turns away from the window, 
               and walks across the room to the long bank of washers and 
               dryers. As she walks she has to thread her way among the 
               dozen or so shopping bags full of dirty laundry -- against 
               apartment regulations, she takes in outsiders' laundry -- 
               which she has brought down the elevator with her.

               She flips open the top of the first washer and begins to dig 
               clothes out of the nearest shopping bag.

               From above and behind the washer, we watch her fill the 
               machine and reach into the front of her dress, which is black 
               and frayed. After feeling around for a few seconds, she pulls 
               out a plastic bag filled with white granulated detergent. 
               She dumps some of this into the washer, finds the appropriate 
               coins in the pocket of her dress, and starts the machine.

               She watches it for a second to make sure it's working 
               properly, then puts the plastic bag back where she found it. 
               She picks up the bag she has almost emptied and shuffles in 
               her ragged slippers to the next washer. She stops in front 
               of it and puts down the bag.

               The old woman notices a slimy streak near the open hole of 
               the washer. She grimaces, grabs a sock from the bag and cleans 
               off the top of the washer with it. She tosses the sock into 
               the washer and leans over the hole, trying to see inside.

               The parasite which has been lurking in the washer suddenly 
               springs from the opening on to the old woman's face, suckering 
               on to her flesh with its stubby tentacles. She shrieks and 
               grabs at the creature with both hands, trying to pull it 
               off.

               She stumbles back from the washer and begins to trip over 
               various shopping bags. Finally she goes down amidst her 
               laundry, thrashing and spilling clothes out everywhere.

               INT. STARLINER TOWERS GROCERY STORE -- NIGHT

               In the grocery store built into the base of one of the towers, 
               Janine flips through some magazines, finally buying a Vogue.

               She stops to look at several shelves of various kinds of 
               food, picking up this and that, but somehow the thought of 
               cooking or even eating repulses her, and she leaves without 
               buying anything but the magazine.

               INT. HALLWAY -- NIGHT

               Janine walks along a hallway, stops at a door, knocks gently, 
               and then opens the door and walks in, obviously very familiar 
               with the occupant.

               INT. BETTS' APARTMENT -- NIGHT

               Janine enters Betts' apartment. Betts is sitting cross-legged 
               in leotards on the broadloom, a number of very large black-
               and-white photographs spread out in front of her. As she 
               speaks to Janine, she arranges and rearranges them.

               Other equipment and graphics of various kinds stuck on walls, 
               hidden in corners and lying on chairs and tables suggest 
               that Betts is in advertising and commercial graphics.

               Janine stands halfway in the door.

                                     JANINE
                         Hi.

                                     BETTS
                         Hi. Want a drink?

                                     JANINE
                         No thanks. Just wanted to tell you 
                         that Dr. St. Luc is coming up to see 
                         Nick at ten or so.

                                     BETTS
                         Was he nice to you?

               Janine nods.

                                     BETTS
                         Good. Well...
                              (takes a sip from a 
                              glass on the floor 
                              next to her)
                         I've ordered in some vrai cuisine 
                         française from Jean-Phillipe at the 
                         Côte d'Azur restaurant. Escargots in 
                         garlic butter... the works. They 
                         have lovely strong delivery boys who 
                         fight their way through sleet and 
                         hail and the gloom of night just to 
                         bring me my coq au vin. And after 
                         Dr. St. Luc has told you that there's 
                         nothing wrong with Nick that a 
                         vacation won't cure, and if Nick 
                         falls asleep early again, you just 
                         come on back here for company and a 
                         late supper. You hear me?

               Janine nods.

                                     BETTS
                         Now, I mean it. I always order enough 
                         for two and I'll just get fat and 
                         lonely if you don't show up.

               Janine wiggles her fingers goodbye and leaves.

               INT. HALLWAY -- NIGHT

               Janine walks down the hallway to her apartment, her Vogue 
               rolled up under her arm. She opens the door to her apartment -- 
               it's not locked -- and goes in.

               A moment after she's gone and closed the door, two children 
               about ten years old appear around a corner, giggling and 
               jostling each other. They approach Tudor's apartment.

                                     GIRL
                         C'mon, let's smoke one of the 
                         cigarettes right now. Your father'll 
                         never miss it.

                                     BOY
                         I can't, dummy. He'll see that the 
                         pack's been opened. You're such a 
                         dumbhead.

                                     GIRL
                         OK, then. I'm gonna go back to the 
                         store and buy my own pack and smoke 
                         'em all myself.

                                     BOY
                         Buy 'em with what, dumbhead?

                                     GIRL
                              (flipping open a milk 
                              box)
                         With some milk jugs I just happened 
                         to pick up on the way home.

               The first box she tries is empty. She advances to the next 
               and the next, finally finding one that has a jug in it. She 
               takes it and advances to Tudor's box, jug swinging, companion 
               trailing after her in admiration. She stops at Tudor's milk 
               box and flicks the door open.

               She looks inside, just about to reach for the jug that nestles 
               back in the shadows. Ugh! What's that?

               The boy takes a look. Inside the box a third parasite can 
               just be seen clinging to a three-quart white plastic milk 
               jug. The jug is smeared with blood. The box's inside door is 
               ajar. The TV set can be heard from inside the apartment.

                                     BOY
                         I dunno. Guess the milk went bad.
                              (shrugs)
                         It's still worth money.

               The girl hesitates for a second. Suddenly the parasite 
               twitches around to the front of the jug. The girl, startled, 
               slams the box door shut.

                                     GIRL
                         Jesus!

                                     BOY
                         Let's get outta here before somebody 
                         hears us!

               The children run off down the hallway together. After a few 
               seconds, the box door is nudged open again from the inside.

               INT. TUDOR'S APARTMENT -- NIGHT

               Janine sits down in front of the TV set. After a moment or 
               two she gets up, turns the set off, and flops back down on 
               the sofa with her Vogue.

               She doesn't notice a trail of bloody slime leading from the 
               bedroom to the inside door of the milk box.

               In the bedroom, a hand reaches down and pulls back a bedsheet 
               to reveal a naked abdomen. It is Tudor's abdomen, and he 
               reaches out with trembling fingers to touch a lump the size 
               of a chicken egg stretching the skin to one side of his navel.

               Tudor watches the lump in the muted light of his bedroom. He 
               gradually extends his hand toward the lump, which disappears 
               the instant it's touched.

                                     TUDOR
                              (delirious, voice 
                              strained, whispering)
                         Come here, boy. Here, boy, here.

               He taps and scratches the skin near his navel, as though 
               trying to lure a cat into attacking his fingers.

               He is propped up in bed, sweating profusely, half-dressed. 
               He looks weak and drained, but still manages to smile with 
               maniacal intensity, his eyes wide and bright.

                                     TUDOR
                         Come on, fella. Thataboy. You and 
                         me, we're gonna be friends, aren't 
                         we?

               We can now see that the sheets are twisted, the pillows half 
               off the bed. Tudor begins drumming on his abdomen.

               Gradually, cautiously, the lump under Tudor's skin returns. 
               He tries to seize the lump with his fingers and it shrinks 
               back, almost disappearing into his abdominal cavity again.

               Tudor seems disappointed.

                                     TUDOR
                         No, no, no. Don't run away, boy. I'm 
                         not going to hurt you. Not going to 
                         hurt you. We're going to be friends. 
                         Friends.

               The lump returns again. Gently, Tudor begins stroking it. 
               The lump seems to respond by pulsing slightly, the rhythm 
               strangely masturbatory.

                                     TUDOR
                              (soothingly)
                         Attaboy.
                              (closing his eyes in 
                              bliss and smiling 
                              again)
                         Attaboy.

               In the living room, Janine suddenly realizes that if the TV 
               set was on, Nick must be home.

               She gets to her feet and walks to the bedroom.

               Inside the bedroom, we see the door open. Light floods the 
               room as Janine enters. Janine sees Tudor sprawled out on the 
               bed.

                                     JANINE
                         Nick? I didn't know you were home. 
                         What's wrong? What are you doing? 
                         You're almost falling out of bed. 
                         How are you feeling?

               Tudor twists around to see who has spoken, eyes wide but now 
               unsmiling. With the same motion, he pulls the covers over 
               his abdomen to hide the lumps from Janine.

               Janine stands at the bedroom door for an instant, then 
               approaches the bedside. She moves as though her hands were 
               tied at her sides, as though she is quite consciously holding 
               herself together.

                                     JANINE
                              (tenderly, but with 
                              caution, as though 
                              expecting a blow)
                         Nick, does your stomach hurt? Can I 
                         see those bumps on your tummy, can 
                         I?

               She reaches out to pull back the covers again, but he rolls 
               away from her.

                                     TUDOR
                         Go away. Leave me alone.

               Janine straightens up. Her hands come up to her face and 
               tears well up in her eyes.

                                     JANINE
                              (frustrated)
                         Oh, why won't you let me help you?

               She turns and walks angrily out of the room, slamming the 
               door behind her.

               Tudor rolls over slowly on to his back, eyes wide and shining, 
               smiling again.

                                     TUDOR
                              (murmuring)
                         Attaboy, attaboy.

               INT. EXAMINATION ROOM -- NIGHT

               St. Luc is examining a very pretty young girl who sits on 
               the examination table in a hospital tunic.

                                     ST. LUC
                         OK, Dotty. Everything else seems to 
                         be fine. Now if it gives you any 
                         trouble at all, any sharp pain, any 
                         unusual discharge, you come and see 
                         me right away. They can be tricky 
                         sometimes.

               Dotty nods. OK, you can get dressed. We're all through.

               The girl starts to get dressed. St. Luc scribbles something 
               in her file and then takes it with him into the adjoining 
               office, closing the door behind him.

               INT. ST. LUC'S OFFICE -- NIGHT

               St. Luc sits at his desk and opens Parkins' file. Forsythe, 
               about twenty-three, earthy and humorous, comes in with an 
               armful of papers and records, which she throws in groups on 
               to St. Luc's desk.

                                     FORSYTHE
                              (distributing papers)
                         OK, Roger. Here's the stuff you 
                         wanted. Files on Horsefield, Tudor, 
                         Swinburne, and Velakofsky. Papers 
                         published by Hobbes, Linsky, and 
                         Lefebvre in a couple of issues of 
                         the Bulletin of the Canadian Medical 
                         Association and also the Journal of 
                         the American Medical Association. 
                         And, as an added extra, a couple of 
                         odds and ends from the files I helped 
                         compile before your time here, Doctor. 
                         I thought they might interest you.

                                     ST. LUC
                         That's great, Forsythe, great. Thanks.

                                     FORSYTHE
                         Do I get a kiss?

               St. Luc is absorbed in his papers and doesn't respond. 
               Forsythe prods his shoulder. He looks up at her.

                                     FORSYTHE
                         Kiss, kiss?

                                     ST. LUC
                         Uh, OK. Sure.

               They kiss, St. Luc making sure that it doesn't get too heavy.

                                     FORSYTHE
                         Another kiss?

                                     ST. LUC
                         C'mon, Forsythe. Are there any more 
                         on the list?

                                     FORSYTHE
                         No. Dotty's the last.

               The telephone rings. St. Luc picks it up.

                                     ST. LUC
                         Yes?

                                     ROLLO (V.O.)
                         That you, Rog?

                                     ST. LUC
                              (not recognizing the 
                              voice)
                         Yes?

                                     ROLLO (V.O.)
                         It's me, Rollo Linsky. Remember me?

                                     ST. LUC
                         Rollo! How'sa boy? I was just thinking 
                         about you.

               Realizing that the conversation is likely to be a long one, 
               Forsythe gets off the desk and walks over to a metal locker 
               in the corner, which she opens.

               Inside are her street clothes. She begins to take off her 
               nurse's uniform in full view of St. Luc, not being obvious 
               about the distraction she's providing, but not taking pains 
               to hurry dressing or be modest either.

               In the scene that follows we cut among three basic things: 
               Rollo in his lab, talking and eating; St. Luc in his office, 
               watching Forsythe get undressed and then dressed; and Hobbes's 
               notes and scribblings, which do not necessarily have to be 
               on the screen long enough to be completely read. Hobbes's 
               notes are there more to convince the viewer that they exist 
               and to provide flavor than to transfer information.

                                     ST. LUC
                         Been glancing at some of your 
                         publications on your work with Hobbes.

               INT. ROLLO'S LAB -- NIGHT

               In his lab, Rollo sits at the gynecological table abandoned 
               by Hobbes. Rollo is using it as an auxiliary desk.

               On the table are several opened waxed-paper packages of beef 
               knishes and accessories. There are also several old cardboard 
               shoeboxes, some still tied with string, some opened and 
               overflowing with papers of all kinds: Hobbes's private notes.

                                     ROLLO
                              (eating a knish)
                         Yeah, well, I'm flattered, but you 
                         won't find any real meat in them.

                                     ST. LUC (V.O.)
                         No? How come?

                                     ROLLO
                              (shuffling papers)
                         Listen, Rog. I knew Hobbes was funny, 
                         you know? I told you that. But I 
                         didn't really know just how funny he 
                         was. See... when he kicked off, they 
                         sent all the personal secret stuff 
                         they found to his mother -- she's 
                         still alive but just barely -- and 
                         she sent everything she thought was 
                         medical to me here at the lab. I'm 
                         Hobbes's partner, right?
                              (laughs sardonically)
                         Anyway, I've been going through his 
                         papers, and what they add up to is 
                         this: Hobbes was shafting us all, 
                         me, the university, the foundations 
                         and the councils, the private labs, 
                         everybody. We never really knew what 
                         it was we were working on. Hobbes 
                         gave us each a few crumbs, but he 
                         was the only one who knew what the 
                         whole loaf would look like.

               INT. ST. LUC'S OFFICE -- NIGHT

               St. Luc watches as Forsythe rolls her stockings down. He 
               shuffles through Hobbes's publications.

                                     ST. LUC
                         OK, I bite. What does it look like?

               INT. ROLLO'S LAB -- NIGHT

                                     ROLLO
                         It looks like -- and I quote -- 'a 
                         disease to save man from his mind.'

                                     ST. LUC (V.O.)
                         I don't get it.

                                     ROLLO
                         Lemme clarify for you.

               Rollo pauses to wash down some knish with a can of Coca-Cola.

               INT. ST. LUC'S OFFICE -- NIGHT

               Forsythe catches St. Luc watching her dress and smiles. St. 
               Luc swivels back to his files.

               INT. ROLLO'S LAB -- NIGHT

               Rollo searches through Hobbes's notes to find the relevant 
               quotes. As he does so, he drops a few crumbs of knish on the 
               page and his plump fingers brush the crumbs away, smearing 
               some meat over the words.

                                     ROLLO
                         Hobbes thought that man is an animal 
                         that thinks too much, an animal that 
                         has lost touch with his instinct, 
                         his 'primal self'... in other words, 
                         too much brain and not enough guts. 
                         And what he came up with to help our 
                         guts along was a human parasite that 
                         is... lemme find it here... 'a 
                         combination of aphrodisiac and 
                         venereal disease, a modern version 
                         of the satyr's tongue.'

               Rollo pauses and flips to a new note with the heading 
               ANNABELLE underlined in red: 'She is becoming a new creature 
               before my eyes. It is like living at the Dawn of Creation. I 
               am euphoric, I am in ecstasy.'

                                     ROLLO
                         But the important thing for you is 
                         this: Hobbes used Annabelle as a 
                         guinea pig. He implanted her with 
                         the thing. I figure that once the 
                         parasites took, Annabelle went 
                         berserk. I dunno what she did, but 
                         Hobbes wasn't ready for it. He had 
                         to kill her. And he wasn't trying to 
                         burn her, he was burning them, all 
                         of them.

               INT. ST. LUC'S OFFICE -- NIGHT

               St. Luc watches Forsythe, who is halfway through getting her 
               street clothes on. He toys with the Velakofsky file, which 
               contains abdominal X-rays showing dark, blurred masses inside 
               the abdominal cavity.

                                     ST. LUC
                         He didn't make it.

                                     ROLLO (V.O.)
                         Huh?

                                     ST. LUC
                         Maybe Hobbes didn't know it, but 
                         Annabelle was a pretty popular girl 
                         around Starliner Towers. I've got 
                         three men here, maybe four, who're 
                         hosting large, free-moving, apparently 
                         pathogenic, abdominal growths that 
                         nobody I've tried can identify. You 
                         were next on my list.

               INT. ROLLO'S LAB -- NIGHT

                                     ROLLO
                         I'd kinda like to come over there 
                         and have a look at one of these guys.

                                     ST. LUC (V.O.)
                         I've got a date with one of them at 
                         ten. Can you make it?

                                     ROLLO
                         Yeah.
                              (pause)
                         Ah, I don't want to panic you or 
                         anything, but, I mean, the way Hobbes 
                         designed them, they're supposed to 
                         get out of hand real quick, so you 
                         don't have much time to think about 
                         what's happening to you. Once they 
                         decide to start pumping all those 
                         dynamite juices into the old blood 
                         stream... I dunno. But if you see 
                         some people doing kind of compulsive, 
                         maybe even bizarre sexual things...

                                     ST. LUC (V.O.)
                              (laughing: he doesn't 
                              take this aspect too 
                              seriously)
                         Yeah? What do I do then?

                                     ROLLO
                         I dunno. Try tranquilizers. Once you 
                         can get at them, there's a lotta 
                         stuff you can use. I'll bring a 
                         bagful. It's just the standard 
                         tropical kit. But the trick is to 
                         get at them.

               INT. ST. LUC'S OFFICE -- NIGHT

               Forsythe has finished dressing and is waiting for St. Luc to 
               get off the phone.

                                     ST. LUC
                         OK. It's apartment 1009, South Tower, 
                         Starliner Towers. May as well go 
                         there directly.

                                     ROLLO (V.O.)
                         OK, Rog. See you at ten.

               St. Luc hangs up.

                                     FORSYTHE
                         Roger? If you're going to be staying 
                         here anyway, why don't you come up 
                         to my place for a late supper?

                                     ST. LUC
                         Meeting Rollo at Tudor's. Might take 
                         a while.

                                     FORSYTHE
                              (innocently)
                         Doesn't matter to me how late it is. 
                         I can keep it warm.

               St. Luc pushes his papers aside for a moment and stretches 
               in his swivel chair.

                                     FORSYTHE
                         Anything wrong?

                                     ST. LUC
                         No. I don't think so.

                                     FORSYTHE
                         Well? Supper at my place?

                                     ST. LUC
                         OK. But late.

                                     FORSYTHE
                              (happy because she 
                              knows she can get 
                              him to stay overnight)
                         Great! Go back to your files. Bye.

               She leaves, closing the door behind her. St. Luc swivels 
               thoughtfully in his chair for a second or two, then turns 
               back to his files.

               INT. RECEPTION AREA -- NIGHT

               Forsythe walks through the darkened and deserted reception 
               area to the elevators. Through the main doors we see a 
               delivery van parked in the main driveway.

               INT. MAIN DOORS -- NIGHT

               A young man aged about twenty-five -- Kurt, the delivery 
               boy, dark, intense, bearded, his manner as stiff and formal 
               as the tuxedo that he wears -- rolls a restaurant serving 
               cart toward the main doors. He has obviously just come from 
               the van outside, which is emblazoned with the words 
               'Restaurant Côte d'Azur'.

               The doorman smiles and opens the door for Kurt, obviously 
               familiar with the restaurant. Kurt takes great care as he 
               lifts the cart slightly so that it clears the doormats. On 
               the cart's two levels is an elaborate array of silver serving 
               vessels and utensils.

               INT. HALLWAY -- NIGHT

               Elevator doors slide open and Kurt steps out, pushing his 
               cart. He walks down the hallway looking for Betts's apartment. 
               After he has passed a few doors he approaches one which is 
               slightly ajar.

               As Kurt approaches, the door opens wider to reveal the old 
               woman from the laundry room. She is no longer wearing her 
               dumpy laundry clothes, however, but is dressed in a 
               translucent nightgown and wears a grotesque amount of make-
               up. She is careful to keep half her face hidden behind the 
               door.

               Kurt notices her but chooses to ignore her. He is just 
               approaching her when she calls to him.

                                     OLD WOMAN
                         I'm hungry!

               Kurt keeps on moving. He is now just passing her door. The 
               old woman edges out from behind the door a bit more.

                                     OLD WOMAN
                         I'm hungry!

               Kurt can't resist turning to look at her, although he keeps 
               moving. When he looks her in the eye, she eases out slightly 
               from behind the door to reveal that half her face has been 
               horribly burned by the laundry-room parasite, the eye melted 
               shut, the nostril drooping.

               Kurt is so stunned that he slows. The old woman speaks softly.

                                     OLD WOMAN
                         Hungry for love. Hungry for love.

               She suddenly reaches out and grabs Kurt by his tux with both 
               hands and, with tremendous energy, jerks him back into her 
               apartment and slams the door closed with a vicious kick.

               Kurt's cart remains out in the hallway, the food steaming.

               INT. BETTS' APARTMENT -- NIGHT

               In her dining room, Betts mixes herself a drink and checks 
               her watch. She takes a sip, then goes into the bathroom and 
               bends over the bathtub, having balanced her drink on the 
               edge of the tub.

               From inside the drain of the tub we see Betts place the plug 
               in the plughole.

               Betts turns on the water, adjusting the proportion of hot to 
               cold until she gets it exactly the way she wants it, then 
               gets undressed.

               She wraps a thick and colorful towel around her and goes out 
               to the living room with her drink in hand. In the living 
               room, she arranges her photos in a new order, props them up 
               against the sofa, changes them around again.

               Back in the bathroom, Betts checks the temperature of the 
               water by swishing her hand around in it. The water drums 
               heavily on the floor of the tub. Betts puts her drink on the 
               edge of the tub and turns the water off.

               She now drops her towel on to the bathmat and steps into the 
               tub. She reaches over the edge of the tub to straighten her 
               sandals on the bathmat, then picks up her drink and stretches 
               back. She takes a big slug of her drink. Her toes curl in 
               pleasure.

               The drain plug begins to jerk and twitch, as though something 
               were trying to push it out from inside the drain.

               Betts sinks down in the water until her hair, short as it 
               is, begins to float a bit.

               The drain plug begins to jerk more and more violently until 
               it is pushed right out of its plug hole. The water begins to 
               run out of the drain, but only in a slight trickle -- the 
               drain pipe is blocked by a soft, spongy body.

               Betts rolls her head back and forth across the back of the 
               tub, smiling, relaxed, enjoying the sensation.

               One of the parasite's stubby tentacles slowly appears, probing 
               out of the drain hole. Then another appears, then another.

               Betts puts down her drink on the tub's edge and reaches for 
               the soap and washcloth. Her eyes are half-closed and a smile 
               still flickers about her lips. The sound of water suddenly 
               rushing out of the drain in volume rouses Betts out of her 
               reverie.

               She sits up and looks down toward the plug end of the tub. 
               The parasite is crawling toward her up the middle of the 
               tub, almost touching her legs, which are pressed together 
               against one side of the tub. The water is becoming pink with 
               the blood that diffuses through it.

               Betts' mouth opens slowly and her eyes are wide. Her reactions 
               are obviously being confused by the drinks she has recently 
               had.

               Under the water, now very shallow, the parasite's tentacles 
               touch Betts's thighs.

               Betts tries to scream but can't. The parasite suckers its 
               way between Betts' thighs. She screams a silent scream in 
               the tub, her mouth wide open, her head rolling from side to 
               side. The only sounds are the thrashing of her legs in the 
               water and the gurgle of the drain.

               With a spasm that shakes her whole body, Betts throws her 
               arms wide and knocks her glass off the edge of the tub and 
               on to the tiles of the bathroom floor. The glass shatters. 
               After a moment or two of further silent struggle, Betts arches 
               her back, then falls into a semi-conscious stupor, slumping 
               motionless in the tub.

               INT. TUDOR'S APARTMENT -- NIGHT

               Nicholas Tudor lies flat on his back in bed on top of the 
               covers. The physical state of his face, ghastly and 
               cadaverous, is in sharp contrast to his expression, which is 
               ecstatic, beatific, Madonna-like.

               Tudor's hands rest on his abdomen in a posture often 
               associated with pregnant women. Between his hands, in the 
               area around the navel, three lumps shift beneath the skin, 
               changing positions and pulsing rhythmically.

               As they move, Tudor makes little delirious crooning sounds, 
               a parody of a lullaby.

               In the living room, Janine sits on the couch agitatedly 
               flipping through her Vogue, now wearing large, fashionable 
               glasses with thick, tinted prescription lenses. She can't 
               seem to get into doing anything until St. Luc comes.

               She gets up and turns the TV on again, deliberately turning 
               up the volume to an uncomfortable level.

               INT. HALLWAY -- NIGHT

               An old man and his wife, the Spergazzis, are taking their 
               late-night constitutional through the halls of the South 
               Tower.

               Their arms are linked and they both walk with the aid of 
               canes, the ultra-modern aluminum kind with four rubber-tipped 
               prongs at the end.

                                     MR. SPERGAZZI
                         Lovely, lovely evening. Very quiet, 
                         eh?

               Mrs. Spergazzi nods and smiles, patting Mr. Spergazzi's hand. 
               They round a corner which leads them down the stretch of 
               hall which passes by Tudor's door.

               As they approach Tudor's door they notice a plastic milk jug 
               lying in the hall just below the open milk-chute door.

               Mrs. Spergazzi detaches herself from her husband and bends 
               down with difficulty to pick up the jug.

                                     MRS. SPERGAZZI
                         Eh, the children in this apartment, 
                         they're such little thieves. You 
                         have to put a lock on everything.

               She puts the jug back in the milk chute. She notices the 
               blood smeared on it just a second before the parasite in the 
               chute fastens itself to her wrist with its suckers.

               She stares at her wrist in astonishment. She is wearing the 
               parasite like some monstrous, spongy, oozing wristwatch. She 
               tries to shake the thing off. It can't be dislodged. She 
               turns in disbelief to her husband and then screams at the 
               top of her lungs.

               Mr. Spergazzi lifts his cane and tries to strike the thing 
               with the cane's prongs. The force of his blow throws him off 
               balance and he falls, dragging his wife down with him.

               Mrs. Spergazzi moans in pain and terror. Her husband manages 
               to get to his knees and begins to smash at the thing with 
               his cane. White burning fluid begins to squirt everywhere. 
               Mrs Spergazzi's forearm begins to smoke, bubble, and dissolve. 
               She becomes hysterical.

               Mr. Spergazzi continues to smash away at the thing, now with 
               some success.

               INT. FORSYTHE'S APARTMENT -- NIGHT

               In the kitchen, a thick paperbound book called Guide to 
               Gourmet Cooking lies open and face down on the kitchen counter 
               next to the sink. There are a couple of pots and pans heating 
               on the stove.

               Forsythe picks up the book, then opens one of the pots to 
               check something. She is obviously taking a lot of care with 
               St. Luc's late supper. She puts the lid back on the pot, 
               reads a bit more, then checks the time on an electric clock 
               on the counter.

               She opens the oven door, then takes a bone-handled carving 
               fork from a carving set and begins to prod at a roast in a 
               ceramic roasting dish.

               Someone knocks on the door. Forsythe leaves her oven and 
               goes to answer it, carving fork in hand.

               She opens the door. Kresimir Sviben stands in the hallway, 
               eyes wide, insane smile on his face. He looks at Forsythe as 
               though she were a piece of steak.

                                     FORSYTHE
                         Yes?

               Kresimir doesn't answer. He begins to drool, his mouth working 
               as though in anticipation of a meal. Forsythe gets a little 
               nervous.

                                     FORSYTHE
                         Can I... can I help you?

               Kresimir approaches. He is visibly shaking.

                                     KRESIMIR
                              (speaking with 
                              difficulty)
                         Yes... you can... help me.

               Without warning, he lunges for Forsythe, who vainly tries to 
               slam the door in his face. Kresimir pushes his way past the 
               door and grabs Forsythe by the back of the head, trying to 
               kiss her and drooling.

               Forsythe breaks away and runs toward the bathroom, intending 
               to lock herself in. Kresimir throws himself at her legs, 
               managing to grab one of her feet. She doesn't fall, but holds 
               on to a cabinet and tries to pull free.

               Kresimir begins to climb up her body. Forsythe, terrified 
               and gasping for breath, plunges the long, curved prongs of 
               the carving fork into Kresimir's shoulder. He screams with 
               pain and loosens his grip on Forsythe long enough for her to 
               pull away, leaving her apron and part of her dress in 
               Kresimir's hands.

               She runs for the door and is gone.

               Kresimir, still on his knees, holds the apron and the piece 
               of dress to his face, breathing in Forsythe's fragrance. He 
               begins to shuffle toward the door on his knees, kissing the 
               clothes in his hands, mumbling and moaning.

                                     KRESIMIR
                         Oh, my darling, I worship, I worship 
                         at the shrine of your body, your 
                         body, your body, oh, your body...

               INT. BETTS'S BATHROOM -- NIGHT

               Betts lies slumped in her bathtub, her hair matted and damp, 
               her eyes open and staring. Her mouth begins to work in a 
               very sensual way, and she begins to drool slightly.

               The tub is completely empty now except for the scum of blood 
               and soap. The smashed glass is scattered all over the floor 
               near the base of the tub.

               Zombie-like, Betts rises from the tub and steps out on to 
               the floor, her feet missing the bathmat. The crunch and snap 
               of her bare feet on the broken glass are heightened abnormally 
               by the tiled echo chamber of the bathroom.

               The steps Betts takes toward the medicine cabinet leave bloody 
               prints on the floor.

               Betts takes out various bottles and plastic cases and tubes 
               from the medicine cabinet and begins to apply make-up to her 
               face with mechanical precision.

               INT. ST. LUC'S OFFICE -- NIGHT

               St. Luc is reading a section of one of Hobbes's medical papers 
               in preparation for examining Tudor later on. The section we 
               see says: '...thus the theoretical organism we are now 
               considering would exhibit what I choose to call "compressed 
               evolution." This in effect means that each generation of the 
               said organism would be better adapted to inhabit and to 
               control the behavior of its host...'

               Suddenly Forsythe bursts in, out of breath, semi-hysterical, 
               tearful.

               St. Luc rises from his chair and Forsythe throws herself on 
               him, sobbing.

                                     ST. LUC
                         Forsythe, Forsythe! What's wrong? 
                         What's happened?

                                     FORSYTHE
                         A man... I think I recognized him... 
                         a man who lives here. He just...
                              (breaking down)
                         ...he just attacked me for no reason 
                         at all. I just opened the door... I 
                         was making supper for you, and he 
                         grabbed me, he tried to kiss me...

               St. Luc hugs Forsythe for a moment, then holds her away from 
               him so that he can get some information out of her.

                                     ST. LUC
                         Where is he now? Do you know?

                                     FORSYTHE
                         I think I... I think I killed him. I 
                         stabbed him with something and he 
                         fell.

                                     ST. LUC
                         Will you be OK now? I've got to go 
                         to your place to see if he's still 
                         there. I've got to see if it's... if 
                         it's what we both think it is.

                                     FORSYTHE
                         Oh, no! You're not leaving me here 
                         all alone. I'm going with you.

               St. Luc hesitates for a second, then grabs his black leather 
               doctor's bag.

                                     ST. LUC
                         OK, c'mon.

               They leave.

               INT. ELEVATOR -- NIGHT

               Inside a descending elevator, a middle-aged woman and her 
               teen-aged daughter flip through a magazine together. The 
               elevator sinks toward the ground floor of the South Tower, 
               then slows and stops. They both look up at the floor numbers. 
               It's not their floor.

               The doors slide open. Nobody seems to be waiting. The mother 
               pushes the CLOSE DOOR button, a bit impatiently. A hand 
               holding a crêpe oozing red jam and sugar reaches around into 
               the elevator.

               The two women cringe, suddenly afraid. Kurt, the delivery 
               boy, steps around and into the elevator, smiling broadly, 
               eyes wide and glistening. He drools slightly. The doors slide 
               closed. Kurt offers one crêpe to each woman.

               INT. MAIN DOORS -- NIGHT

               The doorman sits beside the intercom board reading another 
               Harlequin Nurse Romance when he happens to glance up and 
               notice the elevator flashers which indicate a stuck elevator.

               He sighs, shakes his head -- always something going wrong -- 
               stuffs the pocketbook into his jacket, and gets up, taking 
               out a huge ring of keys from his pocket as he does so.

               He walks over to the metal control panel sunk into the wall 
               between the elevators and opens it with one of the keys on 
               the ring. Then, checking to make sure which elevator is the 
               stuck one, he plays with a switch which manually overrides 
               the floor selector and brings the elevator down.

               The doorman watches as the numbers show that the elevator is 
               finally coming down. He stands by, waiting to see who or 
               what has caused the elevator to stay at one floor for so 
               long, jingling his keys, trying to look stern and 
               authoritarian.

               The doors spring open. Kurt stands at the back of the 
               elevator, one arm around the young girl, who hugs him tightly. 
               The girl is finishing the last bit of one of the crêpes, 
               sucking her fingers deliciously.

               The mother sits slumped in the opposite corner, her coat 
               open, her dress torn, bruises on her face. She struggles to 
               her feet. Kurt and the girl are ignoring her.

               The doorman is nonplussed. He hesitates, then makes a move 
               toward the elevator, intending to help the woman to her feet.

                                     DOORMAN
                         Here, here. What is this all about? 
                         What's the matter with you? What are 
                         you doing in there?

               The woman suddenly lunges at the doorman and tries to pull 
               him down. Kurt detaches himself from the girl and joins her. 
               They giggle and drool all over the doorman as they pull him 
               down and pin him to the floor.

               The daughter, still licking her fingers, slowly approaches 
               the doorman.

                                     DOORMAN
                         Hey, that's enough, enough of this 
                         nonsense! What is this?
                              (Etc.)

               The daughter kneels at the doorman's feet, then crawls over 
               him, her mouth working, drooling. She lowers her lips over 
               his, Kurt making it impossible for the doorman to move his 
               head out of the way.

               INT. HALLWAY -- NIGHT

               Forsythe and St. Luc are hurrying to Forsythe's apartment to 
               see if Kresimir is still there. As they round a corner, they 
               see the Spergazzis coming toward them, the old lady hobbling 
               and hysterical, the old man helping her walk as best he can, 
               trying to maintain some kind of calm.

               When Spergazzi sees St. Luc, he lifts his four-pronged cane 
               and waves it around to get attention.

                                     MR. SPERGAZZI
                         Hey, Doctor, Doctor! Please. Help 
                         us!

               St. Luc and Forsythe rush over and help to support the 
               slumping Mrs. Spergazzi.

                                     ST. LUC
                         What happened?

                                     MR. SPERGAZZI
                              (tipping his hat as 
                              he introduces himself 
                              even in the midst of 
                              chaos)
                         Please pardon me. I am Niccolo 
                         Spergazzi. I am a resident here. I 
                         don't know... we were walking in the 
                         hallway and... Cabiria... my wife... 
                         she was attacked by this thing... 
                         here, on her arm.

               Spergazzi shows St. Luc his wife's forearm, which has been 
               badly burned by the parasite's animal-tissue solvent. As 
               soon as St. Luc starts prodding her arm, Mrs. Spergazzi starts 
               to wail in Italian. Spergazzi tries to soothe her as St. Luc 
               examines her carefully.

                                     MR. SPERGAZZI
                         It's all right, cara mia. What's one 
                         more scar to an old lady, eh? You'll 
                         be OK.

               The old lady wails even more.

                                     ST. LUC
                         Where is this thing that attacked 
                         your wife?

                                     MR. SPERGAZZI
                         I hit it. I hit it with my cane. 
                         Then I carry it on the cane and I 
                         throw it down to the incinerator, 
                         down to the garbage.

               St. Luc hands his bag to Forsythe.

                                     ST. LUC
                              (to Spergazzi)
                         This is Nurse Forsythe. She's a nurse, 
                         you understand me?

               Spergazzi nods. St. Luc turns to Forsythe.

                                     ST. LUC
                         Go back to their apartment with them 
                         and treat her for second-degree burns. 
                         It'll have to do for now.
                              (to Spergazzi)
                         What's your number? The number of 
                         your apartment?

                                     MR. SPERGAZZI
                         We live in 703.

                                     ST. LUC
                              (to Forsythe)
                         OK. I'll meet you back there. Don't 
                         leave until I get there. Lock the 
                         door and don't open it except for 
                         me. OK?

                                     FORSYTHE
                         But where are you going?

                                     ST. LUC
                              (walking away)
                         Down to the incinerator.

               INT. TUDOR'S APARTMENT -- NIGHT

               Janine dozes fitfully on the couch, her glasses fallen on to 
               the carpet, her Vogue crumpled underneath her. Tudor's voice 
               calls to her from the bedroom. It has an eerie, wailing tone 
               to it.

                                     TUDOR
                         Janine. Janine. Come here. Come into 
                         the bedroom, Janine.

               Tudor keeps calling until Janine wakes up with a start and 
               jumps to her feet, still half asleep. She rubs her eyes and 
               walks to the bedroom.

               Janine opens the bedroom door. From her point of view we see 
               a dark, blurry figure sitting on the edge of the bed.

                                     JANINE
                         Nick? Are you up? I can't see a thing, 
                         I took my contacts out.

               Tudor speaks from the bed without moving.

                                     TUDOR
                         Hello, darling. I feel wonderful. 
                         Come and sit beside me, beside me on 
                         the bed.

               Janine hesitates for a second, then walks to the bed and 
               sits down. She can now see that Tudor, although pale and 
               sickly, is smiling ecstatically. He puts an arm around Janine, 
               who reacts stiffly.

                                     TUDOR
                         Do you want to make love? You're 
                         absolutely beautiful, those eyes, 
                         that expression. You're absolutely 
                         the most sexy thing alive. Do you 
                         want to make love?

                                     JANINE
                              (slightly repulsed)
                         Nick, you're so strange...

               Tudor begins to unbutton his shirt with one hand, his other 
               still gripping Janine tightly.

                                     TUDOR
                         You will make love to me, won't you, 
                         Janine? Won't you make love to me? 
                         You start it. Won't you? I think 
                         I've forgotten how to start.

                                     JANINE
                              (now in tears)
                         Oh, Nick, Nick... I can't take this.

                                     TUDOR
                         Please, Janine. Please, 
                         pleasepleaseplease, Janine Janine 
                         JanineJanineJanine...

               Janine hesitantly helps Tudor remove his shirt and begins to 
               caress him in a perfunctory way, tears in her eyes. Her 
               caresses make Tudor moan with pleasure.

                                     TUDOR
                         Love me. Oh, Janine, you're so 
                         beautiful. You're my wife. Mmm. You're 
                         my wife.

               Janine's hand sweeps across Tudor's abdomen. She pulls her 
               hand away, startled, obviously having just felt a few of 
               Tudor's lumps.

               She looks up at Tudor's face with a mixture of horror and 
               wonder in her eyes. Tudor is confused; he doesn't want the 
               caresses to stop.

                                     TUDOR
                              (pleading)
                         You're my wife, Janine. Please make 
                         love to me.

               INT. SPERGAZZI APARTMENT -- NIGHT

               The Spergazzi apartment is very heavily decorated in the 
               Mediterranean European Catholic style, featuring lots of 
               plastic and plaster Madonnas, calendars with Christ exposing 
               his bleeding heart, etc.

               Mrs. Spergazzi lies on an overstuffed couch with her wrist 
               held up for Forsythe to bandage after she coats it with a 
               healing gel. Mrs. Spergazzi wears a suffering-martyr 
               expression. Mr. Spergazzi leans over the back of the couch 
               patting his wife's other hand solicitously.

               INT. INCINERATOR ROOM -- NIGHT

               The steel door at the top of a concrete flight of stairs 
               swings open and St. Luc appears. He quickly negotiates the 
               steps and opens the steel door at the bottom which leads to 
               the incinerator room.

               Once inside, St. Luc grabs the poker hanging from an iron 
               hook sunk into the wall of the incinerator, slides open the 
               bolt on the door and opens it.

               He begins to probe around inside the incinerator oven but 
               can't really see very much. He looks around and notices the 
               superintendent's flashlight stuck up on top of a heating 
               pipe. St. Luc takes down the flashlight, switches it on, and 
               continues his search for the dead parasite.

               INT. TUDOR'S APARTMENT -- NIGHT

               Tudor lies on top of Janine on their bed. Over his shoulder, 
               Janine's face is visible, eyes wide open and full of tears. 
               She tries to push Tudor away, but he resists.

                                     JANINE
                              (frantically)
                         No, no. Nick, please. Stop. Let's 
                         stop. I... I want to put my contacts 
                         in... I can't see anything...

               Tudor pulls her back to him, and finally she is forced to 
               batter him away with her fists and slip off the edge of the 
               bed. Tudor glares after her.

                                     TUDOR
                              (in a mechanical whine)
                         Make love to me, make love to me, 
                         love, love to me...

                                     JANINE
                              (trying to buy time)
                         I want to be able to see us, Nick. 
                         I... I'm going to go into the bathroom 
                         now and put in my contacts, OK? Is 
                         that OK?
                              (pleading with him to 
                              believe her)
                         I want to be able to see us when we 
                         make love, OK?

               Tudor's eyes are staring right out of his head and his mouth 
               is wide open. He gasps for breath. He stares at Janine for a 
               second, then buries his face in the blankets, twisting them 
               in his hands and moaning.

               Janine bursts into tears and turns away from the bed, heading 
               for the bathroom.

               In the bathroom, Janine starts to shake, on the verge of 
               hysteria. Distractedly, she goes through the motions of 
               putting her contact lenses in: opens the medicine-cabinet 
               door, takes out the lens container, takes out the bottles of 
               wetting and soaking solutions, opens the lens container. 
               Suddenly, Tudor wails terribly, like a hound, from the 
               bedroom.

                                     TUDOR
                              (heart-rending wail)
                         Ooooooooooooooooo!

               Janine turns to the door, turns back to the lenses, dumps 
               both lenses out into her hand, begins to squirt solution on 
               them. She has decided to try to ignore Tudor.

                                     TUDOR
                              (wailing)
                         Janine, Janine, Janinnnnnneeee!

               Janine can no longer pretend that she doesn't hear him. 
               Closing her hand around the two lenses, she runs out of the 
               bathroom.

               Tudor lies outstretched on the bed in the darkness. His lips 
               move silently, spasmically, as though in sleep, twitching in 
               an abnormal, insect fashion. There is a swelling in his 
               throat, almost as though he has developed a goiter, which 
               swells and contracts rhythmically.

               Janine appears in the doorway.

                                     JANINE
                              (a strangled half-
                              whisper)
                         I'm here, Nick. Janine is here.

               After a pause, she walks into the room.

               She climbs on to the bed and settles down. She puts her face 
               very close to Tudor's. For the moment, his face is 
               expressionless, but his neck is swollen just under the jaw.

               Janine sighs deeply, trying not to panic. Her eyes narrow 
               suddenly -- she hasn't got her lenses in and her gaze is 
               myopic -- as she notices something odd.

               There is a bit of black something, a thread, in the corner 
               of Tudor's mouth. Janine moves closer to it. The black thing, 
               like the tip of an insect's leg, twitches.

               Janine reaches out to brush the thing off Tudor's lip. As 
               her fingers brush by, the leg twitches back inside Tudor's 
               mouth.

               Janine jerks back in horror, her hands, balled into fists, 
               cover her own mouth as though to protect it from whatever 
               occupies Tudor's mouth.

               Gradually the thread reappears. Tudor's lips part slightly 
               to allow the emergence of the dark, viscous tentacle to which 
               the thread -- a hook used to hang on inside the body -- is 
               attached. The tentacle of the blood parasite probes its way 
               from between Tudor's lips.

               Janine is paralyzed with horror.

               The tentacle is now touching Tudor's chin, his cheek, the 
               tip of his nose.

               Janine's fists tighten even more. A glassy snap breaks the 
               silence. Janine lowers her hands dumbly and opens them. In 
               the right one, the one that held the contact lenses, are 
               incised two bloody circles where her fingers pressed the 
               lenses into her flesh until they snapped. The segmented lens 
               fragments glint in the tiny pools of blood.

               She tries to control the hysteria welling up inside her. She 
               eases herself carefully over the side of the bed as the first 
               stubby tentacle is joined by another and another. She moves 
               a fraction of an inch at a time, almost hypnotized by the 
               movement of the tentacles.

               The hooks of the tentacles are now set into Tudor's chin and 
               cheeks, and the tentacles draw taut as something attempts to 
               draw itself out of his body. His throat bulges, his cheeks 
               swell as the tentacles contract. His lips are gradually forced 
               apart as the quivering, moist shape emerges. His mouth is 
               opened to jaw-breaking width as the creature slowly exposes 
               itself to the dim light of the bedroom.

               Janine's eyes are wide with terror. She utters a gurgling 
               cry and runs, stumbling, from the bedroom. She dashes through 
               the living room and reaches the door to the hallway, 
               whimpering in terror as she fumbles at the lock and the 
               doorknob, finally managing to swing the door open.

               INT. HALLWAY -- NIGHT

               Janine runs down a hallway that leads to Betts's apartment, 
               sobbing and stumbling. She gets to Betts's door and opens it 
               without hesitation.

               INT. BETTS' APARTMENT -- NIGHT

               Janine enters Betts' apartment. She looks around for Betts.

                                     JANINE
                         Betts? Betts? It's me.

               She catches sight of Betts standing out on the balcony, 
               looking across at the North Tower's lights. Betts turns 
               slowly. She is wearing immaculate but very extreme make-up. 
               Janine is slightly taken aback -- it's not Betts' style.

               Betts smiles and opens her arms to Janine.

               INT. ROLLO'S LAB -- NIGHT

               Rollo puts his jacket on, picks up his doctor's bag and a 
               manila envelope jammed solid with Hobbes's notes, and leaves 
               his lab, turning off the lights and locking the door behind 
               him.

               EXT. STREET IN FRONT OF ROLLO'S LAB -- NIGHT

               Rollo gets into his car, which is parked in a now empty 
               parking lot adjacent to the building in which his lab is 
               situated. His car is large and American and ostentatious, a 
               gold Cadillac Eldorado with options or equivalent.

               The car pulls out of the lot and on to the street.

               INT. HALLWAY -- NIGHT

               The doorman, drooling and twitching, locks the exit doors at 
               the end of one hallway. In one hand he holds an enormous 
               pair of cable cutters.

               INT. INCINERATOR ROOM -- NIGHT

               St. Luc continues to poke around inside the incinerator with 
               the poker. Finally his flashlight beam reveals the tattered 
               corpse of Spergazzi's parasite.

               Deftly manipulating the hook on the poker's tip, St. Luc 
               manages to pull the parasite out into the light. Garbage 
               comes rattling down the chute. When St. Luc flashes his light 
               into the oven, we see that the garbage consists of Betts' 
               French food, half-eaten, silver servers and all, the snails 
               being especially prominent. Insane giggles echo down the 
               chute, followed by the slam of the chute door somewhere 
               several floors above.

               St. Luc holds the thing up to the naked light bulb above the 
               incinerator. The light seems to go right through the parasite, 
               illuminating the twisted vascular system, reproductive organs, 
               etc.

               As St. Luc examines the creature, which is still impaled on 
               the hook of the poker, the door to the incinerator room opens 
               behind him. A large, hairy, muscular man enters the room and 
               approaches the oblivious St. Luc.

               The man slips his arms up under St. Luc's arms and kisses 
               him passionately on the neck. As soon as St. Luc realizes 
               what's happening, he smashes the man in the chest with his 
               elbow and pulls free.

               The man grabs St. Luc again, trying to kiss him on the mouth. 
               They struggle. St. Luc is thrown to the concrete floor. The 
               man tries to pin him down. St. Luc, on the verge of being 
               overpowered, smashes the man in the chest with the poker, 
               parasite still hooked into its tip.

               The man stands up unsteadily. St. Luc cracks him on the ankle 
               with the poker and he comes crashing down. The parasite corpse 
               is flung across the room, where it smacks wetly into the 
               wall and slides to the floor.

               St. Luc leaps to his feet and begins kicking the man in the 
               head. After a furious moment or two, he suddenly stops, drops 
               the poker, and stares at the body in horrified disbelief.

               St. Luc slowly backs away from the man's body, which is very 
               still and quietly oozes blood on to the damp concrete floor. 
               He bumps into the edge of the door left open by the man. The 
               collision seems to startle him out of his daze somewhat, and 
               he turns, himself scratched and bleeding, and staggers up 
               the basement steps.

               INT. SPERGAZZI'S APARTMENT -- NIGHT

               Forsythe waits impatiently for St. Luc. Mr. Spergazzi is 
               watching a variety show on TV and Mrs. Spergazzi is making 
               ravioli in the kitchen, more or less recovered from her 
               encounter with the parasite.

               Suddenly a piercing scream is heard from down the hall. Mr. 
               Spergazzi, hard of hearing, doesn't notice. The scream is 
               followed by bangs, crashes, and insane laughter and giggling.

               Mrs. Spergazzi comes out of the kitchen. She has heard the 
               noises. She and Forsythe look at each other for a moment, 
               then Forsythe goes to the door and slides the chain lock 
               into place. She then goes to the telephone to call the police.

                                     FORSYTHE
                              (into receiver)
                         Hello? Hello?

               She dials a few times, and clicks the receiver button. 
               Nothing. The phone is dead. She puts the receiver back on 
               the hook. Mrs. Spergazzi knows that something is very wrong. 
               She wrings her hands and begins to wail in Italian.

               INT. HALLWAY -- NIGHT

               In the hallway outside the Spergazzi apartment, a group of 
               giggling, drooling residents stand around a door.

               One of these residents is the superintendent, who is opening 
               the door with one of his set of master keys. The residents, 
               some of them women, giggle in anticipation. Once the door 
               has been opened, they all rush in, drooling and moaning.

               From inside the apartment we hear several muffled voices, at 
               first angry and indignant, then pleading and terrified. 
               Screams and crashes follow.

               INT. SPERGAZZI APARTMENT -- NIGHT

               Mrs. Spergazzi is getting hysterical; Mr. Spergazzi is trying 
               to calm her down by getting her to sit in front of the TV 
               set with him. But each time he pushes her down, she pops up 
               and begins wailing and moaning again.

               Forsythe paces back and forth, checks her watch, paces some 
               more. Finally, after a particularly noisy outburst by Mrs. 
               Spergazzi, Forsythe picks up the doctor's bag, unchains the 
               door, and leaves.

               Spergazzi hears the door slam and looks up.

                                     MR. SPERGAZZI
                         Miss! Nurse! Come back! Cabiria, she 
                         needs something...!

               He lapses back into Italian, trying vainly to calm his wife 
               down.

               INT. BETTS' APARTMENT -- NIGHT

               Betts and Janine are on the sofa, Janine with her head in 
               Betts's lap, Betts rocking Janine like a child.

                                     JANINE
                              (sobbing)
                         Oh, Betts, Betts, everything is so 
                         hideous. Everything dies and rots 
                         and disappears. I'm going to die, 
                         and you're going to die, and Nick...

               She breaks down.

               Betts is drowsy-eyed and smiling. She strokes Janine's hair.

                                     BETTS
                         There, there, there. It all gets 
                         sorted out in the genes and 
                         chromosomes. It's not for us to think 
                         about at all. It's not our problem 
                         at all, 'Nine. We're just here to 
                         exist and to have a good time. Exist 
                         and have a good time.
                              (pause)
                         Do I feel good, 'Nine? Do I feel 
                         good to you?

               Janine's eyes are red and she still sobs a bit as she speaks, 
               but she is obviously feeling a bit soothed.

                                     JANINE
                         Oh, you feel very good, Betts. You 
                         have such a cosy body. I'm jealous, 
                         I'm so skinny.

                                     BETTS
                              (casually, as though 
                              it were the most 
                              ordinary request in 
                              the world)
                         Make love to me, 'Nine? I want you 
                         to make love to me. Please, please 
                         make love to me.

               Janine twists around and looks up at Betts. There is something 
               in Betts' tone -- quite apart from what she is saying -- 
               that disturbs her, something that reminds her of her husband.

                                     JANINE
                         Betts! You can't really be saying 
                         that! You just can't!

               Betts smiles drowsily. She bends over Janine, turning her 
               head in her hands until they face each other. Betts lowers 
               her face toward Janine. Janine is wide-eyed, almost hypnotized 
               by Betts's strength, smile, and confidence.

                                     BETTS
                         Let's not talk any more, 'Nine, shall 
                         we? Let's kiss and make up. Let's 
                         kiss... kiss and make up, shall we? 
                         'Nine?

               Janine resists only slightly as Betts places her lips on 
               Janine's. After a pause, Betts suddenly opens her mouth wide 
               and presses her lips savagely against Janine's.

               She holds Janine's head firmly as they kiss. Janine struggles 
               for a moment, then opens her mouth as well.

               Her eyes are closed in passion, then suddenly open wide in 
               terror as Betts's throat swells like a goiter as a parasite 
               rushes up her throat toward Janine's open mouth. The parasite 
               begins to force its way into Janine's mouth and down her 
               throat. Janine gags and tries to pull away, but too late.

               INT. INCINERATOR ROOM -- NIGHT

               Forsythe runs down the steps which lead to the incinerator 
               and pulls open the steel door at the bottom. She begins to 
               look around for St. Luc.

                                     FORSYTHE
                         Roger? Roger, are you here?

               She suddenly stumbles across the body of the man St. Luc has 
               killed. She actually has to break her fall with her hands, 
               which slip in the man's blood. Horrified, she gets up and 
               backs away.

               The sounds of people moaning and laughing are coming from 
               everywhere. Forsythe finds herself up against a large door. 
               She tugs on the handle and it opens.

               INT. MAIN DOORS -- NIGHT

               St. Luc has made his way to the main doors and stands talking 
               to the rental agent, Merrick, who is leaning against the 
               intercom board with the doorman's pocketbook romance in one 
               hand.

               The agent looks perfectly normal, though he keeps wiping his 
               mouth unobtrusively with the back of his hand.

                                     MERRICK
                         ...haven't seen anything that looks 
                         like trouble at all. Just filling in 
                         for Walter... the doorman. But if 
                         you want me to call the police, I 
                         will.

               St. Luc is cautious but he seems to believe Merrick. He 
               presses the button which buzzes the Spergazzi apartment. 
               Nobody answers. A middle-aged man walks in. Worried, St. Luc 
               buzzes again.

                                     MAN
                         Apartment 307? Visiting my sister.

               Merrick smiles and opens the door for the man, who goes in 
               and takes the stairway up, preferring to walk.

               The intercom squawks and Spergazzi answers the buzzer.

                                     MR. SPERGAZZI
                         Yes? Who is there?

                                     ST. LUC
                         It's Dr. St. Luc, Mr Spergazzi. Let 
                         me speak to the nurse, please.

                                     MR. SPERGAZZI (V.O.)
                         Oh, but the nurse, she went away. I 
                         think she must go to look for you.

               St. Luc curses under his breath and makes a move toward the 
               door. Merrick smiles and pulls it open for him. St. Luc 
               disappears down the stairs leading to the incinerator.

               As the stairway doors close, the elevators slide open and a 
               young couple come out heading for the main doors, dressed to 
               go out to a late party.

               Before they reach the doors, Merrick slips through them and 
               meets the couple in the lobby. He smiles broadly as he 
               approaches them.

                                     MERRICK
                         Evening, Mr. Wolf, Miss Lewis. I 
                         wonder if I could talk to you for a 
                         second in my office?

                                     MISS LEWIS
                         Why don't you do something about all 
                         that noise? We like parties, but 
                         this is ridiculous.

                                     MERRICK
                         Well, there may be a connection. 
                         See, it's about your locker. 'Fraid 
                         somebody busted into it tonight.

                                     MISS LEWIS AND MR WOLF
                              (together)
                         Oh, no! What a drag!

                                     MERRICK
                         'Fraid so. I've got a few of the 
                         things they threw around in my office 
                         and if you could identify it...

               The couple turn, grumbling, and walk toward Merrick's office. 
               Merrick follows, wiping his mouth with the back of his hand.

               INT. RENTAL OFFICE -- NIGHT

               The young couple enter the rental office, Merrick following 
               close behind. Once they are all in, Merrick closes the door. 
               He rests against the door and drools copiously, then giggles.

               The young couple turn to look at him. Suddenly, three more 
               residents, two women and a man, all of them half naked, jump 
               down on them from the tops of large filing cabinets. The 
               residents begin to kiss and paw the couple. Merrick wipes 
               his mouth with the back of his hand and then throws himself 
               on top of the writhing mass.

               INT. GARAGE -- NIGHT

               Finding herself in the underground garage, Forsythe decides 
               to get in her car and drive out. She finds her car -- a Datsun 
               or Toyota -- gets in, throws the doctor's bag in the back, 
               and drives up the ramp leading to the sliding garage doors.

               The car rolls over the cable which normally activates the 
               doors, but nothing happens. Forsythe puts the car in reverse 
               and backs over the cable, but still nothing happens. She 
               sits with the car idling, trying to figure out what to do 
               next.

               Suddenly the driver's door of her car is yanked open and the 
               doorman, slavering and drooling, throws himself at her.

               The doorman forces her down across the front seats of the 
               car and begins to kiss her on the neck and rip her clothes 
               to shreds. He gradually forces himself between her legs.

               INT. INCINERATOR ROOM -- NIGHT

               St. Luc bounds down the incinerator room stairs looking for 
               Forsythe. He sees immediately that she is not there, but 
               also notices handprints in blood on the door leading to the 
               garage.

               He opens the garage door. Forsythe's screams come echoing 
               through the garage.

               INT. GARAGE -- NIGHT

               St. Luc races through the garage, trying to find Forsythe. 
               He finally sees her car in the middle of the exit ramp and 
               runs over to it.

               The doorman is still on top of Forsythe in the front seat of 
               the car. St. Luc pulls the doorman's gun out of its holster 
               and begins smashing away at the doorman with it.

               The doorman pounds St. Luc in the temple with his fist and 
               lifts himself partially off Forsythe, half turning toward 
               St. Luc, who is staggered by the blow.

               The doorman's face is covered with blood and drool. Repulsed 
               and terrified, St. Luc fires the gun into the doorman's upper 
               body three times, heedless of the possibility that he might 
               hit Forsythe. The doorman slumps over Forsythe.

               St. Luc grips the gun and staggers over to the car. He pulls 
               the doorman off Forsythe, who is completely soaked with blood. 
               She has obviously had an externally rough time, but there is 
               nothing to suggest that she has been infected by the doorman.

               St. Luc shoves her over into the passenger's seat, where she 
               slumps, dazed. He doesn't have to start the car -- it's never 
               been turned off. He slams the shift lever into reverse and 
               backs up, peeling rubber, to the base of the ramp. He puts 
               it into first and begins to accelerate, foot to the floor, 
               toward the garage door.

               Another car full of residents suddenly careens in front of 
               the door and screeches to a halt, blocking St. Luc, who in 
               swerving to avoid them smashes his fender into a concrete 
               post. He picks up the gun from the console between the seats 
               and, opening the car door, empties the gun at the residents, 
               who are emerging from their car.

               One of the residents falls back into the car, blocking the 
               other two.

               St. Luc drags Forsythe out of the car, throws her over his 
               shoulder, and carries her down the ramp toward the door 
               leading to the incinerator.

               INT. HALLWAYS -- NIGHT

               St. Luc half drags, half carries Forsythe along hallways 
               whose doors are wide open. From the apartments issues the 
               entire catalogue of suggestive sexual sounds -- giggles, 
               moans, groans, cries, whispers, shrieks.

               We catch glimpses of people of all kinds and ages locked 
               together on floors, chairs, etc. St. Luc finds an open exit 
               door and plunges through it, taking Forsythe with him.

               INT. GYM -- NIGHT

               The door to the gym opens and St. Luc looks in cautiously. 
               The gym is quite tiny and is deserted. St. Luc pulls Forsythe 
               in and closes the door. He lays Forsythe down on a gym mat 
               and then barricades the door with a box horse and a weight-
               lifting table.

               He kneels beside Forsythe, who seems to be only just regaining 
               consciousness. St. Luc strokes her face, pushes strands of 
               hair matted with blood out of her eyes.

                                     ST. LUC
                              (more to himself than 
                              Forsythe)
                         Rollo'll be here soon. Rollo'll be 
                         here soon.

               EXT. DRIVEWAY -- NIGHT

               Rollo's car pulls up to the main doors and parks in a 
               blatantly illegal space. He flips up a card on the dash which 
               says 'M.D. ON CALL,' then gets out of the car.

               He walks up the steps and through the main doors, which are 
               wide open. Nobody is in sight.

               INT. HALLWAY -- NIGHT

               Rollo walks along the hallway, bag in hand, envelope under 
               arm. He stops in front of Tudor's door, checks the number 
               against the number written in his notebook, then knocks on 
               the door.

               Nobody answers. He knocks once more, then looks around 
               shiftily before turning the knob and walking right in.

               INT. TUDOR'S APARTMENT -- NIGHT

               Rollo enters and closes the door behind him, deliberately 
               slamming it. He walks into the center of the living room and 
               bellows.

                                     ROLLO
                         Hello, good evening, is anybody here? 
                         Dr. St. Luc? It's Dr. Linsky here to 
                         see you for consultation.

               Still no answer. Rollo is puzzled. He snoops around the 
               apartment until he finds the bedroom with its door half 
               closed. He pushes gently on the door and opens it gradually.

                                     ROLLO
                         It's Dr. Linsky. Anybody home?

               Rollo can now see the figure of Tudor lying in bed in the 
               dim light of the bedroom. Rollo enters the bedroom.

                                     ROLLO
                         Is that Mr. Nicholas Tudor? It's Dr. 
                         Linsky. I'm meeting Dr. St. Luc here. 
                         He must be a little bit late.

               Tudor does not answer, does not move. He lies stiffly on the 
               bed on his back, mouth insanely agape, eyes shut, covers 
               half on the floor.

                                     ROLLO
                         Is anyone here? Nicholas Tudor? Is 
                         that you? Tudor? Mind if I have a 
                         look at you?

               He stands at the edge of the bed, peering at Tudor, looking 
               for signs of consciousness. After a pause, he kneels on the 
               bed and slowly draws back the covers.

                                     ROLLO
                         Just a peek, OK? A little peek won't 
                         hurt.

               Tudor's abdomen is gradually exposed as the covers are drawn 
               back. Crouched in the shadows is one of the freshly emerged 
               blood parasites, which sits poised for only a fraction of a 
               second before it springs at Rollo's face with great energy.

               As the thing hits Rollo's face it locks on to his head by 
               entangling its stubby tentacles in his hair and attaching 
               its suckers to his cheeks and chin.

               Rollo tries to stand, then staggers and falls. The thing 
               tries to force its way into Rollo's mouth, cutting his lips 
               in the process. They bleed furiously. When Rollo manages to 
               pull a sucker away, a piece of his flesh comes with it.

               As he writhes on the carpeted floor, two more parasites appear 
               crawling toward him from under the bed, covered with dust 
               from the floor. They clamber on to him and fasten on to his 
               face, suckering on to his ears, his throat, forehead, eyelids. 
               One of them begins to ooze corrosive fluid on to his face. 
               Rollo screams in pain.

               He manages to roll to his feet. He staggers out of the 
               darkness of the bedroom into the living room, one arm 
               extended, groping like a blind man, the three parasites still 
               locked on to his face. They try to pull his lips apart, but 
               he keeps his teeth firmly clenched to keep them from forcing 
               their way into the depths of his body.

               He takes a few unbalanced steps toward the kitchen. With a 
               sudden spasm of pain, he hurls himself sideways into the 
               kitchen and almost falls again, grabbing at the last moment 
               on to the sink.

               His hands touch a large pair of pliers, a screwdriver, and a 
               hammer on the counter by the sink, left there by Tudor weeks 
               ago. Rollo seizes the pliers and begins to pull the parasites 
               from his face with their steel jaws. The parasites, swollen 
               with Tudor's blood, burst and spurt as the pliers tear them 
               apart.

               In the bedroom, Tudor's eyes snap open. His head rises from 
               the pillow.

               He swings his legs over the side of the bed and, ashen and 
               gaunt, shakes his head slowly as though waking from a dream. 
               He begins to mumble.

                                     TUDOR
                         No, no, no, no. Mustn't, mustn't. 
                         You mustn't kill them, no, no, no.

               Then, as though listening to himself and suddenly 
               understanding what he is saying, he rises to his feet shakily 
               and walks to the kitchen. He stops at the kitchen door.

               Rollo has torn the parasites from his face and is pounding 
               away at them in the kitchen sink. The parasites wriggle and 
               curl in their own blood in the sink as he smashes away at 
               them with the pliers.

               Tudor staggers toward Rollo.

                                     TUDOR
                         No, no. You mustn't kill them. That's 
                         my blood you're spilling! My blood! 
                         Let them come home, let them come 
                         home, home, home inside me. Don't 
                         kill them...!

               He starts to paw Rollo, feebly trying to prevent him from 
               further mutilating the parasites. He reaches over St. Luc's 
               shoulder and grabs a large chunk of one of the parasites.

                                     TUDOR
                              (whining pitifully)
                         At least save me one! For God's sake! 
                         At least save me one. One, one, one, 
                         one...

               Rollo turns as Tudor begins to shove the piece of flesh back 
               down his throat.

               As Rollo turns we see that bits of tentacles and suckers are 
               still attached to his cheeks, throat, forehead. His face is 
               melting and smoking in areas where it has been burned by the 
               corrosive fluid on one side. He stares in rage at Tudor.

               With a scream, Rollo strikes Tudor with the pliers. Tudor 
               falls, hitting his head on various chairs and protruding 
               corners as he goes down, the chunk of parasite still in his 
               mouth as he finally comes to rest, twitching, on the floor. 
               Rollo drops the pliers on the floor.

               He stares at Tudor in shock. His face is reflected in a copper 
               frying pan hanging over the stove. Noticing the reflection, 
               Rollo leans over to get close to his own horrible image. He 
               gingerly touches his face, inspecting the damage, shivering 
               and moaning.

               Still shaking, he turns to leave.

               Without warning, Tudor leaps up at Rollo with insane energy 
               and bowls him over, pliers in hand. Sitting on Rollo's chest, 
               Tudor smashes away at Rollo's face and head with the pliers, 
               the piece of dead parasite in his mouth dropping on to Rollo's 
               face as he drools.

               INT. GYM -- NIGHT

               Forsythe finally opens her eyes. She smiles at St. Luc, who 
               hovers anxiously over her as she lies on the gym mat.

                                     ST. LUC
                         Can you walk? I couldn't find anything 
                         wrong with you.

               Forsythe nods and manages to sit up with St. Luc's help. 
               Once she seems able to stay propped up without St. Luc's 
               help, he gets up and begins to move the barricade away from 
               the door.

                                     ST. LUC
                         Rollo and the police should be here 
                         by now. It's just a question of 
                         avoiding infected residents until we 
                         find them.

               St. Luc comes back to Forsythe and kneels beside her.

                                     ST.LUC
                         OK? Ready to go?

               Forsythe puts her arm around St. Luc's neck as though wanting 
               support. Instead, she draws him down toward her and begins 
               to babble in a strange, casual, dreamy way.

                                     FORSYTHE
                         Sometimes I have a recurrent dream. 
                         Have I ever told you about it, 
                         darling? I guess you could call it a 
                         Freudian dream, because in this dream 
                         I find myself making love to Sigmund 
                         Freud. But I'm having trouble because 
                         he's old and dying, and he smells 
                         bad and I find him repulsive. And 
                         then he tells me that everything is 
                         erotic, everything is sexual, you 
                         know what I mean? He has a very thick 
                         accent, but I can understand him 
                         perfectly. He tells me that even old 
                         flesh is erotic flesh, that disease 
                         is the love of two alien kinds of 
                         creatures for each other, that dying 
                         is an act of eroticism, that even 
                         chemicals combine out of sexual frenzy 
                         and longing. That breathing is sexual, 
                         that talking is sexual, that just to 
                         physically exist is sexual... And I 
                         believe him, and we make love 
                         beautifully...

               While she talks, Forsythe gradually slips her arms around 
               St. Luc's neck and brings her lips closer and closer to his.

               St. Luc, mesmerized by the hypnotic drone of her words, is 
               about to kiss her. Suddenly her mouth snaps open wide with 
               mechanical precision, her head tilts back, her eyes flick 
               closed.

               St. Luc stares at her in horror as her throat begins to swell.

               In the depths of Forsythe's mouth two parasite tentacles 
               probe about, seeking a firm hold for their suckers so that 
               they can pull the parasite's body out of her narrow esophagus.

               St. Luc hesitates only for an instant, then rips a strip 
               from her blouse, balls it up, and shoves it into her mouth. 
               Holding her while she struggles to remove it, he rips off a 
               second strip and ties it around her head to keep the gag in. 
               St. Luc rises, throws Forsythe over his shoulder and begins 
               to step toward the door of the gym.

               Dangling over St. Luc's shoulder, Forsythe struggles, moans, 
               and howls as best she can. St. Luc manages to pin her hands 
               to her sides so that she can't pull the gag out.

               Before St. Luc reaches the door, a handsome middle-aged woman 
               peeks in around the corner.

                                     WOMAN
                              (crooning in reply to 
                              Forsythe's howl)
                         Hellooooo? Oooooo? Is there anyone 
                         here who's all alooooooooone?

               St. Luc rushes at the woman, knocking her over. She rolls on 
               the floor, hugging herself and crooning.

               Once out the door, St. Luc makes for the nearest exit.

               INT. STAIRWELL -- NIGHT

               As St. Luc begins to ascend the stairs, we can see tiny black 
               hooks tearing through Forsythe's gag. Blood begins to soak 
               through from the inside.

               A group of residents suddenly appear at the next landing 
               above St. Luc and, noticing them, begin to walk down the 
               steps, moaning and crooning and making vaguely sexual gestures 
               toward the pair.

               Blood is now pouring from Forsythe's mouth and tentacles are 
               groping for leverage at her cheeks and chin.

               St. Luc decides to attempt to shoulder his way up the stairs, 
               certain that Rollo and the police must be at the main doors.

               As he hits the residents on the stairs, they try to kiss 
               him, caress him, pull his clothes off. They finally manage 
               to drag Forsythe from his shoulders, almost unbalancing him 
               as they do so. St. Luc tries to prop her up on her feet, but 
               she's completely limp. St. Luc holds Forsythe against the 
               stairway wall as residents mill all about them. He looks at 
               her in sudden hopelessness.

                                     ST. LUC
                              (shouting)
                         Forsythe! Forsythe!

               The parasite is now half out of her mouth, hanging through 
               the slit it has torn in her gag.

               St. Luc lets go of Forsythe and she sinks to the floor. The 
               residents are swarming all over them. St. Luc abandons 
               Forsythe and begins to fight his way up the stairs.

               He runs higher and higher, up flight after flight of stairs, 
               until he is free of the slow-moving residents. He leans back 
               against a wall, panting.

               Crooning and moaning echo up to him from below. He leans 
               over the railing and looks down.

               In the stairwell several flights below, Forsythe lies 
               surrounded by milling residents, legs spread as though about 
               to give birth. A resident leans over and pulls the parasite 
               from her mouth, then swallows it whole with gusto. Other 
               residents touch her, stroke her, caress her, as though 
               offering her a strange kind of comfort.

               St. Luc reels with disgust and disbelief. He turns and runs.

               INT. SWIMMING POOL -- NIGHT

               Between the two towers lies the swimming pool. St. Luc manages 
               to reach the door leading from the South Tower into the pool. 
               He hangs on to the door of the pool itself for a moment in 
               near exhaustion, then opens it and enters.

               The pool is dim and tranquil. Two women are swimming in the 
               deep end as though nothing were at all abnormal.

               St. Luc watches them for a moment, enjoying the apparent 
               normalcy of the scene. Then he staggers forward, calling out 
               to the swimmers.

                                     ST. LUC
                         Have you seen the police? I'm Dr. 
                         St. Luc. Have you seen the police? 
                         Have they come?

               The swimmers both flick playfully beneath the water's surface. 
               St. Luc approaches the water's edge, waiting for them to 
               surface. The water ripples and bubbles near his feet. A 
               sinking feeling comes over him. He watches in horrible 
               fascination. He begins to shiver.

               The ripples and bubbles spread and intensify. After a pause, 
               Janine surfaces, smiling radiantly. A few seconds later, 
               Betts surfaces near her, the very picture of benign, watery 
               calm. Betts gestures to St. Luc to join them in the pool.

               St. Luc shakes his head slowly, backing away from the pool.

               He turns to leave the room. As he turns, Mr. Spergazzi appears 
               out of the shadows behind him. Using his four-pronged aluminum 
               cane, he pushes St. Luc backwards into the pool, chuckling 
               playfully.

               Spergazzi looks around for approval as St. Luc begins to 
               thrash about wildly.

               Betts swims up beside St. Luc, grabs him, and holds him under.

                                     BETTS
                              (to Janine)
                         A kiss!
                              (laughter echoes in 
                              the pool room)
                         Give him a kiss. Give him a kiss.

                                     VARIOUS RESIDENTS
                              (voices echoing in 
                              unison)
                         A kiss, a kiss, a kiss!

               Betts allows St. Luc to rise to the surface as a laughing 
               Janine splashes over to him and fastens her mouth to his.

               As they kiss, Janine's hands hold St. Luc's head fiercely. 
               Betts assists her by pinning St. Luc's arms behind him. 
               Janine's throat ripples and swells, her cheeks billow as a 
               parasite swarms upwards from deep within her body. St. Luc's 
               cheeks now swell as the parasite enters his mouth. His eyes 
               jolt open in terror and he manages to pull away slightly, 
               revealing the tentacles joining her mouth to his like 
               grappling irons.

               St. Luc twists out of Betts' grasp. He and Janine, still 
               locked together, sink beneath the surface.

               Dozens of residents pour into the pool room and join Spergazzi 
               and the others at the poolside. Among these are faces already 
               familiar to us: Kurt, Kresimir and Benda, the old laundry-
               room woman, etc.

               The new spectators clap, laugh, croon, and moan as though 
               witnessing a wild group baptism. Some of them throw themselves 
               into the water, pulling others in with them.

               Deep under the water's surface, St. Luc still struggles to 
               free himself from Janine. Residents now splash into the depths 
               all around them.

               St. Luc's cheeks bulge wide and blood dribbles from his nose 
               and mouth. His throat swells monstrously. Janine releases 
               him just in time for us to see the end of a tentacle slip 
               back into his mouth. He exhales heavily as parasite enzymes 
               pump furiously through his body. The water boils with his 
               exhaled breath.

               Janine and St. Luc drift apart, now completely calm, as 
               residents splash and swim, kick and embrace.

               INT. STARLINER TOWERS UNDERGROUND GARAGE -- NIGHT

               The vast and dimly lit garage is full of silent cars. 
               Somewhere an engine starts up, then another and another, 
               until the whole garage is full of fumes and the revving of 
               engines.

               As we prowl amongst the cars we find many of the residents 
               we already know, now dressed to the teeth in their seductive 
               best.

               Mr. Spergazzi and his wife stand and watch the spectacle, 
               canes in hand, with great dignity. With them stand others 
               who are too old or too young to go into the night looking 
               for new hosts for their parasites, content to remain 
               incubators for the time being.

               The residents are full of bubbly anticipation in their cars. 
               Kresimir leans out of his car and shouts to no one in 
               particular.

                                     KRESIMIR
                              (shouting)
                         Nobody should be alone! Nobody should 
                         be alone tonight!

               The rest of the residents pick up the cry and chant together.

                                     RESIDENTS
                              (together)
                         Nobody alone! Nobody alone!

               The night watchman stands near the garage doors. Smiling 
               broadly, he stamps on the cable which activates the sliding 
               doors.

               EXT. STARLINER TOWERS -- NIGHT

               The garage doors slide open. One car surges up the ramp ahead 
               of all the others, stopping at the top.

               The driver of this first car is St. Luc, sleek and exuberant, 
               a raised collar and a scarf hiding most of his scars. He 
               glances into his rear-view mirror.

               In the rear-view mirror, St. Luc sees all the other cars 
               lining up behind him, lights blazing.

               St. Luc smiles, then steps on the accelerator. His car shoots 
               out into the street.

               As St. Luc's car turns on to the street, car after car follows 
               him. We rise higher and higher above the Starliner Towers 
               apartment complex until the cars are a small stream of lights 
               far below, bleeding into the main body of the neon-lit 
               metropolis.

                                         THE END
"SIGNS"

FADE IN:

INT.  WINDOW - MORNING

We are looking out a second story window of a house.  The
backyard is large and green with a wooden jungle gym, worn
from use.  A single tree throws shade onto a barbecue and a
picnic table.

The backyard is lined by crops.  Corn.  Golden and brown. 
Six feet high.

Everything is perfect.  Like a postcard.  And then we HEAR A
CHILD SCREAM.  IT'S FAR AWAY.  WE DON'T KNOW WHERE IT'S
COMING FROM.

                                                  CUT TO:

INT.  BEDROOM - MORNING

GRAHAM HESS wakes up from his sleep.  He thought he heard
something.  He listens.  HE HEARS THE HEATER.  THE
REFRIGERATOR DOWNSTAIRS HUMMING.  THE OCCASIONAL BIRDS
OUTSIDE CHIRPING.

Graham climbs out of bed.  He moves in his pajama pants and
white Barron's minor league baseball T-shirt towards the
bedroom door.

                                                  CUT TO:

INT.  HALL LANDING - MORNING

Graham stands in the hall landing where three bedroom doors
meet.  He moves to the door that has children's drawings
taped to it.  He puts his ear close.  Listens.  Beat.

He relaxes.  Graham leans down and picks up two balled up
sweat socks and a child's sweater from the hallway floor.  He
puts it in the hallway hamper before heading back into his
bedroom.

                                                  CUT TO:

INT.  BATHROOM - MORNING

A bathroom door is open.  WE HEAR THE SINK RUNNING.  WE HEAR
THE SOUNDS OF TEETH BEING BRUSHED.

Outside the bathroom on the bedroom wall is the sun faded
outline of where a large CATHOLIC CROSS used to hang.  It's
ghostly stained forever on the blank wall.

A CHILD SCREAMS FROM FAR AWAY.

The water from the sink stops.  Graham steps into the
doorway.  Toothbrush and foam in his mouth.  He becomes very
still.

                                                  CUT TO:

INT.  CHILDREN'S BEDROOM - MORNING

The bedroom door bursts open.  Graham steps into his
children's room.  There are children's books everywhere. 
Overflowing off shelves.  Piled in corners.

Graham's eyes move to the small messy beds.  They're both
empty.

                                                  CUT TO:

INT.  GARAGE BEDROOM - MORNING

WE HEAR THE VOICES OF TWO CHILDREN NOW.  THEIR SCREAMS FLOAT
INTO A DARKENED BEDROOM OVER THE GARAGE.

MERRILL HESS throws the bed sheets off himself as he swings
onto his feet in one quick motion.  He is hyper-awake. 
Merrill is in his late twenties.  He is well build.  His
muscles are tense as he stands in his red bikini briefs and
looks around bewildered.

                                                  CUT TO:

EXT.  BACKYARD - MORNING

Graham bangs open the back screen door and runs into the
backyard.  He spins as he looks around.

Merrill, now with a T-shirt and jeans, rumbles down the side
stairs adjacent to the garage building.

Merrill and Graham make eye contact as they approach each
other across the yard.

                    MERRILL
          Where are they?

Graham looks around -- panic growing in his eyes.

                    CHILDREN
              (yelling in the distance)
          Daaaad!

Graham and Merrill in unison turn in the direction of the
YELLING.  They look away from the house, across the yard and
into THE THICK WALL OF CROPS.

                                                  CUT TO:

EXT.  CROPS - MORNING

The tall stalks of corn smack Graham and Merrill's faces as
they run through the crops.

A LITTLE GIRL appears in the crops thirty feet ahead of them
like an apparition.  She is in her nightgown.  She is four.

They reach her fast.  She stands unaware of them in a daze. 
Her hair is messed from sleep.

                    GRAHAM
          Bo where's Morgan?

BO stands peacefully lost in her thoughts.  Beat.

                    GRAHAM
          Bo?

Bo finally looks at her father.  Beat.  She smiles softly.

                    BO
          Are you in my dreams too?

Beat.

                    GRAHAM
          This isn't a --

                    BOY (O.S.)
          Dad!

Graham looks in the direction of THE BOY'S VOICE.  He's
close.  Graham picks up Bo and rushes through the crops.

He finds MORGAN standing with his hands in the pockets of his
pajama bottoms.  DOGS ARE BARKING NEARBY.

                    GRAHAM
          Morgan what's happening?

Graham puts Bo on the ground and moves right in front of
Morgan.  The ten-year old boy looks deep in thought.

Graham takes hold of Morgan's chin and turns his face so he's
looking straight at him.

                    GRAHAM
          Are... you... hurt?

Beat.  Morgan's eyes reveal he's come to some answer.

                    MORGAN
          I think God did it.

Beat.  THE DOGS KEEP BARKING.

                    GRAHAM
          Did what Morgan?

Morgan takes hold of his father's unshaven chin and turns his
face.  Graham is forced to look to his right.  Beat.  Graham
sees something.

Graham Hess slowly rises to his feet.  He starts moving
forward towards something.

He walks through a thin layer of crops and emerges in a
clearing.  Two German Shepherds are running back and forth. 
They are clearly agitated.

Graham looks around at the THOUSANDS OF CORN STALKS LYING
FLAT ON THE GROUND.  THEY LAY IN A GIGANTIC CIRCLE, A HUNDRED
FEET WIDE.

Graham Hess looks around in a daze as he walks out into the
center.  Merrill, Bo and Morgan follow him.

The dogs keep running and barking as WE PULL BACK AND REVEAL
THE FOUR MEMBERS OF THE HESS FAMILY STANDING IN THE MIDDLE OF
THIS PERFECT, GIGANTIC CIRCLE.

WE KEEP PULLING BACK TO EXPOSE THIS EERIE DESIGN -- FIVE
HUNDRED FEET WIDE -- SITTING IN THE MIDDLE OF AN ENDLESS,
UNTOUCHED CORN FIELD.

                                                  CUT TO:

EXT.  BACKYARD - LUNCHTIME

Graham holds his hand over the barbecue to see if it's at the
right temperature.  The other hand holds a cordless phone to
his ear.

                    GRAHAM
              (into phone)
          ... Lee actually the reason I'm
          calling is about Lionel.

Graham stokes the coals with a LONG BARBECUE FORK.

                    GRAHAM
              (into phone)
          Was he at home last night with you
          or was he out and about with the
          Wolfington brothers?

Graham moves around from behind the barbecue and heads
towards the house.

                    GRAHAM
              (into phone)
          Well, there was a little mischief
          done to our crops last night.

Beat.

                    GRAHAM
              (into phone)
          I know he's a fine boy... No one's
          saying otherwise.

Graham steps through the back screen door into his

KITCHEN.

Graham holds the phone a little closer and talks in a HUSHED
VOICE.

                    GRAHAM
              (into phone)
          Listen Lee, I don't even mind if it
          was him.  You could just talk to
          him and that would be enough for
          me... See it was kind of strange
          finding the crops like that.  The
          kids were... confused by it.  It
          would take the strangeness away if
          we knew it was Lionel and the
          Wolfington brothers just messing
          around...
              (beat, listens)
          The movies...
              (beat)
          Are you sure?
              (beat)
          Okay, then... Thank you for your
          patience Lee.

Graham turns off the phone.  He turns to put it on the
counter and realizes his children are seated on the kitchen
floor with one of their two German Shepherds.  There is a
LARGE PUDDLE on the kitchen tiles.

                    MORGAN
          Houdini peed.  I think he's sick.

Graham looks at the majestic dog.  It's shivering.

                    GRAHAM
          Take him outside.  I'll call Dr.
          Reynolds.

Morgan and Bo lead their dog out with worried expressions on
their faces.

Graham grabs a handful of paper towels and places it on the
puddle of urine.  The DOORBELL rings with Graham still on his
knees on the kitchen floor.  He leans back so he can see down
the hall.

A balding police officer stands on the other side of the
screen door.

                    GRAHAM
          That was quick Edgar.  I only
          called you boys about two hours
          ago.

OFFICER EDGAR PASKI nods that he knows.

                    OFFICER PASKI
          Mrs. Kindleman twisted her ankle as
          she put it, "diving for her life"
          when a bunch of school kids rode
          down the sidewalk on skateboards. 
          She went down to Thorton's store
          this morning and started spitting
          on the new skateboards.  Spitting! 
          By the time I got there, Mrs.
          Kindleman had sprayed the whole
          damn place... She must have had a
          cold or something.  It was enough
          to turn a grown man's stomach.

Beat.  Graham stares at Officer Paski.

                    OFFICER PASKI
          So what happened to your crops?

                                                  CUT TO:

EXT.  BACKYARD JUNGLE GYM - LUNCHTIME

Bo walks from the house with a large glass of water.  She
moves to Houdini, who sits in the shade by the picnic table.

Morgan pokes the barbecue fork into two meat patties on the
grill.  He places two pieces of cheese on the hamburgers,
before walking over to Houdini.

The two children sit down in the grass with the dog.

Bo is about to pour the glass of water into the dog bowl. 
She stops.  Takes a tiny sip of the water first.

She holds the glass out to Morgan.

                    BO
          I think it's contaminated.

                    MORGAN
          You don't even know what that word
          means.

He drinks.

                    MORGAN
          It's not contaminated.  It's just
          tap water.  Pour it in his bowl.

                    BO
          It tastes funny.

                    MORGAN
          He licks his butt everyday.  He's
          not going to mind.

Bo shrugs and pours it into the bowl.  Beat.

Houdini just sits staring at them.  He is not shivering.  He
doesn't drink.  He is unnaturally still.

Bo pushes the bowl closer.

HOUDINI MOVES...

BO'S HAND PULLS BACK...

HOUDINI'S JAWS SNAP SHUT IN THE AIR WHERE HER HAND USED TO
BE.  HE WAS JUST A FRACTION OF A SECOND LATER...

BEAT.  The children turn white.

                    MORGAN
          Houdini?

HOUDINI BEGINS TO GROWL.  Bo stands up.

                    MORGAN
          Bo don't run.

Houdini crouches down.

                    MORGAN
          What's wrong boy?

THE DOG'S GROWL BECOMES DEEP, MENACING.

                    MORGAN
          Stop it Houdini!

The German Shepherd trembles.  His body tightens.  He's about
to leap.  Beat.

                    MORGAN
              (soft)
          Bo, run.

                                                  CUT TO:

EXT.  CROPS - LUNCHTIME

Officer Edgar Paski stands facing Graham fifty feet away. 
They are on opposite ends of the crop circle.  Beat.

The crops all around them sway as the wind blows.  Beat. 
Officer Paski yells over the wind.

                    OFFICER PASKI
              (yelling)
          It's the strangest thing Father.

                    GRAHAM
              (yelling)
          Don't call me Father.

                    OFFICER PASKI
              (yelling)
          What's that?

                    GRAHAM
              (yelling)
          Don't call me Father.  It's just
          Graham now.

                    OFFICER PASKI
              (yelling)
          Sorry.

They stands in awkward silence fifty feet away from each
other.  Beat.

                    GRAHAM
              (yelling)
          You said something was strange. 
          What's strange?

                    OFFICER PASKI
              (yelling)
          The footprints.

                    GRAHAM
              (yelling)
          What about them?

                    OFFICER PASKI
              (yelling)
          There are none.

EXT.  CORN CROPS - LUNCHTIME

Officer Paski's knee touches the ground.  He points to a
single stalk of corn laying flat on it's side.

                    OFFICER PASKI
              (soft)
          Look at where it's bent over.

Graham stands next to him and leans in.  The joint where the
stalk bends from the ground is a perfect "L".

                    GRAHAM
          It's not broken.

                    OFFICER PASKI
          What kind of machine can bend a
          stalk of corn over without cracking
          it?

Graham looks around at the hundreds of thousands of corn
stalks bent over each other in a perfect wave.

                    GRAHAM
              (softy)
          Can't be by hand... It's too
          perfect.

Beat.

                    OFFICER PASKI
          Doesn't sound much like Lionel
          Prichard and the Wolfington
          brothers.  They can't take a piss
          without wetting the front of their
          pants.

Graham, nods in agreement.  Officer Paski stands up.

                    OFFICER PASKI
          Second thing this week I can't
          explain.

                    GRAHAM
          What was the first thing?

                    OFFICER PASKI
          Some animals around the county
          exhibiting uncharacteristic
          behavior.  Sometimes violent
          behavior.  Theo Henry had two of
          his fingers bit off by his cow.

                    GRAHAM
          Sounds like a virus.

                    OFFICER PASKI
          No Father, they're edgy.  On alert. 
          Like they act when they smell a
          predator around... Peeing on
          themselves and everything.

We see a thought catch in Graham's eyes.  He turns back and
stares in the direction of the house.  You can barely see the
roof over the crops.  Beat.

                    GRAHAM
              (preoccupied)
          Edgar, please don't call me Father.

The two men stand as the wind blows lightly around them. 
Officer Paski notices the still expression on Graham's face.

                    OFFICER PASKI
          What's wrong?

Beat.

                    GRAHAM
          I don't hear my children.

                                                  CUT TO:

EXT.  BACKYARD - LUNCHTIME

Morgan watches the thin line of smoke rising from the charred
patties on the grill next to the overturned picnic table.

Morgan's attention moves as the crops part and his father and
Officer Paski enter the backyard.  They stop cold when they
look in his direction.  They begin a slow walk towards him.

Morgan Hess is seated under the jungle gym with Houdini on
his lap.  Morgan is petting Houdini's fur gently.  Bo is on
top of the jungle gym curled up in a ball.

As Graham and Officer Paski get closer, they see Morgan is
crying.

Then they see the dog is laying on it side and has a BARBECUE
FORK DEEP IN ITS NECK.

Beat.

They stare at Morgan as he slowly pulls an inhaler from his
pocket and brings it to his mouth.  He inhales the asthma
spray.  Beat.  He lowers the inhaler so he can speak.

                    MORGAN
              (soft)
          He wanted to kill Bo.

Beat.  Graham stares at his ten-year old son.

                    GRAHAM
          Did he hurt you?

Beat.  Morgan nods, "No."  His tough exterior breaks as his
face starts to tremble.  He starts crying.  Graham picks him
up in his arms.

                    GRAHAM
              (whispers in his ear)
          I'm so sorry Morgan.

Graham reaches up for Bo.  She has dirt and tears on her
face.  Beat.  She slowly climbs down.  Graham carries both
his children as they cry in his arms.

He starts towards the house.  Merrill walks out from the back
holding a bowl of food.

                    MERRILL
          I used a little Tabasco in the
          potato salad.

Merrill sees Houdini lying under the jungle gym.

                    BO
          Houdini's sick.

                    GRAHAM
          Please tie up Isabelle to the back
          of the shed.  Make sure the knot's
          tight.

Merrill stands still with potato salad in his hands.  He
nods.

The children watch over their father's shoulder as Merrill
runs to their other German Shepherd sitting quietly near the
house and leads her by her collar across the yard to the
shed.

Graham reaches the porch of his house and opens the screen
door.

The last thing the children see as they enter the house, is
the image of Officer Paski pulling the barbecue fork out of
their dead dog's neck.

                                                  CUT TO:

INT.  BEDROOM - LATE EVENING

Graham lies in bed.  He rests his cheek against the pillow as
he lies by himself.

                    GRAHAM
          They're tough cookies, those two. 
          They think Houdini's playing with
          you up there.
              (beat)
          At least it got them to sleep.

Graham stares off.  Beat.  He smiles a little.

                    GRAHAM
          Okay Miss Puzzle Master.  I got one
          for you... What can make geometric
          shapes the size of a football
          field... and what would scare every
          animal in this county?
              (beat)
          Have you figured it out yet?
              (smiles)
          You probably have...
              (beat)
          Give me a hint Colleen... Is it
          bigger than a bread box?

                                             DISSOLVE TO:

EXT.  HOUSE - NIGHT

The large Hess farm house sits in the moonlight.

A MILLION CRICKETS AND BUGS FILL THE NIGHT AIR WITH SOUND.

THEY SUDDENLY STOP.

AN UNNATURAL SILENCE FILLS THE YARD.

                                                  CUT TO:

INT.  BEDROOM - NIGHT

Graham opens his eyes slowly as he stirs from his sleep.  His
daughter Bo stares at him from the edge of the bed.  She is
five inches away from his face.

Graham gets startled.

                    GRAHAM
          What's the matter?

                    BO
          I saw a monster.  Can I have a
          glass of water?

Beat.

                    GRAHAM
          What's wrong with the water next to
          your bed?

                    BO
          It tastes old.

Graham slowly gets up from the bed.  He takes his daughter's
hand and starts out of the room.

                    GRAHAM
          What's the rule about getting up in
          the middle of the night?

                    BO
          Only for pee or poop.

                    GRAHAM
          Right.

Graham leads his four-year old daughter down the darkened
hall.

                                                  CUT TO:

INT.  CHILDREN'S BEDROOM - NIGHT

Morgan's body is half off his bed.  Graham gently lifts him
back onto the pillow and covers him up.

There are two glasses of water on Bo's bedside table.  Graham
moves to Bo's bed.  He sits on the edge of it.  She stares
back at him as she holds her panda.

                    GRAHAM
              (soft)
          What are you thinking about?

                    BO
              (soft)
          Why do you talk to mom when you're
          by yourself?

Beat.

                    GRAHAM
              (soft)
          It makes me feel better.

                    BO
              (soft)
          Does she ever answer back?

                    GRAHAM
              (soft)
          No.

                    BO
              (soft)
          She doesn't answer me either.

Beat.  They both sit quietly for a moment.

Graham's eyes drift to the bedroom window.  A LARGE
SILHOUETTED FIGURE STANDS ON THE ROOF IN THE DARKNESS AND
STARES AT HIM.

THE FIGURE MOVES.  HIS SHADOW PASSES OVER THE CHILDREN'S
BEDROOM AS HE JUMPS FROM THE ROOF.

Graham stands.  He looks to his daughter with startled eyes.

                    BO
              (soft)
          Get under a blanket.  They can't
          get you under the blankets.

INT.  FAMILY ROOM - NIGHT

GREY SNOW FILLS THE SCREEN.  Merrill sleeps in front of the
family room television.

A hand gently shakes him.  Merrill wakes and looks up at his
brother zipping up his overcoat.

                                                  CUT TO:

EXT.  FRONT DOOR - NIGHT

Merrill quickly puts on his boots at the front door.

                    MERRILL
          Okay, this guy is trying to scare
          us.  He's messed with our property,
          he's coming around the house.  It's
          time for an ass whoopin'!

                    GRAHAM
          This is not an intelligent way to
          approach this.

Merrill opens the front door.  It's pitch black outside. 
Merrill turn to Graham and gestures with his fingers.

                    MERRILL
              (whispering)
          We both go outside and move around
          the house in opposite directions. 
          We act crazy, insane with anger. 
          Make him crap in his pants and
          force him around till we meet up on
          the other side.

Merrill brings his fingers together at the end of a circle.

                    GRAHAM
              (whispering)
          Explain, act crazy?

                    MERRILL
              (whispering)
          Curse and stuff.

                    GRAHAM
              (whispering)
          I'm not going to curse.

                    MERRILL
              (whispering)
          You don't mean it.  It's just for
          show.

                    GRAHAM
              (whispering)
          It doesn't sound natural when I
          curse.

                    MERRILL
              (whispering)
          Just make noises then.

                    GRAHAM
              (whispering)
          Explain noises.

                    MERRILL
              (whispering)
          Are you going to do this or what?

                    GRAHAM
              (whispering)
          No I'm not.

                    MERRILL
              (whispering)
          You want him coming in the house
          next time?

Beat.

They HEAR MOVEMENT OUTSIDE.  Merrill and Graham look out into
the darkness.

                    MERRILL
              (hushed tone)
          On the count of three.
              (beat)
          One... two... three.

Merrill and Graham go out the front door in opposite
directions.

                                                  CUT TO:

EXT.  MERRILL'S SIDE OF HOUSE - NIGHT

Merrill is in a full sprint.  He hugs the side of the
building as he runs.

                    MERRILL
          We're gonna beat your ass bitch!

                                                  CUT TO:

EXT.  GRAHAM'S SIDE OF HOUSE - NIGHT

Graham runs through the darkness around the first corner of
the house.  He waves his arms.

                    GRAHAM
          Ahhhh... I'm insane with anger.

Graham spots a LARGE FIGURE darting around the corner ahead
of him.

                    GRAHAM
          I've lost my mind!  It's time for
          an ass whoopin'!

                                                  CUT TO:

EXT.  MERRILL'S SIDE OF HOUSE - NIGHT

Merrill turns a corner full speed.  THE LARGE FIGURE HAS COME
TO A STOP IN THE SHADOWS AHEAD OF HIM.  HE SEEMS TO BLEND
INTO THE DARKNESS WHEN HE'S STILL.

                    MERRILL
          I'm gonna tear your head off!

Merrill charges.  WE JUST MAKE OUT MOVEMENT IN THE DARKNESS
AS THE FIGURE DISAPPEARS AROUND THE CORNER.

                                                  CUT TO:

EXT.  SIDE OF HOUSE - NIGHT

Graham and Merrill come screaming around two corners and come
to a stop facing each other.  Beat.

They look around, panting heavily.

                    GRAHAM
          I cursed.

                    MERRILL
          I heard.

Graham's eyes drift above them.

                    GRAHAM
          He's on the roof.

They follow the roof around the corner.  They find themselves
in the backyard.

Their eyes catch movement away from the house.  They just
catch A GLIMPSE OF THE LARGE FIGURE as he disappears into the
crops.  The swing on the swing set is still moving from being
hit.

They stare across the yard silently.  ALL WE HEAR IS THEIR
HEAVY BREATHING.

                    MERRILL (V.O.)
          It was very dark.

                    GRAHAM (V.O.)
          Yes it was.

                                                  CUT TO:

EXT.  PORCH - DAY

Officer Edgar Paski stands on the porch with his note pad
open.  He faces Graham and Merrill.

                    OFFICER PASKI
          You can't describe him at all? 
          Don't you think that's find of odd?

                    GRAHAM
          It does seem kind of odd doesn't
          it?

                    OFFICER PASKI
          I don't know whether to look for a
          midget or a --

                    GRAHAM
          He definitely wasn't a midget.

                    OFFICER PASKI
          Okay.
              (beat)
          So he was tall?

                    GRAHAM
              (to Merrill)
          I would say so.

                    MERRILL
          Probably.

                    OFFICER PASKI
          Over six feet?

Beat.

                    MERRILL
          It was very dark.

                    GRAHAM
          Yes, it was.

                    OFFICER PASKI
          We've established that.
              (beat)
          Just tell me about his clothing
          then.

Graham and Merrill stare at Edgar Paski.

                    OFFICER PASKI
          Was he wearing a Scottish kilt or
          jeans?

They keep staring.  Edgar closes his pad.

                    OFFICER PASKI
          Let me ask you two something. 
          Don't be embarrassed by the answer. 
          It is possible... Just possible
          now, you might have been chasing
          each other around?  You said you
          went in opposite directions.

                    GRAHAM
          Edgar, it sounds as strange to me
          saying it, as it is to you hearing
          it.  But we couldn't see him.  He
          stayed mostly in the shadows.  All
          we could make out was movement.
              (beat)
          But I'll tell you something with
          absolute certainty.  There was
          someone watching our house last
          night.  He was looking in my
          children's windows and I want you
          to find him Edgar.
              (beat)
          I need you to take this seriously,
          just incase, it is something
          serious.

The three men stand in the doorway.  Edgar opens his pad.

                    OFFICER PASKI
          I apologize.

Morgan walks up to the front door.  He holds up a baby
monitor.

                    MORGAN
          Can I use Bo's old baby monitor as
          a walkie-talkie?

                    GRAHAM
          Yes.

                    MORGAN
          It needs batteries.

                    GRAHAM
          Edgar, come inside.

The three men follow Morgan into the house.  They pass
through the family room where Bo stands at the television.

She is staring at the screen.  ON THE SCREEN IS AERIAL
FOOTAGE FROM A HELICOPTER.  THE FOOTAGE IS OF A LARGE FIELD
WITH ENORMOUS CIRCLES AND DIAMONDS CARVED INTO ITS CROPS.

Bo changes the channel.  She finds a cartoon.  She sits down
on the sofa.

Morgan and the men, can't see the screen, and move into the

KITCHEN.

                    OFFICER PASKI
          How certain are you, that this was
          a male?

                    MERRILL
          I don't know any girls can run like
          that.

Graham opens one of the cabinets and pulls down some
batteries.  He hands them to Morgan.

                    MORGAN
          These are D's; I need double A's.

                    GRAHAM
          I have some upstairs.

Graham starts out of the kitchen.

                    OFFICER PASKI
          I don't know Merrill.  I've seen
          some of those women on the
          Olympics.  They could out run me
          easy.

They all move into the

FAMILY ROOM.

Bo watches cartoons.  THE CARTOON MUSIC AND CARTOON PRAT
FALLS FILLS THE ROOM.

                    MERRILL
          This guy got on the roof in like a
          second.

                    GRAHAM
          Bo, can you turn down the volume
          until Officer Paski leaves?

Bo nods and moves to the television.  The pack of men follow
Graham up the

STAIRS.

                    MERRILL
          That roof is over ten feet high.

                    GRAHAM
          He's telling you the truth, Edgar. 
          Whoever it was, is very strong and
          can jump pretty high.

They arrive on the landing and follow Graham into his
bedroom.  He moves into his

BATHROOM.

They all move in with him.

                    OFFICER PASKI
          They got women's high jumping in
          the Olympics.  They got these
          Scandinavian women who could jump
          clean over me.

Graham takes the clock radio from the sink.  Tries to open
the back.

                    GRAHAM
          Shoot, it needs a screw driver.  I
          have double A's in here.

Graham waves the radio.  The men and Morgan move out of the
bathroom.

                    GRAHAM
          I know you're making a point Edgar. 
          I just don't know what it is.

They moves down the STAIRS.

                    OFFICER PASKI
          Yesterday afternoon, an out of town
          woman stopped by the diner and
          started yelling and cussing cause
          they didn't have her favorite
          cigarettes at the vending machine. 
          Scared a couple of customers.  No
          one's seen her since... My point
          is, we don't know anything about
          the person you saw.  We should just
          keep all possibilities available.

They move through the FAMILY ROOM.

Bo's cartoon is replaced by a special report news icon.

                    BO
          Dad, where's the remote?

Bo starts looking around the couch.

Graham stops before entering the kitchen.  The group stops
with him.  He looks at Bo searching the couch.  He walks over
to the television.

There are three glasses of water on the TV set.  He stands
next to the set.  Doesn't see what's on the screen.

                    GRAHAM
          Bo, you're too old to still be
          doing this.  The rule is, you take
          a glass of water, you finish it.
              (beat)
          Now what's wrong with this one?

Bo stops looking through the sofa cushions and looks to her
father.  Looks at the glass.

                    BO
          There's dust in it.

                    GRAHAM
          This one?

                    BO
          A hair.

                    GRAHAM
          This one?

                    BO
          Morgan took a sip.  It has his
          amoebas in it.

Beat.  Bo turns back to her search.  Graham tucks the clock
radio under his arm and collects the three glasses.  He heads
towards the kitchen.

                    MERRILL
          Excluding the possibility that a
          female Scandinavian Olympian was
          running around outside our house
          last night, what else is a
          possibility?

                    OFFICER PASKI
          I'm not done asking questions and I
          don't appreciate the sarcasm.

They follow Graham and Morgan through the swinging door into
the KITCHEN.

Graham puts the glasses in the sink with a group of other
half-filled water glasses and opens the drawer to pull out a
screwdriver.  He starts opening the clock radio.

                    OFFICER PASKI
          Do you have anyone who might have a
          grudge or something against you? 
          Maybe a church member, who might
          not have liked the fact, that you
          left the church?

Graham looks at Edgar.

                    GRAHAM
          I don't think so.

                    OFFICER PASKI
          Do you owe anybody money?  You can
          tell me off the record if you need
          too.

                    GRAHAM
          No.

                    MERRILL
          No.

Morgan hands Graham the baby monitor and Graham starts
replacing the batteries.

                    OFFICER PASKI
          Is anything missing?

                    GRAHAM
          No.

Graham hands Morgan the monitor.  He turns it ON.  THERE IS A
STATIC CRACKLE WITH SPIKES OF SOUND.

                    MORGAN
          It's still making the noises.  It's
          broken.

                    GRAHAM
          It's old Morgan.

Morgan heads out of the kitchen.

                    MERRILL
          Listen, I was out of line with that
          whole female Scandinavian Olympian
          thing.

Edgar nods.

                    MERRILL
          It's just that, I'm pretty strong
          and pretty fast.  And I was running
          as fast as I could.  And this
          guy...
              (embarrassed smile)
          He was just toying with us.

Beat.  Merrill walks out of the kitchen.  Graham watches
Edgar think it over.

INT.  FAMILY ROOM - DAY

Graham moves to a windowsill where more glasses of water sit. 
He picks them up.  Sees two more on the coffee table.  He
gives up and puts the two glasses back on the windowsill.

                    OFFICER PASKI
          Could everyone just take a seat on
          the couch.  I have some preliminary
          thoughts.

Morgan sits with his monitor next to Bo, who quietly watches
the TV.  Merrill and Graham squeeze in next to Morgan.

                    OFFICER PASKI
          There are three possibilities here. 
          We'll call them one, two and three. 
          The level one scenario is that
          there is a sane individual, who for
          real reasons wants to do you harm. 
          I really don't believe that's what
          we're looking at here.  In my
          opinion, whoever this is, they
          don't want to do harm to you all. 
          That's kind of clear.
              (beat)
          The level two scenario is, this is
          a mentally unstable person who's
          fixated on you and your family. 
          This is a possibility, but a very
          slim one.
              (beat)
          I assure you I will treat all three
          possibilities carefully, but in all
          likely hood we are looking at what
          we'll call a level three scenario. 
          He's a watcher.  Someone who this
          is a game for.  He's laying low. 
          Doesn't want to be seen.  But he
          wants to watch you.  Study you
          folks.

Officer Paski walks towards the windows.  Graham, Merrill and
Morgan follow him with their eyes.  Officer Paski walks next
to the television.

ON THE SCREEN WITH THE SOUND ALMOST MUTED, IS AN AERIAL SHOT
FROM A HELICOPTER.  A DIFFERENT ONE THAN BEFORE.  THE FOOTAGE
IS OF A VAST FIELD OF CROPS.  THERE ARE TWO DIAMONDS FLANKING
TWO SIDE OF A TRIANGLE IN THE CENTER OF THE FIELD.

Officer Paski turns to them.

Graham, Merrill and Morgan stare at the screen.

                    OFFICER PASKI
          Now I don't want you all to worry
          about this no more.  You're making
          more of this than it is.
              (beat)
          You guys have had a tough couple of
          days with the vandalism to the
          crops and the death of your
          shepherd.
              (beat)
          Maybe you guys should do something
          fun?  Let me worry about this
          person.  Let me find out who it is
          and then -- What the hell are you
          people looking at?

Edgar comes around to see the screen.

WE ARE ON A TV SCREEN.  THE CROPS SWAY IN THE BREEZE.

A HANDFUL OF PEOPLE ARE WAVING FROM THE DIAMONDS ON THE
FIELD.

                    OFFICER PASKI
          I'll be damned.

                    GRAHAM
          Turn up the volume Bo.

Bo gets up.

                    BO
          I can't find the remote.

She presses the up arrows on the TV controls.

                    TV ANCHOR
          -- images were shot yesterday
          afternoon by a thirty-four year old
          local camera man in Kerala, a
          southern city of India.  It is the
          eighteenth reported crop circle
          found in that country in the last
          seventy-two hours.

The television report cuts to Columbia University PROFESSOR.

                    PROFESSOR (TV)
          Crop circles first emerged in the
          late seventies with the renewed
          interest in extraterrestrial life. 
          They died out by the early
          eighties; dismissed as hoaxes. 
          This new resurgence is wholly
          different.  Elements of it are
          unexplainable.  The speed and the
          quantity in which it has appeared
          implies the coordination of
          hundreds of individuals over many
          countries...
              (beat)
          There is only a limited amount of
          explanations.  Either this is one
          of the most elaborate hoaxes ever
          created, or basically...
              (beat)
          It's for real.

Morgan takes the asthma inhaler from his pocket and breathes
in deeply.

                    MORGAN
              (wonder)
          Extraterrestrials.

                    OFFICER PASKI
          What in God's name is going on?

Beat.

THE ROOM GOES SILENT as everyone watches the images on the
television screen.

EXT.  HESS DRIVEWAY - DAY

The two men walk down the driveway to Edgar's patrol car.

                    OFFICER PASKI
          Don't ask me what I think.  Cause I
          can't think straight right now. 
          I'm going back to the station. 
          Have a cup of Marcia's coffee and
          try to think clear.  After that I
          might make some calls.
              (beat)
          Hoaxes... People got way too much
          time on their hands.

Edgar turns back to Graham.

                    OFFICER PASKI
          But I'll tell you something, what I
          said in their, still goes.  You and
          your family have been through a lot
          in the last two days... Not to
          mention what happened to you all
          seven months ago.

                    GRAHAM
          Six months.

Edgar stares at Graham.

                    GRAHAM
          And three weeks.

                    OFFICER PASKI
          It's left its mark still.  The last
          thing these children need to do, is
          worry about some crazy things
          happening in the world.  Take them
          into town.  Get their minds -- your
          mind, on everyday things.  It's
          good medicine.

                    GRAHAM
          It's good advice...
              (beat)
          Say hi to Marcia for me.

                    OFFICER PASKI
          You take care of yourself...

EXT.  STATION WAGON - AFTERNOON

WE MOVE THROUGH BACK ROADS OF BUCKS COUNTY.  RURAL
PENNSYLVANIA IN ITS MOST BEAUTIFUL.  TREE LINED STREETS. 
WHITE PICKET FENCES.  APPLE ORCHARDS.

The Hess family rides in their station wagon.  Graham drives. 
Merrill is shotgun.  The children are in the back.

Morgan leans forward and TURNS ON THE RADIO.

                    RADIO VOICE
          ... signs intended to be seen from
          the sky --

CLICK.  Graham TURNS IT OFF.

                    GRAHAM
          No radio either... Just for a
          while.

Morgan nods and then plops back into the backseat.

EXT.  MAIN STREET - AFTERNOON

Downtown Bucks County.  A group of small stores along a quiet
street.

The Hess station wagon pulls in front of a free parking
meter.

Graham steps out the driver's side and looks around.  Merrill
puts change in the meter.

Morgan walks up to Graham with Bo.

                    MORGAN
          Book money.

Morgan holds out his hand.  Graham gives his son a look as he
reaches into his back pocket.

                    GRAHAM
          Only one.

Morgan takes the money Graham gives him, then takes Bo's hand
and walks down the sidewalk.

Graham watches them turn into a store.

Merrill steps onto the sidewalk.  Hands in his pockets as he
walks away.

Graham turns and calls after him.

                    GRAHAM

          Meet back in fifteen minutes.

Merrill waves over his shoulder.  He keeps walking.

Graham starts across the street to the pharmacy.

INT.  NATHAN'S BOOKSTORE - AFTERNOON

A mom and pop bookstore.  Three isles wide.  MR. AND MRS.
NATHAN, a couple in their early seventies, sit behind their
counter and watch a black and white TV.  The PICTURE ON THE
TELEVISION IS OF A WHEAT FIELD.  THREE ENORMOUS TRIANGLES
SURROUND A CIRCLE.

Morgan steps up to the counter.

                    MORGAN
          Extraterrestrials?

                    MR. NATHAN
          That's what they keep alluding to. 
          It's just a bunch of crock. 
          They're trying to sell sodas, plain
          and simple.  I've been watching
          these reports since morning.  I've
          seen twelve soda commercials so
          far.  Twelve!

                    MORGAN
          Do you have book on
          extraterrestrials?

                    MR. NATHAN
          Don't tell me you believe this
          horse manure?

Morgan shrugs.  Mrs. Nathan pushes her husband aside.

                    MRS. NATHAN
          As a matter of fact, I think we
          have one.  Came by mistake in a
          shipment.  Decided to keep it for
          city people.

Mrs. Nathan points over to the far corner.

                    MRS. NATHAN
          Last row.  Third book from the left

INT.  PHARMACY - AFTERNOON

Graham waits at a white counter.  A gum chewing PHARMACIST in
her early twenties, who looks like she's in her teens,
glances through back shelves of medicines as she listens to
the radio.

                    RADIO HOST (V.O.)
          Why is no one saying the obvious? 
          This is just a rash case of
          copycats.  Someone, somewhere, does
          the first one.  It's on TV, it's on
          the internet.  In less than an hour
          a couple hundred people get the
          same brilliant idea and here we
          are... on the verge of mass
          hysteria.

                    PHARMACIST
          It was asthma medicine right
          Father?

                    GRAHAM
          For Morgan Hess.  And it's not
          Father anymore.

The Pharmacist looks back at Graham and then reaches up and
TURNS OFF THE RADIO.  She quietly finds the prescription on
the shelf and moves to the counter across from Graham.

She doesn't ring it up.  She just stands there fiddling with
the bag holding Morgan's medicine.  Beat.

                    PHARMACIST
          Can I ask you a favor Father?

Graham stares at the girl.  Beat.  He nods "yes."

                    PHARMACIST
          Can I take confession with you?

Beat.  Graham leans forward on the counter and takes the
girl's hands in his.  He talks very slowly.

                    GRAHAM
          Tracey, I -- am -- not -- a --
          reverend -- anymore.  I haven't
          been for six months.  You know
          this.

Beat.  When Tracey speaks her VOICE IS A BIT SHAKY.

                    TRACEY
          All this stuff on TV...
              (beat)
          Joe Gills was in here talking about
          the end of the world... I'm just a
          little scared.
              (beat)
          Please.  I need to take confession
          with you.

Graham looks at the young girl's teary eyes.  He exhales
slowly.

INT.  ARMY RECRUITING OFFICE - AFTERNOON

Merrill stares up at a poster with a muscular guy in an Army
uniform standing at attention on a beach.

We are in a narrow ARMY RECRUITING CENTER.  Inside the small
storefront space is a desk.  A gentleman sporting a CREWCUT
sits behind it.

A young man, Merrill's age, sits at a side card table filling
out some forms.

                    CREWCUT GUY
          I got it figured.

Merrill realizes the crewcut guy is talking to him.

                    MERRILL
          You do?

                    CREWCUT GUY
          I've had two separate folks tell me
          they think there are strangers
          around these parts the last couple
          of nights.  Can't tell what they
          look like, cause they're staying in
          the shadows -- covert like.  No
          one's got hurt mind you... And
          that's the give away.

                    MERRILL
              (doesn't see)
          I see.

                    CREWCUT GUY
          It's called probing.  It's a
          military procedure.  You send a
          reconnaissance group, very small,
          to check out things.  Not to
          engage, but to evaluate the
          situation.  Evaluate the level of
          danger.  Make sure things are all
          clear...

                    MERRILL
          Clear for what?

The crewcut guy savors the beat of silence.

                    CREWCUT GUY
          ... For the rest of them.

It takes a second, but Merrill smiles.  The crewcut guy
smiles back.  Merrill points at a poster.

                    MERRILL
          You have a pamphlet or something I
          can read?

The crewcut guy reaches to a stack of brochures.  Picks the
top brochure and hands it to Merrill.

The crewcut guy begins to stare at Merrill closely.

                    CREWCUT GUY
          Hey you didn't used to play
          baseball did you?

Merrill looks up from the brochure.  Beat.

                    CREWCUT GUY
          Shit.  I know you.  You're Merrill
          Hess.  I was there that day you hit
          that five hundred and eighty seven
          footer over the left field wall and
          set the record.  That thing had a
          motor on it... It's still the
          record right?

Merrill not, "yes."

                    MERRILL
              (soft)
          I got the bat at home... On the
          wall.

                    CREWCUT GUY
          You got two minor league home run
          records don't you?

Beat.

                    MERRILL
          Five.  The five longest.

                    CREWCUT GUY
          Boy, why aren't you in the pros
          making stacks of cash and getting
          handfuls of T and A?

                    YOUNG MAN (O.S.)
          Cause he also has the minor league
          strike out record.

Merrill turns to the young man, about his age, who sits at
the folding table.

                    MERRILL
          Hello Lionel.

LIONEL smirks.

                    LIONEL
          He'd just swing as hard as he could
          every time.  It didn't matter what
          the coach said, didn't matter who
          was on base, he'd whip that bat
          through the air as hard as he
          could... Looked like a lumber jack
          chopping down a tree.
              (beat)
          Merrill here, struck out more times
          than any two players.

Beat.

                    CREWCUT GUY
          You really hold the strike out
          record?

Beat.  Merrill tucks the pamphlet in his jacket.  Looks like
he's not going to say anything.  When he does, the words are
soft and worn; they've been said a hundred times.

                    MERRILL
          Felt wrong not to swing.

Beat.  The crewcut guy shakes his head.  Merrill turns and
starts walking.

As he passes Lionel, Merrill makes a small, quick move in
Lionel's direction, like he might hit him.  Lionel flinches
and covers his face.

Merrill walks out the door of the army recruiting office.

          "bastards."

          Is "Douche bag" a curse?

Graham glances at the girl as she sits sideways to him at the
counter.

                    GRAHAM
          I suppose it's in its usage.

                    PHARMACIST
          How about "John you're a douche bag
          for kissing Barbara?"

                    GRAHAM
          That's a curse.

                    PHARMACIST
          Then it's not thirty-seven.  It's

          I stole a bottle of Ruby red lip

INT.  NATHAN'S BOOKSTORE - AFTERNOON

Bo sits at a tiny reading table and drinks a glass of water. 
There is another glass, half-full, on her table.  Mrs. Nathan
watches as the little girl takes careful sips.

Beat.  Bo looks up with a grimace.

                    BO
          It's contaminated.

MRS. NATHAN YELLS TO MR. NATHAN AT THE FRONT OF THE STORE.

                    MRS. NATHAN
          Carl, there's something wrong with
          our water!

Morgan doesn't look up from the extraterrestrial book.

                    MORGAN
          Your water is fine.  Bo has a thing
          about her drinking water.  She's
          had it her whole life.  Like a tick
          people have.  Except it's not a
          tick.

                    MRS. NATHAN
              (fascinated)
          Is that right?

Bo shrugs.  She places the glass she sipped on the table with
the other glass.

Mrs. Nathan stares at the four-year old.

                    MR. NATHAN (O.S.)
          Thirteen!

Everyone turns to the front of the store where Mr. Nathan
points to the TV screen.  A Coke Cola commercial is on.

Beat.  Mrs. Nathan turns back to find Morgan holding out the
extraterrestrial book to her.

                    MORGAN
          I'll take it.

                                                  CUT TO:

EXT.  STATION WAGON - AFTERNOON

Merrill, Morgan and Bo are waiting in the parked car.  Beat.

The driver's side opens and Graham sits in.

                    MERRILL
          Pharmacy crowded?

                    GRAHAM
          I don't want any one of you
          spending time with Tracey Abernathy
          alone.  Is that understood?

Beat.  Everyone nods, "yes."

Graham puts the key in the ignition and turns the car on. 
Merrill watches as Graham's hand goes to put the car in
reverse -- and then stops.

Graham is staring out the windshield.  Merrill follows his
stare to a thin, thirty-year old man in a LEATHER JACKET
coming out of a store.  Merrill's face changes expression
too.  They both stare as the man passes in front of the car.

                    MORGAN
              (soft)
          Is that him?

                    MERRILL
              (soft)
          Yeah.

Everyone in the car watches the man in the leather jacket as
he steps off the sidewalk towards the truck.  It's here that
he notices the stares.  He glances up to see the faces
watching him from the station wagon.

The leather jacketed man keeps moving to his truck.  He gets
in, turns it on, and without looking over to the station
wagon, backs out of the parking lot.

Beat.  The Hess family sits quietly.

                    BO
          Who is he?

Nobody says anything for the longest time.

                    MORGAN
          He's the man who killed mom.

Graham puts the station wagon in reverse and backs out into
the street.

                                                  CUT TO:

EXT.  HESS HOME - AFTERNOON

THE SKY IS GOLDEN RED.  The crops sway hypnotically in a
gentle breeze.

The Hess station wagon pulls into their driveway.  It comes
to a stop in front of the house.  The engine goes off.  No
one gets out.

                                                  CUT TO:

INT.  STATION WAGON - AFTERNOON

All four sit quietly not getting out.

A MUFFLED SPIKE OF NOISE IS HEARD FROM THE BACK SEAT.

Graham and Merrill turn and see Morgan pull the baby monitor
out of his jacket.  He holds it in his lap.

Beat.

                    MORGAN
          What if Bo's baby monitor is
          picking up signals from the
          extraterrestrials?

Beat.

                    MERRILL
          All this crop stuff.  They did it
          twenty-five years ago.  It was a
          joke.

THE MONITOR SPIKES WITH A SUDDEN CRACKLE.  MORGAN PULLS IT
AWAY FROM HIS EAR.

                    GRAHAM
          It's just static Morgan.  Turn it
          up and see.

Morgan turns a knob on the side.

THE VOLUME SUDDENLY JUMPS UP ON THE MONITOR.  WE HEAR BEEPS
IN THE STATIC.  THE RED LIGHTS ON THE FRONT OF THE BABY
MONITOR LIGHT UP WITH EACH BEEP.

                    MORGAN
          It's a code.

                    GRAHAM
          Let me see that please.

Morgan hands Graham the monitor in the front seat.  THE BEEPS
COME AND GO AS THEY GET COVERED BY THE STATIC.

                    MERRILL
          It's noise.

                    GRAHAM
          It's broken Morgan.  It'll just
          keep doing this.
              (beat)
          Let's get out of the car okay?

                    MORGAN
          We might lose the signal.

                    GRAHAM
          We can't just sit in the car in our
          own driveway like this.

                    MERRILL
          We'll look like mental patients.

Beat.  Nobody gets out of the station wagon.

                    GRAHAM
          I'm getting out now.

                    MORGAN
          Don't do it.

Graham pulls the handle.  His door opens.  He waits before
getting out.  The other three station wagon doors open right
after.

OUTSIDE CAR

Graham stands and closes his driver side door.

THE MONITOR CHANGES SOUNDS.  THE BEEPING DISAPPEARS.  THE
STATIC BECOMES LOUDER, BECOMING A MOVING, SWIRLING SOUND
TEXTURE.

                    MORGAN
          Nobody move!

Everyone becomes frozen, standing next to the station wagon. 
Three of the doors are open.

IN THE TEXTURE OF SOUND, JUST FOR A MOMENT, WE HEAR SOMETHING
THAT SOUNDS LIKE...

                    MORGAN
          Voices.  Did you hear that?

Everyone stares at the baby monitor in Graham's hand.

                    MORGAN
          Not English though.  You heard the
          voices right Uncle Merrill?

                    BO
          I heard them Morgan.

Graham doesn't move his arm.  He keeps it out in the air
where he had it as he closed his door.  Graham looks to
Merrill over the roof of the station wagon.

                    GRAHAM
          It's probably picking up another
          baby monitor.

                    MERRILL
          That's right.

THE SWIRLING TEXTURE SOUND FLOATS THROUGH THE AIR ABOVE THE
STATION WAGON.

                    MERRILL
          Let me see it.

Beat.  Graham moves.  He hands the monitor over the hood. 
Merrill reaches for it.

THE SWIRLING, MOVING TEXTURE BECOMES LOUD AND FILLED WITH
UNINTELLIGIBLE NOISES.

                    MORGAN
          Stop!

Graham and Merrill freeze -- both touching the monitor over
the roof of the station wagon.

WE HEAR SOMETHING THAT SOUNDS LIKE A VOICE EMERGE AND THEN
QUICKLY FADE AWAY.

                    MORGAN
          It doesn't sound like words.

Merrill concentrates on THE SWIRLING MOVING TEXTURE COMING
FROM THE BABY MONITOR.

Graham looks around at his rapt family.

                    GRAHAM
          See this is why we're not watching
          those news reports.  People get
          obsessed.
              (beat)
          I'm letting go now.

                    BO
          No dad!

                    MORGAN
          Don't do it!

                    MERRILL
          You'll lose the signal!

Graham looks at Merrill, who's now one of them.  Beat.

Morgan is the first one to move.

                    MORGAN
          Don't let go.

He moves from the back passenger door to the back bumper
where he begins to climb onto the station wagon.

                    GRAHAM
          Morgan?

                    MORGAN
          It gets clearer, the higher you
          hold it.

Morgan crawls on the roof and takes the monitor ever-so
gently out of Graham and Merrill's outstretched hands.

                    GRAHAM
          Morgan, be careful.

                    MERRILL
          I got him.

Merrill climbs up over the side and joins Morgan on the roof. 
Merrill keeps a hand on his nephew.  Morgan raises the
monitor above his head.

THE RED LIGHTS ON THE BABY MONITOR ALL TURN ON.

THE SWIRLING TEXTURE COMING FROM THE MONITOR BECOMES
SOMETHING MORE MECHANICAL, LIKE THE HUM OF LARGE EQUIPMENT IN
THE DISTANCE.

THE VOICE LIKE SOUNDS ARE UNDER A CRACKLE BUT ARE CLEARER AND
LOUDER.

Bo runs to the front bumper and climbs onto the hood.

                    GRAHAM
          Hold on.

Graham cuts her off by taking a seat on the hood.  He takes
hold of Bo.  All four are on the car now.

Morgan stands up on the roof of the station wagon.  Merrill
holds him by the waist.

Bo tries to get up onto the roof by climbing over Graham and
the windshield.  Graham boosts her up over his head with both
hands.

                    GRAHAM
          Merrill you got her.

Merrill reaches out his free hand.  Bo reaches out to him. 
THE SOUND FROM THE MONITOR SUDDENLY CHANGES.

                    MORGAN
          Stop!

Everyone STOPS exactly where they are.  Graham holds Bo over
his head.  Bo reaches out to Merrill.  Merrill sits on the
roof with one arm out.  Morgan stands with the baby monitor
raised high in the air.  The Hess family remains very still
on the hood of their station wagon as they listen.

THE CRACKLING IS GONE.  THE VOICE-LIKE SOUNDS ARE CLEAR AND
UPFRONT.  THERE ARE TWO DISTINCT TONES IN THE MIX.

                    MORGAN
              (soft)
          There's two of them talking.

THE VOICE-LIKE SOUNDS ARE NOT WORDS BUT MORE LIKE GRUNTS AND
GURGLING LIKE SOMEONE DROWNING.  THE SOUNDS ARE BEING CREATED
BY INHALES, NOT EXHALES.  A SEQUENCE OF THESE SOUNDS IN ONE
TONE IS FOLLOWED BY SILENCE AND THEN THE SECOND TONE BEGINS
ANOTHER SEQUENCE LIKE A CONVERSATION.

Graham struggles to hold Bo up.  Bo struggles to keep her
arms out.  Merrill struggles not to turn his face to the
incredible SOUNDS ABOVE HIS HEAD.

THE TONES ESCALATE IN VOLUME.

Morgan's eyes widen as THE SEQUENCE OF SOUNDS BECOMES SHORTER
AND FASTER.  THE TONES BECOME HARDER, ANGRIER.  THE SILENCES
ALMOST GONE.

THE VOICE-LIKE TONES REACH A LOUD FEVERISH PACE, ALMOST
VIOLENT AND THEN WE HEAR A CLICK AND THEY'RE GONE.

Beat.  Everyone looks up at the baby monitor.  The red lights
are off.  ONLY THE BLAND HUM OF NORMAL STATIC COMES FROM IT'S
SPEAKER.

Beat.

                    MORGAN
              (soft)
          They hung up.

Graham brings Bo down into his lap.  Morgan takes a seat next
to Merrill on the roof.  The Hess family sits like mental
patients on the top of their station wagon.

                                                  CUT TO:

EXT.  BACKYARD - EVENING

WE ARE AT THE EDGE OF THE CROPS LOOKING BACK AT THE HOUSE. 
The LIGHTS are on in the kitchen.  We see Graham, Merrill and
the children doing dishes after dinner.

The DOG IS BARKING FURIOUSLY.

OUR VIEW TURNS TO LOOK AT THE BARN THROUGH THE CROPS. 
Isabelle, the remaining German Shepherd is tied to a post
outside the barn.  The dog whips back and forth frantically. 
She keeps looking in our direction.

WE HEAR A SCREEN DOOR OPEN.  WE TURN TO LOOK BACK AT THE
HOUSE.  Graham steps out the back screen door with a bowl of
dog food and a bowl of water.

We watch him as he walks towards the frantic dog.  When he
gets close, Graham slows.  He approaches the dog carefully. 
He places the two bowls close but not too close.  The dog has
no interest in them.  She keeps barking and glaring in our
direction.

Graham watches her for a few moments, and THEN TURNS AND
LOOKS DIRECTLY AT US FROM ACROSS THE YARD.

WE PULL BACK INTO THE DARKNESS OF THE CROPS.

                                                  CUT TO:

EXT.  BARN - EVENING

Graham stands frozen looking across his yard.  Isabelle, the
dog turns in desperate circles behind him.  Graham's eyes
stay focused on the same point in the darkness.  He talks to
no one.

                    GRAHAM
          You know something?  Even
          entertaining the possibility of
          this for a minute has been
          exciting.

Beat.  Graham starts to move.

                    GRAHAM
          I can see how people can get
          carried away with this type of
          thing.

Graham reaches the barbecue area.  There's a flashlight on
the picnic table.  Graham TURNS THE FLASHLIGHT ON.  A NARROW
BEAM FALLS ON THE GRASS FIVE FEET AHEAD OF HIM.

Graham starts toward the crops.

                    GRAHAM
          It's a kind of faith.  It's an
          intoxicating thing to believe in
          something you can't see.

THE BEAM OF LIGHT FALLS ON THE WALL OF CORN CROPS LINING THE
BACKYARD.  Graham steps right up to them.  He hesitates and
then steps into the field of

CORN CROPS.

We can't see two feet in any direction.  Six foot stalks of
corn line Graham on all sides.  THE FLASHLIGHT THROWS A
WAVERING BEAM ON THE CROPS AHEAD OF HIM.

                    GRAHAM
          You were always good at that...

THE BEAM OF HIS FLASHLIGHT FINDS A NARROW PATH.  Graham
starts following it.  His shoulders brush crops on either
side.

                    GRAHAM
          Believing in things you couldn't
          see.
              (beat)
          You would have been the first
          person on that station wagon
          wouldn't you?  You and Morgan would
          have been wrestling for that baby
          monitor.

SOMETHING MOVES UP AHEAD.

Graham stops.  HE SHINES HIS LIGHT DOWN THE PATH.  Nothing
but crops disappearing into darkness.

                    GRAHAM
          It'll be secretly kind of sad for
          everybody, when this turns out to
          be -- all just make believe.

THERE'S MOVEMENT RIGHT NEXT TO HIM.  Graham spins and aims
the FLASHLIGHT AT THE CROPS TO HIS RIGHT.  THE LIGHT ONLY
PENETRATES A FEW FEET INTO THE CROPS.

                    GRAHAM
              (yelling)
          You're wasting your time here!  I'm
          not going to report this or
          anything you do to me crops, to the
          news or TV or anybody!  You're not
          going to get famous!

Beat.  There is no response.  GRAHAM CAN HEAR HIS OWN
BREATHING... IT SOUNDS HEAVY, ECHOISH... LIKE THERE'S TWO OF
HIM.

Beat.  Graham holds his breath.  THE SOUND OF SOMEONE ELSE
BREATHING CONTINUES BEHIND HIM.

Graham turns and drops the FLASHLIGHT at the same time.  THE
BEAM OF LIGHT TURNS OFF WHEN THE FLASHLIGHT HITS THE GROUND.

GRAHAM IS IN DARKNESS NOW.  HE LOOKS IN THE DIRECTION OF THE
BREATHING.  BUT CAN'T SEE ANYTHING.  HIS OWN BREATHING IS
FAST AND LOUD NOW.

Graham kneels down and gropes in the darkness.  His hands
search over the ground in all directions.  They finally touch
the flashlight.  Graham quickly fumbles with it to find the
"on" button.  He does.

A BEAM OF LIGHT SHOOTS ACROSS THE GROUND.  SOMETHING POWDERY
WHITE STANDS FIVE FEET AWAY.

It instantly moves into the darkness.  Graham tries to get
up.  He stumbles backwards into the crops.  He's tangled in
crops as he struggles to rise.  He gets up and starts
running.

Leaves and stalks slap him from all directions.  He panics. 
He doesn't know where he is.  THERE IS SOMETHING COMING
BEHIND HIM.

Graham makes a sudden right turn.  He puts his hands in front
of him to protect his face and eyes.  He's running as fast as
he can.  HE HEARS STALKS OF CORN BREAKING BEHIND HIM.

Another sudden turn, this time left.  Graham emerges into his

BACKYARD.

Graham keeps running across the yard.  ISABELLE BARKS
FRANTICALLY.

When Graham reaches the porch stairs, he stops and turns.

There is no one behind him.  The wall of crops fifty feet
away sway in the gentle night breeze.

Graham gains control of his breathing.  He turns and walks to
the screen door, slowing his breathing down with each step.

                                                  CUT TO:

INT.  KITCHEN - EVENING

Graham steps into the kitchen.  His hair is messed.  His
shirt has a few leaves from corn stalks stuck to it.  He
locks the back door.

The children don't notice his presence.  They're splashing
each other at the sink as they clean the dinner dishes.

Graham looks through the kitchen doorway to the family room. 
He sees Merrill there.

Merrill's hands are in his pockets as he stares at the WOODEN
BASEBALL BAT mounted above the fireplace.  Merrill doesn't
notice him either.

Graham takes two steps to the kitchen table and slowly takes
a seat.  His breathing is a slow controlled pant.  He runs
one shaky hand through his hair as he gathers himself and
thinks.  His kind eyes stare down at the ground as he slows
his mind.  Beat.

Merrill is the first to notice him.  He moves from where the
baseball bat is hung, into the kitchen.  As he passes the
children at the sink, he turns off the faucet.

The children stop playing and look up to Merrill.  They
follow his stare to the kitchen table.

Beat.  Graham looks up at them.

                    GRAHAM
              (soft)
          Okay.
              (beat)
          Let's turn on the TV.

                                                  CUT TO:

INT.  FAMILY ROOM - EVENING

THE TV GOES ON WITH A CLICK.  THE SCREEN BLOWS WHITE AND THEN
IMMEDIATELY DARKNESS.  OUTLINES AND SHAPES EMERGE.

THE SOUND POPS ON.

                    TV REPORTER
          -- first appeared fifty two minutes
          ago.

THE SCREEN FILLS WITH CRISP BLACKS.  WE ARE WATCHING VIDEO OF
A NIGHT SKY OVER A DENSE CITY.  THE THOUSAND LIGHTS OF THE
CITY FILL THE BOTTOM OF THE SHAKING IMAGE.

ANOTHER SET OF LIGHTS DOT THE SKY ABOVE THE CITY.  THEY ARE
ARRANGED IN TWO "V'S" SIDE BY SIDE.

Bo puts her finger to the screen and counts the hovering
lights.

                    BO
          Fourteen.

Morgan, Merrill and Graham stand silently before the
television set.

                    TV ANCHOR
          Mexico City officials as well as
          U.S. officials have confirmed that
          these are not air crafts from
          either government's airforce.  The
          first sighting was made by an Air
          Mexico 747 en route from Mazatlan
          to New York as the unidentified
          crafts entered Mexico City air
          space.  They were not detected by
          radar by either country.

Beat.

                    MERRILL
          The crazies were right.

Beat.  Everyone just watches the fourteen lights hovering on
the screen.

                    MORGAN
          We have to tape this...

Morgan reaches into the pile of video tapes under the
television stand.  He grabs one.

Bo snatches the video as Morgan tries to put it into the VCR.

                    BO
          My ballet recital.

Morgan stares at his sister.

                    MORGAN
              (gravely serious)
          Listen Bo.  This is very important. 
          Everything people have written
          about in science books is going to
          change.  The history of the world's
          future is on the TV right now.  We
          need to record this so you can show
          your children this tape and say you
          were there...
              (beat)
          For your children Bo.

                    BO
          My ballet recital.

                    MORGAN
          Dad!

Graham doesn't take his eyes off the screen.

                    GRAHAM
              (preoccupied)
          Find another tape.

Graham and Merrill sit down at the same time on the sofa. 
They both have the same dazed, slow movements.

Morgan rummages through the pile of videos frantically.  He
finds one and reaches for the VCR.

                    MORGAN
          Uncle Merrill, I'm using your tape.

Morgan slams the tape marked "Bay Watch" into the VCR and
presses record.  He's breathing heavy now.  Wheezing
actually.

Morgan moves to the sofa and takes a seat in between his
father and his uncle.  Bo walks over and squeezes in also. 
The four of them stare at the television.

          Told you.

Morgan brings his asthma spray to his mouth and inhales.

                                             DISSOLVE TO:

INT.  FAMILY ROOM - MIDNIGHT

The family room lights are off now.  The TV is still on.  The
SOUND IS MUTED.  There are a couple glasses of Bo's water on
the television now.

The fourteen lights are still hovering on the screen.  Morgan
is asleep on Graham's lap.  Bo is asleep on Merrill's
shoulder.

                    MERRILL
              (whispers)
          Some people are probably thinking
          this is the end of the world.

Graham turns his sleepy eyes away from the screen to Merrill.

                    GRAHAM
              (whispers)
          That's true.

Merrill looks his brother in the eyes.  Beat.

                    MERRILL
              (whispers)
          Do you think it's a possibility?

                    GRAHAM
              (whispers)
          Yes.

                    MERRILL
              (whispers)
          How can you say that?

                    GRAHAM
              (whispers)
          That wasn't the answer you wanted?

                    MERRILL
              (whispers)
          Can you at least pretend to be like
          you used to be?  Give me some
          comfort?

Beat.  Graham thinks it over.

                    GRAHAM
              (whispers)
          ... There are all different ways
          you can tell that there's someone
          really there watching out for us. 
          You see signs.  Sometimes they're
          little ones.  You think of someone. 
          The phone rings.  They're on the
          phone... Sometimes they're big,
          like fourteen lights hovering over
          Mexico City.
              (beat)
          Sure, there are a lot of people
          watching this who think this could
          be a bad thing.  But there are a
          lot of people watching this, who
          think it's a miracle.  A sign of
          God's existence.  It's all in how
          you look at things Merrill.
              (beat)
          What you have to decide is what
          kind of person you are?  Are you
          the type who believes in miracles
          and looks for signs or are you the
          kind who believes, things just
          happen by chance?

Beat.  Merrill is deep in thought.

                    MERRILL
          I was at this party once.  I'm on a
          couch with Sara Mckinney.  She was
          just sitting there, looking
          beautiful and staring at me.  I go
          to lean in and kiss her and I
          realize I have gum in my mouth.  I
          turn and take out the gum.  Stuff
          it in my paper cup next to the sofa
          and turn around.  Sara Mckinney
          throws up all over herself.
              (beat)
          I knew the second it happened.  It
          was a miracle.  I could have been
          kissing her when she threw up. 
          That would have scarred me for
          life.  I may never have recovered.

Merrill looks at the TV screen.  Beat.

                    MERRILL
          I'm a miracle man.  Those lights
          are a miracle.

Graham smiles.

                    GRAHAM
              (whispers)
          There you go.

Beat.

                    MERRILL
              (whispers)
          So which type are you?

Beat.

                    GRAHAM
              (whispers)
          Do you feel comforted?

                    MERRILL
              (whispers)
          Yes.

                    GRAHAM
              (whispers)
          What does it matter then?

The two of them turn back to the silent screen of the
television.  It's a long beat before Graham speaks.

                    GRAHAM
              (whispers)
          Do you know what Colleen's last
          words were before they killed her?

Beat.  Merrill turns and stares quietly at his brother.

                    GRAHAM
              (whispers)
          She said, "See", and then her eyes
          glazed a bit and she said... "Tell
          Merrill to swing away."

Merrill's mouth opens a bit.  Graham turns and chuckles at
his expression.

                    GRAHAM
              (whispers)
          Do you know why she said that?

Merrill nods, "No."

                    GRAHAM
              (whispers)
          Because the nerve endings in her
          brain were firing as she died, and
          some random memory of us at one of
          your baseball games popped into her
          head.
              (beat)
          There is no one watching out for us
          Merrill.  We're all on our own.

Graham turns back to the television.  Beat.

THE LIGHT OF THE TELEVISION FLICKERS ON THE FACES OF THE TWO
BROTHERS AS THEY SIT WATCHING IN SILENCE.

                                                  CUT TO:

INT.  FAMILY ROOM - DAY

Graham's eyes open.  DAYLIGHT FILLS the family room.  He is
alone on the couch.  Alone in the room.

He looks to the television.  It's not there.

Graham moves to his feet and look around the room.  His eyes
stop on an EXTENSION CORD that runs from a wall outlet in the
family room, across the front hall, and under a closet door.

Graham moves to the door.  WE HEAR MUFFLED TELEVISION VOICES. 
Graham opens the

CLOSET.

Merrill looks up.  He's seated on a kitchen chair with the
television on a roll-away stand crammed in with him.

                    MERRILL
          For the kids protection.  All they
          were doing was watching TV from
          five a.m.  I felt like they were
          getting obsessed like you said. 
          They should be playing furry, furry
          rabbit or tea party or something
          right?

                    GRAHAM
          What's furry, furry rabbit?

                    MERRILL
              (points)
          That's a game isn't it?
              (beat)
          Anyway...
              (points at the TV)
          There's been some interesting
          developments.

                    GRAHAM
          What time is it?

                    MERRILL
          Eleven a.m.  They're gone.

Beat.  Graham looks at the TV screen.  There's a daylight
shot of Mexico City.  The skies are empty above it.

                    MERRILL
          But they're not really gone.  We
          just can't see them.  Early this
          morning a bird flew right at the
          area where the lights were hovering
          last night.

Merrill puts a finger in the sky on the screen.

                    MERRILL
          It stopped dead in the air and fell
          straight down.

Merrill's finger trails to the bottom of the screen.

                    MERRILL
          They caught it on tape and they've
          been playing it all morning.  They
          found the bird.  His head crushed
          in.  When you see the footage it
          looks like the bird flew into a
          wall in the sky.
              (beat)
          They think they have some invisible
          shield thing going, like an optical
          illusion.

                    GRAHAM
          The bird could have had a heart
          attack and crushed his head when he
          fell.

                    MERRILL
          Already thought of.  Two other
          birds did the same thing an hour
          later.  Not as dramatic.  They
          lived.  But you could see they hit
          something.

Graham looks at the empty sky on the screen with different
eyes.

                    MERRILL
          They're still there hovering.  In
          fact, some people think there's
          more of them now.  All over the
          place.  Over us even.
              (beat)
          And there's a theory about the crop
          circles now.  They think it could
          be some kind of landmark, visual
          mapping system -- so they can
          navigate.  Coordinate.  Makes sense
          doesn't it?

                                                  CUT TO:

INT.  MASTER BEDROOM - DAY

We are inside Graham's bedroom facing his bathroom door,
which is closed.  The same sun-faded outline of where a large
cross used to hang, is stained on the wall next to the door.

Graham opens the bathroom door and steps out with wet hair. 
He towels it dry as he moves to his bedroom window.

WE LOOK OUT THE SAME WINDOW WE LOOKED OUT AT THE VERY
BEGINNING.

The backyard is large and green with a wooden jungle gym.  A
single tree throws shade onto a picnic table.  The back of
the yard is lined by corn crops.  Golden and brown.  Six feet
high.

The crops go on well beyond our view.  Graham stares at them
quietly.  Watching.

Beat.  THE SOUND OF WHISPERING DRAWS HIS ATTENTION FROM THE
WINDOW.

He listens closely.  HIS CHILDREN ARE WHISPERING IN THE NEXT
ROOM.

                                                  CUT TO:

INT.  CHILDREN'S BEDROOM - DAY

Graham walks into the hall and looks in their room.

Morgan and Bo are seated on the edge of their bed.  They have
TIN FOIL wrapped around their heads like a helmet.  Graham
stares at his children.

                    MORGAN
          So the aliens can't read our minds.

                    GRAHAM
          Oh.

                    MORGAN
          They tell you everything in this
          book.

Morgan holds up the book he bought from Nathan's bookstore.

Graham enters the room.  The children make space for him on
the bed.  He takes a seat between them.  Morgan puts the book
on his father's lap.

                    MORGAN
          It says they're probably very small
          -- like my height -- because, as
          their brains developed, there was
          no use for physical development. 
          It says they're probably
          vegetarians, because they would
          have realized the benefits of such
          a diet.

                    GRAHAM
          Who wrote this book?

Graham looks on the back cover for a picture.  There's none
there.

                    MORGAN
          Scientists who have been persecuted
          for their beliefs.

                    GRAHAM
          That means they're unemployed.

Morgan closes the book.

                    MORGAN
          Dad, are you going to be serious?

Bo points at the book.

                    BO
          Yeah, serious.

Graham looks at his two children with foil on their heads.

                    GRAHAM
          I don't know what got into me.

Beat.  Morgan puts the book on his father's lap.

                    MORGAN
          There are pictures.

Beat.  Morgan opens the tome.

                    MORGAN
          Dr. Bimboo, one of the authors of
          the book --

                    GRAHAM
          Bimboo?

                    MORGAN
          Dad.

                    GRAHAM
          I just asked his name.

                    MERRILL
          You had a tone.

Beat.  Graham acknowledges with a nod that he did have a
tone.

                    MORGAN
          He says there are two reasons why
          Extraterrestrials would visit us.

Morgan turns the page.

                    MORGAN
          To make contact in the spirit of
          exploration and furthering the
          knowledge of the universe.

Graham looks at an illustration of a small, bulbous headed
figure shaking hands with a bearded human.

                    MORGAN
          Or the other reason... They're
          hostile.  They've used up the
          resources on their planet and are
          looking to harvest our planet next.

Morgan turns the page.  There is a picture of a house.  A
space ship is hovering over the home shooting laser beams at
it.  Beat.

                    GRAHAM
          Looks a little like our house
          doesn't it?

Morgan and Bo lean in closer to look at the picture.  Beat.

                    BO
          The same windows.

                    MORGAN
              (soft)
          That's weird.

The three of them study the picture of the house.  It's on
fire.  Their eyes move to the front yard.  There are three
bodies lying dead on the front lawn.  Two are children.

THE PHONE RINGS.

The children SCREAM and cling to their father.  THEIR SCREAMS
DIE DOWN.  The PHONE RINGS again.  Graham gets up.  He closes
the book.

                    GRAHAM
          That's enough from Dr. Bimboo for
          now.  Everybody in this house needs
          to calm down and eat some fruit or
          something.

Graham steps out into the hallway.  He tucks the book under
his arm and picks up the phone.

                    PHONE VOICE
          Father.

THROUGH THE PHONE WE HEAR SUDDEN SCUFFLING, A CHAIR SQUEAL
AGAINST THE FLOOR and then the phone disconnects.

                    GRAHAM
          Hello?

NOTHING BUT DEAD AIR.  Graham looks at the receiver and then
slowly hangs it up.

Graham walks down the hall to a small window.

The window looks down the driveway and out onto the road. 
Graham stares into the distance.  About a half-mile away we
see the TIP OF A HOUSE.  Graham gazes at it for a beat.

                                                  CUT TO:

INT.  FRONT HALL - DAY

Graham comes down the stairs with his overcoat on.  He moves
to the closet door and knocks on it before opening it.

Merrill looks up from the television.

                    GRAHAM
          I'm going out for a few minutes. 
          No one leaves this house.  No one.

Merrill nods.

                    MERRILL
          Where are you going?

                    GRAHAM
          Ray Reddy's house.

Graham starts down the hall.  Merrill steps out of the closet
for the first time.  He looks down the hall shocked.

                    MERRILL
          Why?

Graham unlocks the front door.

                    GRAHAM
          I think he just called here.

                                                  CUT TO:

INT.  CHILDREN'S BEDROOM - DAY

BLUE SKY -- OUR VIEW MOVES OVER CLOUDS.  WE ARE LOOKING
THROUGH SOME KIND OF LENS.

                    BO (O.S.)
          You don't think something bad will
          happen do you Morgan?

Morgan pulls his eye away from the telescope that is set up
on the window seat in his room.

                    MORGAN
          Why, you got one of your feeling
          again?

Bo nods, "Yes."

                    MORGAN
          Is it bad?

Bo nods, "Yes" slowly.

                    MORGAN
          If it does, I won't let anything
          bad happen to you.

Bo hugs Morgan tight.

                    BO
              (soft)
          I don't want you to die.

                    MORGAN
          Who said I was going to die?

Bo keeps hugging Morgan.

                    MORGAN
          Who said I was going to die?

Beat.  Morgan peels Bo's arms off of him.

                    MORGAN
          Come on Bo.  I need to keep a look
          out.

Bo lets go.  Morgan puts his eye to the eyepiece of the
telescope.

                                                  CUT TO:

EXT.  REDDY HOUSE - DAY

A mailbox reads "R. Reddy."

There is a gray and white house at the end of the quarter
mile driveway.  We saw the roof of this house from the Hess
hallway window.

Graham stands at the front door and RINGS THE DOORBELL AGAIN.

Beat.  Graham tries to look inside.  Curtains block his view.

Graham walks around the porch.  Turns the corner of the
house.  He looks in a side window.

THE VIEW THROUGH THE WINDOW IS OF A KITCHEN.  THE KITCHEN
CHAIRS ARE ON THEIR SIDE.  THE KITCHEN TABLE ITSELF, IS
UPSIDE DOWN, LEANING AGAINST A CLOSED DOOR.  THE ROOM IS
TOTALLY WRECKED.

Graham stands straight up.  He looks around nervously.  He
takes two steps back towards the front of the house and the
safety of his station wagon before he notices the GREEN TRUCK
parked to the side of the house.

There is someone sitting in it.

                                                  CUT TO:

EXT.  REDDY DRIVEWAY - DAY

The passenger side window of the truck is open.  Graham steps
up to it and looks inside.  The thin man with the leather
jacket, we saw in town, sits behind the wheel.  He stares out
the windshield.  He is covered in sweat.

                    GRAHAM
          Hello Ray.

RAY REDDY doesn't look over.  Doesn't react.  Keeps staring.

Ray clutches the steering wheel tightly, turning his knuckles
a yellow white.

Graham glances to the backseat of the truck.  There are two
large bags over flowing with clothes.

Graham's eyes gently move back to Ray and drift down to the
TWO BLOOD STAINED AREA ON HIS SHIRT.  Beat.

                    GRAHAM
          What happened Ray?

Beat.  Ray doesn't look over when he speaks.

                    RAY
          I wrote your number down to call
          you.  It's been sitting next to the
          phone for six months.  When I knew
          it was inside the house, I couldn't
          think of any other number to call. 
          I panicked.
              (beat)
          Thank you for coming Father.

                    GRAHAM
              (soft)
          You're welcome Ray.

Tears start falling down Ray's face.

                    RAY
          I worked so long that night.  I
          ain't never fallen asleep driving
          before.  And never since.  Most of
          the ride home, there wasn't a car
          insight in either direction.  If
          I'd fallen asleep then, I'd a ended
          up in a ditch with a head ache.  It
          had to happen at that right moment. 
          That certain ten-fifteen seconds
          when I passed her walking.  It was
          like it was meant to be.

Ray finally turns.  His red face quivers as he talks.

                    RAY
          I guess if this is the end of the
          world, I'm screwed right?  People
          who kill Reverends' wives aren't
          exactly ushered to the front of the
          line in heaven.

Ray starts the car.

                    GRAHAM
          Where you going Ray?

                    RAY
          To the lake.  The way I see it, all
          the places marked in the crops and
          such -- none of them are really
          near water.  I figure they don't
          like water.
              (beat)
          Can't be any worse than here.

Beat.

                    GRAHAM
          Ray, did you see one of them?

Ray looks at Graham.

                    RAY
          I'm truly sorry for what I've done
          to you and yours.

The two men stare at each other for a beat.  Ray looks away. 
He puts the car in drive.

                    RAY
          And don't open my pantry Father.  I
          locked one of them in there.

Graham steps away as the truck moves forward and pulls down
the driveway.

INT.  CLOSET - DAY

Merrill's head is leaned against a bunch of winter coats. 
His eyes are closed.

                    TV ANCHOR
          ... The startling footage we're
          about to show you was photographed
          by a forty-two year old Romero
          Valadares.

Merrill's eyes open.

                    TV ANCHOR
          This video was taken yesterday
          afternoon at his son's seventh
          birthday, in the city of Passo
          Fundo, Brazil.  It was sent to the
          local news bureau there and
          satellited to us a few minutes ago. 
          All initial opinions are; this is
          genuine.

THE TELEVISION ANCHOR APPEARS FLUSTERED.

                    TV ANCHOR
          What you are about to see, may
          disturb you.

Merrill sits up in his chair.

THE PICTURE OF THE ANCHORMAN IS REPLACED BY A HANDHELD VIDEO
IMAGE ON THE TV SCREEN.  THE IMAGE IS OF A FAMILY ROOM WHERE
A BUNCH OF CHILDREN IN DRESS CLOTHES CROWD AROUND A SLIDING
GLASS WINDOW.

THE CHILDREN ARE SPEAKING PORTUGUESE EXCITEDLY.  THEY LOOK AT
THE CAMERA AND POINT TO THE OUTSIDE THROUGH THE GLASS DOORS.

THE HANDHELD IMAGE MOVES OVER THEIR SHOULDERS TO LOOK OUT
THROUGH THE GLASS INTO A CRAMPED BACKYARD.  THERE IS A
RECTANGULAR TABLE WITH PARTY DECORATIONS AND AN UNTOUCHED
BIRTHDAY CAKE ON IT.  COLORFUL BALLOONS FLOAT AROUND THE
BACKYARD.  THERE IS NO ONE OUTSIDE.

THE IMAGES PANS AROUND THE DENSE FOLIAGE THAT FORMS A WALL
AROUND THE YARD.  THE IMAGE ZOOMS AND SEARCHES IN THE
DARKNESS OF THE BRANCHES.

The chair in the closet CREAKS as Merrill leans forward a
little towards the television screen.

WE HEAR A BURST OF PORTUGUESE.  THE IMAGE PANS AWAY FROM THE
GLASS DOORS BACK INTO THE HOME.  WE LOOK DOWN A NARROW HALL
TO THE KITCHEN.  A BOY WITH A BIRTHDAY HAT IS SEATED ON THE
KITCHEN COUNTER, POINTING FRANTICALLY OUT THE KITCHEN WINDOW. 
HE YELLS IN PORTUGUESE.

THE CROWD OF CHILDREN AROUND THE GLASS DOORS START RUSHING
INTO THE KITCHEN.  THEY ARE JOINED BY A FEW ADULTS.  THE
IMAGE FOLLOWS THEM IN.

THE KITCHEN WINDOW IS BLOCKED BY HEADS WHEN WE FIRST ARRIVE.

                    MERRILL
          Move children!  Vamonos!

THE IMAGE FINDS AN OPENING OVER THE SHOULDER OF THE BOY WITH
THE BIRTHDAY HAT AND ANOTHER CHILD.

WE ARE NOW LOOKING OUT THE KITCHEN WINDOW.  WE SEE A NARROW
ALLEY ONLY A FEW FEET WIDE CREATED BY A STONE WALL AND A
SMALL GARAGE BUILDING.  ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE WALL IS
DENSE FOLIAGE.  THE WALL ENDS A FEW FEET AFTER THE GARAGE
BUILDING.

WE HEAR THE CHILD'S VOICE VERY CLOSE TO US SPEAKING IN
PORTUGUESE.  THE CAMERA PANS JUST A LITTLE AS THE FACE OF THE
LITTLE BIRTHDAY BOY FILLS THE SCREEN.  HE TALKS EXCITEDLY
DIRECTLY AT US AND AT SOMEONE BEHIND THE IMAGE.

                    BOY WITH HAT
          Esta atras da garagem!  Esta atras
          de ai!  Is behind!

THE BOY GESTURES TO THE GARAGE BUILDING.  THE IMAGE SETTLES
BACK ON THE WINDOW.  WE STARE AT THE NARROW ALLEY.  THE IMAGE
ZOOMS A BIT.  SEARCHES THE EDGE OF THE GARAGE BUILDING.  THE
IMAGE STARTS WIDENING OUT.

AND THEN WE SEE IT.

THE KITCHEN ERUPTS WITH CHILDREN'S SCREAMS AS A LARGE NON-
HUMAN FIGURE MOVES FROM THE GARAGE BUILDING TO BEHIND THE
WALL.  IT'S OUT OF SIGHT IN LESS THAN A SECOND.

Merrill is frozen like a statue.  His mouth is open a little. 
The closet FILLS WITH THE PANDEMONIA OF THE KITCHEN ON THE
VIDEO.

THE VIDEO IMAGE ON THE NEWS, PAUSES.  BEAT.  WE SEE IT
REWIND.  WE SEE THE FIGURE ZIP BACK BEHIND THE GARAGE IN A
FLICKER.  THE VIDEO STOPS.  PLAYS AGAIN.

THE IMAGE ZOOMS A BIT.  SEARCHES THE EDGE OF THE GARAGE
BUILDING.  STARTS TO WIDEN OUT.  THE KITCHEN STARTS TO FILL
WITH SCREAMS AS THE FIGURE APPEARS... THE IMAGE FREEZES.

THE NEWS HAS PAUSED THE VIDEOTAPE ON THE EXACT MOMENT THE
NON-HUMAN FIGURE IS VISIBLE.  IT'S HALFWAY ACROSS THE ALLEY.
IT'S MOTION HAS BLURRED IT, BUT YOU CAN TELL ITS SHAPE NOW.

Merrill Hess stares stunned at the IMAGE OF AN UPRIGHT ANIMAL
LIKE CREATURE.  THE STRIATIONS ALL OVER ITS BODY LOOK LIKE
BRANCHES.  EXACTLY LIKE BRANCHES.  THEY MATCH THE BUSHES
WHERE IT WAS HIDING, PERFECTLY.

INT.  KITCHEN - DAY

The door swings open slowly.  Graham steps into Ray Reddy's
kitchen.

Cabinets are open.  Dishes are broken.  Chairs are turned
over.  The faucet is running full blast.

Graham's eyes move across the room.  The kitchen table is
upside down and leaned up against the pantry door.

THE SOUND OF A GLASS JAR BREAKING ON THE GROUND CAN BE HEARD
INSIDE THE PANTRY.

Graham takes a few conservative steps to the middle of the
kitchen.

He leans a little bit and listens.  From behind the pantry
door WE HEAR THE SOUND OF BREATHING.  THERE ARE QUIET
MOVEMENT SOUNDS.  THE SOFT SOUND OF GLASS BEING CRUSHED AS
IT'S BEING WALKED ON.

Graham can almost see the bottom of the door around the
leaning table.  Graham stands up straight and thinks it over. 
Beat.

Graham takes two small steps closer.

When he leans, he can now see the entire bottom of the pantry
door.  THERE IS LIGHT LEAKING OUT FROM BENEATH IT.  THERE IS
SHADOW BEING THROWN FROM INSIDE THE PANTRY.  THE SHADOW MOVES
BACK AND FORTH UNDER THE DOOR.

                    GRAHAM
          Hello.

THE SHADOW STOPS MOVING.

Beat.

                    GRAHAM
              (loud)
          The police are here... I am with
          them... I am a police officer.
              (beat)
          I just want to talk to you.

SILENCE.  There is no movement from the pantry.  Beat.

                    GRAHAM
              (loud)
          We know all about the hoax.  We
          already took some of your friends
          downtown in the paddy wagon.
              (mouths to himself)
          Paddy wagon?

THE ONLY SOUND IN THE KITCHEN IS THE SOUND OF THE FAUCET
RUNNING.  Graham waits for a reply, but none comes.

                    GRAHAM
          If you tell us your name and why
          you did it, we'll give you the same
          deal we gave the others.  Don't
          throw away your life son.

Beat.

Graham bends down where he stands.  He puts his head near the
wood floor.  He tries to look under the door.  All he can see
are the bottoms of a couple shelves in the corner of the
pantry.  He's at too severe an angle.

Graham sits up.  He's only four feet away from the pantry
door.  He looks around not knowing what to do.  His eyes fall
on a bunch of kitchen knives that have spilled from a drawer
onto the floor.

He takes a butcher knife from the group and moves closer to
the door.  Beat.  He reaches with the butcher knife
underneath the slanted kitchen table.  He uses the knife like
a mirror to see under the door.  Graham watches the SOFT
REFLECTION IN THE FLAT STAINLESS STEEL SURFACE OF THE BLADE. 
WE CAN MAKE OUT BROKEN GLASS AND RIPPED OPEN PACKETS OF RICE
AND CEREAL ON THE GROUND.  THERE ARE POCKETS OF SHADOWS WE
CAN'T SEE INTO.

Graham pulls the knife out.  He sits there kneeling two feet
from the door.  Beat.

He takes a deep breath and starts to lower his head under the
slanted table.

He stops halfway down.  He loses his nerve and sits up.  He
rises to his feet as he places the butcher knife on the
counter.  Graham starts walking across the kitchen.  He gets
to the door.  Puts his hand on the doorknob.

He stays like that for a long time.  Beat.

Graham lets go of the doorknob -- He turns and walks quickly
across the kitchen -- He picks up the butcher knife -- He
kneels down next to the pantry -- He ducks his head under the
slanted kitchen table -- He places his cheek to the floor,
only inches from the bottom of the door, and looks into the
pantry.

There is broken glass and rice throughout the wooden floor of
the pantry.  Nothing else.

Graham stares at his VIEW OF THE FLOOR.  Something's wrong. 
Parts of it feel like a painting.  THE PAINTING MOVES.

TWO BLACK EYES OPEN -- SEEMINGLY SUSPENDED IN THE MIDDLE OF
THE ROOM.  THEY ARE SIDEWAYS.  THEY LOOK AT GRAHAM.

GRAHAM YELLS.  HE JOLTS UP.  HIS HEAD HITS THE SLANTED TABLE
HARD.

FOUR LONG FINGERS AND CLAWS, THE EXACT COLOR OF THE WOODEN
FLOOR REACH OUT AND MISS HIS FACE BY A FRACTION OF AN INCH.

GRAHAM REACTS.  THE BUTCHER KNIFE COMES DOWN FAST AND HARD ON
THE PROTRUDING WOOD COLORED FINGERS.  SLAM!

WE HEAR AN UNBEARABLY HIGH-PITCHED INHALE SOUND FROM INSIDE
THE PANTRY.

                                                  CUT TO:

EXT.  STATION WAGON - DAY

The station wagon knocks over the "Ray Reddy" mailbox as it
turns sharply onto the road.

Graham picks up speed as he passes the wall of crops on his
right.

THE STATION WAGON SUDDENLY BRAKES.

Two black skid marks form on the road as the station wagon
comes to a fast stop.

Beat.  Graham gets out of the car.  He walks a few feet ahead
of the station wagon.  He bends down in the middle of the
road.

A BIRD lays limp on the asphalt.  Its head is crushed.

Graham gazes at the still pile of feathers.  Beat.

Graham turns and looks straight up at the BLUE, CLOUDLESS SKY
above him.

                    GRAHAM
              (soft)
          Douche bag.

INT.  HESS FAMILY ROOM - DAY

Graham enters his front hall.  He closes the door and locks
it behind him.  He turns and looks into the family room.

Morgan and Bo and Merrill are seated together on the sofa. 
All three are wearing foil helmets.  Beat.

                    MERRILL
          They're skin changes color.  That's
          why we couldn't see him that night.

Graham stares at his family huddled on the couch.  Beat. 
Graham takes in the news as he moves to the stairs.  He takes
a seat on the second to last step.

He sits obscured by the balusters.  Beat.

                    GRAHAM
          Tell me something Morgan.  In that
          book of your, did they happen to
          detail what would happen if they
          were hostile?

                    MORGAN
          Yes.  They would invade us using
          only ground tactics.  Hand to hand
          combat.  They wouldn't use their
          technology or fight an airborne
          battle, because they would know we
          would eventually use nuclear
          weapons and the planet would be
          useless to them.

                    MERRILL
          I'm sorry, what book is this?

                    GRAHAM
          Did they say what our chances would
          be if they did invade?

                    MORGAN
          They said one of two things could
          happen.  One, they fight and are
          defeated and leave to return again
          with full forces hundreds or even
          thousands of years later.

                    GRAHAM
          What's two?

                    MORGAN
          They win.

The words hang in the air.  Graham sits quietly on the second
step of the stairs.

                    GRAHAM
          What do you think about the idea
          that they don't like places near
          water, and we might be safe from
          them near a lake or something?

                    MORGAN
          Sounds made up.

Beat.

                    GRAHAM
          We can choose to believe it and
          pack up and leave.
              (beat)
          Or we can stay here.  Board up this
          house.  Hide inside our home and
          wait it out.  Either way, at least
          we'll be together.
              (beat)
          All those in favor of the lake,
          raise your hand.

No one raises their hand.

                    GRAHAM
          All those in favor of home, raise
          your hand.

All four put their hands in the air.  Beat.  They lower them
and sit in silence.

                    MERRILL
          How do we know boards will do
          anything?

Beat.

                    GRAHAM
              (soft)
          Because, they seem to have trouble
          with pantry doors.

EXT.  HESS HOUSE - AFTERNOON

WE ARE WATCHING THE HOUSE FROM THE CROPS.  We see Graham
inside the house, closing the window shutters in one room
after another.

WE SEE a stack of wooden boards on the porch.

OUR VIEW MOVES to the barn where Isabelle is tied.  She is
not pacing.  She is not barking.  She sits staring right at
us.  She is shivering.

OUR VIEW MOVES to the garage building where we see Merrill
carry a huge pile of his clothes and things down the stairs. 
He's moving into the main house.

Merrill walks across the yard.  His eyes look around
carefully as he moves.

Part of the pile in his arms falls to the grass as he crosses
the lawn.  He stops walking and starts to gather up the
fallen things.  He picks up a couple shirts and two baseballs
encased in glass cases.

The glass encasing one of the souvenir baseballs, has
cracked.  He takes the ball out.  Stares at it.

We watch from the crops as Merrill puts down his pile of
clothes and things on the grass.  He looks around and finds
what he's looking for.  A rake.

Merrill unscrews the fork on the rake from the wooden handle. 
With the wooden stick in one hand and the souvenir baseball
in the other, he turns to face the crops.

WE PULL BACK A LITTLE INTO THE CROPS.  PART OF OUR VIEW IS
OBSCURED BY STALKS, BUT WE STILL SEE MERRILL CLEARLY.

Merrill looks around cautiously again, before getting into a
batter's stance.  His left leg digs into the grass in front
of him.  His weight is mostly on his back leg.  He looks out
into the distance high over the crops.  He throws the
baseball up in the air...

Merrill grabs the wooden handle.  Merrill's shoulders move
with blinding speed.  The wooden rake handle slices the air. 
And misses the ball.

The ball drops at Merrill's feet.

WE WATCH as Merrill picks up the ball and tries again.  This
time his shoulders move even faster.  The wooden stick
actually makes A RESONANT SOUND as it cuts the air.

The ball drops at Merrill's feet.

WE WATCH THROUGH THE CROPS as Merrill snatches the ball up
and tries a third time.  This time he YELLS as he swings.  He
rips the air with the wooden stick so fast it blurs to the
eye.

The baseball drops at his feet.  Strike three.

Merrill stands still in the yard.  He's breathing a little
heavy as he stares down at the ball.

He gently picks it up.  He walks back to his pile of things
and then suddenly turns.  He throws the ball in the air as he
does.  His left leg goes out.  His weight goes to his right
leg as he turns his shoulders with astonishing speed and
power...

THE SOUND OF THE BASEBALL HITTING THE WOODEN HANDLE CRACKS
ACROSS THE WHOLE YARD.

The ball rockets into the air.  We watch it fly overhead...
sail high over the crops... it becomes a tiny dot in the sky.

After a long beat of silence it comes back to earth.  It
lands in the street and bounces twenty feet into the air.  It
cleared at least four or five hundred feet of crops.  Maybe
more.

WE LOOK BACK to Merrill standing in the backyard.  He drops
the wooden stick to the grass and moves for his things.  He
piles them in his arms.  When his arms are full, he starts
for the porch.  WE WATCH FROM THE CROPS AS MERRILL GOES
INSIDE THE HOUSE.

INT.  CLOSET - LATE AFTERNOON

Morgan and Bo are seated on the kitchen chair in the closet.

                    MORGAN
          Come quick!

THE FLICKER OF THE TELEVISION FALLS ON THE CHILDREN'S FACES.

WE HEAR MERRILL AND GRAHAM COMING DOWN THE HALLWAY BEFORE WE
SEE THEM.

They appear almost at the same time in the doorway to the
closet.  Graham and Merrill are holding hammers.

All four stare at the television.

ON THE SCREEN IS A STREET FILLED WITH PEOPLE RUNNING WITH
SUITCASES AND BAGS.  SOME PEOPLE ARE GETTING TRAMPLED. 
OTHERS ARE STANDING ON THE STREET CORNER AND YELLING.  THERE
IS PANIC IN THE AIR.

                    TV ANCHOR
          Tel Aviv joins Nairobi, Lagos and
          Jerusalem as the latest to confirm
          the appearance of lights.  There
          are lights in the skies over an
          estimated two hundred and seventy
          four cities.  That total could be
          as high as four hundred within the
          hour.

THE IMAGE ON THE TELEVISION SCREEN CHANGES TO A NIGHT TIME
VIEW OF THE TEL AVIV CITY LINE.  THERE ARE FOURTEEN LIGHTS IN
TWO "V" FORMATIONS OVER THE CITY.

                    GRAHAM
          They decided to show themselves.

Beat.

                    MORGAN
          They think these look like stages
          immediately proceeding an attack
          maneuver.

                    MERRILL
          It's like War of the Worlds.

                    MORGAN
          They think it might happen all at
          once.

The words silence everyone.  Beat.

The image goes back to a quiet TV anchor.  He takes a second
before starting up again.

                    TV ANCHOR
          Hundreds of thousands have flocked
          to synagogues, churches and
          temples.

The television shows hundreds of Israelis in a temple and in
the streets praying.

Graham watches quietly as the masses pray side by side.

                    TV ANCHOR
          Ground forces are being assembled
          in countries throughout the
          globe...

                    GRAHAM
          I'm going to get back to the
          windows.

Bo watches as Graham leaves the doorway of the closet.  She
turns back to the television.

Beat.  Merrill leans down between his niece and nephew.

                    MERRILL
              (whispers)
          You guys okay?

They don't answer.  They watch the soldiers loading up onto
trucks on the television.

                    MORGAN
          Some guy had a sign that said it
          was the end of the world.
              (beat)
          Nothing really bad is going to
          happen, is it Uncle Merrill?

                    MERRILL
          Don't worry.

Morgan glances at Bo and then back to his uncle.

                    MORGAN
          You sure right?

Beat.  Merrill gazes at the two questioning faces.  He looks
back at the empty closet doorway where Graham stood.  He
turns back to the children.

                    MERRILL
          You know about signs Morgan?  Not
          like the ones people write on. 
          It's like if you poured a glass of
          milk and you dropped the glass by
          mistake and broke it before you
          could drink it.  Then you looked at
          the milk carton and saw that the
          milk was spoiled.  They're things
          that happen by chance or luck, but
          make you feel that someone's
          watching out for you.

The children think it over.  Beat.

                    MORGAN
          I once had a bad dream and I
          couldn't wake up.  I kicked at the
          table next to my bed and something
          fell on me and I woke up.  It was a
          picture of mom.  She was smiling. 
          It made me feel safe... You mean
          like that?

Beat.

                    MERRILL
          Yeah, like that.
              (beat)
          I believe in signs Morgan.  I think
          there's someone watching out for
          us.  I got to believe he's going to
          make sure we're all right in the
          end.

Merrill smiles as he steps out of the closet and closes the
door half-way.

He stands in the hall by himself.  He takes a couple deep

Graham sits in a chair by the windows.  He has a board on his
lap.  He has a hammer in his hands.  Graham drowns in his

                                                  CUT TO:

INT.  UPSTAIRS LANDING - EVENING

Graham, Bo and Morgan are seated in the upstairs hallway. 
There's a couple boards left leaning against the walls.

Merrill comes out of the children's room with his tools.

                    MERRILL
          Too many windows in the bedrooms. 
          We don't have enough boards.

Merrill stands and leans against the wall.

                    GRAHAM
          We'll have to board up the bedroom
          doors.

                    MORGAN
          Where are we going to sleep?

                    GRAHAM
          The family room.

Everyone sits quietly for a moment.

                    MORGAN
          What about Isabelle?

                    GRAHAM
          We'll keep her in the garage, after
          dinner.

Beat.

                    MERRILL
          I'll make sandwiches.

                    BO
          I want spaghetti?

                    MERRILL
          We should eat fast Bo.

                    GRAHAM
          Spaghetti sounds great.

Merrill glances at Graham.

                    GRAHAM
          What do you want, Morgan?

Beat.

                    MORGAN
          Anything?

Graham nods "yes."

                    MORGAN
          French toast... and mashed
          potatoes.

                    GRAHAM
          Now we're talking.
              (beat)
          How about you Merrill?

Graham turns and looks at Merrill.  They stare at each other
quietly.  They have a conversation without words.  Beat.

                    MERRILL
              (soft)
          Chicken Teriyaki.

                    GRAHAM
          Good choice... I'm going to have a
          cheeseburger with bacon.
              (smiles)
          Extra bacon.

                                                  CUT TO:

INT.  KITCHEN - EVENING

The windows in the kitchen are boarded up, as is the back
door.

The sink is piled with pots and pans.  It seems like every
utensil and dish in the kitchen was used.

                                                  CUT TO:

INT.  DINNING ROOM - EVENING

One side of the dinning room is lined with windows that have
been boarded up.

The table is set.  Mash potatoes, spaghetti, French toast,
chicken teriyaki and bacon cheeseburgers are all displayed
elegantly on serving dishes.

The Hess family sits around the table.  Beat.  The scene is
somber.  No one is moving.

                    GRAHAM
          What's the matter with everyone? 
          Eat.

No one says anything.  No one eats.

Beat.

                    MORGAN
          I'm scared.

                    BO
          Me too.

                    GRAHAM
          I don't want to hear anymore talk
          like that.  And I don't want to see
          anymore faces like the ones I'm
          looking at.
              (beat)
          We are going to enjoy this meal. 
          Nothing can stop us from enjoying
          this meal!  Enjoy!

Bo sits next to her three glasses of water and begins to cry.

                    GRAHAM
          Stop crying!

                    MORGAN
          Don't yell at her!

Morgan's face is hard, but tears start to fall anyway. 
Graham watches as both his children cry at the table.

                    GRAHAM
          Fine, if you all don't want to eat,
          then I'm going to have some of
          everything.

Graham takes big scoops of every dish and piles it on his
plate.  He digs his fork into the pile and starts to shove it
in his mouth.  He swallows.

                    GRAHAM
          This tastes so great.

Bo, Morgan and Merrill watch in stunned silence as Graham
stuffs more in his mouth.  He chews and chews and swallows
hard.  He digs his fork into the pile again.

Graham starts crying as he eats.  He keeps taking more bites. 
More tears fall.

Morgan gets up from his seat.  He goes to Graham's chair.  He
leans against his dad's arm and cries with him.  Graham's
fork stops moving.  He watches as Bo moves from her seat to
his other side.  She holds her dad's arm and cries.

Beat.  Graham pulls them both up onto the chair with him and
hugs them tight.  Merrill leans forward and comes to the pile
on Graham's chair.  Merrill buries his head in Graham's
shoulder.  The Hess family huddles together at one end of the
table.  Beat.

THE BABY MONITOR EXPLODES WITH STATIC AND NOISE.

Everyone slowly turns and looks over to Morgan's place
setting where the baby monitor sits on the table.  THE RED
LIGHTS ON THE FRONT ARE ALL LIT UP.

Merrill sits up.  Graham puts down the children from his lap. 
He gets up from his seat and moves around the table and out
of the dinning room.  He moves through the family room and
into the hall.

Graham opens the closet door and looks in at the television. 
He turns it ON.

Beat.  THE EMERGENCY BROADCAST SYMBOL IS ON THE SCREEN.  A
LOW TONE EMITS FROM THE TV.  Beat.  Graham changes stations. 
THE SYMBOL AND TONE APPEAR ON EVERY CHANNEL.  THE MONOTONE
SOUND FILLS THE CLOSET.  Beat.

Graham steps out into the hall.  Merrill and the two children
are standing there waiting.  Graham looks at them.

                    GRAHAM
              (soft)
          It's happening.

                                                  CUT TO:

INT.  UPSTAIRS HALL - EVENING

Merrill pounds furiously with his hammer as he nails boards
to the children's bedroom door.  The master bedroom door is
open with a board leaning next to it.  Graham is inside his
bedroom

                                                  CUT TO:

INT.  GRAHAM'S BEDROOM - EVENING

Graham walks to the window next to his bed.  It's the same
one we've looked out twice before.

Graham looks out onto his backyard.  The FLOOD LIGHT FROM THE
HOUSE THROWS LONG SHADOWS OVER THE YARD.  There is a light
breeze.  Nothing seems wrong.

Graham's eyes stay locked on the crops which go on and on
into darkness.  He moves closer to the glass.  Watches the
top of the corn stalks swaying slightly with the wind.

SOMETHING MOVES IN THE DARKNESS.

Graham's eyes moves to where the corn crops fade into black
forty feet away.  Graham goes very still.

LINES EMERGE IN THE CROPS; THE KIND OF LINES MADE BY SOMEONE
TRAMPLING THROUGH A FIELD.  WE CAN'T SEE WHO'S MAKING THEM. 
ALL WE SEE ARE THE COUNTLESS LINES BEING FORMED.  THE LINES
MOVE FROM THE DARKNESS TOWARDS THE HOUSE.  GRAHAM WATCHES
THEM CLOSE IN ON HIS BACKYARD.  THIRTY FEET... TWENTY FEET...
TEN...

Graham backs away from the window towards the middle of his
bedroom.

                    MERRILL
          Graham hurry.

Graham turns to see Merrill standing with the last board in
the hall.  Graham moves out into the hall and shuts the
bedroom door behind him.

                                                  CUT TO:

INT.  UPSTAIRS HALL - EVENING

Merrill immediately puts the wooden board up and starts
hammering nails into the frame.  Graham picks up his hammer
and quietly begins to hammer nails into the wood.

Graham glances to his right as he works.  Bo and Morgan are
standing together at the top of the stairs.  Bo holds
Morgan's hand.

Graham keeps hammering as he speaks.

                    GRAHAM
          Did I ever tell you what everyone
          said when you were born, Bo?

Bo nods "no" lightly.

                    GRAHAM
          You came out of your momma and you
          didn't even cry.  You just opened
          your eyes and looked around at
          everybody.  Your eyes were so big
          and gorgeous, the ladies in the
          room gasped.

Graham stops hammering.  Merrill keeps going.

                    GRAHAM
          They literally gasped.
              (Graham gasps like them)
          Then they go, "She's like an
          angel."  They said, "We've never
          seen a baby so beautiful."

Graham smiles to himself as he remembers the moment.  Merrill
finishes hammering.

Graham goes over and picks up Bo.

                    GRAHAM
              (soft)
          And you know what else happened?

Bo nods, "no."

                    GRAHAM
              (soft)
          When they put you on the table to
          clean you up, you looked at me and
          smiled.  They say babies that young
          can't smile... You smiled.

Graham looks at his daughter quietly.  He brushes the hair
out of her face as Merrill moves to Morgan and picks him up.

All four turn and look at the three boarded up bedroom doors. 
Beat.

                    GRAHAM
              (soft)
          Let's go down now.

                                                  CUT TO:

INT.  FRONT HALL - EVENING

Graham puts Bo down in the hallway.  She stands close to him. 
Merrill puts down Morgan.  The four of them stand quietly in
a tight group.

THEY HEAR FRANTIC BARKING IN THE DISTANCE.

                    MORGAN
          We forgot about Isabelle.

ISABELLE'S BARKING BECOMES DESPERATE AND ANGRY.  THEY LISTEN
AS SHE BARKS NONSTOP FOR TEN SECONDS... AND THEN SUDDENLY
STOPS.

THE LOW EMERGENCY TONE FROM THE CLOSET TV FILLS THE SILENCE.

Beat.

                    MERRILL
              (whispers)
          Should we turn off the lights?

                    GRAHAM
              (soft)
          They already know we're here.

THE FIRST SOUNDS OF MOVEMENT ARE HEARD OUTSIDE.  CREAKS OF
WOOD FROM THE FRONT PORCH CAN BE HEARD.

THERE IS SOUNDS OF MOVEMENT FROM BEHIND THE LOCKED BACK DOOR.

SOUNDS OF MOVEMENT AGAINST THE SIDE OF THE HOUSE.  SOUNDS
FROM ALL DIRECTIONS.

THERE IS SCRATCHING NOISES AGAINST THE FRONT DOOR.  METAL
NOISES AS THE HANDLE IS TRIED.

                    MORGAN
              (almost inaudible)
          Dad --

THE DOOR CREAKS AS PRESSURE IS PLACED AGAINST IT.

                    GRAHAM
          Do you know what happened when you
          were born Morgan?

Morgan looks at his father, unable to speak.

                    GRAHAM
          You came out and your momma kept
          bleeding.  The doctors rushed you
          out of the room before I could even
          see you.

THERE ARE THUDS ABOVE THEM.

All four look up.

                    MERRILL
          They're on the roof.

                    GRAHAM
          While they were trying to fix her
          up, all she kept asking about was
          you.

THEY LISTEN AS THE THUDS INCREASE IN NUMBER.

THE FIRST SOUND OF SHATTERING GLASS IS HEARD FROM UPSTAIRS.

Merrill looks up the stairs at the boarded bedroom doors.

                    MERRILL
          They're in the house.

Graham takes Morgan's hand.

                    GRAHAM
          I wanted your momma to see you
          first.  She had dreamed about you
          her whole life.
              (beat)
          They waited till she felt better,
          then they brought you in.  They
          placed you right in her arms.  And
          she looked at you.  And you looked
          at her.  You just stared at each
          other for the longest time and then
          she said real soft, "Hello Morgan,
          I'm you momma, you look just like I
          dreamed."

Graham smiles down at his son who smiles gently back.

SCRATCHING NOISES BEGIN TO COME FROM UPSTAIRS.

The group of four turns and watches the top of the stairs. 
The BEDROOM DOOR HANDLES ARE BEING RATTLED.

Merrill's eyes moves quietly above the bedroom doors, to the
ceiling of the upstairs hallway.  He stares at a rectangle in
the ceiling.  A tiny rope hangs from the rectangle.  Beat.

                    MERRILL
          The attic door.

Merrill sprints up the stairs.

Morgan and Bo watch as Graham follows after Merrill.

                                                  CUT TO:

INT.  UPSTAIRS HALL - EVENING

Graham and Merrill stare up at the ceiling.  There is
movement right above them.  Dust falls from a ceiling light
right next to them.

The rope hanging from the attic trapdoor hangs between them. 
They watch as it begins to twitch and sway.

The springs in the trap door begins to GROAN.  The door
starts to fall open.

Merrill and Graham raise their arms above their head and
reach up.  The door opens a few inches.  Merrill is taller. 
The door presses against his fingers first.  It gives a few
more inches before Merrill stops it.

Graham's finger are barely touching it.  Merrill's face turns
red with strain as something pushes down on the door.

                    MERRILL
          This is a very temporary solution.

Graham brings his arms down.  He sees his children watching
from the bottom of the stairs.  Graham looks around where he
is.  There is a very small table with photos against a wall. 
A laundry closet and three boarded up bedroom doors...
nothing else.  Graham turns to Merrill.

                    GRAHAM
          How temporary?

Merrill's face is a deep crimson.

                    MERRILL
          Twenty-two seconds.

Graham looks around again... the same things... the same
table... the same closet... Graham stops and stares at the
closet.  It has a wooden folding door that opens and closed
on a guide rail.  The wooden folding door is very tall.  Its
top is one foot from the ceiling.

Graham goes to the closet and grabs the door.  He starts
rocking it hard.  Pulling it out... It starts to come out of
its guide rail... Graham leans back with all his weight...
The thin wooden door rips out of place.  One end is still
attached at the hinge.  Graham pulls it straight.  It reaches
into the middle of the landing.  It stands right next to
Merrill.  Right under the attic trapdoor.  Its top is only a
few inches lower than Merrill's reach.

                    GRAHAM
          Let go.

Merrill hesitates and then lowers the attic trapdoor.  It
connects with the top of the closet door and stops.  The
trapdoor is now open almost a foot... We can now see part of
the bottom step of the wooden pull out stairs that lead to
the attic.

Merrill and Graham step away as the closet folding door holds
the weight of the attic door.

After a moment, the spring on the attic trapdoor recoils as
the pressure is let up.  The trapdoor closes.  Beat.

It opens with force, slamming the top of the standing closet
door with a THUD.

The attic trapdoor closes again.  Opens again with force. 
THUD.

The closet folding door begins to pull away from the hinges
keeping it upright.

Graham moves down the stairs.  Merrill follows him.

                                                  CUT TO:

INT.  FRONT HALL - EVENING

THE SCRATCHING NOISES FILL THE HOUSE.

Morgan and Bo are frozen watching a set of long fingers reach
under the front door.  THE COLOR OF THE FINGERS CHANGES -- TO
THE EXACT COLOR AND TEXTURE OF THE YELLOW CRACKED PAINT ON
THE DOOR.

THUD.  THE TRAPDOOR SLAMS THE TOP OF THE FOLDING DOOR
UPSTAIRS.

Graham and Merrill arrive in the front hall.  Graham takes
Morgan and Bo by the hand and leads them quickly down the
hall.  Merrill backs away as he watches the top of the
stairs.

ANOTHER THUD ECHOES THROUGH THE HOUSE.

                                                  CUT TO:

INT.  KITCHEN - EVENING

The swinging door swings open and closed behind Merrill as he
enters the kitchen.

Graham has moved the chairs away from the kitchen table and
waits by it.  Merrill goes over and the two of them push the
table against the swinging door.

They take the kitchen chairs and pile a couple on top, and
jam the rest underneath the table.

Graham leans against the kitchen counter.  Merrill stares at
the pile of furniture.

                    MERRILL
          This is going to do nothing.

                    GRAHAM
          We have to go in the basement.

Graham points to a set of narrow stairs that lead to a
darkened door at the bottom.

                    MERRILL
          There's no way out of there.

Beat.  Graham looks at the faces of his frightened children.

                    GRAHAM
          Did I ever tell you, I dislocated
          Uncle Merrill's arm?

THUD.

                    MERRILL
          Should we make a run for it out the
          back?

                    GRAHAM
          They're right behind the door.

Merrill looks at the boarded up back door.  Graham turns to
Bo and Morgan who stand against the wall.

                    GRAHAM
          He was only a year and half old.

                    MERRILL
              (to Graham)
          What are you doing?

                    GRAHAM
          He was trying to eat a second
          chocolate bar.  Your grandma said,
          "No."  He tried to take a bite, so
          I grabbed it.

THUD WITH A CRACK OF WOOD FROM UPSTAIRS.  Merrill turns and
stares at the barricaded entrance to the kitchen.

                    GRAHAM
          I must have pulled his arm at an
          awkward angle.  His elbow popped
          right out of the socket.

THE LAST THUD COMES WITH A SOUND OF WOOD SPLINTERING.  THE
CLOSET FOLDING DOOR CRASHES TO THE GROUND IN THE UPSTAIRS
HALL.

WE HEAR CREAKS AS THE ATTIC TRAPDOOR OPENS.

                    GRAHAM
          He didn't scream or anything.  His
          arm just flopped to his side and he
          got real still.

                    MERRILL
          They're coming.

Graham moves towards the basement stairs.

                    GRAHAM
          I held him in my lap in the back
          seat as we drove to the hospital. 
          I couldn't stop crying... We need
          to go into the basement now.

Graham gestures for the kids to come to the stairs.  Morgan
and Bo move to their father slowly.

                    GRAHAM
          You know what your Uncle Merrill
          did right after the doctor put his
          arm back in place?  He jumped off
          the table and gave me a hug.  He
          had already forgotten that I was
          the one who hurt him.

Graham ushers the two children down the stairs.  He waits for
Merrill.  Merrill turns from the kitchen door and walks
toward him.  Merrill stops and looks down the stairs.

                    MERRILL
          We won't be able to get out of
          there.

                    GRAHAM
          I'm sorry I hurt your arm.

Beat.  Merrill's eyes fill with water.  He doesn't look up at
his older brother.

                    MERRILL
          I know.

Merrill walks down the stairs.  Graham waits at the top.  He
watches the kitchen door with the table and chairs against
it.  Beat.

THERE IS MOVEMENT OUTSIDE IN THE HALL.

The door starts to force its way open.  THE TABLE AND CHAIRS
BEGIN TO SCRAPE ACROSS THE KITCHEN FLOOR LIKE NAILS AGAINST A
CHALK BOARD.

WE HEAR VOICE-LIKE SOUNDS ENTER THE KITCHEN.  SOUNDS MADE
FROM INHALES, NOT EXHALES.

                                                  CUT TO:

INT.  BASEMENT - EVENING

Graham comes down the last few steps and enters the basement.

                    MORGAN
          We forgot our foil helmets!

Graham closes the door behind him.  It has no lock.

                    GRAHAM
          We need something to wedge against
          the doorknob.

The basement is lined with metal shelves.  The shelves are
cluttered with all sorts of canned goods, extension cords,
cleaning supplies, decorations, outdoor tools.  Merrill
rummages through the shelves frantically.

                    MORGAN
          They'll read our minds!

                    GRAHAM
          You're scaring your sister.

                    BO
          I'm already scared.

Graham puts his ear to the door and listens.

                    GRAHAM
          Merrill --

                    MERRILL
          I'm looking!

Merrill moves to another set of shelves.  He starts knocking
things to the ground.

                    MORGAN
              (to himself)
          They'll know our secret thoughts.

There is SCRATCHING AGAINST THE DOOR.  The doorknob turns. 
Graham grabs it with both hands.  The door begins to push
open.

                    GRAHAM
          Merrill!

                    MERRILL
          Got it!

Merrill reaches between two stacks of shelves and pulls out a
pick for digging in the ground.  He holds it up in the air. 
It has a three-foot wooden handle.

Merrill turns and rushes in Graham's direction.

A single light bulb hangs from a wire in the ceiling.  It is
the only light in the room.  Merrill CLIPS THE LIGHT BULB
with the end of the wooden handle as he crosses the room.

THE BULB SHATTERS.

THE BASEMENT IS INSTANTLY BLACK.

                    BO
          Dad!

WE HEAR THE SOUNDS OF SUDDEN COMMOTION, VOICES.  STRUGGLING
AT THE DOOR.  STEPS ON BROKEN GLASS.

CLICK.  A BEAM OF A FLASHLIGHT COMES ON.

IT ILLUMINATES MORGAN STANDING NEXT TO A RACK OF METAL
SHELVES.  HE TURNS THE FLASHLIGHT IN HIS TINY HANDS.

THE NARROW BEAM MOVES ACROSS THE DARKNESS.  IT FINDS MERRILL
AND GRAHAM LEANING UP AGAINST THE BASEMENT DOOR.

MORGAN MOVES THE BEAM DOWN TO THE PICK, WHICH IS WEDGED
BETWEEN THE DOORKNOB AND THE GROUND.  THE PICK WAVERS A
LITTLE WITH EACH PUSH FROM THE OTHER SIDE, BUT HOLDS.

THE SCRATCHING AND MOVEMENT OUTSIDE THE DOOR BEGINS TO
LESSEN.

Beat.  Morgan slowly moves THE BEAM BACK UP TO HIS FATHER'S
FACE.

                    GRAHAM
          Where's Bo?

THE BEAM SEARCHES IN THE DARKNESS.  THROUGH THE BOXES,
BETWEEN THE SHELVES... IT SETTLES ON A SMALL FOOT HIDING
BEHIND A COUPLE TWENTY-FIVE POUND BAGS OF DOG FOOD.  BO'S
HEAD SLOWLY APPEARS.  SHE SQUINTS AS SHE LOOKS IN THE LIGHT.

                    BO
          I'm okay.

ANOTHER BEAM COMES ON.  IT REVEALS MERRILL AT THE SHELVES
WITH A SECOND FLASHLIGHT.  HE LOOKS OVER THE CONTENTS OF THE
SHELVES NEAR HIM.  BEAT.

HIS BEAM OF LIGHT FALLS ON A RADIO.

He turns the knob to "on."  The radio lights up, but no sound
emerges for it's speakers.  Merrill turns the channel knob
and checks all the stations.  No sound.  No signal.  He
listens to the LIGHT HUM FROM THE SPEAKERS.

Beat.

                    MERRILL
          What's happening out there?

Beat.

                    GRAHAM
              (in the dark)
          I can't even imagine.

THEY ALL LISTEN TO THE DEAD AIR HUM FROM THE RADIO SPEAKERS.

                    MORGAN
          I hope they're doing better than we
          are.  We don't even have helmets.

THERE IS A LOUD BANG.

BOTH FLASHLIGHT BEAMS CRISSCROSS OVER THE BASEMENT AND COME
TO A STOP ON THE DOOR.

ANOTHER BANG.  THE DOOR VIBRATES.  THE PICK WITH THE WOODEN
HANDLE HOLDS IN PLACE.

BANG.

GRAHAM STEPS INTO THE BEAM OF LIGHTS.  He looks at the door
and then turns and faces the lights.

                    GRAHAM
          They're just making noises. 
          They're not trying to get in.
              (beat)
          Why are they doing that?

Graham looks at Merrill's corner of the darkness.  Morgan
moves his BEAM ONTO MERRILL.

                    MERRILL
          They want our attention on the
          door?

BANG.  A beat of silence.

                    GRAHAM
          They're distracting us?

                    MERRILL
          From what?

                    MORGAN
          The book says they're probably very
          good problem solvers.

                    MERRILL
          What book!

                    MORGAN
          They'll find a way in.

BANG.

                    GRAHAM
          Morgan, give me your flashlight.

Morgan puts the FLASHLIGHT ON THE GROUND AND ROLLS IT ACROSS
THE FLOOR.  THE BEAM SPINS IN TINY CIRCLES SHOWING THE BROKEN
GLASS OF THE BULB IN THE MIDDLE OF THE FLOOR.

THE FLASHLIGHT COMES TO A STOP IN GRAHAM'S PALM.  He picks it
up.

                    GRAHAM
          Is there an air vent in here?

Merrill moves next to Graham.  ANOTHER BANG FROM THE DOOR.

They aim their FLASHLIGHTS IN ONE CORNER OF THE ROOM.  The
brothers move in opposite directions.

GRAHAM MOVES HIS BEAM UP AND DOWN CHECKING THE WALLS AND THE
CEILING AS HE MOVES.

MERRILL MOVES BETWEEN SHELVES, ONE AT A TIME.  HIS FLASHLIGHT
PEERS BEHIND THE STACKS OF CANNED GOODS.

A BANG ECHOES THROUGH THE BASEMENT DOOR.

Merrill and Graham are at opposite ends of the room now.

                    GRAHAM
          I can feel air.

                    MERRILL
          Me too.

THE TWO BEAMS OF LIGHT START MOVING TOWARDS EACH OTHER.

                    GRAHAM
          It's getting stronger.

                    MERRILL
          I'm close.

BANG.

THE BEAMS MOVE UP AND DOWN OVER THE FINAL WALL.  GRAHAM AND
MERRILL MOVE CLOSER AND CLOSER... THE TWO BEAMS FINALLY COME
TO A STOP IN THE SAME PLACE... THEY SHINE DOWN ON MORGAN.

HE SITS ON THE GROUND AGAINST THE WALL.  HE STARES UP AT THE
TWO LIGHTS.

                    MORGAN
          What?

IN THE BEAM OF LIGHTS YOU CAN SEE HIS HAIR MOVING GENTLY FROM
A BREEZE.

GRAHAM AND MERRILL TURN THEIR LIGHTS STRAIGHT INTO THE AIR
VENT HE'S LEANING AGAINST.

EYES ARE REVEALED IN THE DARKNESS OF THE VENT.  A NARROW SET
OF METALLIC COLORED FINGERS SHOOT OUT BETWEEN THE HOLES IN
THE VENT GRILL AND GRAB MORGAN.

MORGAN SCREAMS.  THE FLASHLIGHTS DROP TO THE GROUND.  THERE'S
A DESPERATE SCRAMBLE.  FEET MOVE THROUGH THE BEAMS OF LIGHT.

WE CAN'T SEE WHAT'S HAPPENING.

                    MERRILL (O.S.)
          Hold the vent!

SOMEONE PICKS UP A FLASHLIGHT.  WE SEE GLIMPSES OF STRAINING
FACES.  MORGAN SCREAMING.

                    GRAHAM
          Pull him!

THE FLASHLIGHT IS DROPPED AND PICKED UP AGAIN.  WE SEE IT IS
BO WHO IS HOLDING THE LIGHT.

BO TURNS THE LIGHT AT THE VENT.  MERRILL IS THE ONLY ONE
THERE.  HE PRESSES ONE OF THE TWENTY-FIVE POUND BAGS OF DOG
FOOD AGAINST THE METAL GRILL.  HE DRAGS THE SECOND BAG OVER
WITH HIS FOOT AND SLAMS IT AGAINST THE FIRST BAG.  HE QUICKLY
MOVES OUT OF THE LIGHT.

BO FOLLOWS HIM WITH THE BEAM.  SHE FINDS HIM DRAGGING AN
ENORMOUS BAG OF FLOUR OVER TO THE VENT.  HE HEAVES IT ON TOP
OF THE PILE.  HE LEAVES THE LIGHT AGAIN.  RETURNS WITH
ANOTHER GIANT BAG OF FLOUR.  GRUNTS AS HE THROWS IT ON TOP OF
THE REST.

MERRILL FALLS TO THE GROUND EXHAUSTED.  THE PILE OF DOG FOOD
AND FLOUR COMPLETELY OBSCURE THE VENT.  A CAN OF SOUP ROLLS
ON THE GROUND NEAR MERRILL.  HE SLOWLY PICKS IT UP AND PUTS
AN ADDITIONAL EIGHT OUNCES ON THE PILE.

Merrill slowly catches his breath.  He reaches over to his
side and grabs the remaining flashlight.  HE TRAINS THE BEAM
AROUND THE ROOM TILL HE FINDS MORGAN.

HE FINDS THE BOY IN GRAHAM'S LAP.  MORGAN IS SEATED WITH HIS
BACK AGAINST GRAHAM'S CHEST.  USING HIM AS A CHAIR.  MORGAN'S
FACE IS PALE.  HE IS TAKING VERY LONG SLOW HEAVES.  IT SOUNDS
LIKE THE AIR IS GOING THROUGH A STRAW.  HE'S SUFFOCATING.

GRAHAM LOOKS UP INTO THE LIGHT.

                    GRAHAM
          We don't have his medicine.

Merrill looks at his nephew turning gray.

Graham pulls Morgan closer to his body and talks into the
child's ear.

                    GRAHAM
          Don't be scared Morgan.  We'll slow
          it down together.  Feel my chest. 
          Feel it going in and out.  Breathe
          like me.  Breathe like me.

Morgan's throat is closing -- his face is filled with strain
and panic.

                    BO
          He can't breathe.

Bo moves to Merrill and curls up with him as they watch.

Graham closes his eyes.  Beat.  He opens his eyes and talks
into Morgan's ear.

                    GRAHAM
          Stay with me.  Stay with me.  I
          know it hurts.  Be strong baby...
          It'll pass.

Graham closes his eyes -- talks to the darkness.

                    GRAHAM
          Don't do this to me again.  Not
          again.

Merrill stares at his brother's desperate face.

Graham's eyes open as Morgan's tiny fingers press down on
Graham's hand.  The fingers squeeze with all the strength
they have.

Graham looks to Merrill helplessly.  Merrill's eyes fill up
with water.

Graham's eyes close.

                    GRAHAM
          I hate you.  I hate you...

Graham's eyes open as he leans in close to Morgan's ear.

                    GRAHAM
          The fear is feeding it... Don't be
          afraid of what's happening...
          Believe it's going to pass...
          Believe it... Just wait... Don't be
          afraid... The air is coming...
          Believe... We don't have to be
          afraid... It's about to pass...
          Here it comes... Don't be afraid...
          Here comes the air...

A THIN STREAM OF SOUND EMITS FROM MORGAN'S THROAT.  LIKE THE
SOUND OF AIR LEAKING FROM A BALLOON.

                    GRAHAM
          There we go... We don't have to be
          scared at all... We know it'll
          pass.  We believe it... Don't be
          afraid Morgan.

Morgan's fingers relax a little on Graham's hand.

THE LEAKING BALLOON SOUND TURNS BACK INTO THE SOUND OF AIR
THROUGH A STRAW.

Merrill watches as Graham's face stays pressed up against his
son.

                    GRAHAM
          Feel my chest... Breathe with me. 
          Together... The air is going in our
          lungs... Together... We're the
          same.  We're the same.

Merrill watches as Morgan's chest starts to move in sync with
Graham's.

THE SOUND OF THE STRAW FADES AS MORGAN'S BREATHING TURNS INTO
LABORED BREATHS.

Graham's eyes close.  He starts crying.  He speaks to no one.

                    GRAHAM
              (soft)
          I hate you.

Morgan's fingers relax on Graham's hand.  Merrill watches as
father and son breathe together.  Merrill and Bo hold each
other tight.

THE FLASHLIGHT FLICKERS ON GRAHAM AND MORGAN'S EXHAUSTED
FACES.  THEY BOTH STARE OUT INTO THE DARKNESS OF THE
BASEMENT.  TEARS DRYING ON THEIR CHEEKS.  THEY'RE BOTH LOST
IN THEIR THOUGHTS.

Beat.

                    MERRILL
          I should save the flashlights.

Beat.  Graham nods without looking over.

MERRILL PRESSES THE BUTTON ON HIS FLASHLIGHT.  THE BEAM OF
LIGHT ILLUMINATING GRAHAM AND MORGAN GOES OUT.  THEY
DISAPPEAR INTO SHADOWS.

Merrill looks down to Bo, who has the second flashlight in
her hand.  THE BEAM POINTS UP AT THE BASEMENT CEILING ABOVE
HER AND MERRILL.

Merrill nods to her.  She reaches down and presses the
button.

THE BASEMENT IS ENGULFED BY BLACK.

                                             DISSOLVE TO:

INT.  BASEMENT - MORNING

WE ARE STILL IN BLACK.  A VOICE IS HEARD IN THE DARKNESS. 
IT'S MURKY AT FIRST, THEN BECOMES CLEARER.

                    VOICE
          ... Jordan, Saudi Arabia and
          Bahrain have also confirmed.

Graham opens his eyes from sleep.  HE SQUINTS FROM THE LIGHT
OF THE HANGING BULB IN THE BASEMENT.

Merrill steps into his vision.

                    MERRILL
          I found a pack of light bulbs.

Merrill walks back to the radio on the metal shelf.  THE
VOICE WE HEARD IN THE DARKNESS COMES FROM THE TINY SPEAKER OF
THE RADIO.

                    RADIO VOICE
          ... Parts of China and Northern
          Korea are among the few remaining
          to verify withdrawals.

                    GRAHAM
          They're broadcasting...

                    MERRILL
          It came on about two hours ago. 
          Woke me up.
              (beat)
          We won Graham.

Merrill waits for his brother to say something.  Beat.

                    MERRILL
          It went on all night.  Everywhere. 
          It was completely a ground battle. 
          Mostly hand to hand.  You can't see
          them unless you're up close.  A lot
          of people died.  Some from combat. 
          But most from poison gas
          inhalation.  They secrete it.

Beat.

                    GRAHAM
          How many died?

                    MERRILL
          They think over a hundred thousand. 
          They're just estimates.
              (beat)
          But we held strong.

                    GRAHAM
          How do they know it's over?

                    MERRILL
          A mass evacuation by them started
          about eight o'clock this morning. 
          It's eleven now.
              (beat)
          They're leaving.

Beat.

                    MERRILL
          You didn't think we'd make it.

Beat.

                    GRAHAM
          No.

                    MERRILL
              (low voice)
          Listen, there's things I can take
          and a couple things I can't and one
          of them I can't take, is when my
          older brother --
              (voice cracks)
          -- who is everything I want to be,
          starts losing faith in things.  I
          saw your eyes last night.
              (beat)
          I don't want to ever see your eyes
          like that again, okay?  I'm
          serious.

Merrill's face is hard.  He looks shaken.  Graham stares at
the conviction in his younger brother's expression.

                    GRAHAM
              (soft)
          Okay.

Beat.

THERE'S A WHEEZING SOUND FROM THE CORNER OF THE ROOM.  Graham
and Merrill turn to look at Morgan -- laying down on
Merrill's folded sweater.  Morgan's breathing is strained. 
He still looks grey.

                    MERRILL
          He's been like that for awhile.  We
          need to get him some medicine.

                    GRAHAM
          Have they said anything about our
          area?

                    MERRILL
          Philadelphia and its outlying
          counties are cleared, but who knows
          for sure?

Graham looks at Morgan lying limp on the ground.  Graham
turns to Merrill.

                    GRAHAM
              (whispers)
          He's not strong enough to fight off
          another attack.

                    MERRILL
              (whispers)
          I know.
              (beat)
          We need to be sure, before we open
          that door Graham.

The two men stand under the single dangling light bulb. 
Graham quietly turns and looks at Morgan.  He moves across
the room towards him.

Merrill watches as Graham kneels down and reaches to Morgan's
side.  Graham unclips the baby monitor from his son's belt.

Graham walks back to Merrill.  He holds it out between them. 
Beat.

He turns it ON.

A SLIGHT STATIC IS HEARD.  GRAHAM TURNS THE VOLUME ALL THE
WAY UP.  THE STATIC GETS A LITTLE LOUDER, BUT DOESN'T CHANGE. 
THERE ARE NO NOISES, NO SPIKES, NO VOICES... JUST EMPTY
ELECTRICAL STATIC.  Beat.

Graham makes eye contact with Merrill.  Beat.

                    MERRILL
          That's good enough for me.

                    GRAHAM
          Me too.

                                                  CUT TO:

INT.  BASEMENT STAIRWELL - MORNING

DAYLIGHT FILTERS DOWN FROM THE KITCHEN AND PIERCES THE
STAIRWELL TO THE BASEMENT.

The basement door cracks open a few inches.  Beat.  Merrill
opens it all the way.

DUST FLOATS UP IN THE DAYLIGHT THAT SPILLS DOWN THE STAIRS.

Merrill moves up the stairs by himself.  He reaches the top
and looks around.  Turns back down to the faces at the
bottom.  Gives them the thumbs up.

Graham leads Bo up the stairs.  He carries a limp Morgan in
his arms.

                                                  CUT TO:

INT.  KITCHEN - MORNING

THE KITCHEN IS KIND OF BEAUTIFUL IN ITS DESTRUCTION.  BEAMS
OF DAYLIGHT CRISSCROSS THE ROOM FROM THE PUNCHED OUT HOLES IN
THE WINDOWS AND BOARDS.

THE BACK DOOR IS WIDE OPEN.

WE HEAR SOUNDS FROM THE TV FILTERING IN FROM THE HALL.

Graham and Bo and Morgan watch as Merrill walks over the
toppled chairs to get to the cabinets.

                    GRAHAM
          Get the syringe as well.  We might
          need to give him an epinephrine
          shot.

Merrill nods as he begins to search the piles of things that
have fallen from the cabinets.

                                                  CUT TO:

INT.  FAMILY ROOM - MORNING

SHAFTS OF SUNLIGHT STREAM IN FROM ONE SIDE OF THE FAMILY ROOM
WHERE THE WINDOWS HAVE BEEN BROKEN IN.

Graham gently lays Morgan on the sofa.

WE HEAR CHEERING COME FROM THE TELEVISION, FILTER THROUGH THE
FRONT HALL AND INTO THE FAMILY ROOM.

Bo steps out of the closet and looks into the family room.

                    BO
          People are dancing.

She points at the closet.

Morgan strains to look in her direction.  Graham looks at
him.

                    GRAHAM
          You want to see it?

Morgan nods, "yes" as he struggles to breathe.

                    GRAHAM
          I'll bring the TV in here.

                                                  CUT TO:

INT.  CLOSET - MORNING

THE TELEVISION SHOWS A SHOT OF A STREET CORNER.  THOUSANDS OF
PEOPLE STAND IN THE STREETS.  A REPORTER STANDS AMONGST THEM
AND TALKS INTO A MICROPHONE.

                    TV REPORTER
          Today there are no countries, and
          no races, and no differences -- we
          are all apart of the same --

Graham unplugs the television.  The screen goes black.

Bo moves the coats aside as Graham wheels the television and
the television cart out into the hall.

                                                  CUT TO:

INT.  FAMILY ROOM - MORNING

Graham pulls the television into the family room.  Careful
not to trip it on the carpet.

THE GLASS OF THE TELEVISION IS LIKE A MIRROR.

Graham moves the television into position.  THE BLACK SCREEN
REFLECTS THE FAMILY ROOM BEHIND GRAHAM AS IT TURNS.

THE REFLECTION OF A CREATURE SILHOUETTED PANS ACROSS THE
TELEVISION SCREEN.

The TV stops moving.  Graham stays frozen with his hands on
either side of the television cart.  He's slightly bent over. 
His back is to the family room.

Graham straightens and turns around slowly.

Morgan is held by his waist three feet in the air.  Morgan's
face turns to the color of ash as his throat closes up.

For a moment it appears he's suspended in the air.  Then we
see the outlines... and we see the eyes.  The black eyes.

There is a creature close to seven feet tall standing in the
middle of the family room.  It's powdery skin has taken on
the shades, lines and colors of the family room so perfectly,
it almost disappears.

It blinks.

Graham and Bo have turned to stone.  Bo stands frozen in the
front hall.

Merrill comes out of the doorway from the kitchen to the
family room.  He takes two steps into the room and comes to a
stop next to the fireplace.  The inhaler and syringe in his
hand fall to the ground.  The creature is between Graham and
Merrill in the middle of the family room.

Morgan is dying.  THE LAST SOUNDS OF AIR STOP IN HIS THROAT.

The lines of the chairs and windowsill mimicked on the
creature's skin move as the creature moves its free hand.

Graham's eyes shift to the hand.  THREE OF THE CREATURES
FINGERS ARE MISSING -- SLICED OFF BY A BUTCHER KNIFE.

The creature's hand moves to Morgan's face.  It tilts its
fingers and palm back.  THE COLORS ON THE HAND ARE ALREADY
CHANGING TO MATCH IT'S NEW POSITION IN THE ROOM.

A small pore opens up on its wrist.  A YELLOWISH GAS STARTS
TO LEAK OUT OF THE OPENING.

Graham looks up from the leaking poison gas to the face of
the creature.  It's large empty black eyes lock on Graham's.

GRAHAM STARTS TO HEAR A HIGH PITCH RINGING SOUND -- IT BEGINS
TO ENGULF ALL SOUND IN THE ROOM.

GRAHAM STARES HELPLESSLY INTO THE LARGE BLACK EYES.

WE MOVE INTO GRAHAM'S EYES... THEY WIDEN.  WE SEE THE EMOTION
IN THEM.  HIS MOUTH BARELY GETS THE WORDS OUT.

                    GRAHAM
              (soft)
          He's reading my --

THE HIGH PITCHED RINGING SOUND OVERWHELMS EVERYTHING.  THE
ROOM GOES BRIGHT WHITE.

                                             DISSOLVE TO:

EXT.  STREET - NIGHT

WE ARE BLINDED BY A BRIGHT LIGHT.  THE LIGHT IS MOVING.  WE
REALIZE IT IS THE HEADLIGHTS OF A CAR THAT PULLS TO THE SIDE
OF THE ROAD.

The car door opens.  Graham Hess steps out.  His coat is
open.  He is wearing a black shirt and black pants.  A
priest's white collar sits under the lapel of the black
shirt.  Graham looks around in a daze.

We are on a country road.  THERE ARE STROBING RED AND WHITE
LIGHTS FILLING THE NIGHT AIR.  Four police cars are scattered
amongst the tow trucks and the ambulances.

A large group of officers and workers hover around a green
truck that has swerved off the road into a grouping of trees.

Officer Edgar Paski walks up to Graham.  He whispers
something into a walkie clipped to his shirt as he
approaches.  Edgar looks badly shaken.  Beat.  The two men
look at each other.

                    OFFICER PASKI
          What do you know?

Graham stands motionless with his hands at his sides.  Beat.

                    GRAHAM
          There was an accident.  Drunk
          driving.  They weren't sure.

                    OFFICER PASKI
          He wasn't drinking.  Ray fell
          asleep at the wheel.

Officer Paski gestures in the direction of one of the
ambulances.  Ray Reddy sits to the side on the grass.  His
arms rest on his bent knees.

                    GRAHAM
          Is he okay?

                    OFFICER PASKI
          Yes... That's the first thing
          Colleen asked too.

Graham smiles a little smile.

                    GRAHAM
          She's talking... Which ambulance is
          she in?

Beat.

                    OFFICER PASKI
          She's not in an ambulance Father.

                    GRAHAM
          Why not?

                    OFFICER PASKI
          See Father, Ray's truck swerved off
          the road and ah... Hit Colleen and
          then a tree.  She was pinned
          between the two.

                    GRAHAM
          Pinned?  What does that mean?

Beat.

                    OFFICER PASKI
          The truck... the truck has severed
          most of her lower half.

                    GRAHAM
          What did you say?

Beat.

                    OFFICER PASKI
          She won't be saved.  At this point
          she's alive, because the truck is
          holding her together.  She doesn't
          feel much, and she's talking almost
          like normal.  We didn't pull the
          truck out, cause we wanted you to
          come down here to be with her, as
          long as she's awake.  That won't be
          very long.
              (beat)
          Father, you understand what I've
          told you?

Beat.

                    GRAHAM
          Edgar.
              (he starts crying)
          Is this the last time I'm going to
          talk to my wife?

Beat.

                    OFFICER PASKI
          Yes it is.

                                                  CUT TO:

EXT.  STREET - NIGHT

The other officers turn and look as Graham walks by them.  He
walks on, unaware of the stares.

He slows as he reaches the back bumper of the truck.  It
sticks out onto the road a few feet.  He comes around the
side of the vehicle.

COLLEEN HESS is beautiful in a delicate way.  Her straight
brown hair falls down over her small face.  She leans over
the front bumper of the truck onto the hood.  Her head rests
on her arms like a child resting on a school desk.  Her back
is against a tree.  The lower half of her is obscured by the
truck.

She's able to raise her head and shoulders as Graham walks up
to her.  She is shivering slightly.

                    COLLEEN
              (soft)
          Hi sweetie.

                    GRAHAM
          Hi baby.

Graham glances down.  There are bundles of blood soaked
blankets in the area below her.  They peek out under the
twisted front of the truck.  Graham looks up quickly.

                    COLLEEN
          I was just taking a walk before
          dinner.

                    GRAHAM
          You love walks.

Beat.

                    COLLEEN
          I guess it was meant to be.

Beat.

                    GRAHAM
          Does it hurt?

                    COLLEEN
          I don't feel much.

                    GRAHAM
          Good.

Graham touches her cheek.  She starts crying.  Graham starts
crying with her.

                    COLLEEN
              (crying)
          ... Tell Morgan to play games --
          it's okay to be silly.

                    GRAHAM
              (crying)
          ... I will.

                    COLLEEN
              (crying)
          ... Tell Bo to listen to her
          brother.  He'll always take care of
          her.

                    GRAHAM
              (crying)
          ... I will.

                    COLLEEN
              (crying)
          ... Tell Graham --

                    GRAHAM
              (crying)
          I'm here.

                    COLLEEN
              (crying)
          Tell him... See.  Tell him to see.

Colleen presses her cheek on top of Graham's hand.  She rests
on it.  Her eyes are distant.

                    COLLEEN
              (soft)
          And tell Merrill to swing away.

                    GRAHAM
              (soft)
          What?
              (beat)
          Colleen?... Colleen?

WE ARE OVERCOME BY A BRIGHT WHITE.

                                                  CUT TO:

INT.  FAMILY ROOM - MORNING

WE ARE IN THE FAMILY ROOM.  THE HIGH PITCHED RINGING SOUNDS
FADE AND ARE REPLACED BY THE BREATHING IN THE ROOM.

THE BREATHING IS JOINED BY THE HISSING OF GAS AS IT'S BEING
RELEASED.

THE CREATURE FORCES POISON GAS OUT INTO MORGAN'S UNCONSCIOUS
FACE.

THE ROOM IS ENGULFED WITH STREAMS OF SUNLIGHT FROM THE BROKEN
WINDOWS.  THE LIGHT SEEMS TO CATCH CERTAIN THINGS IN THE ROOM
AND MAKE THEM STAND OUT.  THINGS ON SHELVES, THINGS ON
TABLES, THINGS ON THE WALL.

Graham stares at the baseball bat on the wall.  Beat.

                    GRAHAM
              (soft)
          Swing away, Merrill.

Morgan's face is obscured by gas.

                    GRAHAM
              (loud)
          Merrill.

Merrill turns and looks to Graham.

                    GRAHAM
          Swing away.

Graham's eyes are not on Merrill.  Merrill follows his eye
line to the baseball bat mounted above him.

Beat.  Merrill reaches up and takes the bat off its resting
place.

The creature starts to move.

Merrill's hands tighten around the handle as he walks
forward.  He stops.  His weight shifts to his right leg.

The creature begins to turn and becomes more visible as its
lines and colors don't match in position in the room.

Merrill's left leg goes out.  His torso and shoulders turn
with staggering speed and strength.  The bat slices through
the air of the family room... Contact.

The creature gets HAMMERED across the back with the baseball
bat.

Morgan is dropped.  He falls to the carpet of the family room
in an unnatural crumpled pile.  His arms and legs flop
lifelessly to the carpet.

The creature turns to face Merrill.  All the creature sees is
the BLUR OF WOOD as Merrill swings like a lumberjack.  SLAM. 
The creature falls to the ground.

Graham takes Bo by the hand and moves to Morgan.  Graham
picks up his son's limp body in his arms.

The creature moves to its feet.

Merrill's hands choke up on the bat.  Merrill's eyes are on
fire.

Graham leans down and picks up the full syringe of medicine
on the ground.

Merrill SCREAMS as he swings again.  His powerful muscles
pull his shoulders whipping around.  The bat connects with
the creature across its chest.  The creature is thrown back
into the wall.  Two glass of water fall off a shelf and CRASH
ONTO THE CREATURE'S SHOULDER.  The water connects with it's
skin.  The creature makes a HIGH PITCHED INHALE SOUND.

Bo and Graham look up.

THE CREATURE'S SHOULDER STOPS CHANGING COLORS AND WITHERS
INTO A POWDERY WHITE.

Merrill looks back across the room at Bo and Graham.  They
stare at each other with sudden realization.

Merrill looks around at Bo's half-filled water glasses places
all over the family room.

                                                  CUT TO:

INT.  KITCHEN - MORNING

Graham carries Morgan through the kitchen and out the back
door.  Morgan's arms and legs swing limp as Graham walks.

Morgan's head bobs back from its own weight as Graham steps
outside.

                                                  CUT TO:

INT.  FAMILY ROOM - MORNING

Merrill steps in.  THE WOODEN BAT MAKES A SOUND AS IT CUTS
THROUGH THE AIR.  SLAM!  It connects with the creature.  The
creature falls back into the coffee table.  Bo's glasses of
water crack and SPLASH OVER the creature's TORSO.  ANOTHER
HIGH PITCHED INHALE SCREAM.  His torso turns a powdery white. 
Parts of its body are still changing and matching its
environment.  Parts are white.

The creature stands again.

Merrill looks for the next target in the room.  Bo points to
the dinning table where the old chicken teriyaki, bacon
cheeseburger and spaghetti with meatballs sit untouched.

Merrill sees the three glasses of water at Bo's seat.  He
nods.

                                                  CUT TO:

INT.  FAMILY ROOM - MORNING

MERRILL YELLS WITH EVERYTHING IN HIS LUNGS.  His wrists turn. 
His shoulders torque.  THE WOODEN LOUISVILLE SLUGGER SLICES
THE AIR AND SHATTERS WHEN IT CONNECTS WITH THE UPPER CHEST OF
THE CREATURE.  PIECES OF WOOD SPLINTER OVER THE FAMILY ROOM.

THE CREATURE WAVERS AND THEN ALL SEVEN FEET OF IT TIPS OVER. 
IT FALLS BACK.  IT CLIPS THE TV STAND AS IT FALLS.  IT LANDS
ON THE GROUND WITH A THUD.

THE CREATURE'S BLACK, EMPTY EYES LOOK UP IN TIME TO SEE BO'S
GLASSES OF WATER RESTING ON THE TELEVISION, FALL... AND SPILL
OVER THE EDGE -- RIGHT ONTO ITS FACE.

THE CREATURE'S SCREAMS FILL THE FAMILY ROOM -- AND THEN
SUDDENLY STOP.

IT BECOMES VERY STILL.  EVERY INCH OF ITS BODY TURNS A
WITHERED, POWDERY WHITE.  BEAT.

Bo watches quietly from the door.  Merrill drops the handle
of the bat in his hands.

                                                  CUT TO:

EXT.  BACKYARD - MORNING

Merrill and Bo find Graham kneeling in the grass.  Morgan
lays limp in his arms.  They kneel down in the grass with
him.

Merrill sees the empty syringe in Graham's hand.  He looks to
Morgan.  The boy's head is tilted back.  His tiny mouth hangs
open unnaturally.

                    GRAHAM
          His lungs were closed.
              (beat)
          His lungs were closed.  No poison
          got in... No poison got in.

Merrill stares at Morgan.  His body is utterly still.

                    GRAHAM
          His lungs were closed.

Merrill reaches for Morgan's still hand.

                    GRAHAM
          Don't touch him.

                    MERRILL
              (soft)
          Graham.

Beat.  Morgan lies lifeless.

                    BO
          Daddy.

                    GRAHAM
          Don't touch him.

Bo is crying.

                    MERRILL
          Graham.

                    GRAHAM
          Don't.

Beat.

                    MORGAN'S VOICE
          Dad.

HIS SON'S VOICE MAKES HIM STOP.  Graham starts crying.  Every
bit of sadness trapped in his body is released.  He looks
down through tears and tears at Morgan.

                    MORGAN
          Did someone save me?

                    GRAHAM
          Yeah baby.  I think someone did.

INT.  WINDOW - MORNING

We look out through the broken glass of the second story
bedroom window.  We see the worn jungle gym.  We see the
single tree throwing shade on the picnic table.  We see the
golden brown corn lining the back of the yard.

And we see the Hess family.  Sitting together on the grass. 
Huddled together in the sunlight.

                                           FADE TO BLACK.

FADE IN:

INT.  WINDOW - MORNING

We are looking out a second story window of a house.  The
backyard is large and green with a wooden jungle gym, worn
from use.  A single tree throws shade onto a barbecue and a
picnic table.

The backyard is lined by crops.  Corn.  Golden and brown. 
Six feet high.

Everything is perfect.  Like a postcard.  And then we HEAR A
CHILD SCREAM.  IT'S FAR AWAY.  WE DON'T KNOW WHERE IT'S
COMING FROM.

                                                  CUT TO:

INT.  BEDROOM - MORNING

GRAHAM HESS wakes up from his sleep.  He thought he heard
something.  He listens.  HE HEARS THE HEATER.  THE
REFRIGERATOR DOWNSTAIRS HUMMING.  THE OCCASIONAL BIRDS
OUTSIDE CHIRPING.

Graham climbs out of bed.  He moves in his pajama pants and
white Barron's minor league baseball T-shirt towards the
bedroom door.

                                                  CUT TO:

INT.  HALL LANDING - MORNING

Graham stands in the hall landing where three bedroom doors
meet.  He moves to the door that has children's drawings
taped to it.  He puts his ear close.  Listens.  Beat.

He relaxes.  Graham leans down and picks up two balled up
sweat socks and a child's sweater from the hallway floor.  He
puts it in the hallway hamper before heading back into his
bedroom.

                                                  CUT TO:

INT.  BATHROOM - MORNING

A bathroom door is open.  WE HEAR THE SINK RUNNING.  WE HEAR
THE SOUNDS OF TEETH BEING BRUSHED.

Outside the bathroom on the bedroom wall is the sun faded
outline of where a large CATHOLIC CROSS used to hang.  It's
ghostly stained forever on the blank wall.

A CHILD SCREAMS FROM FAR AWAY.

The water from the sink stops.  Graham steps into the
doorway.  Toothbrush and foam in his mouth.  He becomes very
still.

                                                  CUT TO:

INT.  CHILDREN'S BEDROOM - MORNING

The bedroom door bursts open.  Graham steps into his
children's room.  There are children's books everywhere. 
Overflowing off shelves.  Piled in corners.

Graham's eyes move to the small messy beds.  They're both
empty.

                                                  CUT TO:

INT.  GARAGE BEDROOM - MORNING

WE HEAR THE VOICES OF TWO CHILDREN NOW.  THEIR SCREAMS FLOAT
INTO A DARKENED BEDROOM OVER THE GARAGE.

MERRILL HESS throws the bed sheets off himself as he swings
onto his feet in one quick motion.  He is hyper-awake. 
Merrill is in his late twenties.  He is well build.  His
muscles are tense as he stands in his red bikini briefs and
looks around bewildered.

                                                  CUT TO:

EXT.  BACKYARD - MORNING

Graham bangs open the back screen door and runs into the
backyard.  He spins as he looks around.

Merrill, now with a T-shirt and jeans, rumbles down the side
stairs adjacent to the garage building.

Merrill and Graham make eye contact as they approach each
other across the yard.

                    MERRILL
          Where are they?

Graham looks around -- panic growing in his eyes.

                    CHILDREN
              (yelling in the distance)
          Daaaad!

Graham and Merrill in unison turn in the direction of the
YELLING.  They look away from the house, across the yard and
into THE THICK WALL OF CROPS.

                                                  CUT TO:

EXT.  CROPS - MORNING

The tall stalks of corn smack Graham and Merrill's faces as
they run through the crops.

A LITTLE GIRL appears in the crops thirty feet ahead of them
like an apparition.  She is in her nightgown.  She is four.

They reach her fast.  She stands unaware of them in a daze. 
Her hair is messed from sleep.

                    GRAHAM
          Bo where's Morgan?

BO stands peacefully lost in her thoughts.  Beat.

                    GRAHAM
          Bo?

Bo finally looks at her father.  Beat.  She smiles softly.

                    BO
          Are you in my dreams too?

Beat.

                    GRAHAM
          This isn't a --

                    BOY (O.S.)
          Dad!

Graham looks in the direction of THE BOY'S VOICE.  He's
close.  Graham picks up Bo and rushes through the crops.

He finds MORGAN standing with his hands in the pockets of his
pajama bottoms.  DOGS ARE BARKING NEARBY.

                    GRAHAM
          Morgan what's happening?

Graham puts Bo on the ground and moves right in front of
Morgan.  The ten-year old boy looks deep in thought.

Graham takes hold of Morgan's chin and turns his face so he's
looking straight at him.

                    GRAHAM
          Are... you... hurt?

Beat.  Morgan's eyes reveal he's come to some answer.

                    MORGAN
          I think God did it.

Beat.  THE DOGS KEEP BARKING.

                    GRAHAM
          Did what Morgan?

Morgan takes hold of his father's unshaven chin and turns his
face.  Graham is forced to look to his right.  Beat.  Graham
sees something.

Graham Hess slowly rises to his feet.  He starts moving
forward towards something.

He walks through a thin layer of crops and emerges in a
clearing.  Two German Shepherds are running back and forth. 
They are clearly agitated.

Graham looks around at the THOUSANDS OF CORN STALKS LYING
FLAT ON THE GROUND.  THEY LAY IN A GIGANTIC CIRCLE, A HUNDRED
FEET WIDE.

Graham Hess looks around in a daze as he walks out into the
center.  Merrill, Bo and Morgan follow him.

The dogs keep running and barking as WE PULL BACK AND REVEAL
THE FOUR MEMBERS OF THE HESS FAMILY STANDING IN THE MIDDLE OF
THIS PERFECT, GIGANTIC CIRCLE.

WE KEEP PULLING BACK TO EXPOSE THIS EERIE DESIGN -- FIVE
HUNDRED FEET WIDE -- SITTING IN THE MIDDLE OF AN ENDLESS,
UNTOUCHED CORN FIELD.

EXT.  BACKYARD - LUNCHTIME

Graham holds his hand over the barbecue to see if it's at the
right temperature.  The other hand holds a cordless phone to
his ear.

                    GRAHAM
              (into phone)
          ... Lee actually the reason I'm
          calling is about Lionel.

Graham stokes the coals with a LONG BARBECUE FORK.

                    GRAHAM
              (into phone)
          Was he at home last night with you
          or was he out and about with the
          Wolfington brothers?

Graham moves around from behind the barbecue and heads
towards the house.

                    GRAHAM
              (into phone)
          Well, there was a little mischief
          done to our crops last night.

Beat.

                    GRAHAM
              (into phone)
          I know he's a fine boy... No one's
          saying otherwise.

Graham steps through the back screen door into his

KITCHEN.

Graham holds the phone a little closer and talks in a HUSHED
VOICE.

                    GRAHAM
              (into phone)
          Listen Lee, I don't even mind if it
          was him.  You could just talk to
          him and that would be enough for
          me... See it was kind of strange
          finding the crops like that.  The
          kids were... confused by it.  It
          would take the strangeness away if
          we knew it was Lionel and the
          Wolfington brothers just messing
          around...
              (beat, listens)
          The movies...
              (beat)
          Are you sure?
              (beat)
          Okay, then... Thank you for your
          patience Lee.

Graham turns off the phone.  He turns to put it on the
counter and realizes his children are seated on the kitchen
floor with one of their two German Shepherds.  There is a
LARGE PUDDLE on the kitchen tiles.

                    MORGAN
          Houdini peed.  I think he's sick.

Graham looks at the majestic dog.  It's shivering.

                    GRAHAM
          Take him outside.  I'll call Dr.
          Reynolds.

Morgan and Bo lead their dog out with worried expressions on
their faces.

Graham grabs a handful of paper towels and places it on the
puddle of urine.  The DOORBELL rings with Graham still on his
knees on the kitchen floor.  He leans back so he can see down
the hall.

A balding police officer stands on the other side of the
screen door.

                    GRAHAM
          That was quick Edgar.  I only
          called you boys about two hours
          ago.

OFFICER EDGAR PASKI nods that he knows.

                    OFFICER PASKI
          Mrs. Kindleman twisted her ankle as
          she put it, "diving for her life"
          when a bunch of school kids rode
          down the sidewalk on skateboards. 
          She went down to Thorton's store
          this morning and started spitting
          on the new skateboards.  Spitting! 
          By the time I got there, Mrs.
          Kindleman had sprayed the whole
          damn place... She must have had a
          cold or something.  It was enough
          to turn a grown man's stomach.

Beat.  Graham stares at Officer Paski.

                    OFFICER PASKI
          So what happened to your crops?

                                                  CUT TO:

EXT.  BACKYARD JUNGLE GYM - LUNCHTIME

Bo walks from the house with a large glass of water.  She
moves to Houdini, who sits in the shade by the picnic table.

Morgan pokes the barbecue fork into two meat patties on the
grill.  He places two pieces of cheese on the hamburgers,
before walking over to Houdini.

The two children sit down in the grass with the dog.

Bo is about to pour the glass of water into the dog bowl. 
She stops.  Takes a tiny sip of the water first.

She holds the glass out to Morgan.

                    BO
          I think it's contaminated.

                    MORGAN
          You don't even know what that word
          means.

He drinks.

                    MORGAN
          It's not contaminated.  It's just
          tap water.  Pour it in his bowl.

                    BO
          It tastes funny.

                    MORGAN
          He licks his butt everyday.  He's
          not going to mind.

Bo shrugs and pours it into the bowl.  Beat.

Houdini just sits staring at them.  He is not shivering.  He
doesn't drink.  He is unnaturally still.

Bo pushes the bowl closer.

HOUDINI MOVES...

BO'S HAND PULLS BACK...

HOUDINI'S JAWS SNAP SHUT IN THE AIR WHERE HER HAND USED TO
BE.  HE WAS JUST A FRACTION OF A SECOND LATER...

BEAT.  The children turn white.

                    MORGAN
          Houdini?

HOUDINI BEGINS TO GROWL.  Bo stands up.

                    MORGAN
          Bo don't run.

Houdini crouches down.

                    MORGAN
          What's wrong boy?

THE DOG'S GROWL BECOMES DEEP, MENACING.

                    MORGAN
          Stop it Houdini!

The German Shepherd trembles.  His body tightens.  He's about
to leap.  Beat.

                    MORGAN
              (soft)
          Bo, run.

EXT.  CROPS - LUNCHTIME

Officer Edgar Paski stands facing Graham fifty feet away. 
They are on opposite ends of the crop circle.  Beat.

The crops all around them sway as the wind blows.  Beat. 
Officer Paski yells over the wind.

                    OFFICER PASKI
              (yelling)
          It's the strangest thing Father.

                    GRAHAM
              (yelling)
          Don't call me Father.

                    OFFICER PASKI
              (yelling)
          What's that?

                    GRAHAM
              (yelling)
          Don't call me Father.  It's just
          Graham now.

                    OFFICER PASKI
              (yelling)
          Sorry.

They stands in awkward silence fifty feet away from each
other.  Beat.

                    GRAHAM
              (yelling)
          You said something was strange. 
          What's strange?

                    OFFICER PASKI
              (yelling)
          The footprints.

                    GRAHAM
              (yelling)
          What about them?

                    OFFICER PASKI
              (yelling)
          There are none.

EXT.  CORN CROPS - LUNCHTIME

Officer Paski's knee touches the ground.  He points to a
single stalk of corn laying flat on it's side.

                    OFFICER PASKI
              (soft)
          Look at where it's bent over.

Graham stands next to him and leans in.  The joint where the
stalk bends from the ground is a perfect "L".

                    GRAHAM
          It's not broken.

                    OFFICER PASKI
          What kind of machine can bend a
          stalk of corn over without cracking
          it?

Graham looks around at the hundreds of thousands of corn
stalks bent over each other in a perfect wave.

                    GRAHAM
              (softy)
          Can't be by hand... It's too
          perfect.

Beat.

                    OFFICER PASKI
          Doesn't sound much like Lionel
          Prichard and the Wolfington
          brothers.  They can't take a piss
          without wetting the front of their
          pants.

Graham, nods in agreement.  Officer Paski stands up.

                    OFFICER PASKI
          Second thing this week I can't
          explain.

                    GRAHAM
          What was the first thing?

                    OFFICER PASKI
          Some animals around the county
          exhibiting uncharacteristic
          behavior.  Sometimes violent
          behavior.  Theo Henry had two of
          his fingers bit off by his cow.

                    GRAHAM
          Sounds like a virus.

                    OFFICER PASKI
          No Father, they're edgy.  On alert. 
          Like they act when they smell a
          predator around... Peeing on
          themselves and everything.

We see a thought catch in Graham's eyes.  He turns back and
stares in the direction of the house.  You can barely see the
roof over the crops.  Beat.

                    GRAHAM
              (preoccupied)
          Edgar, please don't call me Father.

The two men stand as the wind blows lightly around them. 
Officer Paski notices the still expression on Graham's face.

                    OFFICER PASKI
          What's wrong?

Beat.

                    GRAHAM
          I don't hear my children.

                                                  CUT TO:

EXT.  BACKYARD - LUNCHTIME

Morgan watches the thin line of smoke rising from the charred
patties on the grill next to the overturned picnic table.

Morgan's attention moves as the crops part and his father and
Officer Paski enter the backyard.  They stop cold when they
look in his direction.  They begin a slow walk towards him.

Morgan Hess is seated under the jungle gym with Houdini on
his lap.  Morgan is petting Houdini's fur gently.  Bo is on
top of the jungle gym curled up in a ball.

As Graham and Officer Paski get closer, they see Morgan is
crying.

Then they see the dog is laying on it side and has a BARBECUE
FORK DEEP IN ITS NECK.

Beat.

They stare at Morgan as he slowly pulls an inhaler from his
pocket and brings it to his mouth.  He inhales the asthma
spray.  Beat.  He lowers the inhaler so he can speak.

                    MORGAN
              (soft)
          He wanted to kill Bo.

Beat.  Graham stares at his ten-year old son.

                    GRAHAM
          Did he hurt you?

Beat.  Morgan nods, "No."  His tough exterior breaks as his
face starts to tremble.  He starts crying.  Graham picks him
up in his arms.

                    GRAHAM
              (whispers in his ear)
          I'm so sorry Morgan.

Graham reaches up for Bo.  She has dirt and tears on her
face.  Beat.  She slowly climbs down.  Graham carries both
his children as they cry in his arms.

He starts towards the house.  Merrill walks out from the back
holding a bowl of food.

                    MERRILL
          I used a little Tabasco in the
          potato salad.

Merrill sees Houdini lying under the jungle gym.

                    BO
          Houdini's sick.

                    GRAHAM
          Please tie up Isabelle to the back
          of the shed.  Make sure the knot's
          tight.

Merrill stands still with potato salad in his hands.  He
nods.

The children watch over their father's shoulder as Merrill
runs to their other German Shepherd sitting quietly near the
house and leads her by her collar across the yard to the
shed.

Graham reaches the porch of his house and opens the screen
door.

The last thing the children see as they enter the house, is
the image of Officer Paski pulling the barbecue fork out of
their dead dog's neck.

INT.  BEDROOM - LATE EVENING

Graham lies in bed.  He rests his cheek against the pillow as
he lies by himself.

                    GRAHAM
          They're tough cookies, those two. 
          They think Houdini's playing with
          you up there.
              (beat)
          At least it got them to sleep.

Graham stares off.  Beat.  He smiles a little.

                    GRAHAM
          Okay Miss Puzzle Master.  I got one
          for you... What can make geometric
          shapes the size of a football
          field... and what would scare every
          animal in this county?
              (beat)
          Have you figured it out yet?

          You probably have...

          Give me a hint Colleen... Is it

The large Hess farm house sits in the moonlight.

A MILLION CRICKETS AND BUGS FILL THE NIGHT AIR WITH SOUND.

THEY SUDDENLY STOP.

INT.  BEDROOM - NIGHT

Graham opens his eyes slowly as he stirs from his sleep.  His
daughter Bo stares at him from the edge of the bed.  She is
five inches away from his face.

Graham gets startled.

                    GRAHAM
          What's the matter?

                    BO
          I saw a monster.  Can I have a
          glass of water?

Beat.

                    GRAHAM
          What's wrong with the water next to
          your bed?

                    BO
          It tastes old.

Graham slowly gets up from the bed.  He takes his daughter's
hand and starts out of the room.

                    GRAHAM
          What's the rule about getting up in
          the middle of the night?

                    BO
          Only for pee or poop.

                    GRAHAM
          Right.

Graham leads his four-year old daughter down the darkened
hall.

INT.  CHILDREN'S BEDROOM - NIGHT

Morgan's body is half off his bed.  Graham gently lifts him
back onto the pillow and covers him up.

There are two glasses of water on Bo's bedside table.  Graham
moves to Bo's bed.  He sits on the edge of it.  She stares
back at him as she holds her panda.

                    GRAHAM
              (soft)
          What are you thinking about?

                    BO
              (soft)
          Why do you talk to mom when you're
          by yourself?

Beat.

                    GRAHAM
              (soft)
          It makes me feel better.

                    BO

          Does she ever answer back?

                    GRAHAM

          No.

                    BO
              (soft)
          She doesn't answer me either.

Beat.  They both sit quietly for a moment.

Graham's eyes drift to the bedroom window.  A LARGE
SILHOUETTED FIGURE STANDS ON THE ROOF IN THE DARKNESS AND
STARES AT HIM.

THE FIGURE MOVES.  HIS SHADOW PASSES OVER THE CHILDREN'S
BEDROOM AS HE JUMPS FROM THE ROOF.

Graham stands.  He looks to his daughter with startled eyes.

                    BO

Merrill quickly puts on his boots at the front door.

                    MERRILL
          Okay, this guy is trying to scare
          us.  He's messed with our property,
          he's coming around the house.  It's
          time for an ass whoopin'!

                    GRAHAM
          This is not an intelligent way to
          approach this.

Merrill opens the front door.  It's pitch black outside. 
Merrill turn to Graham and gestures with his fingers.

                    MERRILL
              (whispering)
          We both go outside and move around
          the house in opposite directions. 
          We act crazy, insane with anger. 
          Make him crap in his pants and
          force him around till we meet up on
          the other side.

Merrill brings his fingers together at the end of a circle.

                    GRAHAM
              (whispering)
          Explain, act crazy?

                    MERRILL

          You don't mean it.  It's just for

              (whispering)
          It doesn't sound natural when I

                    MERRILL
              (whispering)
          Just make noises then.

They HEAR MOVEMENT OUTSIDE.  Merrill and Graham look out into

Graham spots a LARGE FIGURE darting around the corner ahead
of him.

Merrill charges.  WE JUST MAKE OUT MOVEMENT IN THE DARKNESS

Graham's eyes drift above them.

                    GRAHAM
          He's on the roof.

They follow the roof around the corner.  They find themselves
in the backyard.

Their eyes catch movement away from the house.  They just
catch A GLIMPSE OF THE LARGE FIGURE as he disappears into the
crops.  The swing on the swing set is still moving from being
hit.

They stare across the yard silently.  ALL WE HEAR IS THEIR
HEAVY BREATHING.

                    MERRILL (V.O.)
          It was very dark.

                    GRAHAM
          He definitely wasn't a midget.

                    OFFICER PASKI
          Okay.
              (beat)
          So he was tall?

                    GRAHAM
              (to Merrill)
          I would say so.

                    MERRILL
          Probably.

                    OFFICER PASKI
          Over six feet?

Beat.

                    MERRILL
          It was very dark.

                    GRAHAM
          Yes, it was.

                    OFFICER PASKI
          We've established that.
              (beat)
          Just tell me about his clothing
          then.

Graham and Merrill stare at Edgar Paski.

                    OFFICER PASKI
          Was he wearing a Scottish kilt or
          jeans?

They keep staring.  Edgar closes his pad.

                    OFFICER PASKI
          Let me ask you two something. 
          Don't be embarrassed by the answer. 
          It is possible... Just possible
          now, you might have been chasing
          each other around?  You said you
          went in opposite directions.

                    GRAHAM
          Edgar, it sounds as strange to me
          saying it, as it is to you hearing
          it.  But we couldn't see him.  He
          stayed mostly in the shadows.  All
          we could make out was movement.
              (beat)
          But I'll tell you something with
          absolute certainty.  There was
          someone watching our house last
          night.  He was looking in my
          children's windows and I want you
          to find him Edgar.
              (beat)
          I need you to take this seriously,
          just incase, it is something
          serious.

The three men stand in the doorway.  Edgar opens his pad.

                    OFFICER PASKI
          I apologize.

Morgan walks up to the front door.  He holds up a baby
monitor.

                    MORGAN
          Can I use Bo's old baby monitor as
          a walkie-talkie?

                    GRAHAM
          Yes.

                    MORGAN
          It needs batteries.

                    GRAHAM
          Edgar, come inside.

The three men follow Morgan into the house.  They pass
through the family room where Bo stands at the television.

She is staring at the screen.  ON THE SCREEN IS AERIAL
FOOTAGE FROM A HELICOPTER.  THE FOOTAGE IS OF A LARGE FIELD
WITH ENORMOUS CIRCLES AND DIAMONDS CARVED INTO ITS CROPS.

Bo changes the channel.  She finds a cartoon.  She sits down
on the sofa.

Morgan and the men, can't see the screen, and move into the

KITCHEN.

                    OFFICER PASKI
          How certain are you, that this was
          a male?

                    MERRILL
          I don't know any girls can run like
          that.

Graham opens one of the cabinets and pulls down some
batteries.  He hands them to Morgan.

                    MORGAN
          These are D's; I need double A's.

                    GRAHAM
          I have some upstairs.

Graham starts out of the kitchen.

                    OFFICER PASKI
          I don't know Merrill.  I've seen
          some of those women on the
          Olympics.  They could out run me
          easy.

They all move into the

FAMILY ROOM.

Bo watches cartoons.  THE CARTOON MUSIC AND CARTOON PRAT
FALLS FILLS THE ROOM.

                    MERRILL
          This guy got on the roof in like a
          second.

                    GRAHAM
          Bo, can you turn down the volume
          until Officer Paski leaves?

Bo nods and moves to the television.  The pack of men follow
Graham up the

STAIRS.

                    MERRILL
          That roof is over ten feet high.

                    GRAHAM
          He's telling you the truth, Edgar. 
          Whoever it was, is very strong and
          can jump pretty high.

They arrive on the landing and follow Graham into his
bedroom.  He moves into his

BATHROOM.

They all move in with him.

                    OFFICER PASKI
          They got women's high jumping in
          the Olympics.  They got these
          Scandinavian women who could jump
          clean over me.

Graham takes the clock radio from the sink.  Tries to open
the back.

                    GRAHAM
          Shoot, it needs a screw driver.  I
          have double A's in here.

Graham waves the radio.  The men and Morgan move out of the
bathroom.

                    GRAHAM
          I know you're making a point Edgar. 
          I just don't know what it is.

They moves down the STAIRS.

                    OFFICER PASKI
          Yesterday afternoon, an out of town
          woman stopped by the diner and
          started yelling and cussing cause
          they didn't have her favorite
          cigarettes at the vending machine. 
          Scared a couple of customers.  No
          one's seen her since... My point
          is, we don't know anything about
          the person you saw.  We should just
          keep all possibilities available.

They move through the FAMILY ROOM.

Bo's cartoon is replaced by a special report news icon.

                    BO
          Dad, where's the remote?

Bo starts looking around the couch.

Graham stops before entering the kitchen.  The group stops
with him.  He looks at Bo searching the couch.  He walks over
to the television.

There are three glasses of water on the TV set.  He stands
next to the set.  Doesn't see what's on the screen.

                    GRAHAM
          Bo, you're too old to still be
          doing this.  The rule is, you take
          a glass of water, you finish it.
              (beat)
          Now what's wrong with this one?

Bo stops looking through the sofa cushions and looks to her
father.  Looks at the glass.

                    BO
          There's dust in it.

                    GRAHAM
          This one?

                    BO
          A hair.

                    GRAHAM
          This one?

                    BO
          Morgan took a sip.  It has his
          amoebas in it.

Beat.  Bo turns back to her search.  Graham tucks the clock
radio under his arm and collects the three glasses.  He heads
towards the kitchen.

                    MERRILL
          Excluding the possibility that a
          female Scandinavian Olympian was
          running around outside our house
          last night, what else is a
          possibility?

                    OFFICER PASKI
          I'm not done asking questions and I
          don't appreciate the sarcasm.

They follow Graham and Morgan through the swinging door into
the KITCHEN.

Graham puts the glasses in the sink with a group of other
half-filled water glasses and opens the drawer to pull out a
screwdriver.  He starts opening the clock radio.

                    OFFICER PASKI
          Do you have anyone who might have a
          grudge or something against you? 
          Maybe a church member, who might
          not have liked the fact, that you
          left the church?

Graham looks at Edgar.

                    GRAHAM
          I don't think so.

                    OFFICER PASKI
          Do you owe anybody money?  You can
          tell me off the record if you need
          too.

                    GRAHAM
          No.

                    MERRILL
          No.

Morgan hands Graham the baby monitor and Graham starts
replacing the batteries.

                    OFFICER PASKI
          Is anything missing?

                    GRAHAM
          No.

Graham hands Morgan the monitor.  He turns it ON.  THERE IS A
STATIC CRACKLE WITH SPIKES OF SOUND.

                    MORGAN
          It's still making the noises.  It's
          broken.

                    GRAHAM
          It's old Morgan.

Morgan heads out of the kitchen.

                    MERRILL
          Listen, I was out of line with that
          whole female Scandinavian Olympian
          thing.

Edgar nods.

                    MERRILL
          It's just that, I'm pretty strong
          and pretty fast.  And I was running
          as fast as I could.  And this
          guy...
              (embarrassed smile)
          He was just toying with us.

Beat.  Merrill walks out of the kitchen.  Graham watches
Edgar think it over.

                                                  CUT TO:

INT.  FAMILY ROOM - DAY

Graham moves to a windowsill where more glasses of water sit. 
He picks them up.  Sees two more on the coffee table.  He
gives up and puts the two glasses back on the windowsill.

                    OFFICER PASKI
          Could everyone just take a seat on
          the couch.  I have some preliminary
          thoughts.

Morgan sits with his monitor next to Bo, who quietly watches
the TV.  Merrill and Graham squeeze in next to Morgan.

                    OFFICER PASKI
          There are three possibilities here. 
          We'll call them one, two and three. 
          The level one scenario is that
          there is a sane individual, who for
          real reasons wants to do you harm. 
          I really don't believe that's what
          we're looking at here.  In my
          opinion, whoever this is, they
          don't want to do harm to you all. 
          That's kind of clear.
              (beat)
          The level two scenario is, this is
          a mentally unstable person who's
          fixated on you and your family. 
          This is a possibility, but a very
          slim one.
              (beat)
          I assure you I will treat all three
          possibilities carefully, but in all
          likely hood we are looking at what
          we'll call a level three scenario. 
          He's a watcher.  Someone who this
          is a game for.  He's laying low. 
          Doesn't want to be seen.  But he
          wants to watch you.  Study you
          folks.

Officer Paski walks towards the windows.  Graham, Merrill and
Morgan follow him with their eyes.  Officer Paski walks next
to the television.

ON THE SCREEN WITH THE SOUND ALMOST MUTED, IS AN AERIAL SHOT
FROM A HELICOPTER.  A DIFFERENT ONE THAN BEFORE.  THE FOOTAGE
IS OF A VAST FIELD OF CROPS.  THERE ARE TWO DIAMONDS FLANKING
TWO SIDE OF A TRIANGLE IN THE CENTER OF THE FIELD.

Officer Paski turns to them.

Graham, Merrill and Morgan stare at the screen.

                    OFFICER PASKI
          Now I don't want you all to worry
          about this no more.  You're making
          more of this than it is.
              (beat)
          You guys have had a tough couple of
          days with the vandalism to the
          crops and the death of your
          shepherd.
              (beat)
          Maybe you guys should do something
          fun?  Let me worry about this
          person.  Let me find out who it is
          and then -- What the hell are you
          people looking at?

Edgar comes around to see the screen.

WE ARE ON A TV SCREEN.  THE CROPS SWAY IN THE BREEZE.

A HANDFUL OF PEOPLE ARE WAVING FROM THE DIAMONDS ON THE
FIELD.

                    OFFICER PASKI
          I'll be damned.

                    GRAHAM
          Turn up the volume Bo.

Bo gets up.

                    BO
          I can't find the remote.

She presses the up arrows on the TV controls.

                    TV ANCHOR
          -- images were shot yesterday
          afternoon by a thirty-four year old
          local camera man in Kerala, a
          southern city of India.  It is the
          eighteenth reported crop circle
          found in that country in the last
          seventy-two hours.

The television report cuts to Columbia University PROFESSOR.

                    PROFESSOR (TV)
          Crop circles first emerged in the
          late seventies with the renewed
          interest in extraterrestrial life. 
          They died out by the early
          eighties; dismissed as hoaxes. 
          This new resurgence is wholly
          different.  Elements of it are
          unexplainable.  The speed and the
          quantity in which it has appeared
          implies the coordination of
          hundreds of individuals over many
          countries...
              (beat)
          There is only a limited amount of
          explanations.  Either this is one
          of the most elaborate hoaxes ever
          created, or basically...
              (beat)
          It's for real.

Morgan takes the asthma inhaler from his pocket and breathes
in deeply.

                    MORGAN
              (wonder)
          Extraterrestrials.

                    OFFICER PASKI
          What in God's name is going on?

Beat.

THE ROOM GOES SILENT as everyone watches the images on the
television screen.

                                                  CUT TO:

EXT.  HESS DRIVEWAY - DAY

The two men walk down the driveway to Edgar's patrol car.

                    OFFICER PASKI
          Don't ask me what I think.  Cause I
          can't think straight right now. 
          I'm going back to the station. 
          Have a cup of Marcia's coffee and
          try to think clear.  After that I
          might make some calls.
              (beat)
          Hoaxes... People got way too much
          time on their hands.

Edgar turns back to Graham.

                    OFFICER PASKI
          But I'll tell you something, what I
          said in their, still goes.  You and
          your family have been through a lot
          in the last two days... Not to
          mention what happened to you all
          seven months ago.

                    GRAHAM
          Six months.

Edgar stares at Graham.

                    GRAHAM
          And three weeks.

                    OFFICER PASKI
          It's left its mark still.  The last
          thing these children need to do, is
          worry about some crazy things
          happening in the world.  Take them
          into town.  Get their minds -- your
          mind, on everyday things.  It's
          good medicine.

                    GRAHAM
          It's good advice...
              (beat)
          Say hi to Marcia for me.

                    OFFICER PASKI
          You take care of yourself...

EXT.  STATION WAGON - AFTERNOON

WE MOVE THROUGH BACK ROADS OF BUCKS COUNTY.  RURAL
PENNSYLVANIA IN ITS MOST BEAUTIFUL.  TREE LINED STREETS. 
WHITE PICKET FENCES.  APPLE ORCHARDS.

The Hess family rides in their station wagon.  Graham drives. 
Merrill is shotgun.  The children are in the back.

Morgan leans forward and TURNS ON THE RADIO.

                    RADIO VOICE
          ... signs intended to be seen from
          the sky --

CLICK.  Graham TURNS IT OFF.

                    GRAHAM
          No radio either... Just for a
          while.

Morgan nods and then plops back into the backseat.

EXT.  MAIN STREET - AFTERNOON

Downtown Bucks County.  A group of small stores along a quiet
street.

The Hess station wagon pulls in front of a free parking
meter.

Graham steps out the driver's side and looks around.  Merrill
puts change in the meter.

Morgan walks up to Graham with Bo.

                    MORGAN
          Book money.

Morgan holds out his hand.  Graham gives his son a look as he
reaches into his back pocket.

                    GRAHAM
          Only one.

Morgan takes the money Graham gives him, then takes Bo's hand
and walks down the sidewalk.

Graham watches them turn into a store.

Merrill steps onto the sidewalk.  Hands in his pockets as he
walks away.

Graham turns and calls after him.

                    GRAHAM
              (calls out)
          Meet back in fifteen minutes.

Merrill waves over his shoulder.  He keeps walking.

Graham starts across the street to the pharmacy.

INT.  NATHAN'S BOOKSTORE - AFTERNOON

A mom and pop bookstore.  Three isles wide.  MR. AND MRS.
NATHAN, a couple in their early seventies, sit behind their
counter and watch a black and white TV.  The PICTURE ON THE
TELEVISION IS OF A WHEAT FIELD.  THREE ENORMOUS TRIANGLES
SURROUND A CIRCLE.

Morgan steps up to the counter.

                    MORGAN
          Extraterrestrials?

                    MR. NATHAN
          That's what they keep alluding to. 
          It's just a bunch of crock. 
          They're trying to sell sodas, plain
          and simple.  I've been watching
          these reports since morning.  I've
          seen twelve soda commercials so
          far.  Twelve!

                    MORGAN
          Do you have book on
          extraterrestrials?

                    MR. NATHAN
          Don't tell me you believe this
          horse manure?

Morgan shrugs.  Mrs. Nathan pushes her husband aside.

                    MRS. NATHAN
          As a matter of fact, I think we
          have one.  Came by mistake in a
          shipment.  Decided to keep it for
          city people.

Mrs. Nathan points over to the far corner.

                    MRS. NATHAN
          Last row.  Third book from the left

INT.  PHARMACY - AFTERNOON

Graham waits at a white counter.  A gum chewing PHARMACIST in
her early twenties, who looks like she's in her teens,
glances through back shelves of medicines as she listens to
the radio.

                    RADIO HOST (V.O.)
          Why is no one saying the obvious? 
          This is just a rash case of
          copycats.  Someone, somewhere, does
          the first one.  It's on TV, it's on
          the internet.  In less than an hour
          a couple hundred people get the
          same brilliant idea and here we
          are... on the verge of mass
          hysteria.

                    PHARMACIST
          It was asthma medicine right
          Father?

                    GRAHAM
          For Morgan Hess.  And it's not
          Father anymore.

The Pharmacist looks back at Graham and then reaches up and
TURNS OFF THE RADIO.  She quietly finds the prescription on
the shelf and moves to the counter across from Graham.

She doesn't ring it up.  She just stands there fiddling with
the bag holding Morgan's medicine.  Beat.

                    PHARMACIST
          Can I ask you a favor Father?

Graham stares at the girl.  Beat.  He nods "yes."

                    PHARMACIST
          Can I take confession with you?

Beat.  Graham leans forward on the counter and takes the
girl's hands in his.  He talks very slowly.

                    GRAHAM
          Tracey, I -- am -- not -- a --
          reverend -- anymore.  I haven't
          been for six months.  You know
          this.

Beat.  When Tracey speaks her VOICE IS A BIT SHAKY.

                    TRACEY
          All this stuff on TV...
              (beat)
          Joe Gills was in here talking about
          the end of the world... I'm just a
          little scared.
              (beat)
          Please.  I need to take confession
          with you.

Graham looks at the young girl's teary eyes.  He exhales
slowly.

                                                  CUT TO:

INT.  ARMY RECRUITING OFFICE - AFTERNOON

Merrill stares up at a poster with a muscular guy in an Army
uniform standing at attention on a beach.

We are in a narrow ARMY RECRUITING CENTER.  Inside the small
storefront space is a desk.  A gentleman sporting a CREWCUT
sits behind it.

A young man, Merrill's age, sits at a side card table filling
out some forms.

                    CREWCUT GUY
          I got it figured.

Merrill realizes the crewcut guy is talking to him.

                    MERRILL
          You do?

                    CREWCUT GUY
          I've had two separate folks tell me
          they think there are strangers
          around these parts the last couple
          of nights.  Can't tell what they
          look like, cause they're staying in
          the shadows -- covert like.  No
          one's got hurt mind you... And
          that's the give away.

                    MERRILL
              (doesn't see)
          I see.

                    CREWCUT GUY
          It's called probing.  It's a
          military procedure.  You send a
          reconnaissance group, very small,
          to check out things.  Not to
          engage, but to evaluate the
          situation.  Evaluate the level of
          danger.  Make sure things are all
          clear...

                    MERRILL
          Clear for what?

The crewcut guy savors the beat of silence.

                    CREWCUT GUY
          ... For the rest of them.

It takes a second, but Merrill smiles.  The crewcut guy
smiles back.  Merrill points at a poster.

                    MERRILL
          You have a pamphlet or something I
          can read?

The crewcut guy reaches to a stack of brochures.  Picks the
top brochure and hands it to Merrill.

The crewcut guy begins to stare at Merrill closely.

                    CREWCUT GUY
          Hey you didn't used to play
          baseball did you?

Merrill looks up from the brochure.  Beat.

                    CREWCUT GUY
          Shit.  I know you.  You're Merrill
          Hess.  I was there that day you hit
          that five hundred and eighty seven
          footer over the left field wall and
          set the record.  That thing had a
          motor on it... It's still the
          record right?

Merrill not, "yes."

                    MERRILL
              (soft)
          I got the bat at home... On the
          wall.

                    CREWCUT GUY
          You got two minor league home run
          records don't you?

Beat.

                    MERRILL
          Five.  The five longest.

                    CREWCUT GUY
          Boy, why aren't you in the pros
          making stacks of cash and getting
          handfuls of T and A?

                    YOUNG MAN (O.S.)
          Cause he also has the minor league
          strike out record.

Merrill turns to the young man, about his age, who sits at
the folding table.

                    MERRILL
          Hello Lionel.

LIONEL smirks.

                    LIONEL
          He'd just swing as hard as he could
          every time.  It didn't matter what
          the coach said, didn't matter who
          was on base, he'd whip that bat
          through the air as hard as he
          could... Looked like a lumber jack
          chopping down a tree.
              (beat)
          Merrill here, struck out more times
          than any two players.

Beat.

                    CREWCUT GUY
          You really hold the strike out
          record?

Beat.  Merrill tucks the pamphlet in his jacket.  Looks like
he's not going to say anything.  When he does, the words are
soft and worn; they've been said a hundred times.

                    MERRILL
          Felt wrong not to swing.

Beat.  The crewcut guy shakes his head.  Merrill turns and
starts walking.

As he passes Lionel, Merrill makes a small, quick move in
Lionel's direction, like he might hit him.  Lionel flinches
and covers his face.

Merrill walks out the door of the army recruiting office.

INT.  PHARMACY - AFTERNOON

                    PHARMACIST
          I cursed thirty-seven times last
          week... I said the f-word a couple
          times, but mostly "shits" and
          "bastards."
              (beat)
          Is "Douche bag" a curse?

Graham glances at the girl as she sits sideways to him at the
counter.

                    GRAHAM
          I suppose it's in its usage.

                    PHARMACIST
          How about "John you're a douche bag
          for kissing Barbara?"

                    GRAHAM
          That's a curse.

                    PHARMACIST
          Then it's not thirty-seven.  It's
          seventy-one.

Graham's eyes widen.

                    PHARMACIST
          I stole a bottle of Ruby red lip
          stick from K-mart... I punched my
          brother in the back three times...

Graham looks around the empty store for help.

INT.  NATHAN'S BOOKSTORE - AFTERNOON

Bo sits at a tiny reading table and drinks a glass of water. 
There is another glass, half-full, on her table.  Mrs. Nathan
watches as the little girl takes careful sips.

Beat.  Bo looks up with a grimace.

                    BO
          It's contaminated.

MRS. NATHAN YELLS TO MR. NATHAN AT THE FRONT OF THE STORE.

                    MRS. NATHAN
          Carl, there's something wrong with
          our water!

Morgan doesn't look up from the extraterrestrial book.

                    MORGAN
          Your water is fine.  Bo has a thing
          about her drinking water.  She's
          had it her whole life.  Like a tick
          people have.  Except it's not a
          tick.

                    MRS. NATHAN
              (fascinated)
          Is that right?

Bo shrugs.  She places the glass she sipped on the table with
the other glass.

Mrs. Nathan stares at the four-year old.

                    MR. NATHAN (O.S.)
          Thirteen!

Everyone turns to the front of the store where Mr. Nathan
points to the TV screen.  A Coke Cola commercial is on.

Beat.  Mrs. Nathan turns back to find Morgan holding out the
extraterrestrial book to her.

                    MORGAN
          I'll take it.

EXT.  STATION WAGON - AFTERNOON

Merrill, Morgan and Bo are waiting in the parked car.  Beat.

The driver's side opens and Graham sits in.

                    MERRILL
          Pharmacy crowded?

                    GRAHAM
          I don't want any one of you
          spending time with Tracey Abernathy
          alone.  Is that understood?

Beat.  Everyone nods, "yes."

Graham puts the key in the ignition and turns the car on. 
Merrill watches as Graham's hand goes to put the car in
reverse -- and then stops.

Graham is staring out the windshield.  Merrill follows his
stare to a thin, thirty-year old man in a LEATHER JACKET
coming out of a store.  Merrill's face changes expression
too.  They both stare as the man passes in front of the car.

                    MORGAN
              (soft)
          Is that him?

                    MERRILL
              (soft)
          Yeah.

Everyone in the car watches the man in the leather jacket as
he steps off the sidewalk towards the truck.  It's here that
he notices the stares.  He glances up to see the faces
watching him from the station wagon.

The leather jacketed man keeps moving to his truck.  He gets
in, turns it on, and without looking over to the station
wagon, backs out of the parking lot.

Beat.  The Hess family sits quietly.

                    BO
          Who is he?

Nobody says anything for the longest time.

                    MORGAN
          He's the man who killed mom.

Graham puts the station wagon in reverse and backs out into
the street.

EXT.  HESS HOME - AFTERNOON

THE SKY IS GOLDEN RED.  The crops sway hypnotically in a
gentle breeze.

The Hess station wagon pulls into their driveway.  It comes
to a stop in front of the house.  The engine goes off.  No
one gets out.

                                                  CUT TO:

INT.  STATION WAGON - AFTERNOON

All four sit quietly not getting out.

A MUFFLED SPIKE OF NOISE IS HEARD FROM THE BACK SEAT.

Graham and Merrill turn and see Morgan pull the baby monitor
out of his jacket.  He holds it in his lap.

Beat.

                    MORGAN
          What if Bo's baby monitor is
          picking up signals from the
          extraterrestrials?

Beat.

                    MERRILL
          All this crop stuff.  They did it
          twenty-five years ago.  It was a
          joke.

THE MONITOR SPIKES WITH A SUDDEN CRACKLE.  MORGAN PULLS IT
AWAY FROM HIS EAR.

                    GRAHAM
          It's just static Morgan.  Turn it
          up and see.

Morgan turns a knob on the side.

THE VOLUME SUDDENLY JUMPS UP ON THE MONITOR.  WE HEAR BEEPS
IN THE STATIC.  THE RED LIGHTS ON THE FRONT OF THE BABY
MONITOR LIGHT UP WITH EACH BEEP.

                    MORGAN
          It's a code.

                    GRAHAM
          Let me see that please.

Morgan hands Graham the monitor in the front seat.  THE BEEPS
COME AND GO AS THEY GET COVERED BY THE STATIC.

                    MERRILL
          It's noise.

                    GRAHAM
          It's broken Morgan.  It'll just
          keep doing this.
              (beat)
          Let's get out of the car okay?

                    MORGAN
          We might lose the signal.

                    GRAHAM
          We can't just sit in the car in our
          own driveway like this.

                    MERRILL
          We'll look like mental patients.

Beat.  Nobody gets out of the station wagon.

                    GRAHAM
          I'm getting out now.

                    MORGAN
          Don't do it.

Graham pulls the handle.  His door opens.  He waits before
getting out.  The other three station wagon doors open right
after.

OUTSIDE CAR

Graham stands and closes his driver side door.

THE MONITOR CHANGES SOUNDS.  THE BEEPING DISAPPEARS.  THE
STATIC BECOMES LOUDER, BECOMING A MOVING, SWIRLING SOUND
TEXTURE.

                    MORGAN
          Nobody move!

Everyone becomes frozen, standing next to the station wagon. 
Three of the doors are open.

IN THE TEXTURE OF SOUND, JUST FOR A MOMENT, WE HEAR SOMETHING
THAT SOUNDS LIKE...

                    MORGAN
          Voices.  Did you hear that?

Everyone stares at the baby monitor in Graham's hand.

                    MORGAN
          Not English though.  You heard the
          voices right Uncle Merrill?

                    BO
          I heard them Morgan.

Graham doesn't move his arm.  He keeps it out in the air
where he had it as he closed his door.  Graham looks to
Merrill over the roof of the station wagon.

                    GRAHAM
          It's probably picking up another
          baby monitor.

                    MERRILL
          That's right.

THE SWIRLING TEXTURE SOUND FLOATS THROUGH THE AIR ABOVE THE
STATION WAGON.

                    MERRILL
          Let me see it.

Beat.  Graham moves.  He hands the monitor over the hood. 
Merrill reaches for it.

THE SWIRLING, MOVING TEXTURE BECOMES LOUD AND FILLED WITH
UNINTELLIGIBLE NOISES.

                    MORGAN
          Stop!

Graham and Merrill freeze -- both touching the monitor over
the roof of the station wagon.

WE HEAR SOMETHING THAT SOUNDS LIKE A VOICE EMERGE AND THEN
QUICKLY FADE AWAY.

                    MORGAN
          It doesn't sound like words.

Merrill concentrates on THE SWIRLING MOVING TEXTURE COMING
FROM THE BABY MONITOR.

Graham looks around at his rapt family.

                    GRAHAM
          See this is why we're not watching
          those news reports.  People get
          obsessed.
              (beat)
          I'm letting go now.

                    BO
          No dad!

                    MORGAN
          Don't do it!

                    MERRILL
          You'll lose the signal!

Graham looks at Merrill, who's now one of them.  Beat.

Morgan is the first one to move.

                    MORGAN
          Don't let go.

He moves from the back passenger door to the back bumper
where he begins to climb onto the station wagon.

                    GRAHAM
          Morgan?

                    MORGAN
          It gets clearer, the higher you
          hold it.

Morgan crawls on the roof and takes the monitor ever-so
gently out of Graham and Merrill's outstretched hands.

                    GRAHAM
          Morgan, be careful.

                    MERRILL
          I got him.

Merrill climbs up over the side and joins Morgan on the roof. 
Merrill keeps a hand on his nephew.  Morgan raises the
monitor above his head.

THE RED LIGHTS ON THE BABY MONITOR ALL TURN ON.

THE SWIRLING TEXTURE COMING FROM THE MONITOR BECOMES
SOMETHING MORE MECHANICAL, LIKE THE HUM OF LARGE EQUIPMENT IN
THE DISTANCE.

THE VOICE LIKE SOUNDS ARE UNDER A CRACKLE BUT ARE CLEARER AND
LOUDER.

Bo runs to the front bumper and climbs onto the hood.

                    GRAHAM
          Hold on.

Graham cuts her off by taking a seat on the hood.  He takes
hold of Bo.  All four are on the car now.

Morgan stands up on the roof of the station wagon.  Merrill
holds him by the waist.

Bo tries to get up onto the roof by climbing over Graham and
the windshield.  Graham boosts her up over his head with both
hands.

                    GRAHAM
          Merrill you got her.

Merrill reaches out his free hand.  Bo reaches out to him. 
THE SOUND FROM THE MONITOR SUDDENLY CHANGES.

                    MORGAN
          Stop!

Everyone STOPS exactly where they are.  Graham holds Bo over
his head.  Bo reaches out to Merrill.  Merrill sits on the
roof with one arm out.  Morgan stands with the baby monitor
raised high in the air.  The Hess family remains very still
on the hood of their station wagon as they listen.

THE CRACKLING IS GONE.  THE VOICE-LIKE SOUNDS ARE CLEAR AND
UPFRONT.  THERE ARE TWO DISTINCT TONES IN THE MIX.

                    MORGAN
              (soft)
          There's two of them talking.

THE VOICE-LIKE SOUNDS ARE NOT WORDS BUT MORE LIKE GRUNTS AND
GURGLING LIKE SOMEONE DROWNING.  THE SOUNDS ARE BEING CREATED
BY INHALES, NOT EXHALES.  A SEQUENCE OF THESE SOUNDS IN ONE
TONE IS FOLLOWED BY SILENCE AND THEN THE SECOND TONE BEGINS
ANOTHER SEQUENCE LIKE A CONVERSATION.

Graham struggles to hold Bo up.  Bo struggles to keep her
arms out.  Merrill struggles not to turn his face to the
incredible SOUNDS ABOVE HIS HEAD.

THE TONES ESCALATE IN VOLUME.

Morgan's eyes widen as THE SEQUENCE OF SOUNDS BECOMES SHORTER
AND FASTER.  THE TONES BECOME HARDER, ANGRIER.  THE SILENCES
ALMOST GONE.

THE VOICE-LIKE TONES REACH A LOUD FEVERISH PACE, ALMOST
VIOLENT AND THEN WE HEAR A CLICK AND THEY'RE GONE.

Beat.  Everyone looks up at the baby monitor.  The red lights
are off.  ONLY THE BLAND HUM OF NORMAL STATIC COMES FROM IT'S
SPEAKER.

Beat.

                    MORGAN
              (soft)
          They hung up.

Graham brings Bo down into his lap.  Morgan takes a seat next
to Merrill on the roof.  The Hess family sits like mental
patients on the top of their station wagon.

EXT.  BACKYARD - EVENING

WE ARE AT THE EDGE OF THE CROPS LOOKING BACK AT THE HOUSE. 
The LIGHTS are on in the kitchen.  We see Graham, Merrill and
the children doing dishes after dinner.

The DOG IS BARKING FURIOUSLY.

OUR VIEW TURNS TO LOOK AT THE BARN THROUGH THE CROPS. 
Isabelle, the remaining German Shepherd is tied to a post
outside the barn.  The dog whips back and forth frantically. 
She keeps looking in our direction.

WE HEAR A SCREEN DOOR OPEN.  WE TURN TO LOOK BACK AT THE
HOUSE.  Graham steps out the back screen door with a bowl of
dog food and a bowl of water.

We watch him as he walks towards the frantic dog.  When he
gets close, Graham slows.  He approaches the dog carefully. 
He places the two bowls close but not too close.  The dog has
no interest in them.  She keeps barking and glaring in our
direction.

Graham watches her for a few moments, and THEN TURNS AND
LOOKS DIRECTLY AT US FROM ACROSS THE YARD.

WE PULL BACK INTO THE DARKNESS OF THE CROPS.

Graham stands frozen looking across his yard.  Isabelle, the
dog turns in desperate circles behind him.  Graham's eyes
stay focused on the same point in the darkness.  He talks to
no one.

                    GRAHAM
          You know something?  Even
          entertaining the possibility of
          this for a minute has been
          exciting.

Beat.  Graham starts to move.

                    GRAHAM
          I can see how people can get
          carried away with this type of
          thing.

Graham reaches the barbecue area.  There's a flashlight on
the picnic table.  Graham TURNS THE FLASHLIGHT ON.  A NARROW
BEAM FALLS ON THE GRASS FIVE FEET AHEAD OF HIM.

Graham starts toward the crops.

                    GRAHAM
          It's a kind of faith.  It's an
          intoxicating thing to believe in
          something you can't see.

THE BEAM OF LIGHT FALLS ON THE WALL OF CORN CROPS LINING THE
BACKYARD.  Graham steps right up to them.  He hesitates and
then steps into the field of

CORN CROPS.

We can't see two feet in any direction.  Six foot stalks of
corn line Graham on all sides.  THE FLASHLIGHT THROWS A
WAVERING BEAM ON THE CROPS AHEAD OF HIM.

                    GRAHAM
          You were always good at that...

THE BEAM OF HIS FLASHLIGHT FINDS A NARROW PATH.  Graham
starts following it.  His shoulders brush crops on either
side.

                    GRAHAM
          Believing in things you couldn't
          see.
              (beat)
          You would have been the first
          person on that station wagon
          wouldn't you?  You and Morgan would
          have been wrestling for that baby
          monitor.

SOMETHING MOVES UP AHEAD.

Graham stops.  HE SHINES HIS LIGHT DOWN THE PATH.  Nothing
but crops disappearing into darkness.

                    GRAHAM
          It'll be secretly kind of sad for
          everybody, when this turns out to
          be -- all just make believe.

THERE'S MOVEMENT RIGHT NEXT TO HIM.  Graham spins and aims
the FLASHLIGHT AT THE CROPS TO HIS RIGHT.  THE LIGHT ONLY
PENETRATES A FEW FEET INTO THE CROPS.

                    GRAHAM
              (yelling)
          You're wasting your time here!  I'm
          not going to report this or
          anything you do to me crops, to the
          news or TV or anybody!  You're not
          going to get famous!

Beat.  There is no response.  GRAHAM CAN HEAR HIS OWN
BREATHING... IT SOUNDS HEAVY, ECHOISH... LIKE THERE'S TWO OF
HIM.

Beat.  Graham holds his breath.  THE SOUND OF SOMEONE ELSE
BREATHING CONTINUES BEHIND HIM.

Graham turns and drops the FLASHLIGHT at the same time.  THE
BEAM OF LIGHT TURNS OFF WHEN THE FLASHLIGHT HITS THE GROUND.

GRAHAM IS IN DARKNESS NOW.  HE LOOKS IN THE DIRECTION OF THE
BREATHING.  BUT CAN'T SEE ANYTHING.  HIS OWN BREATHING IS
FAST AND LOUD NOW.

Graham kneels down and gropes in the darkness.  His hands
search over the ground in all directions.  They finally touch
the flashlight.  Graham quickly fumbles with it to find the
"on" button.  He does.

A BEAM OF LIGHT SHOOTS ACROSS THE GROUND.  SOMETHING POWDERY
WHITE STANDS FIVE FEET AWAY.

It instantly moves into the darkness.  Graham tries to get
up.  He stumbles backwards into the crops.  He's tangled in
crops as he struggles to rise.  He gets up and starts
running.

Leaves and stalks slap him from all directions.  He panics. 
He doesn't know where he is.  THERE IS SOMETHING COMING
BEHIND HIM.

Graham makes a sudden right turn.  He puts his hands in front
of him to protect his face and eyes.  He's running as fast as
he can.  HE HEARS STALKS OF CORN BREAKING BEHIND HIM.

Another sudden turn, this time left.  Graham emerges into his

BACKYARD.

Graham keeps running across the yard.  ISABELLE BARKS
FRANTICALLY.

When Graham reaches the porch stairs, he stops and turns.

There is no one behind him.  The wall of crops fifty feet
away sway in the gentle night breeze.

Graham gains control of his breathing.  He turns and walks to
the screen door, slowing his breathing down with each step.

                                                  CUT TO:

INT.  KITCHEN - EVENING

Graham steps into the kitchen.  His hair is messed.  His
shirt has a few leaves from corn stalks stuck to it.  He
locks the back door.

The children don't notice his presence.  They're splashing
each other at the sink as they clean the dinner dishes.

Graham looks through the kitchen doorway to the family room. 
He sees Merrill there.

Merrill's hands are in his pockets as he stares at the WOODEN
BASEBALL BAT mounted above the fireplace.  Merrill doesn't
notice him either.

Graham takes two steps to the kitchen table and slowly takes
a seat.  His breathing is a slow controlled pant.  He runs
one shaky hand through his hair as he gathers himself and
thinks.  His kind eyes stare down at the ground as he slows
his mind.  Beat.

Merrill is the first to notice him.  He moves from where the
baseball bat is hung, into the kitchen.  As he passes the
children at the sink, he turns off the faucet.

The children stop playing and look up to Merrill.  They
follow his stare to the kitchen table.

Beat.  Graham looks up at them.

                    GRAHAM
              (soft)
          Okay.
              (beat)
          Let's turn on the TV.

                                                  CUT TO:

INT.  FAMILY ROOM - EVENING

THE TV GOES ON WITH A CLICK.  THE SCREEN BLOWS WHITE AND THEN
IMMEDIATELY DARKNESS.  OUTLINES AND SHAPES EMERGE.

THE SOUND POPS ON.

                    TV REPORTER
          -- first appeared fifty two minutes
          ago.

THE SCREEN FILLS WITH CRISP BLACKS.  WE ARE WATCHING VIDEO OF
A NIGHT SKY OVER A DENSE CITY.  THE THOUSAND LIGHTS OF THE
CITY FILL THE BOTTOM OF THE SHAKING IMAGE.

ANOTHER SET OF LIGHTS DOT THE SKY ABOVE THE CITY.  THEY ARE
ARRANGED IN TWO "V'S" SIDE BY SIDE.

Bo puts her finger to the screen and counts the hovering
lights.

                    BO
          Fourteen.

Morgan, Merrill and Graham stand silently before the
television set.

                    TV ANCHOR
          Mexico City officials as well as
          U.S. officials have confirmed that
          these are not air crafts from
          either government's airforce.  The
          first sighting was made by an Air
          Mexico 747 en route from Mazatlan
          to New York as the unidentified
          crafts entered Mexico City air
          space.  They were not detected by
          radar by either country.

Beat.

                    MERRILL
          The crazies were right.

Beat.  Everyone just watches the fourteen lights hovering on
the screen.

                    MORGAN
          We have to tape this...

Morgan reaches into the pile of video tapes under the
television stand.  He grabs one.

Bo snatches the video as Morgan tries to put it into the VCR.

                    BO
          My ballet recital.

Morgan stares at his sister.

                    MORGAN
              (gravely serious)
          Listen Bo.  This is very important. 
          Everything people have written
          about in science books is going to
          change.  The history of the world's
          future is on the TV right now.  We
          need to record this so you can show
          your children this tape and say you
          were there...
              (beat)
          For your children Bo.

                    BO
          My ballet recital.

                    MORGAN
          Dad!

Graham doesn't take his eyes off the screen.

                    GRAHAM
              (preoccupied)
          Find another tape.

Graham and Merrill sit down at the same time on the sofa. 
They both have the same dazed, slow movements.

Morgan rummages through the pile of videos frantically.  He
finds one and reaches for the VCR.

                    MORGAN
          Uncle Merrill, I'm using your tape.

Morgan slams the tape marked "Bay Watch" into the VCR and
presses record.  He's breathing heavy now.  Wheezing
actually.

Morgan moves to the sofa and takes a seat in between his
father and his uncle.  Bo walks over and squeezes in also. 
The four of them stare at the television.

                    TV ANCHOR
          ... You're seeing a live feed from

          Everything they wrote in science
          books is about to change.

Beat.

                    MORGAN
              (soft)
          Told you.

Morgan brings his asthma spray to his mouth and inhales.

                                             DISSOLVE TO:

INT.  FAMILY ROOM - MIDNIGHT

The family room lights are off now.  The TV is still on.  The
SOUND IS MUTED.  There are a couple glasses of Bo's water on
the television now.

The fourteen lights are still hovering on the screen.  Morgan
is asleep on Graham's lap.  Bo is asleep on Merrill's
shoulder.

                    MERRILL
              (whispers)
          Some people are probably thinking
          this is the end of the world.

Graham turns his sleepy eyes away from the screen to Merrill.

                    GRAHAM
              (whispers)
          That's true.

Merrill looks his brother in the eyes.  Beat.

                    MERRILL
              (whispers)
          Do you think it's a possibility?

                    GRAHAM
              (whispers)
          Yes.

                    MERRILL
              (whispers)
          How can you say that?

                    GRAHAM
              (whispers)
          That wasn't the answer you wanted?

                    MERRILL
              (whispers)
          Can you at least pretend to be like
          you used to be?  Give me some
          comfort?

Beat.  Graham thinks it over.

                    GRAHAM
              (whispers)
          ... There are all different ways
          you can tell that there's someone
          really there watching out for us. 
          You see signs.  Sometimes they're
          little ones.  You think of someone. 
          The phone rings.  They're on the
          phone... Sometimes they're big,
          like fourteen lights hovering over
          Mexico City.
              (beat)
          Sure, there are a lot of people
          watching this who think this could
          be a bad thing.  But there are a
          lot of people watching this, who
          think it's a miracle.  A sign of
          God's existence.  It's all in how
          you look at things Merrill.
              (beat)
          What you have to decide is what
          kind of person you are?  Are you
          the type who believes in miracles
          and looks for signs or are you the
          kind who believes, things just
          happen by chance?

Beat.  Merrill is deep in thought.

                    MERRILL
          I was at this party once.  I'm on a
          couch with Sara Mckinney.  She was
          just sitting there, looking
          beautiful and staring at me.  I go
          to lean in and kiss her and I
          realize I have gum in my mouth.  I
          turn and take out the gum.  Stuff
          it in my paper cup next to the sofa
          and turn around.  Sara Mckinney
          throws up all over herself.
              (beat)
          I knew the second it happened.  It
          was a miracle.  I could have been
          kissing her when she threw up. 
          That would have scarred me for
          life.  I may never have recovered.

Merrill looks at the TV screen.  Beat.

                    MERRILL
          I'm a miracle man.  Those lights
          are a miracle.

Graham smiles.

                    GRAHAM
              (whispers)
          There you go.

Beat.

                    MERRILL
              (whispers)
          So which type are you?

Beat.

                    GRAHAM
              (whispers)
          Do you feel comforted?

                    MERRILL
              (whispers)
          Yes.

                    GRAHAM
              (whispers)
          What does it matter then?

The two of them turn back to the silent screen of the
television.  It's a long beat before Graham speaks.

                    GRAHAM
              (whispers)
          Do you know what Colleen's last
          words were before they killed her?

Beat.  Merrill turns and stares quietly at his brother.

                    GRAHAM
              (whispers)
          She said, "See", and then her eyes
          glazed a bit and she said... "Tell
          Merrill to swing away."

Merrill's mouth opens a bit.  Graham turns and chuckles at
his expression.

                    GRAHAM
              (whispers)
          Do you know why she said that?

Merrill nods, "No."

                    GRAHAM
              (whispers)
          Because the nerve endings in her
          brain were firing as she died, and
          some random memory of us at one of
          your baseball games popped into her
          head.
              (beat)
          There is no one watching out for us
          Merrill.  We're all on our own.

Graham turns back to the television.  Beat.

THE LIGHT OF THE TELEVISION FLICKERS ON THE FACES OF THE TWO
BROTHERS AS THEY SIT WATCHING IN SILENCE.

                                                  CUT TO:

INT.  FAMILY ROOM - DAY

Graham's eyes open.  DAYLIGHT FILLS the family room.  He is
alone on the couch.  Alone in the room.

He looks to the television.  It's not there.

Graham moves to his feet and look around the room.  His eyes
stop on an EXTENSION CORD that runs from a wall outlet in the
family room, across the front hall, and under a closet door.

Graham moves to the door.  WE HEAR MUFFLED TELEVISION VOICES. 
Graham opens the

CLOSET.

Merrill looks up.  He's seated on a kitchen chair with the
television on a roll-away stand crammed in with him.

                    MERRILL
          For the kids protection.  All they
          were doing was watching TV from
          five a.m.  I felt like they were
          getting obsessed like you said. 
          They should be playing furry, furry
          rabbit or tea party or something
          right?

                    GRAHAM
          What's furry, furry rabbit?

                    MERRILL
              (points)
          That's a game isn't it?
              (beat)
          Anyway...
              (points at the TV)
          There's been some interesting
          developments.

                    GRAHAM
          What time is it?

                    MERRILL
          Eleven a.m.  They're gone.

Beat.  Graham looks at the TV screen.  There's a daylight
shot of Mexico City.  The skies are empty above it.

                    MERRILL
          But they're not really gone.  We
          just can't see them.  Early this
          morning a bird flew right at the
          area where the lights were hovering
          last night.

Merrill puts a finger in the sky on the screen.

                    MERRILL
          It stopped dead in the air and fell
          straight down.

Merrill's finger trails to the bottom of the screen.

                    MERRILL
          They caught it on tape and they've
          been playing it all morning.  They
          found the bird.  His head crushed
          in.  When you see the footage it
          looks like the bird flew into a
          wall in the sky.
              (beat)
          They think they have some invisible
          shield thing going, like an optical
          illusion.

                    GRAHAM
          The bird could have had a heart
          attack and crushed his head when he
          fell.

                    MERRILL
          Already thought of.  Two other
          birds did the same thing an hour
          later.  Not as dramatic.  They
          lived.  But you could see they hit
          something.

Graham looks at the empty sky on the screen with different
eyes.

                    MERRILL
          They're still there hovering.  In
          fact, some people think there's
          more of them now.  All over the
          place.  Over us even.
              (beat)
          And there's a theory about the crop
          circles now.  They think it could
          be some kind of landmark, visual
          mapping system -- so they can
          navigate.  Coordinate.  Makes sense
          doesn't it?

                                                  CUT TO:

INT.  MASTER BEDROOM - DAY

We are inside Graham's bedroom facing his bathroom door,
which is closed.  The same sun-faded outline of where a large
cross used to hang, is stained on the wall next to the door.

Graham opens the bathroom door and steps out with wet hair. 
He towels it dry as he moves to his bedroom window.

WE LOOK OUT THE SAME WINDOW WE LOOKED OUT AT THE VERY
BEGINNING.

The backyard is large and green with a wooden jungle gym.  A
single tree throws shade onto a picnic table.  The back of
the yard is lined by corn crops.  Golden and brown.  Six feet
high.

The crops go on well beyond our view.  Graham stares at them
quietly.  Watching.

Beat.  THE SOUND OF WHISPERING DRAWS HIS ATTENTION FROM THE
WINDOW.

He listens closely.  HIS CHILDREN ARE WHISPERING IN THE NEXT
ROOM.

                                                  CUT TO:

INT.  CHILDREN'S BEDROOM - DAY

Graham walks into the hall and looks in their room.

Morgan and Bo are seated on the edge of their bed.  They have
TIN FOIL wrapped around their heads like a helmet.  Graham
stares at his children.

                    MORGAN
          So the aliens can't read our minds.

                    GRAHAM
          Oh.

                    MORGAN
          They tell you everything in this
          book.

Morgan holds up the book he bought from Nathan's bookstore.

Graham enters the room.  The children make space for him on
the bed.  He takes a seat between them.  Morgan puts the book
on his father's lap.

                    MORGAN
          It says they're probably very small
          -- like my height -- because, as
          their brains developed, there was
          no use for physical development. 
          It says they're probably
          vegetarians, because they would
          have realized the benefits of such
          a diet.

                    GRAHAM
          Who wrote this book?

Graham looks on the back cover for a picture.  There's none
there.

                    MORGAN
          Scientists who have been persecuted
          for their beliefs.

                    GRAHAM
          That means they're unemployed.

Morgan closes the book.

                    MORGAN
          Dad, are you going to be serious?

Bo points at the book.

                    BO
          Yeah, serious.

Graham looks at his two children with foil on their heads.

                    GRAHAM
          I don't know what got into me.

Beat.  Morgan puts the book on his father's lap.

                    MORGAN
          There are pictures.

Beat.  Morgan opens the tome.

                    MORGAN
          Dr. Bimboo, one of the authors of
          the book --

                    GRAHAM
          Bimboo?

                    MORGAN
          Dad.

                    GRAHAM
          I just asked his name.

                    MERRILL
          You had a tone.

Beat.  Graham acknowledges with a nod that he did have a
tone.

                    MORGAN
          He says there are two reasons why
          Extraterrestrials would visit us.

Morgan turns the page.

                    MORGAN
          To make contact in the spirit of
          exploration and furthering the
          knowledge of the universe.

Graham looks at an illustration of a small, bulbous headed
figure shaking hands with a bearded human.

                    MORGAN
          Or the other reason... They're
          hostile.  They've used up the
          resources on their planet and are
          looking to harvest our planet next.

Morgan turns the page.  There is a picture of a house.  A
space ship is hovering over the home shooting laser beams at
it.  Beat.

                    GRAHAM
          Looks a little like our house
          doesn't it?

Morgan and Bo lean in closer to look at the picture.  Beat.

                    BO
          The same windows.

                    MORGAN
              (soft)
          That's weird.

The three of them study the picture of the house.  It's on
fire.  Their eyes move to the front yard.  There are three
bodies lying dead on the front lawn.  Two are children.

THE PHONE RINGS.

The children SCREAM and cling to their father.  THEIR SCREAMS
DIE DOWN.  The PHONE RINGS again.  Graham gets up.  He closes
the book.

                    GRAHAM
          That's enough from Dr. Bimboo for
          now.  Everybody in this house needs
          to calm down and eat some fruit or
          something.

Graham steps out into the hallway.  He tucks the book under
his arm and picks up the phone.

                    PHONE VOICE
          Father.

THROUGH THE PHONE WE HEAR SUDDEN SCUFFLING, A CHAIR SQUEAL
AGAINST THE FLOOR and then the phone disconnects.

                    GRAHAM
          Hello?

NOTHING BUT DEAD AIR.  Graham looks at the receiver and then
slowly hangs it up.

Graham walks down the hall to a small window.

The window looks down the driveway and out onto the road. 
Graham stares into the distance.  About a half-mile away we
see the TIP OF A HOUSE.  Graham gazes at it for a beat.

                                                  CUT TO:

INT.  FRONT HALL - DAY

Graham comes down the stairs with his overcoat on.  He moves
to the closet door and knocks on it before opening it.

Merrill looks up from the television.

                    GRAHAM
          I'm going out for a few minutes. 
          No one leaves this house.  No one.

Merrill nods.

                    MERRILL
          Where are you going?

                    GRAHAM
          Ray Reddy's house.

Graham starts down the hall.  Merrill steps out of the closet
for the first time.  He looks down the hall shocked.

                    MERRILL
          Why?

Graham unlocks the front door.

                    GRAHAM
          I think he just called here.

                                                  CUT TO:

INT.  CHILDREN'S BEDROOM - DAY

BLUE SKY -- OUR VIEW MOVES OVER CLOUDS.  WE ARE LOOKING
THROUGH SOME KIND OF LENS.

                    BO (O.S.)
          You don't think something bad will
          happen do you Morgan?

Morgan pulls his eye away from the telescope that is set up
on the window seat in his room.

                    MORGAN
          Why, you got one of your feeling
          again?

Bo nods, "Yes."

                    MORGAN
          Is it bad?

Bo nods, "Yes" slowly.

                    MORGAN
          If it does, I won't let anything
          bad happen to you.

Bo hugs Morgan tight.

                    BO
              (soft)
          I don't want you to die.

                    MORGAN
          Who said I was going to die?

Bo keeps hugging Morgan.

                    MORGAN
          Who said I was going to die?

Beat.  Morgan peels Bo's arms off of him.

                    MORGAN
          Come on Bo.  I need to keep a look
          out.

Bo lets go.  Morgan puts his eye to the eyepiece of the
telescope.

                                                  CUT TO:

EXT.  REDDY HOUSE - DAY

A mailbox reads "R. Reddy."

There is a gray and white house at the end of the quarter
mile driveway.  We saw the roof of this house from the Hess
hallway window.

Graham stands at the front door and RINGS THE DOORBELL AGAIN.

Beat.  Graham tries to look inside.  Curtains block his view.

Graham walks around the porch.  Turns the corner of the
house.  He looks in a side window.

THE VIEW THROUGH THE WINDOW IS OF A KITCHEN.  THE KITCHEN
CHAIRS ARE ON THEIR SIDE.  THE KITCHEN TABLE ITSELF, IS
UPSIDE DOWN, LEANING AGAINST A CLOSED DOOR.  THE ROOM IS
TOTALLY WRECKED.

Graham stands straight up.  He looks around nervously.  He
takes two steps back towards the front of the house and the
safety of his station wagon before he notices the GREEN TRUCK
parked to the side of the house.

There is someone sitting in it.

                                                  CUT TO:

EXT.  REDDY DRIVEWAY - DAY

The passenger side window of the truck is open.  Graham steps
up to it and looks inside.  The thin man with the leather
jacket, we saw in town, sits behind the wheel.  He stares out
the windshield.  He is covered in sweat.

                    GRAHAM
          Hello Ray.

RAY REDDY doesn't look over.  Doesn't react.  Keeps staring.

Ray clutches the steering wheel tightly, turning his knuckles
a yellow white.

Graham glances to the backseat of the truck.  There are two
large bags over flowing with clothes.

Graham's eyes gently move back to Ray and drift down to the
TWO BLOOD STAINED AREA ON HIS SHIRT.  Beat.

                    GRAHAM
          What happened Ray?

Beat.  Ray doesn't look over when he speaks.

                    RAY
          I wrote your number down to call
          you.  It's been sitting next to the
          phone for six months.  When I knew
          it was inside the house, I couldn't
          think of any other number to call. 
          I panicked.
              (beat)
          Thank you for coming Father.

                    GRAHAM
              (soft)
          You're welcome Ray.

Tears start falling down Ray's face.

                    RAY
          I worked so long that night.  I
          ain't never fallen asleep driving
          before.  And never since.  Most of
          the ride home, there wasn't a car
          insight in either direction.  If
          I'd fallen asleep then, I'd a ended
          up in a ditch with a head ache.  It
          had to happen at that right moment. 
          That certain ten-fifteen seconds
          when I passed her walking.  It was
          like it was meant to be.

Ray finally turns.  His red face quivers as he talks.

                    RAY
          I guess if this is the end of the
          world, I'm screwed right?  People
          who kill Reverends' wives aren't
          exactly ushered to the front of the
          line in heaven.

Ray starts the car.

                    GRAHAM
          Where you going Ray?

                    RAY
          To the lake.  The way I see it, all
          the places marked in the crops and
          such -- none of them are really
          near water.  I figure they don't
          like water.
              (beat)
          Can't be any worse than here.

Beat.

                    GRAHAM
          Ray, did you see one of them?

Ray looks at Graham.

                    RAY
          I'm truly sorry for what I've done
          to you and yours.

The two men stare at each other for a beat.  Ray looks away. 
He puts the car in drive.

                    RAY
          And don't open my pantry Father.  I
          locked one of them in there.

Graham steps away as the truck moves forward and pulls down
the driveway.

                                                  CUT TO:

INT.  CLOSET - DAY

Merrill's head is leaned against a bunch of winter coats. 
His eyes are closed.

                    TV ANCHOR
          ... The startling footage we're
          about to show you was photographed
          by a forty-two year old Romero
          Valadares.

Merrill's eyes open.

                    TV ANCHOR
          This video was taken yesterday
          afternoon at his son's seventh
          birthday, in the city of Passo
          Fundo, Brazil.  It was sent to the
          local news bureau there and
          satellited to us a few minutes ago. 
          All initial opinions are; this is
          genuine.

THE TELEVISION ANCHOR APPEARS FLUSTERED.

                    TV ANCHOR
          What you are about to see, may
          disturb you.

Merrill sits up in his chair.

THE PICTURE OF THE ANCHORMAN IS REPLACED BY A HANDHELD VIDEO
IMAGE ON THE TV SCREEN.  THE IMAGE IS OF A FAMILY ROOM WHERE
A BUNCH OF CHILDREN IN DRESS CLOTHES CROWD AROUND A SLIDING
GLASS WINDOW.

THE CHILDREN ARE SPEAKING PORTUGUESE EXCITEDLY.  THEY LOOK AT
THE CAMERA AND POINT TO THE OUTSIDE THROUGH THE GLASS DOORS.

THE HANDHELD IMAGE MOVES OVER THEIR SHOULDERS TO LOOK OUT
THROUGH THE GLASS INTO A CRAMPED BACKYARD.  THERE IS A
RECTANGULAR TABLE WITH PARTY DECORATIONS AND AN UNTOUCHED
BIRTHDAY CAKE ON IT.  COLORFUL BALLOONS FLOAT AROUND THE
BACKYARD.  THERE IS NO ONE OUTSIDE.

THE IMAGES PANS AROUND THE DENSE FOLIAGE THAT FORMS A WALL
AROUND THE YARD.  THE IMAGE ZOOMS AND SEARCHES IN THE
DARKNESS OF THE BRANCHES.

The chair in the closet CREAKS as Merrill leans forward a
little towards the television screen.

WE HEAR A BURST OF PORTUGUESE.  THE IMAGE PANS AWAY FROM THE
GLASS DOORS BACK INTO THE HOME.  WE LOOK DOWN A NARROW HALL
TO THE KITCHEN.  A BOY WITH A BIRTHDAY HAT IS SEATED ON THE
KITCHEN COUNTER, POINTING FRANTICALLY OUT THE KITCHEN WINDOW. 
HE YELLS IN PORTUGUESE.

THE CROWD OF CHILDREN AROUND THE GLASS DOORS START RUSHING
INTO THE KITCHEN.  THEY ARE JOINED BY A FEW ADULTS.  THE
IMAGE FOLLOWS THEM IN.

THE KITCHEN WINDOW IS BLOCKED BY HEADS WHEN WE FIRST ARRIVE.

                    MERRILL
          Move children!  Vamonos!

THE IMAGE FINDS AN OPENING OVER THE SHOULDER OF THE BOY WITH
THE BIRTHDAY HAT AND ANOTHER CHILD.

WE ARE NOW LOOKING OUT THE KITCHEN WINDOW.  WE SEE A NARROW
ALLEY ONLY A FEW FEET WIDE CREATED BY A STONE WALL AND A
SMALL GARAGE BUILDING.  ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE WALL IS
DENSE FOLIAGE.  THE WALL ENDS A FEW FEET AFTER THE GARAGE
BUILDING.

WE HEAR THE CHILD'S VOICE VERY CLOSE TO US SPEAKING IN
PORTUGUESE.  THE CAMERA PANS JUST A LITTLE AS THE FACE OF THE
LITTLE BIRTHDAY BOY FILLS THE SCREEN.  HE TALKS EXCITEDLY
DIRECTLY AT US AND AT SOMEONE BEHIND THE IMAGE.

                    BOY WITH HAT
          Esta atras da garagem!  Esta atras
          de ai!  Is behind!

THE BOY GESTURES TO THE GARAGE BUILDING.  THE IMAGE SETTLES
BACK ON THE WINDOW.  WE STARE AT THE NARROW ALLEY.  THE IMAGE
ZOOMS A BIT.  SEARCHES THE EDGE OF THE GARAGE BUILDING.  THE
IMAGE STARTS WIDENING OUT.

AND THEN WE SEE IT.

THE KITCHEN ERUPTS WITH CHILDREN'S SCREAMS AS A LARGE NON-
HUMAN FIGURE MOVES FROM THE GARAGE BUILDING TO BEHIND THE
WALL.  IT'S OUT OF SIGHT IN LESS THAN A SECOND.

Merrill is frozen like a statue.  His mouth is open a little. 
The closet FILLS WITH THE PANDEMONIA OF THE KITCHEN ON THE
VIDEO.

THE VIDEO IMAGE ON THE NEWS, PAUSES.  BEAT.  WE SEE IT
REWIND.  WE SEE THE FIGURE ZIP BACK BEHIND THE GARAGE IN A
FLICKER.  THE VIDEO STOPS.  PLAYS AGAIN.

THE IMAGE ZOOMS A BIT.  SEARCHES THE EDGE OF THE GARAGE
BUILDING.  STARTS TO WIDEN OUT.  THE KITCHEN STARTS TO FILL
WITH SCREAMS AS THE FIGURE APPEARS... THE IMAGE FREEZES.

THE NEWS HAS PAUSED THE VIDEOTAPE ON THE EXACT MOMENT THE
NON-HUMAN FIGURE IS VISIBLE.  IT'S HALFWAY ACROSS THE ALLEY.
IT'S MOTION HAS BLURRED IT, BUT YOU CAN TELL ITS SHAPE NOW.

Merrill Hess stares stunned at the IMAGE OF AN UPRIGHT ANIMAL
LIKE CREATURE.  THE STRIATIONS ALL OVER ITS BODY LOOK LIKE
BRANCHES.  EXACTLY LIKE BRANCHES.  THEY MATCH THE BUSHES
WHERE IT WAS HIDING, PERFECTLY.

                                                  CUT TO:

INT.  KITCHEN - DAY

The door swings open slowly.  Graham steps into Ray Reddy's
kitchen.

Cabinets are open.  Dishes are broken.  Chairs are turned
over.  The faucet is running full blast.

Graham's eyes move across the room.  The kitchen table is
upside down and leaned up against the pantry door.

THE SOUND OF A GLASS JAR BREAKING ON THE GROUND CAN BE HEARD
INSIDE THE PANTRY.

Graham takes a few conservative steps to the middle of the
kitchen.

He leans a little bit and listens.  From behind the pantry
door WE HEAR THE SOUND OF BREATHING.  THERE ARE QUIET
MOVEMENT SOUNDS.  THE SOFT SOUND OF GLASS BEING CRUSHED AS
IT'S BEING WALKED ON.

Graham can almost see the bottom of the door around the
leaning table.  Graham stands up straight and thinks it over. 
Beat.

Graham takes two small steps closer.

When he leans, he can now see the entire bottom of the pantry
door.  THERE IS LIGHT LEAKING OUT FROM BENEATH IT.  THERE IS
SHADOW BEING THROWN FROM INSIDE THE PANTRY.  THE SHADOW MOVES
BACK AND FORTH UNDER THE DOOR.

                    GRAHAM
          Hello.

THE SHADOW STOPS MOVING.

Beat.

                    GRAHAM
              (loud)
          The police are here... I am with
          them... I am a police officer.
              (beat)
          I just want to talk to you.

SILENCE.  There is no movement from the pantry.  Beat.

                    GRAHAM
              (loud)
          We know all about the hoax.  We
          already took some of your friends
          downtown in the paddy wagon.
              (mouths to himself)
          Paddy wagon?

THE ONLY SOUND IN THE KITCHEN IS THE SOUND OF THE FAUCET
RUNNING.  Graham waits for a reply, but none comes.

                    GRAHAM
          If you tell us your name and why
          you did it, we'll give you the same
          deal we gave the others.  Don't
          throw away your life son.

Beat.

Graham bends down where he stands.  He puts his head near the
wood floor.  He tries to look under the door.  All he can see
are the bottoms of a couple shelves in the corner of the
pantry.  He's at too severe an angle.

Graham sits up.  He's only four feet away from the pantry
door.  He looks around not knowing what to do.  His eyes fall
on a bunch of kitchen knives that have spilled from a drawer
onto the floor.

He takes a butcher knife from the group and moves closer to
the door.  Beat.  He reaches with the butcher knife
underneath the slanted kitchen table.  He uses the knife like
a mirror to see under the door.  Graham watches the SOFT
REFLECTION IN THE FLAT STAINLESS STEEL SURFACE OF THE BLADE. 
WE CAN MAKE OUT BROKEN GLASS AND RIPPED OPEN PACKETS OF RICE
AND CEREAL ON THE GROUND.  THERE ARE POCKETS OF SHADOWS WE
CAN'T SEE INTO.

Graham pulls the knife out.  He sits there kneeling two feet
from the door.  Beat.

He takes a deep breath and starts to lower his head under the
slanted table.

He stops halfway down.  He loses his nerve and sits up.  He
rises to his feet as he places the butcher knife on the
counter.  Graham starts walking across the kitchen.  He gets
to the door.  Puts his hand on the doorknob.

He stays like that for a long time.  Beat.

Graham lets go of the doorknob -- He turns and walks quickly
across the kitchen -- He picks up the butcher knife -- He
kneels down next to the pantry -- He ducks his head under the
slanted kitchen table -- He places his cheek to the floor,
only inches from the bottom of the door, and looks into the
pantry.

There is broken glass and rice throughout the wooden floor of
the pantry.  Nothing else.

Graham stares at his VIEW OF THE FLOOR.  Something's wrong. 
Parts of it feel like a painting.  THE PAINTING MOVES.

TWO BLACK EYES OPEN -- SEEMINGLY SUSPENDED IN THE MIDDLE OF
THE ROOM.  THEY ARE SIDEWAYS.  THEY LOOK AT GRAHAM.

GRAHAM YELLS.  HE JOLTS UP.  HIS HEAD HITS THE SLANTED TABLE
HARD.

FOUR LONG FINGERS AND CLAWS, THE EXACT COLOR OF THE WOODEN
FLOOR REACH OUT AND MISS HIS FACE BY A FRACTION OF AN INCH.

GRAHAM REACTS.  THE BUTCHER KNIFE COMES DOWN FAST AND HARD ON
THE PROTRUDING WOOD COLORED FINGERS.  SLAM!

WE HEAR AN UNBEARABLY HIGH-PITCHED INHALE SOUND FROM INSIDE
THE PANTRY.

                                                  CUT TO:

EXT.  STATION WAGON - DAY

The station wagon knocks over the "Ray Reddy" mailbox as it
turns sharply onto the road.

Graham picks up speed as he passes the wall of crops on his
right.

THE STATION WAGON SUDDENLY BRAKES.

Two black skid marks form on the road as the station wagon
comes to a fast stop.

Beat.  Graham gets out of the car.  He walks a few feet ahead
of the station wagon.  He bends down in the middle of the
road.

A BIRD lays limp on the asphalt.  Its head is crushed.

Graham gazes at the still pile of feathers.  Beat.

Graham turns and looks straight up at the BLUE, CLOUDLESS SKY
above him.

                    GRAHAM
              (soft)
          Douche bag.

                                                  CUT TO:

INT.  HESS FAMILY ROOM - DAY

Graham enters his front hall.  He closes the door and locks
it behind him.  He turns and looks into the family room.

Morgan and Bo and Merrill are seated together on the sofa. 
All three are wearing foil helmets.  Beat.

                    MERRILL
          They're skin changes color.  That's
          why we couldn't see him that night.

Graham stares at his family huddled on the couch.  Beat. 
Graham takes in the news as he moves to the stairs.  He takes
a seat on the second to last step.

He sits obscured by the balusters.  Beat.

                    GRAHAM
          Tell me something Morgan.  In that
          book of your, did they happen to
          detail what would happen if they
          were hostile?

                    MORGAN
          Yes.  They would invade us using
          only ground tactics.  Hand to hand
          combat.  They wouldn't use their
          technology or fight an airborne
          battle, because they would know we
          would eventually use nuclear
          weapons and the planet would be
          useless to them.

                    MERRILL
          I'm sorry, what book is this?

                    GRAHAM
          Did they say what our chances would
          be if they did invade?

                    MORGAN
          They said one of two things could
          happen.  One, they fight and are
          defeated and leave to return again
          with full forces hundreds or even
          thousands of years later.

                    GRAHAM
          What's two?

                    MORGAN
          They win.

The words hang in the air.  Graham sits quietly on the second
step of the stairs.

                    GRAHAM
          What do you think about the idea
          that they don't like places near
          water, and we might be safe from
          them near a lake or something?

                    MORGAN
          Sounds made up.

Beat.

                    GRAHAM
          We can choose to believe it and
          pack up and leave.
              (beat)
          Or we can stay here.  Board up this
          house.  Hide inside our home and
          wait it out.  Either way, at least
          we'll be together.
              (beat)
          All those in favor of the lake,
          raise your hand.

No one raises their hand.

                    GRAHAM
          All those in favor of home, raise
          your hand.

All four put their hands in the air.  Beat.  They lower them
and sit in silence.

                    MERRILL
          How do we know boards will do
          anything?

Beat.

                    GRAHAM
              (soft)
          Because, they seem to have trouble
          with pantry doors.

EXT.  HESS HOUSE - AFTERNOON

WE ARE WATCHING THE HOUSE FROM THE CROPS.  We see Graham
inside the house, closing the window shutters in one room
after another.

WE SEE a stack of wooden boards on the porch.

OUR VIEW MOVES to the barn where Isabelle is tied.  She is
not pacing.  She is not barking.  She sits staring right at
us.  She is shivering.

OUR VIEW MOVES to the garage building where we see Merrill
carry a huge pile of his clothes and things down the stairs. 
He's moving into the main house.

Merrill walks across the yard.  His eyes look around
carefully as he moves.

Part of the pile in his arms falls to the grass as he crosses
the lawn.  He stops walking and starts to gather up the
fallen things.  He picks up a couple shirts and two baseballs
encased in glass cases.

The glass encasing one of the souvenir baseballs, has
cracked.  He takes the ball out.  Stares at it.

We watch from the crops as Merrill puts down his pile of
clothes and things on the grass.  He looks around and finds
what he's looking for.  A rake.

Merrill unscrews the fork on the rake from the wooden handle. 
With the wooden stick in one hand and the souvenir baseball
in the other, he turns to face the crops.

WE PULL BACK A LITTLE INTO THE CROPS.  PART OF OUR VIEW IS
OBSCURED BY STALKS, BUT WE STILL SEE MERRILL CLEARLY.

Merrill looks around cautiously again, before getting into a
batter's stance.  His left leg digs into the grass in front
of him.  His weight is mostly on his back leg.  He looks out
into the distance high over the crops.  He throws the
baseball up in the air...

Merrill grabs the wooden handle.  Merrill's shoulders move
with blinding speed.  The wooden rake handle slices the air. 
And misses the ball.

The ball drops at Merrill's feet.

WE WATCH as Merrill picks up the ball and tries again.  This
time his shoulders move even faster.  The wooden stick
actually makes A RESONANT SOUND as it cuts the air.

The ball drops at Merrill's feet.

WE WATCH THROUGH THE CROPS as Merrill snatches the ball up
and tries a third time.  This time he YELLS as he swings.  He
rips the air with the wooden stick so fast it blurs to the
eye.

The baseball drops at his feet.  Strike three.

Merrill stands still in the yard.  He's breathing a little
heavy as he stares down at the ball.

He gently picks it up.  He walks back to his pile of things
and then suddenly turns.  He throws the ball in the air as he
does.  His left leg goes out.  His weight goes to his right
leg as he turns his shoulders with astonishing speed and
power...

THE SOUND OF THE BASEBALL HITTING THE WOODEN HANDLE CRACKS
ACROSS THE WHOLE YARD.

The ball rockets into the air.  We watch it fly overhead...
sail high over the crops... it becomes a tiny dot in the sky.

After a long beat of silence it comes back to earth.  It
lands in the street and bounces twenty feet into the air.  It
cleared at least four or five hundred feet of crops.  Maybe
more.

WE LOOK BACK to Merrill standing in the backyard.  He drops
the wooden stick to the grass and moves for his things.  He
piles them in his arms.  When his arms are full, he starts
for the porch.  WE WATCH FROM THE CROPS AS MERRILL GOES
INSIDE THE HOUSE.

                                                  CUT TO:

INT.  CLOSET - LATE AFTERNOON

Morgan and Bo are seated on the kitchen chair in the closet.

                    MORGAN
          Come quick!

THE FLICKER OF THE TELEVISION FALLS ON THE CHILDREN'S FACES.

WE HEAR MERRILL AND GRAHAM COMING DOWN THE HALLWAY BEFORE WE
SEE THEM.

They appear almost at the same time in the doorway to the
closet.  Graham and Merrill are holding hammers.

All four stare at the television.

ON THE SCREEN IS A STREET FILLED WITH PEOPLE RUNNING WITH
SUITCASES AND BAGS.  SOME PEOPLE ARE GETTING TRAMPLED. 
OTHERS ARE STANDING ON THE STREET CORNER AND YELLING.  THERE
IS PANIC IN THE AIR.

                    TV ANCHOR
          Tel Aviv joins Nairobi, Lagos and
          Jerusalem as the latest to confirm
          the appearance of lights.  There
          are lights in the skies over an
          estimated two hundred and seventy
          four cities.  That total could be
          as high as four hundred within the
          hour.

THE IMAGE ON THE TELEVISION SCREEN CHANGES TO A NIGHT TIME
VIEW OF THE TEL AVIV CITY LINE.  THERE ARE FOURTEEN LIGHTS IN
TWO "V" FORMATIONS OVER THE CITY.

                    GRAHAM
          They decided to show themselves.

Beat.

                    MORGAN
          They think these look like stages
          immediately proceeding an attack
          maneuver.

                    MERRILL
          It's like War of the Worlds.

                    MORGAN
          They think it might happen all at
          once.

The words silence everyone.  Beat.

The image goes back to a quiet TV anchor.  He takes a second
before starting up again.

                    TV ANCHOR
          Hundreds of thousands have flocked
          to synagogues, churches and
          temples.

The television shows hundreds of Israelis in a temple and in
the streets praying.

Graham watches quietly as the masses pray side by side.

                    TV ANCHOR
          Ground forces are being assembled
          in countries throughout the
          globe...

                    GRAHAM
          I'm going to get back to the
          windows.

Bo watches as Graham leaves the doorway of the closet.  She
turns back to the television.

Beat.  Merrill leans down between his niece and nephew.

                    MERRILL
              (whispers)
          You guys okay?

They don't answer.  They watch the soldiers loading up onto
trucks on the television.

                    MORGAN
          Some guy had a sign that said it
          was the end of the world.
              (beat)
          Nothing really bad is going to
          happen, is it Uncle Merrill?

                    MERRILL
          Don't worry.

Morgan glances at Bo and then back to his uncle.

                    MORGAN
          You sure right?

Beat.  Merrill gazes at the two questioning faces.  He looks
back at the empty closet doorway where Graham stood.  He
turns back to the children.

                    MERRILL
          You know about signs Morgan?  Not
          like the ones people write on. 
          It's like if you poured a glass of
          milk and you dropped the glass by
          mistake and broke it before you
          could drink it.  Then you looked at
          the milk carton and saw that the
          milk was spoiled.  They're things
          that happen by chance or luck, but
          make you feel that someone's
          watching out for you.

The children think it over.  Beat.

                    MORGAN
          I once had a bad dream and I
          couldn't wake up.  I kicked at the
          table next to my bed and something
          fell on me and I woke up.  It was a
          picture of mom.  She was smiling. 
          It made me feel safe... You mean
          like that?

Beat.

                    MERRILL
          Yeah, like that.
              (beat)
          I believe in signs Morgan.  I think
          there's someone watching out for
          us.  I got to believe he's going to
          make sure we're all right in the
          end.

INT.  HALLWAY - LATE AFTERNOON

Merrill smiles as he steps out of the closet and closes the
door half-way.

He stands in the hall by himself.  He takes a couple deep
breaths as everything hits him.

                                                  CUT TO:

INT.  CLOSET - LATE AFTERNOON

Morgan turns off the television.

He and Bo sit quietly in the closet under the stairs.

INT.  FAMILY ROOM - LATE AFTERNOON

Graham sits in a chair by the windows.  He has a board on his
lap.  He has a hammer in his hands.  Graham drowns in his
thoughts as the skies darken behind him.

                                                  CUT TO:

INT.  UPSTAIRS LANDING - EVENING

Graham, Bo and Morgan are seated in the upstairs hallway. 
There's a couple boards left leaning against the walls.

Merrill comes out of the children's room with his tools.

                    MERRILL
          Too many windows in the bedrooms. 
          We don't have enough boards.

Merrill stands and leans against the wall.

                    GRAHAM
          We'll have to board up the bedroom
          doors.

                    MORGAN
          Where are we going to sleep?

                    GRAHAM
          The family room.

Everyone sits quietly for a moment.

                    MORGAN
          What about Isabelle?

                    GRAHAM
          We'll keep her in the garage, after
          dinner.

Beat.

                    MERRILL
          I'll make sandwiches.

                    BO
          I want spaghetti?

                    MERRILL
          We should eat fast Bo.

                    GRAHAM
          Spaghetti sounds great.

Merrill glances at Graham.

                    GRAHAM
          What do you want, Morgan?

Beat.

                    MORGAN
          Anything?

Graham nods "yes."

                    MORGAN
          French toast... and mashed
          potatoes.

                    GRAHAM
          Now we're talking.
              (beat)
          How about you Merrill?

Graham turns and looks at Merrill.  They stare at each other
quietly.  They have a conversation without words.  Beat.

                    MERRILL
              (soft)
          Chicken Teriyaki.

                    GRAHAM
          Good choice... I'm going to have a
          cheeseburger with bacon.
              (smiles)
          Extra bacon.

INT.  KITCHEN - EVENING

The windows in the kitchen are boarded up, as is the back
door.

The sink is piled with pots and pans.  It seems like every
utensil and dish in the kitchen was used.

                                                  CUT TO:

INT.  DINNING ROOM - EVENING

One side of the dinning room is lined with windows that have
been boarded up.

The table is set.  Mash potatoes, spaghetti, French toast,
chicken teriyaki and bacon cheeseburgers are all displayed
elegantly on serving dishes.

The Hess family sits around the table.  Beat.  The scene is
somber.  No one is moving.

                    GRAHAM
          What's the matter with everyone? 
          Eat.

No one says anything.  No one eats.

Beat.

                    MORGAN
          I'm scared.

                    BO
          Me too.

                    GRAHAM
          I don't want to hear anymore talk
          like that.  And I don't want to see
          anymore faces like the ones I'm
          looking at.
              (beat)
          We are going to enjoy this meal. 
          Nothing can stop us from enjoying
          this meal!  Enjoy!

Bo sits next to her three glasses of water and begins to cry.

                    GRAHAM
          Stop crying!

                    MORGAN
          Don't yell at her!

Morgan's face is hard, but tears start to fall anyway. 
Graham watches as both his children cry at the table.

                    GRAHAM
          Fine, if you all don't want to eat,
          then I'm going to have some of
          everything.

Graham takes big scoops of every dish and piles it on his
plate.  He digs his fork into the pile and starts to shove it
in his mouth.  He swallows.

                    GRAHAM
          This tastes so great.

Bo, Morgan and Merrill watch in stunned silence as Graham
stuffs more in his mouth.  He chews and chews and swallows
hard.  He digs his fork into the pile again.

Graham starts crying as he eats.  He keeps taking more bites. 
More tears fall.

Morgan gets up from his seat.  He goes to Graham's chair.  He
leans against his dad's arm and cries with him.  Graham's
fork stops moving.  He watches as Bo moves from her seat to
his other side.  She holds her dad's arm and cries.

Beat.  Graham pulls them both up onto the chair with him and
hugs them tight.  Merrill leans forward and comes to the pile
on Graham's chair.  Merrill buries his head in Graham's
shoulder.  The Hess family huddles together at one end of the
table.  Beat.

THE BABY MONITOR EXPLODES WITH STATIC AND NOISE.

Everyone slowly turns and looks over to Morgan's place
setting where the baby monitor sits on the table.  THE RED
LIGHTS ON THE FRONT ARE ALL LIT UP.

Merrill sits up.  Graham puts down the children from his lap. 
He gets up from his seat and moves around the table and out
of the dinning room.  He moves through the family room and
into the hall.

Graham opens the closet door and looks in at the television. 
He turns it ON.

Beat.  THE EMERGENCY BROADCAST SYMBOL IS ON THE SCREEN.  A
LOW TONE EMITS FROM THE TV.  Beat.  Graham changes stations. 
THE SYMBOL AND TONE APPEAR ON EVERY CHANNEL.  THE MONOTONE
SOUND FILLS THE CLOSET.  Beat.

Graham steps out into the hall.  Merrill and the two children
are standing there waiting.  Graham looks at them.

                    GRAHAM
              (soft)
          It's happening.

                                                  CUT TO:

INT.  UPSTAIRS HALL - EVENING

Merrill pounds furiously with his hammer as he nails boards
to the children's bedroom door.  The master bedroom door is
open with a board leaning next to it.  Graham is inside his
bedroom

                                                  CUT TO:

INT.  GRAHAM'S BEDROOM - EVENING

Graham walks to the window next to his bed.  It's the same
one we've looked out twice before.

Graham looks out onto his backyard.  The FLOOD LIGHT FROM THE
HOUSE THROWS LONG SHADOWS OVER THE YARD.  There is a light
breeze.  Nothing seems wrong.

Graham's eyes stay locked on the crops which go on and on
into darkness.  He moves closer to the glass.  Watches the
top of the corn stalks swaying slightly with the wind.

SOMETHING MOVES IN THE DARKNESS.

Graham's eyes moves to where the corn crops fade into black
forty feet away.  Graham goes very still.

LINES EMERGE IN THE CROPS; THE KIND OF LINES MADE BY SOMEONE
TRAMPLING THROUGH A FIELD.  WE CAN'T SEE WHO'S MAKING THEM. 
ALL WE SEE ARE THE COUNTLESS LINES BEING FORMED.  THE LINES
MOVE FROM THE DARKNESS TOWARDS THE HOUSE.  GRAHAM WATCHES
THEM CLOSE IN ON HIS BACKYARD.  THIRTY FEET... TWENTY FEET...
TEN...

Graham backs away from the window towards the middle of his
bedroom.

                    MERRILL
          Graham hurry.

Graham turns to see Merrill standing with the last board in
the hall.  Graham moves out into the hall and shuts the
bedroom door behind him.

                                                  CUT TO:

INT.  UPSTAIRS HALL - EVENING

Merrill immediately puts the wooden board up and starts
hammering nails into the frame.  Graham picks up his hammer
and quietly begins to hammer nails into the wood.

Graham glances to his right as he works.  Bo and Morgan are
standing together at the top of the stairs.  Bo holds
Morgan's hand.

Graham keeps hammering as he speaks.

                    GRAHAM
          Did I ever tell you what everyone
          said when you were born, Bo?

Bo nods "no" lightly.

                    GRAHAM
          You came out of your momma and you
          didn't even cry.  You just opened
          your eyes and looked around at
          everybody.  Your eyes were so big
          and gorgeous, the ladies in the
          room gasped.

Graham stops hammering.  Merrill keeps going.

                    GRAHAM
          They literally gasped.
              (Graham gasps like them)
          Then they go, "She's like an
          angel."  They said, "We've never
          seen a baby so beautiful."

Graham smiles to himself as he remembers the moment.  Merrill
finishes hammering.

Graham goes over and picks up Bo.

                    GRAHAM
              (soft)
          And you know what else happened?

Bo nods, "no."

                    GRAHAM
              (soft)
          When they put you on the table to
          clean you up, you looked at me and
          smiled.  They say babies that young
          can't smile... You smiled.

Graham looks at his daughter quietly.  He brushes the hair
out of her face as Merrill moves to Morgan and picks him up.

All four turn and look at the three boarded up bedroom doors. 
Beat.

                    GRAHAM
              (soft)
          Let's go down now.

                                                  CUT TO:

INT.  FRONT HALL - EVENING

Graham puts Bo down in the hallway.  She stands close to him. 
Merrill puts down Morgan.  The four of them stand quietly in
a tight group.

THEY HEAR FRANTIC BARKING IN THE DISTANCE.

                    MORGAN
          We forgot about Isabelle.

ISABELLE'S BARKING BECOMES DESPERATE AND ANGRY.  THEY LISTEN
AS SHE BARKS NONSTOP FOR TEN SECONDS... AND THEN SUDDENLY
STOPS.

THE LOW EMERGENCY TONE FROM THE CLOSET TV FILLS THE SILENCE.

Beat.

                    MERRILL
              (whispers)
          Should we turn off the lights?

                    GRAHAM
              (soft)
          They already know we're here.

THE FIRST SOUNDS OF MOVEMENT ARE HEARD OUTSIDE.  CREAKS OF
WOOD FROM THE FRONT PORCH CAN BE HEARD.

THERE IS SOUNDS OF MOVEMENT FROM BEHIND THE LOCKED BACK DOOR.

SOUNDS OF MOVEMENT AGAINST THE SIDE OF THE HOUSE.  SOUNDS
FROM ALL DIRECTIONS.

THERE IS SCRATCHING NOISES AGAINST THE FRONT DOOR.  METAL
NOISES AS THE HANDLE IS TRIED.

                    MORGAN
              (almost inaudible)
          Dad --

THE DOOR CREAKS AS PRESSURE IS PLACED AGAINST IT.

                    GRAHAM
          Do you know what happened when you
          were born Morgan?

Morgan looks at his father, unable to speak.

                    GRAHAM
          You came out and your momma kept
          bleeding.  The doctors rushed you
          out of the room before I could even
          see you.

THERE ARE THUDS ABOVE THEM.

All four look up.

                    MERRILL
          They're on the roof.

                    GRAHAM
          While they were trying to fix her
          up, all she kept asking about was
          you.

THEY LISTEN AS THE THUDS INCREASE IN NUMBER.

THE FIRST SOUND OF SHATTERING GLASS IS HEARD FROM UPSTAIRS.

Merrill looks up the stairs at the boarded bedroom doors.

                    MERRILL
          They're in the house.

Graham takes Morgan's hand.

                    GRAHAM
          I wanted your momma to see you
          first.  She had dreamed about you
          her whole life.
              (beat)
          They waited till she felt better,
          then they brought you in.  They
          placed you right in her arms.  And
          she looked at you.  And you looked
          at her.  You just stared at each
          other for the longest time and then
          she said real soft, "Hello Morgan,
          I'm you momma, you look just like I
          dreamed."

Graham smiles down at his son who smiles gently back.

SCRATCHING NOISES BEGIN TO COME FROM UPSTAIRS.

The group of four turns and watches the top of the stairs. 
The BEDROOM DOOR HANDLES ARE BEING RATTLED.

Merrill's eyes moves quietly above the bedroom doors, to the
ceiling of the upstairs hallway.  He stares at a rectangle in
the ceiling.  A tiny rope hangs from the rectangle.  Beat.

                    MERRILL
          The attic door.

Merrill sprints up the stairs.

Morgan and Bo watch as Graham follows after Merrill.

                                                  CUT TO:

INT.  UPSTAIRS HALL - EVENING

Graham and Merrill stare up at the ceiling.  There is
movement right above them.  Dust falls from a ceiling light
right next to them.

The rope hanging from the attic trapdoor hangs between them. 
They watch as it begins to twitch and sway.

The springs in the trap door begins to GROAN.  The door
starts to fall open.

Merrill and Graham raise their arms above their head and
reach up.  The door opens a few inches.  Merrill is taller. 
The door presses against his fingers first.  It gives a few
more inches before Merrill stops it.

Graham's finger are barely touching it.  Merrill's face turns
red with strain as something pushes down on the door.

                    MERRILL
          This is a very temporary solution.

Graham brings his arms down.  He sees his children watching
from the bottom of the stairs.  Graham looks around where he
is.  There is a very small table with photos against a wall. 
A laundry closet and three boarded up bedroom doors...
nothing else.  Graham turns to Merrill.

                    GRAHAM
          How temporary?

Merrill's face is a deep crimson.

                    MERRILL
          Twenty-two seconds.

Graham looks around again... the same things... the same
table... the same closet... Graham stops and stares at the
closet.  It has a wooden folding door that opens and closed
on a guide rail.  The wooden folding door is very tall.  Its
top is one foot from the ceiling.

Graham goes to the closet and grabs the door.  He starts
rocking it hard.  Pulling it out... It starts to come out of
its guide rail... Graham leans back with all his weight...
The thin wooden door rips out of place.  One end is still
attached at the hinge.  Graham pulls it straight.  It reaches
into the middle of the landing.  It stands right next to
Merrill.  Right under the attic trapdoor.  Its top is only a
few inches lower than Merrill's reach.

                    GRAHAM
          Let go.

Merrill hesitates and then lowers the attic trapdoor.  It
connects with the top of the closet door and stops.  The
trapdoor is now open almost a foot... We can now see part of
the bottom step of the wooden pull out stairs that lead to
the attic.

Merrill and Graham step away as the closet folding door holds
the weight of the attic door.

After a moment, the spring on the attic trapdoor recoils as
the pressure is let up.  The trapdoor closes.  Beat.

It opens with force, slamming the top of the standing closet
door with a THUD.

The attic trapdoor closes again.  Opens again with force. 
THUD.

The closet folding door begins to pull away from the hinges
keeping it upright.

Graham moves down the stairs.  Merrill follows him.

                                                  CUT TO:

INT.  FRONT HALL - EVENING

THE SCRATCHING NOISES FILL THE HOUSE.

Morgan and Bo are frozen watching a set of long fingers reach
under the front door.  THE COLOR OF THE FINGERS CHANGES -- TO
THE EXACT COLOR AND TEXTURE OF THE YELLOW CRACKED PAINT ON
THE DOOR.

THUD.  THE TRAPDOOR SLAMS THE TOP OF THE FOLDING DOOR
UPSTAIRS.

Graham and Merrill arrive in the front hall.  Graham takes
Morgan and Bo by the hand and leads them quickly down the
hall.  Merrill backs away as he watches the top of the
stairs.

ANOTHER THUD ECHOES THROUGH THE HOUSE.

                                                  CUT TO:

INT.  KITCHEN - EVENING

The swinging door swings open and closed behind Merrill as he
enters the kitchen.

Graham has moved the chairs away from the kitchen table and
waits by it.  Merrill goes over and the two of them push the
table against the swinging door.

They take the kitchen chairs and pile a couple on top, and
jam the rest underneath the table.

Graham leans against the kitchen counter.  Merrill stares at
the pile of furniture.

                    MERRILL
          This is going to do nothing.

                    GRAHAM
          We have to go in the basement.

Graham points to a set of narrow stairs that lead to a
darkened door at the bottom.

                    MERRILL
          There's no way out of there.

Beat.  Graham looks at the faces of his frightened children.

                    GRAHAM
          Did I ever tell you, I dislocated
          Uncle Merrill's arm?

THUD.

                    MERRILL
          Should we make a run for it out the
          back?

                    GRAHAM
          They're right behind the door.

Merrill looks at the boarded up back door.  Graham turns to
Bo and Morgan who stand against the wall.

                    GRAHAM
          He was only a year and half old.

                    MERRILL
              (to Graham)
          What are you doing?

                    GRAHAM
          He was trying to eat a second
          chocolate bar.  Your grandma said,
          "No."  He tried to take a bite, so
          I grabbed it.

THUD WITH A CRACK OF WOOD FROM UPSTAIRS.  Merrill turns and
stares at the barricaded entrance to the kitchen.

                    GRAHAM
          I must have pulled his arm at an
          awkward angle.  His elbow popped
          right out of the socket.

THE LAST THUD COMES WITH A SOUND OF WOOD SPLINTERING.  THE
CLOSET FOLDING DOOR CRASHES TO THE GROUND IN THE UPSTAIRS
HALL.

WE HEAR CREAKS AS THE ATTIC TRAPDOOR OPENS.

                    GRAHAM
          He didn't scream or anything.  His
          arm just flopped to his side and he
          got real still.

                    MERRILL
          They're coming.

Graham moves towards the basement stairs.

                    GRAHAM
          I held him in my lap in the back
          seat as we drove to the hospital. 
          I couldn't stop crying... We need
          to go into the basement now.

Graham gestures for the kids to come to the stairs.  Morgan
and Bo move to their father slowly.

                    GRAHAM
          You know what your Uncle Merrill
          did right after the doctor put his
          arm back in place?  He jumped off
          the table and gave me a hug.  He
          had already forgotten that I was
          the one who hurt him.

Graham ushers the two children down the stairs.  He waits for
Merrill.  Merrill turns from the kitchen door and walks
toward him.  Merrill stops and looks down the stairs.

                    MERRILL
          We won't be able to get out of
          there.

                    GRAHAM
          I'm sorry I hurt your arm.

Beat.  Merrill's eyes fill with water.  He doesn't look up at
his older brother.

                    MERRILL
          I know.

Merrill walks down the stairs.  Graham waits at the top.  He
watches the kitchen door with the table and chairs against
it.  Beat.

THERE IS MOVEMENT OUTSIDE IN THE HALL.

The door starts to force its way open.  THE TABLE AND CHAIRS
BEGIN TO SCRAPE ACROSS THE KITCHEN FLOOR LIKE NAILS AGAINST A
CHALK BOARD.

WE HEAR VOICE-LIKE SOUNDS ENTER THE KITCHEN.  SOUNDS MADE
FROM INHALES, NOT EXHALES.

                                                  CUT TO:

INT.  BASEMENT - EVENING

Graham comes down the last few steps and enters the basement.

                    MORGAN
          We forgot our foil helmets!

Graham closes the door behind him.  It has no lock.

                    GRAHAM
          We need something to wedge against
          the doorknob.

The basement is lined with metal shelves.  The shelves are
cluttered with all sorts of canned goods, extension cords,
cleaning supplies, decorations, outdoor tools.  Merrill
rummages through the shelves frantically.

                    MORGAN
          They'll read our minds!

                    GRAHAM
          You're scaring your sister.

                    BO
          I'm already scared.

Graham puts his ear to the door and listens.

                    GRAHAM
          Merrill --

                    MERRILL
          I'm looking!

Merrill moves to another set of shelves.  He starts knocking
things to the ground.

                    MORGAN
              (to himself)
          They'll know our secret thoughts.

There is SCRATCHING AGAINST THE DOOR.  The doorknob turns. 
Graham grabs it with both hands.  The door begins to push
open.

                    GRAHAM
          Merrill!

                    MERRILL
          Got it!

Merrill reaches between two stacks of shelves and pulls out a
pick for digging in the ground.  He holds it up in the air. 
It has a three-foot wooden handle.

Merrill turns and rushes in Graham's direction.

A single light bulb hangs from a wire in the ceiling.  It is
the only light in the room.  Merrill CLIPS THE LIGHT BULB
with the end of the wooden handle as he crosses the room.

THE BULB SHATTERS.

THE BASEMENT IS INSTANTLY BLACK.

                    BO
          Dad!

WE HEAR THE SOUNDS OF SUDDEN COMMOTION, VOICES.  STRUGGLING
AT THE DOOR.  STEPS ON BROKEN GLASS.

CLICK.  A BEAM OF A FLASHLIGHT COMES ON.

IT ILLUMINATES MORGAN STANDING NEXT TO A RACK OF METAL
SHELVES.  HE TURNS THE FLASHLIGHT IN HIS TINY HANDS.

THE NARROW BEAM MOVES ACROSS THE DARKNESS.  IT FINDS MERRILL
AND GRAHAM LEANING UP AGAINST THE BASEMENT DOOR.

MORGAN MOVES THE BEAM DOWN TO THE PICK, WHICH IS WEDGED
BETWEEN THE DOORKNOB AND THE GROUND.  THE PICK WAVERS A
LITTLE WITH EACH PUSH FROM THE OTHER SIDE, BUT HOLDS.

THE SCRATCHING AND MOVEMENT OUTSIDE THE DOOR BEGINS TO
LESSEN.

Beat.  Morgan slowly moves THE BEAM BACK UP TO HIS FATHER'S
FACE.

                    GRAHAM
          Where's Bo?

THE BEAM SEARCHES IN THE DARKNESS.  THROUGH THE BOXES,
BETWEEN THE SHELVES... IT SETTLES ON A SMALL FOOT HIDING
BEHIND A COUPLE TWENTY-FIVE POUND BAGS OF DOG FOOD.  BO'S
HEAD SLOWLY APPEARS.  SHE SQUINTS AS SHE LOOKS IN THE LIGHT.

                    BO
          I'm okay.

ANOTHER BEAM COMES ON.  IT REVEALS MERRILL AT THE SHELVES
WITH A SECOND FLASHLIGHT.  HE LOOKS OVER THE CONTENTS OF THE
SHELVES NEAR HIM.  BEAT.

HIS BEAM OF LIGHT FALLS ON A RADIO.

He turns the knob to "on."  The radio lights up, but no sound
emerges for it's speakers.  Merrill turns the channel knob
and checks all the stations.  No sound.  No signal.  He
listens to the LIGHT HUM FROM THE SPEAKERS.

Beat.

                    MERRILL
          What's happening out there?

Beat.

                    GRAHAM
              (in the dark)
          I can't even imagine.

THEY ALL LISTEN TO THE DEAD AIR HUM FROM THE RADIO SPEAKERS.

                    MORGAN
          I hope they're doing better than we
          are.  We don't even have helmets.

THERE IS A LOUD BANG.

BOTH FLASHLIGHT BEAMS CRISSCROSS OVER THE BASEMENT AND COME
TO A STOP ON THE DOOR.

ANOTHER BANG.  THE DOOR VIBRATES.  THE PICK WITH THE WOODEN
HANDLE HOLDS IN PLACE.

BANG.

GRAHAM STEPS INTO THE BEAM OF LIGHTS.  He looks at the door
and then turns and faces the lights.

                    GRAHAM
          They're just making noises. 
          They're not trying to get in.
              (beat)
          Why are they doing that?

Graham looks at Merrill's corner of the darkness.  Morgan
moves his BEAM ONTO MERRILL.

                    MERRILL
          They want our attention on the
          door?

BANG.  A beat of silence.

                    GRAHAM
          They're distracting us?

                    MERRILL
          From what?

                    MORGAN
          The book says they're probably very
          good problem solvers.

                    MERRILL
          What book!

                    MORGAN
          They'll find a way in.

BANG.

                    GRAHAM
          Morgan, give me your flashlight.

Morgan puts the FLASHLIGHT ON THE GROUND AND ROLLS IT ACROSS
THE FLOOR.  THE BEAM SPINS IN TINY CIRCLES SHOWING THE BROKEN
GLASS OF THE BULB IN THE MIDDLE OF THE FLOOR.

THE FLASHLIGHT COMES TO A STOP IN GRAHAM'S PALM.  He picks it
up.

                    GRAHAM
          Is there an air vent in here?

Merrill moves next to Graham.  ANOTHER BANG FROM THE DOOR.

They aim their FLASHLIGHTS IN ONE CORNER OF THE ROOM.  The
brothers move in opposite directions.

GRAHAM MOVES HIS BEAM UP AND DOWN CHECKING THE WALLS AND THE
CEILING AS HE MOVES.

MERRILL MOVES BETWEEN SHELVES, ONE AT A TIME.  HIS FLASHLIGHT
PEERS BEHIND THE STACKS OF CANNED GOODS.

A BANG ECHOES THROUGH THE BASEMENT DOOR.

Merrill and Graham are at opposite ends of the room now.

                    GRAHAM
          I can feel air.

                    MERRILL
          Me too.

THE TWO BEAMS OF LIGHT START MOVING TOWARDS EACH OTHER.

                    GRAHAM
          It's getting stronger.

                    MERRILL
          I'm close.

BANG.

THE BEAMS MOVE UP AND DOWN OVER THE FINAL WALL.  GRAHAM AND
MERRILL MOVE CLOSER AND CLOSER... THE TWO BEAMS FINALLY COME
TO A STOP IN THE SAME PLACE... THEY SHINE DOWN ON MORGAN.

HE SITS ON THE GROUND AGAINST THE WALL.  HE STARES UP AT THE
TWO LIGHTS.

                    MORGAN
          What?

IN THE BEAM OF LIGHTS YOU CAN SEE HIS HAIR MOVING GENTLY FROM
A BREEZE.

GRAHAM AND MERRILL TURN THEIR LIGHTS STRAIGHT INTO THE AIR
VENT HE'S LEANING AGAINST.

EYES ARE REVEALED IN THE DARKNESS OF THE VENT.  A NARROW SET
OF METALLIC COLORED FINGERS SHOOT OUT BETWEEN THE HOLES IN
THE VENT GRILL AND GRAB MORGAN.

MORGAN SCREAMS.  THE FLASHLIGHTS DROP TO THE GROUND.  THERE'S
A DESPERATE SCRAMBLE.  FEET MOVE THROUGH THE BEAMS OF LIGHT.

WE CAN'T SEE WHAT'S HAPPENING.

                    MERRILL (O.S.)
          Hold the vent!

SOMEONE PICKS UP A FLASHLIGHT.  WE SEE GLIMPSES OF STRAINING
FACES.  MORGAN SCREAMING.

                    GRAHAM
          Pull him!

THE FLASHLIGHT IS DROPPED AND PICKED UP AGAIN.  WE SEE IT IS
BO WHO IS HOLDING THE LIGHT.

BO TURNS THE LIGHT AT THE VENT.  MERRILL IS THE ONLY ONE
THERE.  HE PRESSES ONE OF THE TWENTY-FIVE POUND BAGS OF DOG
FOOD AGAINST THE METAL GRILL.  HE DRAGS THE SECOND BAG OVER
WITH HIS FOOT AND SLAMS IT AGAINST THE FIRST BAG.  HE QUICKLY
MOVES OUT OF THE LIGHT.

BO FOLLOWS HIM WITH THE BEAM.  SHE FINDS HIM DRAGGING AN
ENORMOUS BAG OF FLOUR OVER TO THE VENT.  HE HEAVES IT ON TOP
OF THE PILE.  HE LEAVES THE LIGHT AGAIN.  RETURNS WITH
ANOTHER GIANT BAG OF FLOUR.  GRUNTS AS HE THROWS IT ON TOP OF
THE REST.

MERRILL FALLS TO THE GROUND EXHAUSTED.  THE PILE OF DOG FOOD
AND FLOUR COMPLETELY OBSCURE THE VENT.  A CAN OF SOUP ROLLS
ON THE GROUND NEAR MERRILL.  HE SLOWLY PICKS IT UP AND PUTS
AN ADDITIONAL EIGHT OUNCES ON THE PILE.

Merrill slowly catches his breath.  He reaches over to his
side and grabs the remaining flashlight.  HE TRAINS THE BEAM
AROUND THE ROOM TILL HE FINDS MORGAN.

HE FINDS THE BOY IN GRAHAM'S LAP.  MORGAN IS SEATED WITH HIS
BACK AGAINST GRAHAM'S CHEST.  USING HIM AS A CHAIR.  MORGAN'S
FACE IS PALE.  HE IS TAKING VERY LONG SLOW HEAVES.  IT SOUNDS
LIKE THE AIR IS GOING THROUGH A STRAW.  HE'S SUFFOCATING.

GRAHAM LOOKS UP INTO THE LIGHT.

                    GRAHAM
          We don't have his medicine.

Merrill looks at his nephew turning gray.

Graham pulls Morgan closer to his body and talks into the
child's ear.

                    GRAHAM
          Don't be scared Morgan.  We'll slow
          it down together.  Feel my chest. 
          Feel it going in and out.  Breathe
          like me.  Breathe like me.

Morgan's throat is closing -- his face is filled with strain
and panic.

                    BO
          He can't breathe.

Bo moves to Merrill and curls up with him as they watch.

Graham closes his eyes.  Beat.  He opens his eyes and talks
into Morgan's ear.

                    GRAHAM
          Stay with me.  Stay with me.  I
          know it hurts.  Be strong baby...
          It'll pass.

Graham closes his eyes -- talks to the darkness.

                    GRAHAM
          Don't do this to me again.  Not
          again.

Merrill stares at his brother's desperate face.

Graham's eyes open as Morgan's tiny fingers press down on
Graham's hand.  The fingers squeeze with all the strength
they have.

Graham looks to Merrill helplessly.  Merrill's eyes fill up
with water.

Graham's eyes close.

                    GRAHAM
          I hate you.  I hate you...

Graham's eyes open as he leans in close to Morgan's ear.

                    GRAHAM
          The fear is feeding it... Don't be
          afraid of what's happening...
          Believe it's going to pass...
          Believe it... Just wait... Don't be
          afraid... The air is coming...
          Believe... We don't have to be
          afraid... It's about to pass...
          Here it comes... Don't be afraid...
          Here comes the air...

A THIN STREAM OF SOUND EMITS FROM MORGAN'S THROAT.  LIKE THE
SOUND OF AIR LEAKING FROM A BALLOON.

                    GRAHAM
          There we go... We don't have to be
          scared at all... We know it'll
          pass.  We believe it... Don't be
          afraid Morgan.

Morgan's fingers relax a little on Graham's hand.

THE LEAKING BALLOON SOUND TURNS BACK INTO THE SOUND OF AIR
THROUGH A STRAW.

Merrill watches as Graham's face stays pressed up against his
son.

                    GRAHAM
          Feel my chest... Breathe with me. 
          Together... The air is going in our
          lungs... Together... We're the
          same.  We're the same.

Merrill watches as Morgan's chest starts to move in sync with
Graham's.

THE SOUND OF THE STRAW FADES AS MORGAN'S BREATHING TURNS INTO
LABORED BREATHS.

Graham's eyes close.  He starts crying.  He speaks to no one.

                    GRAHAM
              (soft)
          I hate you.

Morgan's fingers relax on Graham's hand.  Merrill watches as
father and son breathe together.  Merrill and Bo hold each
other tight.

THE FLASHLIGHT FLICKERS ON GRAHAM AND MORGAN'S EXHAUSTED
FACES.  THEY BOTH STARE OUT INTO THE DARKNESS OF THE
BASEMENT.  TEARS DRYING ON THEIR CHEEKS.  THEY'RE BOTH LOST
IN THEIR THOUGHTS.

Beat.

                    MERRILL
          I should save the flashlights.

Beat.  Graham nods without looking over.

MERRILL PRESSES THE BUTTON ON HIS FLASHLIGHT.  THE BEAM OF
LIGHT ILLUMINATING GRAHAM AND MORGAN GOES OUT.  THEY
DISAPPEAR INTO SHADOWS.

Merrill looks down to Bo, who has the second flashlight in
her hand.  THE BEAM POINTS UP AT THE BASEMENT CEILING ABOVE
HER AND MERRILL.

Merrill nods to her.  She reaches down and presses the
button.

THE BASEMENT IS ENGULFED BY BLACK.

                                             DISSOLVE TO:

INT.  BASEMENT - MORNING

WE ARE STILL IN BLACK.  A VOICE IS HEARD IN THE DARKNESS. 
IT'S MURKY AT FIRST, THEN BECOMES CLEARER.

                    VOICE
          ... Jordan, Saudi Arabia and
          Bahrain have also confirmed.

Graham opens his eyes from sleep.  HE SQUINTS FROM THE LIGHT
OF THE HANGING BULB IN THE BASEMENT.

Merrill steps into his vision.

                    MERRILL
          I found a pack of light bulbs.

Merrill walks back to the radio on the metal shelf.  THE
VOICE WE HEARD IN THE DARKNESS COMES FROM THE TINY SPEAKER OF
THE RADIO.

                    RADIO VOICE
          ... Parts of China and Northern
          Korea are among the few remaining
          to verify withdrawals.

                    GRAHAM
          They're broadcasting...

                    MERRILL
          It came on about two hours ago. 
          Woke me up.
              (beat)
          We won Graham.

Merrill waits for his brother to say something.  Beat.

                    MERRILL
          It went on all night.  Everywhere. 
          It was completely a ground battle. 
          Mostly hand to hand.  You can't see
          them unless you're up close.  A lot
          of people died.  Some from combat. 
          But most from poison gas
          inhalation.  They secrete it.

Beat.

                    GRAHAM
          How many died?

                    MERRILL
          They think over a hundred thousand. 
          They're just estimates.
              (beat)
          But we held strong.

                    GRAHAM
          How do they know it's over?

                    MERRILL
          A mass evacuation by them started
          about eight o'clock this morning. 
          It's eleven now.
              (beat)
          They're leaving.

Beat.

                    MERRILL
          You didn't think we'd make it.

Beat.

                    GRAHAM
          No.

                    MERRILL
              (low voice)
          Listen, there's things I can take
          and a couple things I can't and one
          of them I can't take, is when my
          older brother --
              (voice cracks)
          -- who is everything I want to be,
          starts losing faith in things.  I
          saw your eyes last night.
              (beat)
          I don't want to ever see your eyes
          like that again, okay?  I'm
          serious.

Merrill's face is hard.  He looks shaken.  Graham stares at
the conviction in his younger brother's expression.

                    GRAHAM
              (soft)
          Okay.

Beat.

THERE'S A WHEEZING SOUND FROM THE CORNER OF THE ROOM.  Graham
and Merrill turn to look at Morgan -- laying down on
Merrill's folded sweater.  Morgan's breathing is strained. 
He still looks grey.

                    MERRILL
          He's been like that for awhile.  We
          need to get him some medicine.

                    GRAHAM
          Have they said anything about our
          area?

                    MERRILL
          Philadelphia and its outlying
          counties are cleared, but who knows
          for sure?

Graham looks at Morgan lying limp on the ground.  Graham
turns to Merrill.

                    GRAHAM
              (whispers)
          He's not strong enough to fight off
          another attack.

                    MERRILL
              (whispers)
          I know.
              (beat)
          We need to be sure, before we open
          that door Graham.

The two men stand under the single dangling light bulb. 
Graham quietly turns and looks at Morgan.  He moves across
the room towards him.

Merrill watches as Graham kneels down and reaches to Morgan's
side.  Graham unclips the baby monitor from his son's belt.

Graham walks back to Merrill.  He holds it out between them. 
Beat.

He turns it ON.

A SLIGHT STATIC IS HEARD.  GRAHAM TURNS THE VOLUME ALL THE
WAY UP.  THE STATIC GETS A LITTLE LOUDER, BUT DOESN'T CHANGE. 
THERE ARE NO NOISES, NO SPIKES, NO VOICES... JUST EMPTY
ELECTRICAL STATIC.  Beat.

Graham makes eye contact with Merrill.  Beat.

                    MERRILL
          That's good enough for me.

                    GRAHAM
          Me too.

                                                  CUT TO:

INT.  BASEMENT STAIRWELL - MORNING

DAYLIGHT FILTERS DOWN FROM THE KITCHEN AND PIERCES THE
STAIRWELL TO THE BASEMENT.

The basement door cracks open a few inches.  Beat.  Merrill
opens it all the way.

DUST FLOATS UP IN THE DAYLIGHT THAT SPILLS DOWN THE STAIRS.

Merrill moves up the stairs by himself.  He reaches the top
and looks around.  Turns back down to the faces at the
bottom.  Gives them the thumbs up.

Graham leads Bo up the stairs.  He carries a limp Morgan in
his arms.

                                                  CUT TO:

INT.  KITCHEN - MORNING

THE KITCHEN IS KIND OF BEAUTIFUL IN ITS DESTRUCTION.  BEAMS
OF DAYLIGHT CRISSCROSS THE ROOM FROM THE PUNCHED OUT HOLES IN
THE WINDOWS AND BOARDS.

THE BACK DOOR IS WIDE OPEN.

WE HEAR SOUNDS FROM THE TV FILTERING IN FROM THE HALL.

Graham and Bo and Morgan watch as Merrill walks over the
toppled chairs to get to the cabinets.

                    GRAHAM
          Get the syringe as well.  We might
          need to give him an epinephrine
          shot.

Merrill nods as he begins to search the piles of things that
have fallen from the cabinets.

                                                  CUT TO:

INT.  FAMILY ROOM - MORNING

SHAFTS OF SUNLIGHT STREAM IN FROM ONE SIDE OF THE FAMILY ROOM
WHERE THE WINDOWS HAVE BEEN BROKEN IN.

Graham gently lays Morgan on the sofa.

WE HEAR CHEERING COME FROM THE TELEVISION, FILTER THROUGH THE
FRONT HALL AND INTO THE FAMILY ROOM.

Bo steps out of the closet and looks into the family room.

                    BO
          People are dancing.

She points at the closet.

Morgan strains to look in her direction.  Graham looks at
him.

                    GRAHAM
          You want to see it?

Morgan nods, "yes" as he struggles to breathe.

                    GRAHAM
          I'll bring the TV in here.

                                                  CUT TO:

INT.  CLOSET - MORNING

THE TELEVISION SHOWS A SHOT OF A STREET CORNER.  THOUSANDS OF
PEOPLE STAND IN THE STREETS.  A REPORTER STANDS AMONGST THEM
AND TALKS INTO A MICROPHONE.

                    TV REPORTER
          Today there are no countries, and
          no races, and no differences -- we
          are all apart of the same --

Graham unplugs the television.  The screen goes black.

Bo moves the coats aside as Graham wheels the television and
the television cart out into the hall.

                                                  CUT TO:

INT.  FAMILY ROOM - MORNING

Graham pulls the television into the family room.  Careful
not to trip it on the carpet.

THE GLASS OF THE TELEVISION IS LIKE A MIRROR.

Graham moves the television into position.  THE BLACK SCREEN
REFLECTS THE FAMILY ROOM BEHIND GRAHAM AS IT TURNS.

THE REFLECTION OF A CREATURE SILHOUETTED PANS ACROSS THE
TELEVISION SCREEN.

The TV stops moving.  Graham stays frozen with his hands on
either side of the television cart.  He's slightly bent over. 
His back is to the family room.

Graham straightens and turns around slowly.

Morgan is held by his waist three feet in the air.  Morgan's
face turns to the color of ash as his throat closes up.

For a moment it appears he's suspended in the air.  Then we
see the outlines... and we see the eyes.  The black eyes.

There is a creature close to seven feet tall standing in the
middle of the family room.  It's powdery skin has taken on
the shades, lines and colors of the family room so perfectly,
it almost disappears.

It blinks.

Graham and Bo have turned to stone.  Bo stands frozen in the
front hall.

Merrill comes out of the doorway from the kitchen to the
family room.  He takes two steps into the room and comes to a
stop next to the fireplace.  The inhaler and syringe in his
hand fall to the ground.  The creature is between Graham and
Merrill in the middle of the family room.

Morgan is dying.  THE LAST SOUNDS OF AIR STOP IN HIS THROAT.

The lines of the chairs and windowsill mimicked on the
creature's skin move as the creature moves its free hand.

Graham's eyes shift to the hand.  THREE OF THE CREATURES
FINGERS ARE MISSING -- SLICED OFF BY A BUTCHER KNIFE.

The creature's hand moves to Morgan's face.  It tilts its
fingers and palm back.  THE COLORS ON THE HAND ARE ALREADY
CHANGING TO MATCH IT'S NEW POSITION IN THE ROOM.

A small pore opens up on its wrist.  A YELLOWISH GAS STARTS
TO LEAK OUT OF THE OPENING.

Graham looks up from the leaking poison gas to the face of
the creature.  It's large empty black eyes lock on Graham's.

GRAHAM STARTS TO HEAR A HIGH PITCH RINGING SOUND -- IT BEGINS
TO ENGULF ALL SOUND IN THE ROOM.

GRAHAM STARES HELPLESSLY INTO THE LARGE BLACK EYES.

WE MOVE INTO GRAHAM'S EYES... THEY WIDEN.  WE SEE THE EMOTION
IN THEM.  HIS MOUTH BARELY GETS THE WORDS OUT.

                    GRAHAM
              (soft)
          He's reading my --

THE HIGH PITCHED RINGING SOUND OVERWHELMS EVERYTHING.  THE
ROOM GOES BRIGHT WHITE.

                                             DISSOLVE TO:

EXT.  STREET - NIGHT

WE ARE BLINDED BY A BRIGHT LIGHT.  THE LIGHT IS MOVING.  WE
REALIZE IT IS THE HEADLIGHTS OF A CAR THAT PULLS TO THE SIDE
OF THE ROAD.

The car door opens.  Graham Hess steps out.  His coat is
open.  He is wearing a black shirt and black pants.  A
priest's white collar sits under the lapel of the black
shirt.  Graham looks around in a daze.

We are on a country road.  THERE ARE STROBING RED AND WHITE
LIGHTS FILLING THE NIGHT AIR.  Four police cars are scattered
amongst the tow trucks and the ambulances.

A large group of officers and workers hover around a green
truck that has swerved off the road into a grouping of trees.

Officer Edgar Paski walks up to Graham.  He whispers
something into a walkie clipped to his shirt as he
approaches.  Edgar looks badly shaken.  Beat.  The two men
look at each other.

                    OFFICER PASKI
          What do you know?

Graham stands motionless with his hands at his sides.  Beat.

                    GRAHAM
          There was an accident.  Drunk
          driving.  They weren't sure.

                    OFFICER PASKI
          He wasn't drinking.  Ray fell
          asleep at the wheel.

Officer Paski gestures in the direction of one of the
ambulances.  Ray Reddy sits to the side on the grass.  His
arms rest on his bent knees.

                    GRAHAM
          Is he okay?

                    OFFICER PASKI
          Yes... That's the first thing
          Colleen asked too.

Graham smiles a little smile.

                    GRAHAM
          She's talking... Which ambulance is
          she in?

Beat.

                    OFFICER PASKI
          She's not in an ambulance Father.

                    GRAHAM
          Why not?

                    OFFICER PASKI
          See Father, Ray's truck swerved off
          the road and ah... Hit Colleen and
          then a tree.  She was pinned
          between the two.

                    GRAHAM
          Pinned?  What does that mean?

Beat.

                    OFFICER PASKI
          The truck... the truck has severed
          most of her lower half.

                    GRAHAM
          What did you say?

Beat.

                    OFFICER PASKI
          She won't be saved.  At this point
          she's alive, because the truck is
          holding her together.  She doesn't
          feel much, and she's talking almost
          like normal.  We didn't pull the
          truck out, cause we wanted you to
          come down here to be with her, as
          long as she's awake.  That won't be
          very long.
              (beat)
          Father, you understand what I've
          told you?

Beat.

                    GRAHAM
          Edgar.
              (he starts crying)
          Is this the last time I'm going to
          talk to my wife?

Beat.

                    OFFICER PASKI
          Yes it is.

                                                  CUT TO:

EXT.  STREET - NIGHT

The other officers turn and look as Graham walks by them.  He
walks on, unaware of the stares.

He slows as he reaches the back bumper of the truck.  It
sticks out onto the road a few feet.  He comes around the
side of the vehicle.

COLLEEN HESS is beautiful in a delicate way.  Her straight
brown hair falls down over her small face.  She leans over
the front bumper of the truck onto the hood.  Her head rests
on her arms like a child resting on a school desk.  Her back
is against a tree.  The lower half of her is obscured by the
truck.

She's able to raise her head and shoulders as Graham walks up
to her.  She is shivering slightly.

                    COLLEEN
              (soft)
          Hi sweetie.

                    GRAHAM
          Hi baby.

Graham glances down.  There are bundles of blood soaked
blankets in the area below her.  They peek out under the
twisted front of the truck.  Graham looks up quickly.

                    COLLEEN
          I was just taking a walk before
          dinner.

                    GRAHAM
          You love walks.

Beat.

                    COLLEEN
          I guess it was meant to be.

Beat.

                    GRAHAM
          Does it hurt?

                    COLLEEN
          I don't feel much.

                    GRAHAM
          Good.

Graham touches her cheek.  She starts crying.  Graham starts
crying with her.

                    COLLEEN
              (crying)
          ... Tell Morgan to play games --
          it's okay to be silly.

                    GRAHAM
              (crying)
          ... I will.

                    COLLEEN
              (crying)
          ... Tell Bo to listen to her
          brother.  He'll always take care of
          her.

                    GRAHAM
              (crying)
          ... I will.

                    COLLEEN
              (crying)
          ... Tell Graham --

                    GRAHAM
              (crying)
          I'm here.

                    COLLEEN
              (crying)
          Tell him... See.  Tell him to see.

Colleen presses her cheek on top of Graham's hand.  She rests
on it.  Her eyes are distant.

                    COLLEEN
              (soft)
          And tell Merrill to swing away.

                    GRAHAM
              (soft)
          What?
              (beat)
          Colleen?... Colleen?

WE ARE OVERCOME BY A BRIGHT WHITE.

                                                  CUT TO:

INT.  FAMILY ROOM - MORNING

WE ARE IN THE FAMILY ROOM.  THE HIGH PITCHED RINGING SOUNDS
FADE AND ARE REPLACED BY THE BREATHING IN THE ROOM.

THE BREATHING IS JOINED BY THE HISSING OF GAS AS IT'S BEING
RELEASED.

THE CREATURE FORCES POISON GAS OUT INTO MORGAN'S UNCONSCIOUS
FACE.

THE ROOM IS ENGULFED WITH STREAMS OF SUNLIGHT FROM THE BROKEN
WINDOWS.  THE LIGHT SEEMS TO CATCH CERTAIN THINGS IN THE ROOM
AND MAKE THEM STAND OUT.  THINGS ON SHELVES, THINGS ON
TABLES, THINGS ON THE WALL.

Graham stares at the baseball bat on the wall.  Beat.

                    GRAHAM
              (soft)
          Swing away, Merrill.

Morgan's face is obscured by gas.

                    GRAHAM
              (loud)
          Merrill.

Merrill turns and looks to Graham.

                    GRAHAM
          Swing away.

Graham's eyes are not on Merrill.  Merrill follows his eye
line to the baseball bat mounted above him.

Beat.  Merrill reaches up and takes the bat off its resting
place.

The creature starts to move.

Merrill's hands tighten around the handle as he walks
forward.  He stops.  His weight shifts to his right leg.

The creature begins to turn and becomes more visible as its
lines and colors don't match in position in the room.

Merrill's left leg goes out.  His torso and shoulders turn
with staggering speed and strength.  The bat slices through
the air of the family room... Contact.

The creature gets HAMMERED across the back with the baseball
bat.

Morgan is dropped.  He falls to the carpet of the family room
in an unnatural crumpled pile.  His arms and legs flop
lifelessly to the carpet.

The creature turns to face Merrill.  All the creature sees is
the BLUR OF WOOD as Merrill swings like a lumberjack.  SLAM. 
The creature falls to the ground.

Graham takes Bo by the hand and moves to Morgan.  Graham
picks up his son's limp body in his arms.

The creature moves to its feet.

Merrill's hands choke up on the bat.  Merrill's eyes are on
fire.

Graham leans down and picks up the full syringe of medicine
on the ground.

Merrill SCREAMS as he swings again.  His powerful muscles
pull his shoulders whipping around.  The bat connects with
the creature across its chest.  The creature is thrown back
into the wall.  Two glass of water fall off a shelf and CRASH
ONTO THE CREATURE'S SHOULDER.  The water connects with it's
skin.  The creature makes a HIGH PITCHED INHALE SOUND.

Bo and Graham look up.

THE CREATURE'S SHOULDER STOPS CHANGING COLORS AND WITHERS
INTO A POWDERY WHITE.

Merrill looks back across the room at Bo and Graham.  They
stare at each other with sudden realization.

Merrill looks around at Bo's half-filled water glasses places
all over the family room.

                                                  CUT TO:

INT.  KITCHEN - MORNING

Graham carries Morgan through the kitchen and out the back
door.  Morgan's arms and legs swing limp as Graham walks.

Morgan's head bobs back from its own weight as Graham steps
outside.

                                                  CUT TO:

INT.  FAMILY ROOM - MORNING

Merrill steps in.  THE WOODEN BAT MAKES A SOUND AS IT CUTS
THROUGH THE AIR.  SLAM!  It connects with the creature.  The
creature falls back into the coffee table.  Bo's glasses of
water crack and SPLASH OVER the creature's TORSO.  ANOTHER
HIGH PITCHED INHALE SCREAM.  His torso turns a powdery white. 
Parts of its body are still changing and matching its
environment.  Parts are white.

The creature stands again.

Merrill looks for the next target in the room.  Bo points to
the dinning table where the old chicken teriyaki, bacon
cheeseburger and spaghetti with meatballs sit untouched.

Merrill sees the three glasses of water at Bo's seat.  He
nods.

                                                  CUT TO:

INT.  FAMILY ROOM - MORNING

MERRILL YELLS WITH EVERYTHING IN HIS LUNGS.  His wrists turn. 
His shoulders torque.  THE WOODEN LOUISVILLE SLUGGER SLICES
THE AIR AND SHATTERS WHEN IT CONNECTS WITH THE UPPER CHEST OF
THE CREATURE.  PIECES OF WOOD SPLINTER OVER THE FAMILY ROOM.

THE CREATURE WAVERS AND THEN ALL SEVEN FEET OF IT TIPS OVER. 
IT FALLS BACK.  IT CLIPS THE TV STAND AS IT FALLS.  IT LANDS
ON THE GROUND WITH A THUD.

THE CREATURE'S BLACK, EMPTY EYES LOOK UP IN TIME TO SEE BO'S
GLASSES OF WATER RESTING ON THE TELEVISION, FALL... AND SPILL
OVER THE EDGE -- RIGHT ONTO ITS FACE.

THE CREATURE'S SCREAMS FILL THE FAMILY ROOM -- AND THEN
SUDDENLY STOP.

IT BECOMES VERY STILL.  EVERY INCH OF ITS BODY TURNS A
WITHERED, POWDERY WHITE.  BEAT.

Bo watches quietly from the door.  Merrill drops the handle
of the bat in his hands.

                                                  CUT TO:

EXT.  BACKYARD - MORNING

Merrill and Bo find Graham kneeling in the grass.  Morgan
lays limp in his arms.  They kneel down in the grass with
him.

Merrill sees the empty syringe in Graham's hand.  He looks to
Morgan.  The boy's head is tilted back.  His tiny mouth hangs
open unnaturally.

                    GRAHAM
          His lungs were closed.
              (beat)
          His lungs were closed.  No poison
          got in... No poison got in.

Merrill stares at Morgan.  His body is utterly still.

                    GRAHAM
          His lungs were closed.

Merrill reaches for Morgan's still hand.

                    GRAHAM
          Don't touch him.

                    MERRILL
              (soft)
          Graham.

Beat.  Morgan lies lifeless.

                    BO
          Daddy.

                    GRAHAM
          Don't touch him.

Bo is crying.

                    MERRILL
          Graham.

                    GRAHAM
          Don't.

Beat.

                    MORGAN'S VOICE
          Dad.

HIS SON'S VOICE MAKES HIM STOP.  Graham starts crying.  Every
bit of sadness trapped in his body is released.  He looks
down through tears and tears at Morgan.

                    MORGAN
          Did someone save me?

                    GRAHAM
          Yeah baby.  I think someone did.

                                                  CUT TO:

INT.  WINDOW - MORNING

We look out through the broken glass of the second story
bedroom window.  We see the worn jungle gym.  We see the
single tree throwing shade on the picnic table.  We see the
golden brown corn lining the back of the yard.

And we see the Hess family.  Sitting together on the grass. 
Huddled together in the sunlight.

                                           FADE TO BLACK.

	----------------------------------------------------------------
	
	FADE IN:
	
	ON BRIGHT, OUT-OF-FOCUS, OVAL-SHAPED COLORS.
	
	The colored shapes dart around the screen -- the impression
	of looking through a kaleidoscope.
	
	As the image comes into sharp focus, we discover that we are
	inside a CANDY BOWL.  A MAN'S FINGERS are frantically
	removing all the cherry-flavored pieces of candy.
	
	EXT.  STUDIO LOT - DAY
	
	The man performing this curious task is
	writer/producer/director, VIKTOR TARANSKY, forties,
	conservatively dressed in suit and tie.  He sits alone at an
	empty craft service table outside a cavernous soundstage,
	some distance from the rest of the film set -- a breeze blows
	the table's paper cloth.
	
	Viktor finishes sorting.  Finding no trash can to deposit the
	rejected cherry candy, he scoops them into his pocket.
	
	A young headset-clad P.A. hurriedly approaches.  He looks
	ill.
	
	                    P.A.
	          Mr. Taransky --
	
	Viktor reads the young P.A.'s panicked expression.
	
	                    VIKTOR
	          She's walking?... Don't tell me
	          she's walking.
	              (blood slowly draining
	               from his face)
	          She is not walking... She can't
	          walk.
	
	EXT.  TRAILER - DAY
	
	NICOLA ANDERS, twenty-something, A-list actress, beautiful
	face scowling, is supervising her ASSISTANT ferrying clothes
	from a movie trailer to a limousine.  VIKTOR desperately
	follows after Nicola.
	
	                    VIKTOR
	          -- Nicola!  How was your massage?
	
	                    NICOLA
	          You're in breach.
	
	                    VIKTOR
	          -- Is this about the new pages? --
	          I made the changes you wanted,
	          you're in virtually every scene --
	
	                    NICOLA
	              (wheeling on him)
	          It's not the size of the role,
	          Viktor.
	              (suddenly very cool)
	          Am I or am I not contractually
	          entitled to the biggest trailer on
	          the set?
	
	                    VIKTOR
	              (regarding the enormous
	               silver fish behind them,
	               confused)
	          It's the biggest on earth!  I
	          swear!  It's a 50-foot Airstream --
	          they don't make them any longer
	          than that.
	
	                    NICOLA
	          Taller, Viktor.
	
	                    VIKTOR
	          Taller?  What?
	
	Viktor looks up in horror.  The trailer next to Nicola's does
	indeed appear to be fractionally taller.
	
	                    NICOLA
	              (walking away)
	          You've insulted me for the last
	          time.
	
	Viktor looks to the tires.  His face suddenly brightens.
	
	                    VIKTOR
	          Nicola, it's just the tires --
	          they're over-inflated!  I can fix
	          it!
	
	Viktor grasps the air nozzle on a tire and begins desperately
	stabbing at it with a ballpoint pen.  Air hisses out.
	
	                    VIKTOR
	          See, it's lower already.
	
	Nicola ignores Viktor, marching towards her limo with her
	PUBLICIST.  Abandoning the trailer, Viktor hurries after her.
	
	                    VIKTOR
	          I beg you.  You can't do this to
	          me.
	
	                    NICOLA
	              (looking back)
	          I had three other offers.  I only
	          signed on to this picture out of...
	          loyalty.
	
	                    VIKTOR
	          Then show some.  They'll shut me
	          down!
	
	                    NICOLA
	              (opening the car door)
	          It wasn't working anyhow.  The
	          scene with the thousand geese -- I
	          don't understand this film.  I
	          don't think anyone will understand
	          it.  I already put out a press
	          release -- citing "creative
	          differences".
	
	Viktor stops, nods resignedly -- suddenly very calm.
	
	                    VIKTOR
	          You know what, Nicola, you're
	          right.
	              (picking up her last piece
	               of luggage)
	          Here, let me help you with that.
	              (holding the door for her)
	          You ought to go.  The truth is I
	          don't deserve you.  This film
	          doesn't deserve you.  Frankly, it
	          deserves much, much better.  The
	          reason it's not working is because
	          you're not about the work.
	
	Nicola is stunned.
	
	                    VIKTOR
	              (to the limo driver)
	          To Hell, please.
	
	The door slams and the limo roars away.  Viktor looks to the
	still hissing trailer tire.  The CREW regards Viktor
	apprehensively.
	
	                    VIKTOR
	              (to the crew)
	          What are you looking at?  Get back
	          to work.
	
	The crew is uncertain what work there is to do.
	
	INT.  BEDROOM - "SUNRISE, SUNSET" - NIGHT
	
	In an ornate bedroom, NICOLA lies on her death bed under a
	veil of netting.  A distraught man, HAL, sits close by.
	
	                    NICOLA
	              (whispered)
	          Jack... are you there?
	
	                    HAL
	          I'm here.  I'm right beside you.
	
	A NUN enters.
	
	                    NUN
	              (to Hal)
	          You should really go now.
	
	                    NICOLA
	          No, it's alright.  Please, let him
	          stay.
	
	The nun withdraws.  Hal holds his face in his hands, almost
	breaking down.
	
	                    HAL
	              (a glance to heaven)
	          What kind of cruel God is it that
	          would take you away from me?
	
	                    NICOLA
	          The same one who brought me to you.
	
	                    HAL
	          No... I cannot accept it.  If
	          something like this can happen. 
	          What...
	              (struggling to find the
	               words)
	          What is it for?
	
	                    NICOLA
	              (smiles through her pain)
	          -- Why are we here?  Is that what
	          you're asking, Jack?... Why are we
	          here?  No why.  Just here.
	
	Nicola dies peacefully.
	
	INT.  SCREENING ROOM - STUDIO - DAY
	
	VIKTOR sits with leading man HAL, THREE EXECUTIVES and studio
	head ELAINE CHRISTIAN, watching a rough assembly of the film. 
	It ends with a close up of NICOLA ANDERS.
	
	The lights go up.  The image of Nicola fades off the screen.
	
	                    EXECUTIVE 1
	          She's good.  You can hardly tell
	          she's reading off a teleprompter.
	
	                    VIKTOR
	              (ignoring him)
	          I've analyzed the footage.  We've
	          got almost everything we need in
	          the can.  If we rework the script,
	          we can finish the film without her.
	
	                    EXECUTIVE 2
	              (forceful shake of the
	               head)
	          According to the writ her attorneys
	          filed at noon today.  They'll sue
	          if the film is released with Nicola
	          in a single frame.
	
	                    VIKTOR
	              (more anxious)
	          So we'll re-cast.
	
	                    HAL
	          Nicola Anders is the only actress
	          who can play that role.
	
	                    VIKTOR
	              (incredulous)
	          It's a re-make, Hal.  Anders is not
	          bigger than this picture.
	
	Elaine finally speaks up.
	
	                    ELAINE
	          Of course she is.  No other name is
	          going to sign on now and risk
	          offending her.
	
	                    VIKTOR
	          We don't need a name.  We'll cast
	          an unknown.
	
	                    HAL
	          I won't play opposite an unknown.
	
	                    ELAINE
	          We can't sell an unknown.  Nicola's
	          soured on the project and we have
	          to accept that.  If we ever want to
	          be in the Nicola Anders business
	          again, we have to cut our losses
	          and shelve the picture.
	
	The executives, leading man and director nod sagely.
	
	                    VIKTOR
	              (aghast)
	          No!  You will not give in to that
	          blackmailing bitch!
	
	                    ELAINE
	              (a wince, addressing
	               everyone but Viktor)
	          Excuse us.
	
	Elaine ushers Viktor out of the screening room.
	
	EXT.  STUDIO LOT - DAY
	
	ELAINE and VIKTOR talk in the shadow of an enormous
	soundstage.  They speak more freely in each other's company.
	
	                    ELAINE
	          God, Viktor.  Why do you always
	          have to make things so difficult
	          for yourself?
	
	                    VIKTOR
	          Difficult.  I'm difficult.
	
	He produces a handful of candy from his pocket.
	
	                    VIKTOR
	              (referring to the candy)
	          -- Do you know what these are,
	          Elaine?
	
	                    ELAINE
	              (talking a piece of candy
	               and eating it)
	          Hmm... Mike and Ike's.
	
	                    VIKTOR
	          Not just any Mike & Ike's -- cherry
	          Mike & Ike's.  Do you know why I,
	          Viktor Taransky, two-time Academy
	          Award nominated director --
	
	                    ELAINE
	          -- Viktor, that was Short Subject.
	
	                    VIKTOR
	          -- overseeing the most cherished
	          movie project of my career, am
	          walking around with a pocketful of
	          cherry Mike & Ike's?
	
	Elaine takes a seat in a nearby studio cart as Viktor paces.
	
	                    ELAINE
	          -- I have a feeling you're going to
	          tell me.
	
	                    VIKTOR
	          -- I'll tell you why.  It is
	          because Miss Nicola Anders,
	          supermodel with a SAG card God's
	          gift to cinema, has it written into
	          her contract that all cherry Mike &
	          Ike's be removed from her candy
	          dish along with strict instructions
	          that any room she walks into should
	          have seven packs of cigarettes
	          waiting for her three of them
	          opened, that there be a personal
	          jacuzzi within eighty paces of her
	          dressing room, and that any time
	          she travels, her nanny must fly
	          with her first class.
	
	                    ELAINE
	          -- What's wrong with that?
	
	                    VIKTOR
	          Elaine, she doesn't have any
	          children!
	              (grabbing her arm)
	          Don't you see?  We're being held
	          hostage by 12 men and 5 women who
	          someone somewhere has decreed are
	          the A-list.
	
	                    ELAINE
	          The public decides who's on that
	          list.
	
	                    VIKTOR
	          Please.
	
	                    ELAINE
	          It's the truth.  Those 17
	          superstars are our insurance
	          policy.  We can't open -- can't
	          make a profit without them.
	
	                    VIKTOR
	          We can hardly make a profit with
	          them.  Up-front salary, back-end
	          deal, perks, per diem, percentages 
	          -- They're mocking us, Elaine. 
	          We're at their mercy.
	              (staring wistful, into
	               space)
	          We always had movie stars but they
	          used to be our stars.  We used to
	          decide who would play what role. 
	          We told them what to wear, what to
	          say, who to date.  When they were
	          under contract, we could change
	          their names if we wanted to -- more
	          than once!
	
	                    ELAINE
	              (regarding him as if he's
	               insane)
	          You realize you're nostalgic for an
	          era you weren't even born in?
	
	                    VIKTOR
	              (irritated at her
	               infuriating logic)
	          Well, I do remember why I started
	          out in this business -- you seem to
	          have forgotten -- working in New
	          York with Cassevetes -- we were
	          trying to do something important,
	          shine a light in that darkened
	          cinema --
	
	                    ELAINE
	              (rolling her eyes)
	          -- It's called a projector.
	
	                    VIKTOR
	              (ignoring her)
	          -- Illuminate hearts and minds with
	          a ray of truth.
	
	                    ELAINE
	          Listen, Viktor, I have good
	          memories of those days too -- but
	          this isn't about that or you or me
	          or some high-minded ideal.  This is
	          business.
	
	                    VIKTOR
	          Spare me.
	
	                    ELAINE
	              (gesturing at the studio
	               lot)
	          -- Christ, Viktor, look around. 
	          What do you think pays for all
	          this?  This is about investment and
	          return.  Those days in New York...
	          that's... it's over.
	
	A pause.  Viktor reads Elaine's face.
	
	                    VIKTOR
	          You're not renewing my contract.
	
	                    ELAINE
	          How can I?  Your last three
	          pictures tanked.  The board is
	          giving me hell.  No bankable star
	          will work with you after this.  If
	          you just compromised... a little.
	
	Viktor eats some of the candy in his hand as he takes in the
	news.
	
	                    VIKTOR
	              (rueful smile)
	          -- Well, it's not every day you're
	          fired by the mother of your own
	          child.
	
	Elaine also eats some more candy -- a curiously intimate
	moment between them.
	
	                    ELAINE
	              (softening, a heart-to
	               heart)
	          I'm not taking away your daughter,
	          just your deal.  You and I both
	          know, after the divorce I kept you
	          on for old time's sake, so you
	          could still hold your head up in
	          front of Lainey.  I called what's
	          his name at Warner's.  He said he'd
	          take a meeting -- in July.  I've
	          fought for you Viktor...
	              (voice trails off)
	          You want to talk severance?
	
	                    VIKTOR
	              (staring off into the
	               distance, face hardening)
	          You can have everything -- office,
	          car, assistants -- all I want is
	          the picture.
	
	                    ELAINE
	              (confused)
	          The picture's dead.
	
	                    VIKTOR
	          So there's no problem -- I can have
	          the rights, the negative too?
	
	                    ELAINE
	              (believing she's getting
	               off lightly)
	          They're yours.  But how are you
	          going to finish it?  Without a star
	          there's no movie.
	
	                    VIKTOR
	          I don't need a star.  All I need is
	          an actor -- I'll reshoot the part,
	          cut out Nicola and replace her with
	          a real actor.  A real leading lady.
	
	                    ELAINE
	          Even if you find her, you know the
	          problem with unknowns, Viktor.  If
	          they're good, they get known.  And
	          then you're back to sorting their
	          candy... and worse.
	              (kissing him on the cheek
	               as she departs in her
	               studio golf cart)
	          I'm sorry, Viktor.
	
	Viktor watches her depart down the canyon of stages, left
	alone on the deserted lot.
	
	EXT.  STUDIO ENTRANCE - DUSK
	
	Twenty NICOLA ANDERS' FACES jiggle into frame.  VIKTOR's face
	appears amongst them.
	
	They are cardboard figures, standing together in the trailer
	of an electric cart.  A WORKMAN is collecting the promotional
	standees from around the lot.
	
	VIKTOR places his hands on the neck of a cardboard cut-out --
	we sense he is about to rip her head off -- when a fourteen
	year old girl, LAINEY, appears beside him, carrying a laptop
	computer.
	
	                    LAINEY
	          Hi, Dad.
	
	                    VIKTOR
	              (slightly ashamed)
	          Hello, sweetheart.
	
	Viktor, embarrassed by his childishness, steps aside for the
	suspicious workman who carries the standee away.
	
	Lainey smiles sweetly.  She hugs him.
	
	                    LAINEY
	          I'm sorry Mom canned you.
	
	                    VIKTOR
	              (shrugging)
	          It's really... not anything,
	          Lainey.  It's just --
	
	                    LAINEY
	          Don't feel too bad.
	              (glancing to a standee)
	          Mom runs the place and they still
	          walk all over her.  You're better
	          off out of it.
	
	                    VIKTOR
	              (regarding his daughter)
	          You look very grown up.  What are
	          you doing?  You meeting your mom
	          for dinner?
	
	She glances towards the entrance where Lainey's mother,
	ELAINE, and her dependable, uncomplicated businessman
	boyfriend, KENT, wait beside Elaine's car.
	
	                    LAINEY
	              (reluctant admission)
	          Kent got tickets to the ballet.
	
	Viktor shakes the idea of Kent and Elaine from his head.
	
	                    VIKTOR
	              (trying to convince
	               himself as much as
	               Lainey)
	          I'm going to finish the picture,
	          sweetheart.  It's important.
	
	                    LAINEY
	              (not quite convinced)
	          I know you'll do it, Dad.  You're
	          Viktor Taransky.
	
	Lainey kisses the forlorn Viktor goodbye.  She runs to her
	mother and Kent.
	
	                    VIKTOR
	              (to himself)
	          That's right.  I'm Viktor Taransky.
	
	EXT.  STUDIO BUILDING - SOME DISTANCE AWAY - DUSK
	
	From a distance ELAINE and KENT regard the lonely figure of
	VIKTOR.
	
	                    KENT
	          You had no choice, Elaine.  He's a
	          liability.
	
	                    ELAINE
	              (wistful look to Viktor)
	          He also happens to be the most
	          talented man I've ever known.
	
	Elaine climbs in the car as Lainey approaches.
	
	EXT.  STUDIO BACKLOT - TRAM - DAY
	
	CLOSE UP on a copy of "Variety".  The front page banner
	headline: "ANDERS RIDES OUT OF 'SUNSET' -- Cites Creative
	Differences"
	
	The man reading the trade paper sits in the back of a tram on
	a studio tour -- HANK ALENO.  He wears a pair of spectacles
	with one lens blacked out, his head tilted on one side.  It
	is an item buried on the inside pages that catches Hank's one
	good eye.

	The tram pauses.  The TOUR GUIDE keeps up a commentary.

	          Claris Commodore uttered those now
	          immortal words, "If that door
	          doesn't hold, stand behind me". 
	          And coming up on your right --
	
	When the tram departs, we discover that Hank has exited the
	tram and is hiding in the facade of a New York subway
	entrance.  The tag around his neck reads, "VISITOR -- Stay
	With The Tour".
	
	EXT.  STUDIO GATE - NIGHT
	
	VIKTOR wheels a stack of film cans on a dolly while holding
	several framed black and white photographs of screen legends
	under his arm.
	
	HANK, hiding in the shadows of the soundstages, spies Viktor.
	He hurries towards him as Viktor approaches his antiquated
	Bentley.
	
	                    HANK
	          -- Mr. Taransky, Mr. Taransky...

	          you, calling -- Your assistant
	          wouldn't put me through.  I told
	          her it was a matter of life and

	          to you in time --
	
	                    VIKTOR
	              (using his stack of film
	               cans as a barrier)
	          -- Please, get away from me.
	
	                    HANK
	          I did it, Mr. Taransky.  I licked
	          skin.  I licked hair.  I licked
	          every part of her.
	
	                    VIKTOR
	              (more disturbed, fearing
	               he is dealing with a
	               pervert)
	          You want me to call Security?
	
	                    HANK
	          I have her, Mr. Taransky.  The
	          answer to your prayers.
	              (producing the "Variety"
	               article, conspiratorial)
	          The answer to this.
	
	                    VIKTOR
	              (regarding the article)
	          I was misquoted.
	
	                    HANK
	          I have your new leading lady...
	              (indicating the bulge in
	               his pocket)
	          ... right here in my pants.
	
	Viktor takes a step back, concerned once again about the
	man's motives.
	
	                    HANK
	              (trying to reassure)
	          It's me, Mr. Taransky.  Don't you
	          recognize me? -- The Future of
	          Film conference in San Jose. 
	          Hank... Hank Aleno.  I was keynote
	          speaker.  You must remember my
	          speech... "Who Needs Humans?"
	
	                    VIKTOR
	              (faint glimmer of
	               recognition)
	          That's right.  You were booed off
	          the stage.  That's got to be -- ?
	
	                    HANK
	          -- Eight years ago.  In that whole
	          time, I never left my computer.
	
	                    VIKTOR
	              (wary)
	          Good for you, Hank.
	
	                    HANK
	              (referring to his covered
	               eye)

	                    HANK
	          Don't be.  It was worth it.
	
	Hank once again indicated the bulge in his pocket.  Viktor
	now understands the significance of the gesture.
	
	                    HANK
	          You have to see her.

	              (loading cans into the

	          I've seen them all before.
	
	                    HANK
	          Not like this --
	
	                    VIKTOR
	              (patronizing smile)

	                    HANK
	          -- Flesh is weak.

	              (pointing to Nicola in
	               Variety)
	          You already do.  But my actor won't

	          That's the point, Hank.  No matter
	          how good they are, they're still
	          Mickey Mouse.  Everyone's tried. 
	          Everyone's failed.  It can't be
	          done.
	
	                    HANK
	          It can -- with my new computer
	          code, you and me, we can do it
	          together.
	
	                    VIKTOR
	          I don't know anything about
	          computers.
	
	                    HANK
	          That's why you're so perfect.  You
	          have something I don't have.
	
	                    VIKTOR
	          What's that?
	
	                    HANK
	          An eye -- for performance.  You
	          know the truth when you see it.  I
	          know.  I've seen your movies.  I
	          love your movies.
	
	                    VIKTOR
	          You do?

	                    VIKTOR
	          You saw that?
	
	                    HANK
	          I've seen every frame of your work. 
	          You're the only filmmaker in
	          Hollywood with the artistic
	          integrity to realize my vision. 
	          You and me, art and science... we
	          are the perfect marriage.
	
	                    VIKTOR
	          Listen, Hank, it's been a rough
	          day.
	              (climbing into his car)
	          I'll call you about his next week.
	
	                    HANK
	              (at the car window)
	          I won't be here next week.  The
	          tumor's inoperable.  I'll be dead.
	
	                    VIKTOR
	              (winding down the window)
	          I'm already dead.
	
	Viktor's car roars away.  He looks back at the forlorn Hank
	in the rear view mirror.
	
	                    HANK
	          Call me.
	              (looking at his watch)
	          This week!
	
	A huge eye from a dismantled Nicola Anders billboard is
	wheeled away behind him -- followed by a huge pair of lips.
	
	INT.  VIKTOR'S MALIBU HOUSE - DAY
	
	A sea of ingenue headshots.  Black X's are drawn through all
	of them.  VIKTOR lies amongst the rejected faces, talking on
	the telephone, in his spartan bachelor beach house.
	
	                    VIKTOR
	              (into phone, referring to
	               a young woman's headshot)
	          -- What do you mean she won't work
	          with me?  She's done nothing.  She
	          doesn't have a single credit --
	
	                    AGENT'S VOICE
	              (from phone, off-camera)
	          -- Better no credits than a
	          Taransky credit.  No young actress
	          is going to step into Nicola
	          Anders' shoes and risk ending her
	          career before it's even started.
	
	                    VIKTOR
	          -- Art, you don't understand.  I've
	          mortgaged everything to finish this
	          film -- creditors calling, coming
	          to the house, for God's sake, I
	          need this --
	
	The phone goes dead.  Viktor tries to re-dial --
	disconnected.
	
	                    VIKTOR
	          -- Damn.
	
	Sharp knock on his door.  Viktor peers through a curtain and
	spies an official-looking MAN IN A SUIT, carrying what looks
	to be a legal notice in his hands.
	
	Viktor slips out of the back door.
	
	EXT.  BEACH - DAY
	
	VIKTOR hurries along the beach.  When he turns, he discovers
	the MAN IN THE SUIT following him.  As Viktor runs, the Suit
	runs -- calling out to him.
	
	                    MAN IN THE SUIT
	          Mr. Taransky, Mr. Taransky --
	
	                    VIKTOR
	              (calling back)
	          I'm not him.
	
	Viktor stumbles.  When he recovers, the Suit is on him.
	
	                    MAN IN THE SUIT
	          Mr. Taransky, Sir, I represent the
	          estate of Mr. Hank Aleno.
	              (showing him Hank's
	               obituary in the L.A. 
	               Times)
	          It was Mr. Aleno's last wish that
	          you have this.
	
	The Suit hands Viktor a heavily-sealed envelope.
	
	                    VIKTOR
	          What is it?
	
	                    MAN IN THE SUIT
	          I have no idea, Sir.  He wanted you
	          to have it.
	
	The Suit departs.  Viktor hesitates, then breaks the seal on
	the package -- inside he finds a hard-drive.  The hard-drive
	is labeled "SIMULATION ONE".
	
	A TITLE APPEARS ON THE SCREEN:
	
	                      SIX MONTHS LATER
	
	CLOSE UP ON
	
	a VACUUM CLEANER cleaning a tatty red carpet.
	
	On the other end of the vacuum cleaner is VIKTOR.  The red
	carpet leads to a rundown, downtown Los Angeles cinema -- the
	venue for the premiere of "SUNRISE, SUNSET".  To save money
	on posters, Viktor has altered the originals, "Starring
	NICOLA ANDERS" crudely pasted over with "Introducing SIMONE".
	
	EXT.  RUNDOWN DOWNTOWN CINEMA - DUSK
	
	VIKTOR regards the sad, little premiere.  No paparazzi, no
	limos, no klieg lights.  Resorting to giving away tickets to
	PASSERS-BY, Viktor approaches a HOMELESS MAN sleeping in
	trash.
	
	                    VIKTOR
	          Want to see a free movie?
	
	                    HOMELESS MAN
	              (he thinks)
	          No.
	
	A taxi pulls up.  Viktor's daughter, LAINEY, steps out.
	
	                    LAINEY
	              (kissing him hello)
	          Hi, Dad.
	
	                    VIKTOR
	          Hello, Lainey.
	
	Viktor goes to pay for the taxi but doesn't have quite enough
	cash.  Lainey pays herself.
	
	                    VIKTOR
	          Your mother couldn't make it?
	
	                    LAINEY
	          She's at the premiere of "A Cold
	          Day In Hell".  But I think she send
	          someone from Acquisitions.
	
	                    VIKTOR
	          She still with Kent?
	
	                    LAINEY
	          This week anyhow.
	
	VIKTOR escorts Lainey down the empty red carpet, regarding
	the pathetic premiere.  As they walk by, the bulb in Viktor's
	sole spotlight expires.
	
	                    VIKTOR
	          Not quite how I imagined it --
	
	                    LAINEY
	              (looking on the bright
	               side)
	          -- You finished the film on your
	          own terms, that's what matters. 
	          Did you really do all the post
	          yourself?
	
	                    VIKTOR
	          There was no other way.
	
	                    LAINEY
	          I missed you.  I wondered if you
	          were ever coming back.
	
	                    VIKTOR
	          Me too.
	
	                    LAINEY
	              (regarding the makeshift
	               poster, trying to lift
	               his spirits)
	          Well, I can't wait to meet
	          Simone... what's her last name?
	
	                    VIKTOR
	          You know, I... don't know.
	
	                    LAINEY
	          Is she here tonight?
	
	                    VIKTOR
	          She can't watch herself.
	
	They are interrupted by the THEATER OWNER.
	
	                    THEATER OWNER
	          -- Hey, we have to start.  I've got
	          "Tough Love 2" playing at ten.
	
	EXT.  PIER - "SUNRISE, SUNSET" - MORNING
	
	A foggy, empty pier.  A MAN is running through the mist,
	shouting desperately.
	
	                    HAL
	          Valarie!  VALARIE!
	
	Finally, out of the fog -- a young woman in a black cape and
	hood, her back to us.  The camera pushes in, music swells and
	she turns.  SIMONE.  She is exquisitely, ethereally
	beautiful.  Perfect.
	
	INT.  RUNDOWN DOWNTOWN CINEMA - AUDITORIUM - NIGHT
	
	In the near-empty, dilapidated theater, "SUNRISE, SUNSET" is
	playing ON THE SCREEN.
	
	When Simone's face appears, the faces of the AUDIENCE MEMBERS
	change.  They are all visibly moved, including the THEATER
	OWNER.  Some weeping, some with curious smiles on their
	faces, some opened-mouthed.
	
	                    HAL
	              (ON SCREEN, approaching)
	          Valarie, what are you running from?
	
	                    SIMONE
	              (enigmatic smile)
	          From Valarie.
	
	Suddenly a GUNSHOT rings out.  Simone collapses to the
	ground.
	
	                    HAL
	              (running to her)
	          Valarie!  No!
	
	INT.  THEATER LOBBY - NIGHT
	
	VIKTOR, unable to watch, paces up and down, chain-smoking
	while worriedly shoving popcorn in his mouth.  Viktor finally
	musters the courage to look inside the auditorium.
	
	INT.  BEDROOM - "SUNRISE, SUNSET" - NIGHT
	
	The same scene that played in the studio screening room. 
	However now when we cut from the leading man, HAL, to the
	leading lady it is not NICOLA but the newly cast SIMONE.
	
	                    SIMONE
	          -- Why are we here?  Is that what
	          you're asking, Jack?... Why are we
	          here?  No why.  Just here.
	
	INT.  AUDITORIUM - NIGHT
	
	ON SCREEN SIMONE lies dying.  Now even LAINEY is affected by
	Simone's performance.  She wipes a tear from her eye.
	
	VIKTOR watches the backs of the heads, trying to gauge the
	audience reaction.  Finally the credits roll.
	
	A dedication, "For HANK".
	
	No one moves from their seats.  Viktor permits himself a
	brief smile of satisfaction as he sees his name appear in the
	credits:
	
	                 A Film By VIKTOR TARANSKY
	
	Still no one moves from their seats.  Viktor cannot stand it
	any longer.  He runs to the restroom.
	
	INT.  THEATER RESTROOM - NIGHT
	
	Face over the stained sink, VIKTOR splashes himself with
	water.  He looks to the mirror, horrified by his own
	reflection.  He rehearses a courtroom speech.
	
	                    VIKTOR
	          Ladies and gentlemen of the jury, I
	          may be guilty of a crime, but it
	          was committed with the purest of
	          intentions, to send a message to
	          the acting community who put
	          themselves above the work and
	          above --
	
	Three AUDIENCE MEMBERS enter the restroom.  They approach the
	urinals.
	
	                    AUDIENCE MEMBER 1
	              (continuing their
	               conversation from the
	               lobby)
	          -- So fake.
	
	                    AUDIENCE MEMBER 2
	          -- Totally artificial.
	
	Viktor looks at the men aghast and hurriedly exits, missing
	the end of their conversation.
	
	                    AUDIENCE MEMBER 1
	          We're really supposed to believe
	          that was 19th Century Lisbon?
	
	                    AUDIENCE MEMBER 3
	          Who's looking at the sets when she
	          is on the screen?
	
	All three nod in agreement and begin to urinate.
	
	INT.  THEATER LOBBY - NIGHT
	
	VIKTOR exits the restroom.  Almost all the AUDIENCE MEMBERS,
	including LAINEY, are waiting for him.
	
	                    LAINEY
	              (pointing out her father)
	          There he is.  That's my dad, Viktor
	          Taransky.
	
	Viktor is about to run for the exit when the small group
	spontaneously applauds.  They rush to shake his hand.
	
	                    AUDIENCE MEMBER 4
	          -- She is magnificent.
	
	                    AUDIENCE MEMBER 5
	          -- Absolutely unreal.
	
	Viktor appears uncomfortable with their compliments.
	
	                    VIKTOR
	          She wasn't too... cartoony?
	
	                    AUDIENCE MEMBER 6
	          -- Who?  The nun?
	
	                    AUDIENCE MEMBER 7
	          -- Or are you talking about the
	          mother?
	
	                    AUDIENCE MEMBER 8
	          -- A star like that, who cares
	          about the supporting cast?
	
	                    AUDIENCE MEMBER 9
	          -- Congratulations again.  She
	          was... not of this earth.  You
	          should be very proud.
	
	                    VIKTOR
	          "Not of this earth".  A good way of
	          putting it.  And the film as a
	          whole -- ?
	
	The group drifts away, leaving LAINEY and VIKTOR alone.
	
	                    LAINEY
	          She's a miracle, Dad.  Where did
	          you find her?
	
	                    VIKTOR
	              (vague)
	          I saw her picture on the, er...
	          internet.
	              (interrogating his
	               daughter's face)
	          You really didn't notice anything --
	          unusual?
	
	                    LAINEY
	          Only her brilliance.  To be honest,
	          with what you had to work with, I
	          was expecting a train wreck.  You
	          really pulled it off.
	
	Lainey regards the makeshift poster.
	
	                    LAINEY
	          I have a feeling mom is going to
	          take you back after this.
	
	Viktor's head snaps around.  Lainey smiles.
	
	                    LAINEY
	          Back on the lot.
	
	Viktor shrugs off the misunderstanding.
	
	INT.  VIKTOR TARANSKY'S MALIBU HOME - NIGHT
	
	VIKTOR enters his sterile, bachelor home, carrying his mail. 
	His answering machine blinks in the darkness, the message
	light reads "FULL".  He hits the "PLAY" button.
	
	                    ELAINE (V.O.)
	          Viktor, you bastard!  I hear it's
	          great.
	              (beat)
	          Seriously, I'm happy for you.
	
	Viktor opens a drawer containing a photo of he and Elaine
	from happier times.  He gazes at it as he listens to the
	message.
	
	                    ELAINE (V.O.)
	          I know people are going to be
	          beating down your door but... well,
	          I'd love the chance to buy back
	          something I gave away for free. 
	          Don't you just love Hollywood?...
	          BEEP.
	
	Viktor stops the machine, dazed.  He idly opens his mail. 
	Inside an envelope he finds a SAG Card with the new member's
	name, "SIMONE".
	
	A MONTAGE OF SCENES BEGINS TO PLAY.
	
	A)  A line of AUDIENCE MEMBERS stretches outside the rundown
	    movie theater as far as the eye can see.
	
	                    ENTERTAINMENT REPORTER (O.S.)
	          A dazzling new ingenue has come
	          from seemingly nowhere to capture
	          the hearts of movie-going audiences
	          across the nation...
	
	B)  THE FRONT PAGE OF "VARIETY" coming off the presses reads,
	    "SIMONE: A REVELATION -- Dawning Of A New Star In
	    "SUNRISE".
	
	                    ENTERTAINMENT REPORTER (O.S.)
	          ... in her debut film, "Sunrise,
	          Sunset".
	
	C)  A TEENAGE BOY in a public library logs on to the first
	    website dedicated to SIMONE.
	
	                    ENTERTAINMENT REPORTER (O.S.)
	          Her face is already posted on
	          everything from websites to bedroom
	          walls.
	
	D)  Trendy TEENAGE GIRLS saunter past a swimming pool in
	    Simone capes and hoods despite the sweltering heat.
	
	                    ENTERTAINMENT REPORTER (O.S.)
	          Her wardrobe has inspired a fashion
	          craze.
	
	E)  In a Third World back-alley a YOUNG ASIAN MAN shows an
	    UNDERCOVER REPORTER a pirated recording of SIMONE on a
	    camcorder.
	
	                    ENTERTAINMENT REPORTER (O.S.)
	          And bootleg copies of her film are
	          being sold in back alleys all over
	          the world.
	
	F)  A LIQUOR STORE CUSTOMER watches a TV behind the counter
	    showing a clip of SIMONE from, "SUNRISE, SUNSET Courtesy:
	    Taransky Productions".
	
	                    ENTERTAINMENT REPORTER
	              (from TV)
	          But who is Simone?  We know so
	          little about her.  No details of
	          her background have been released,
	          not even her age.  She is somewhere
	          between a girl and a woman.  A
	          fresh face and familiar both at the
	          same time.
	
	G)  The ENTERTAINMENT REPORTER now stands outside a
	    multiplex.  The marquee has 16 screens and looks like
	    this:
	
	        "SUNRISE, SUNSET"         "SUNRISE, SUNSET"
	        "SUNRISE, SUNSET"         "SUNRISE, SUNSET"
	        "SUNRISE, SUNSET"         "SUNRISE, SUNSET"
	        "SUNRISE, SUNSET"         "SUNRISE, SUNSET"
	        "SUNRISE, SUNSET"         "SUNRISE, SUNSET"
	        "SUNRISE, SUNSET"         "SUNRISE, SUNSET"
	        "SUNRISE, SUNSET"         "SUNRISE, SUNSET"
	        "SUNRISE, SUNSET"         "THE MAKING OF
	                                       SUNRISE, SUNSET"
	
	                    ENTERTAINMENT REPORTER
	          Is Simone even her real name?  And
	          why the secrecy?  All we know for
	          sure is that she was discovered by
	          little-known director, Viktor
	          Tarinsky.
	
	INT.  LIMOUSINE - DAY
	
	VIKTOR, watching "SCENE" on a TV in the back of a limousine,
	corrects the reporter.
	
	                    VIKTOR
	          Taransky.
	
	                    ENTERTAINMENT REPORTER
	              (from the TV)
	          He has parlayed his relationship
	          with the new sensation into a three
	          picture deal with the very studio
	          that dumped him only six months
	          ago.  And no wonder with the
	          starlet's performance breaking all
	          box office records.
	
	EXT.  STUDIO GATE - MORNING
	
	Outside the studio entrance, a swarm of REPORTERS,
	PHOTOGRAPHERS and FANS rush VIKTOR's limousine, hoping for a
	glimpse of SIMONE.
	
	                    MOB
	          Simone!  SIMONE!  I LOVE YOU!  I
	          Want to BE you!
	
	Studio SECURITY GUARDS hold them back as the limo enters the
	lot.
	
	EXT.  STUDIO - ENTRANCE - DAY
	
	ELAINE and an entourage of EXECUTIVES greets VIKTOR's
	limousine on the studio steps.
	 
	A STUDIO PHOTOGRAPHER has a camera at the ready.  A banner
	reads, "Welcome SIMONE".  A YOUNG ASSISTANT wheels a cake.
	
	VIKTOR steps out of the car.  ELAINE pushes past him, into
	the limo.
	
	                    ELAINE
	          Simone!... Simone?
	
	The car is empty.
	
	                    ELAINE
	              (re-emerging from the car)
	          Where is she?
	
	                    VIKTOR
	          Good to see you too, Elaine.
	
	                    ELAINE
	              (ignoring his sarcasm)
	          Why isn't she with you?
	
	                    VIKTOR
	          Why?  Because she would never show
	          up at something like this.  She's
	          intensely private.
	
	Elaine sighs, exasperated.
	
	                    ELAINE
	              (dismissing her
	               colleagues)
	          Back to work, everyone.  She's not
	          here.
	
	The reception committee disperses, murmurs of disappointment.
	
	                    ELAINE
	          Viktor... I want to thank you for
	          convincing Simone to sign with the
	          studio.
	
	                    VIKTOR
	          Don't thank me.  It was entirely
	          Simone's decision.  Do you have
	          Simone's check?
	
	                    ELAINE
	          I don't have it on me.  Anyway, it
	          means a lot.
	              (quickly changing tack)
	          Have you read the reviews?  They're
	          love letters.
	              (reading from a newspaper)
	          Listen to this one.  "Simone has
	          the voice of a young Jane Fonda,
	          the body of Sophia Loren, the grace
	          of, well, Grace Kelley, and the
	          face of Audrey Hepburn combined
	          with an angel".
	
	                    VIKTOR
	              (musing to himself)
	          Almost right.
	
	                    ELAINE
	          I can't wait to meet her.
	
	                    VIKTOR
	          I don't know if that's going to
	          happen.
	
	                    ELAINE
	              (confused)
	          Why not?
	
	                    VIKTOR
	          As I say, she's... something of a
	          recluse.  That's how she's able to
	          stay so pure -- by isolating
	          herself in her art.
	
	                    ELAINE
	              (face falling)
	          Don't be ridiculous.  I arranged a
	          press conference.
	
	                    VIKTOR
	          Out of the question.  A circus like
	          that?
	
	                    ELAINE
	          Viktor, it's my studio.
	
	                    VIKTOR
	          She's my actor.  There are other
	          studios, Elaine.  There's only one
	          Simone.
	              (leaving her on the steps)
	          Leave the press conference to me.
	
	Viktor strides up the studio steps.  Elaine stares after her
	ex-husband -- she finds herself smiling at his newfound
	arrogance.
	
	EXT.  STUDIO - PRESS CONFERENCE - DAY
	
	The studio soundstages as a backdrop, VIKTOR approaches a
	podium and a forest of microphones, revelling in his recent
	fame by association.
	
	                    VIKTOR
	              (tapping the microphone)
	          Is this on?

	          Who are you?
	
	                    VIKTOR
	          Taransky, Viktor.  T-a-r-a-n-s-k-y,
	          V-i-k-t-o-r.
	
	                    REPORTER 1
	          Yeah, but -- who are you?
	
	                    VIKTOR
	              (patronizing smile)
	          I am a two-time Academy Award
	          nominated director with over
	          eighteen films to my credit thus
	          far including my latest release,
	          "Sunrise, Sunset".  Who are you?
	
	A REPORTER rolls her eyes at his pomposity.
	
	                    VIKTOR
	          I will not be taking any questions. 
	          However I do have a statement to
	          read on behalf of my leading lady,
	          Simone.
	              (reading from his
	               statement)
	          "To Whom It May Concern.  I'm
	          deeply grateful for the
	          extraordinary public response to
	          Mr. Taransky's film.  At this time
	          I will be conducting no interviews
	          or making publicity appearances
	          since I am really nothing without
	          the beautiful worlds and characters
	          Mr. Taransky creates for me.  I
	          politely request that the press
	          respect my privacy and let the work
	          speak for itself.  All questions
	          and inquiries should be directed to
	          Mr. Taransky to whom I entrust all
	          aspects of my career.  Yours very
	          truly, Simone".
	
	The reporters all call out at once.
	
	                    REPORTER 2
	          -- Viktor, Viktor, who's Simone
	          dating?
	
	                    REPORTER 3
	          -- Viktor, where'd you find her?
	
	                    REPORTER 4
	          -- Is Simone her real name?
	
	                    REPORTER 5
	          -- What's she got to hide?
	
	                    REPORTER 1
	          -- Is she the new Garbo?
	
	                    REPORTER 2
	          -- Who's Garbo?
	
	Viktor silences the reporters by theatrically raising his
	hands.
	
	                    VIKTOR
	          I thought I made it clear -- no
	          questions regarding Simone.
	              (bringing the press
	               conference to a hasty
	               conclusion)
	          Now, I would like to close by
	          announcing that Miss Simone begins
	          production today on her next film,
	          "Eternity Forever".  This project
	          has been near and dear to my heart
	          since I wrote it nine years ago.
	              (a tinge of bitterness,
	               then a smile)
	          I Thank you.
	
	Viktor exits the podium.  A voice stops him in his tracks.
	
	                    VOICE (O.S.)
	          Who do you think you're fooling,
	          Taransky?
	
	Viktor turns.  The voice belongs to over-zealous, crusading,
	truth-seeking investigative reporter, MAX SAYER, accompanied
	by his assistant, MILTON.
	
	                    VIKTOR
	          Do I know you?
	
	                    MAX
	          Max Sayer -- National Echo.
	
	                    VIKTOR
	              (regaining his composure,
	               a smirk)
	          Don't you have a real story to
	          write?  Why aren't you in Latin
	          America?
	
	                    MAX
	          This is the story.
	
	                    VIKTOR
	          I remember when the Echo had class 
	          -- the paper that could bring down
	          governments.
	
	                    MAX
	          Our leaders aren't presidents
	          anymore -- they're pop stars and
	          screen idols.  If Woodward and
	          Bernstein were alive today, they'd
	          be right here in Hollywood with me.
	
	                    VIKTOR
	          They are alive, Sayer.
	
	Milton confirms that Woodward and Bernstein are still living.
	
	                    MAX
	          So they're probably here.
	              (hardly missing a beat)
	          You might be able to sell this
	          'disappearing act' to the rest of
	          the world, but I'm not buying it. 
	          What's really behind this Simone
	          woman?  The public has a right to
	          know.  Why is she staying out of
	          sight?  And why the hell is she
	          with you?  I don't want you to take
	          this the wrong way, Viktor, but
	          you're not exactly Cecil B. 
	          DeMille -- more run-of-the-mill.
	
	                    VIKTOR
	          Maybe the reason she's with me is a
	          little thing called integrity,
	          Sayer.  Look it up.
	
	Viktor walks away.
	
	                    MAX
	              (calling after him)
	          Oh, I know all about integrity.  I
	          know even more about persistence. 
	          Look that one up.
	
	Max watches Viktor depart, with obvious suspicion.
	
	EXT.  SOUNDSTAGE - STUDIO LOT - DAY
	
	A large satellite dish sits atop a soundstage.
	
	"CLOSED SET" is the sign on the door -- a surveillance camera
	panning the entrance.  A SECURITY GUARD, also keeping watch,
	nods a greeting to VIKTOR as he pulls up in his studio golf
	cart, script in hand.
	
	                    SECURITY GUARD
	          No one came in or went out just
	          like you said, Mr. Taransky.
	
	                    VIKTOR
	          Good.
	
	                    SECURITY GUARD
	          Is Miss Simone coming today?
	
	                    VIKTOR
	          She's already here.  She arrived
	          before you and she'll leave long
	          after you've gone.
	              (admonishing guard)
	          Remember, under no circumstances
	          are you or any other person to
	          enter the set without my express
	          permission.
	
	                    SECURITY GUARD
	          What if it catches on fire?
	
	                    VIKTOR
	          Let it burn.  Simone would rather
	          go up in flames than give up her
	          privacy.
	
	Viktor enters his secret code into the keypad lock and enters
	the soundstage.
	
	INT.  VIKTOR'S SOUNDSTAGE - DAY
	
	The cavernous soundstage is almost completely empty save for
	a small table upon which sits two computer keyboards and a
	tablet attached to a large, projection screen monitor and two
	side monitors.  VIKTOR takes a seat in front of the monitor.
	
	                    VIKTOR
	              (to himself as he inserts
	               his Hollywood hard-drive 
	               -- SIMULATION ONE)
	          Pay no attention to the man behind
	          the computer.
	
	A title appears on his computer screen.
	
	                          Welcome
	                             to
	                       SIMULATION ONE
	
	With a satisfied smile, Viktor backspaces characters until he
	revises the title to:
	
	                          Welcome
	                             to
	                           SIMONE
	
	He presses "ENTER" and a face begins to build -- wire upon
	wire, pixel upon pixel -- until a completed synthespian
	emerges -- SIMONE.  She is indistinguishable from a flesh-and
	blood actress.
	
	Simone moves on a video loop against a neutral background --
	titled "VISUAL LOOP 6".  Within the confines of the monitor
	she is reminiscent of a beautiful caged animal.  She looks a
	little bored as if she has been cooped up in cyberspace for
	too long.
	
	                    VIKTOR
	              (to the screen)
	          Good morning, Simone.
	
	                    SIMONE / VIKTOR
	          Good morning, Mr. Taransky.
	
	                    VIKTOR
	          A star is...
	
	                    SIMONE / VIKTOR
	          ... digitized.
	
	Only now do we observe that Viktor is occasionally talking
	into a microphone connected to the computer and pressing a
	key on his keyboard.  When he speaks, she speaks.  Simone's
	voice and mouth movements automatically sync in response to
	Viktor's voice.  A scanning light on Viktor allows Simone to
	mimic his movements.
	
	                    SIMONE / VIKTOR
	          You mean they buy it?
	
	                    VIKTOR
	              (nervous smile as he
	               examines his first
	               royalty check)
	          Buy it?  They're paying for it. 
	          And around here that's how you
	          really know they buy it.
	
	Viktor fondly touches a photograph of Hank that is taped to
	the terminal -- from the "L.A. Times" obituaries.
	
	                    VIKTOR
	          I'm only sorry Hank isn't here to
	          see this.
	
	Viktor looks up, Simone mimicking his action.
	
	                    SIMONE / VIKTOR
	              (depressing the button
	               every time he wants to
	               express his thoughts
	               through Simone)
	          Maybe he can.
	
	                    VIKTOR
	          Do you have any idea what this
	          means, Simone?  Our ability to
	          manufacture fraud now exceeds our
	          ability to detect it.
	
	                    SIMONE / VIKTOR
	              (appearing to indulge
	               Viktor with a smile)
	          I am the death of real.
	
	                    VIKTOR
	              (pondering the enormity of
	               the hoax)
	          You are birth of... what?  A
	          Phenomenon.  A miracle.  A new era
	          in show business.  All I wanted to
	          do was finish the film.
	
	                    SIMONE / VIKTOR
	          And now look what you've started. 
	          And now look what you've started. 
	          And now look what you've started.
	
	Viktor's conversation with himself is not merely for his own
	amusement.  He is adjusting and refining Simone's voice.
	
	                    VIKTOR
	          Hmm... a little less Streep, a
	          little more Bacall.
	
	Viktor scrolls through a photo library of stars, living and
	dead, that comprise Simone.
	
	Viktor makes an adjustment on a panel on the computer screen
	dedicated to Simone's audio, incorporating the vocal
	deliveries -- "20% STREEP, 80% BACALL".
	
	He speaks once again as Simone to test the adjustment.  The
	voice patterns appear on his screen -- graphic
	representations of the sound waves.
	
	                    SIMONE / VIKTOR
	          Is that better, Mr. Taransky?
	
	                    VIKTOR
	          Yes.  Yes, it is.
	
	VIKTOR snaps back to reality himself.  He scrolls through the
	list of screen legends.  He clicks on the image of AUDREY
	HEPBURN.
	
	                    VIKTOR
	          While I think of it, I'd like you
	          to add something to your repertoire
	          -- remember that thing Hepburn does
	          in "Breakfast At Tiffany's".
	
	A clip of AUDREY HEPBURN in "Breakfast At Tiffany's" plays on
	the screen.  Hepburn, sitting on a fire escape, looks up.
	
	                    AUDREY HEPBURN
	              (from the screen, an
	               incomparable smile)
	          Hi.
	
	                    VIKTOR
	              (pausing the moment)
	          Let's hear you say "Hi" like
	          Audrey.
	
	With a CUT and PASTE, Viktor morphs the gesture seamlessly
	into a frozen Simone.  Viktor presses play.
	
	                    SIMONE
	              (imitating Audrey's
	               performance perfectly)
	          Hi.
	
	                    VIKTOR
	          Perfect.
	              (stretching)
	          God, I'm so relaxed around you.
	
	                    SIMONE / VIKTOR
	          You did create me.
	
	                    VIKTOR
	          No.  I... just helped bring someone
	          else's dream to life.
	
	                    SIMONE / VIKTOR
	          Mr. Taransky, we both know I was
	          nothing without you.  I was
	          computer code -- ones and zeros.
	
	                    VIKTOR
	          You're right.  You're right.  Of
	          course, one doesn't want to boast. 
	          It's a classic case of technology
	          in search of an artist.  That's all
	          you've been waiting for, an artist
	          with integrity, with a vision, who
	          can see.
	
	Viktor gets up and starts walking around the room, warming to
	his theme.  SIMONE moves in a VISUAL LOOP on the monitor,
	nodding attentively as if she's really interested.
	
	                    VIKTOR
	          See beyond that irrational
	          allegiance to flesh and blood. --
	          See that with the rise in price of
	          a real actor and the fall in price
	          of a fake, the scales have tipped
	          in favor of the fake.
	              (voice raising in
	               excitement)
	          -- See that if the performance is
	          genuine, it doesn't matter if the
	          actor is real.  Once a performance
	          is committed to film, the blood and
	          bones are gone anyway.  Only the
	          spirit, the illusion remains. 
	          Besides, what's real anymore? 
	          These days most actors have digital
	          work done to them so it's a gray
	          area.
	
	                    SIMONE / VIKTOR
	              (Simone appears to look
	               directly at her maker)
	          Are you ever going to tell the
	          truth about me, Mr. Taransky?
	
	                    VIKTOR
	          The only real truth is in the work.
	
	                    SIMONE / VIKTOR
	          You know what I'm talking about.
	
	                    VIKTOR
	          Yes.  Yes, I'm going to tell the
	          truth about you, why wouldn't I...?
	              (pondering his own
	               question)
	          Of course, with Hank's tragic
	          passing, the secret died with him.
	              (shaking the thought from
	               his head)
	          I am going to tell the truth...
	          after your next picture.
	
	Feeling uneasy at the prospect, Viktor changes the subject. 
	He pulls out his script for "ETERNITY FOREVER".
	
	                    VIKTOR
	          Speaking of which -- this is the
	          project I'd like you to do next.
	
	                    SIMONE / VIKTOR
	          Not, "Eternity Forever"?  The
	          legendary unproduced script that
	          was too good ever to get made?  I'd
	          kill for that part.
	
	                    VIKTOR
	          I was hoping you'd say that.
	
	Suddenly, Simone appears to talk on her own.
	
	                    SIMONE
	          I'll do anything to please you, Mr.
	          Taransky.
	
	                    VIKTOR
	              (pretending to be hard of
	               hearing)
	          I'm sorry, I didn't catch that. 
	          What did you say?
	
	                    SIMONE
	          I'll do anything to please you, Mr.
	          Taransky.
	
	On a side monitor, we discover a highlighted box marked "PRE
	RECORD" -- Viktor's finger on the "PLAY" button.  He is
	unable to resist speaking another line.
	
	                    SIMONE / VIKTOR
	          And I will never, ever leave you.
	
	Simone appears to indulge Viktor by blowing him a kiss --
	until we see that Viktor has now highlighted a box marked,
	"GESTURES OF AFFECTION -- WINK, SMILE, GIGGLE, SIGH, KISS,
	FLUTTER OF EYES, FLICK OF HAIR, PUFF OF CHEST".
	
	Viktor comes close to the monitor.  He notices something
	about Simone's face.
	
	                    VIKTOR
	          You're so beautiful.  Too
	          beautiful.
	
	Viktor accesses a program labeled, "DISTINGUISHING FEATURES".
	He adds a "FRECKLE" and a "MOLE".
	
	From a distance we watch him, alone with Simone in the vast,
	empty soundstage.
	
	EXT.  STUDIO LOT - DAY
	
	VIKTOR's face against the SKY.  As he walks, we reveal that
	the sky is no more than a huge, painted backdrop on the
	studio lot -- behind a parking lot.  Viktor hands his valet
	ticket to a fawning VALET MANAGER.
	
	                    VALET MANAGER
	          -- Just be a minute, Mr. Taransky. 
	          We gave you a complimentary car
	          wash -- they're washing the engine
	          now.
	
	Viktor joins other industry MOVERS and SHAKERS waiting for
	their cars under an umbrella.  A young TALENT AGENT
	approaches.
	
	                    TALENT AGENT
	          Viktor!  Look, I'm sorry I didn't
	          call you back last year.  I was,
	          er... out of the country.
	              (strained moment)
	          But we should get together.  My
	          schedule's wide open.
	
	                    VIKTOR
	          Sure, I'll... "call you".
	
	The agent's face falls.  He gets in his car, disconsolate.
	
	Suddenly, HAL SINCLAIR, rushes over and hugs Viktor.
	
	                    HAL
	          Viktor, I'm so happy for us!
	
	                    VIKTOR
	          Hello, Hal.
	
	                    HAL
	          The film.  The chemistry.  No
	          reflections on Nicola but Simone
	          and I -- we were just so right
	          together.
	
	                    VIKTOR
	          You never were together, Hal.
	
	                    HAL
	          And still the connection was
	          undeniable.
	              (aside)
	          I haven't read "Eternity Forever"
	          but I know it's brilliant.  And I
	          know I would be perfect for Clive.
	
	                    VIKTOR
	              (correcting him)
	          Clyde.
	
	                    HAL
	          Yes, perfect.
	              (lowering his voice)
	          As a matter of fact, I ran into
	          Simone on the lot the other day.
	
	                    VIKTOR
	              (genuinely startled)
	          Really?  She didn't mention it.
	
	                    HAL
	              (quickly covering)
	          I'm sure she's meeting with a lot
	          of people right now.
	              (under his breath)
	          She is just as you described her,
	          Viktor... indescribable.  I
	          strongly sensed she thought I was
	          right for it.
	
	Behind his back, Viktor surreptitiously presses a button on
	his cell phone.  The phone rings.  Viktor feigns surprise and
	answers.
	
	                    VIKTOR
	              (answering the phone he
	               has just dialed, louder
	               than necessary)
	          Hello?... SIMONE!  How are you,
	          sweetheart?
	
	A hush descends over the executives.  Hal is suddenly very
	uncomfortable.  Even the VALETS strain to eavesdrop on the
	conversation.
	
	                    VIKTOR
	              (winking to Hal)
	          You'll never guess who I'm with...
	          you ran into him on the lot.
	
	                    HAL
	          It was more in passing.
	
	                    VIKTOR
	          You're so far off!
	              (finally chuckles)
	          Hal... Hal Sinclair... your co-
	          star.  Remember now?... No, I don't
	          think he's put on weight.
	              (a shrug of apology to the
	               appalled Hal)
	          Anyway, you think he's right for
	          "Eternity Forever"?... not the
	          right type?... a different
	          direction...
	              (covering phone, to Hal)
	          I'll try to talk her into it.
	
	The other INDUSTRY PEOPLE make a note of the remark.  A
	mortified Hal excuses himself with a pathetic wave, climbing
	into his car.
	
	                    VIKTOR
	              (into phone)
	          ... Listen this is a bad place to
	          talk... what?... sweetheart, I know
	          you have charity work you want to
	          do, I know you want to give back --
	          but remember, your greatest gift is
	          your talent... we'll talk about it
	          at the beach house this weekend...
	          I'm looking forward to it too.
	
	Viktor hangs up.  His car pulls up.  He tips extravagantly
	and drives away.  The INDUSTRY PEOPLE get on their cell
	phones.
	
	EXT.  STUDIO LOT - FACADE - DAY
	
	Parked behind the sky facade is a curious CAR with shaded
	windows.
	
	INT.  CAR - DAY
	
	Inside the car, MAX SAYER and assistant MILTON, scanner in
	hand, are replaying Viktor's intercepted phone call on a
	computer.
	
	                    VIKTOR'S VOICE
	              (from the machine)
	          -- "... You think he's right for
	          "Eternity Forever"?... not the
	          right type?... a different
	          direction..."
	
	                    MILTON
	              (to Max, a shake of the
	               head)
	          I'm getting nothing from her side
	          of the conversation.
	
	                    MAX
	          Is it a jamming device?
	
	                    MILTON
	              (shrugs)
	          Maybe he's talking to himself.
	
	                    MAX
	              (dismissing the idea)
	          Taransky isn't that good an actor. 
	          No, they're taking special
	          precautions.  Some kind of new
	          encryption.
	
	                    MILTON
	          Why?
	
	                    MAX
	              (musing)
	          Whatever it is, it's dark.
	
	                    MILTON
	          Dark?
	
	                    MAX
	          Yes, very.
	
	They continue listening to the recording.
	
	                    VIKTOR'S VOICE
	          "... We'll talk about it at the
	          beach house this weekend..."
	
	MAX's eyes light up.  He gazes to a photo of SIMONE pasted to
	the inside of the car.
	
	INT.  VIKTOR'S MALIBU HOME - MORNING
	
	VIKTOR and LAINEY make breakfast.  Lainey is in her pajamas,
	occasionally glancing to a laptop computer as her father
	prepares French toast.
	
	                    VIKTOR
	              (glancing to the computer)
	          Can't you stop that?
	
	                    LAINEY
	          Why?
	
	                    VIKTOR
	          Those things can be dangerous. 
	          Staring at a screen all day -- you
	          miss what's going on outside in the
	          real world.  You can lose yourself. 
	          You should get out more.  How are
	          you going to meet boys?
	
	                    LAINEY
	              (shrugs coyly, getting up)
	          I know plenty of boys.
	
	                    VIKTOR
	          Really?  Who?  Where do you meet
	          them?  In a chat room?  How do you
	          know he's not some middle-aged
	          freak?
	
	                    LAINEY
	          Dad, I can spot a middle-aged freak
	          a mile away.
	
	                    VIKTOR
	          Okay.  But you have to find a way
	          to escape that thing.
	
	                    LAINEY
	          I do.
	
	                    VIKTOR
	          How?
	
	                    LAINEY
	          I read.
	
	                    VIKTOR
	          You do?  Still?  I can't tell you
	          how happy I am to hear that.
	
	                    LAINEY
	          You were the one who insisted on
	          it.  Reading me Dostoyevsky and
	          Joyce when I was four.
	
	                    VIKTOR
	          You understood them.  That's what
	          was amazing.
	              (looking out the window)
	          It's a nice day.  Let's eat
	          outside.
	
	Lainey grabs the plates and opens the deck door.  We hear a
	chorus of CLICKS.
	
	                    LAINEY
	          Actually, it may be nicer inside.
	
	Viktor joins her at the doorway.
	
	                    VIKTOR
	          Stay here, I'll deal with this.
	
	Unfazed, Lainey retreats into the house.
	
	EXT.  VIKTOR'S MALIBU HOUSE - MORNING
	
	Boats are moored just off the beach packed dangerously full
	of telephoto lens-toting PHOTOGRAPHERS.  The next door houses
	have LENSES protruding through the drapes of the windows.
	
	VIKTOR strides onto the lawn of his property that backs onto
	the beach, soaking up the attention -- unable to resist
	waving extravagantly.
	
	Suddenly, a PHOTOGRAPHER, losing his balance, drops from a
	nearby rooftop.  The photographer limps towards the fence. 
	Viktor calmly follows, retrieving the photographer's camera
	and ripping out the film with a flourish -- he is clearly
	relishing the attention.
	
	The photographer clambers over the fence where he joins
	several dozen other SHUTTER-BUGS and VIDEORAZZI.
	
	                    PHOTOGRAPHER 1
	          That wasn't her, Taransky.
	
	                    ECHO PHOTOGRAPHER
	          Where is she?  You can't hide her
	          forever.
	
	                    VIKTOR
	              (hurling the camera into
	               the mob)
	          You'll never find her.  Simone only
	          appears when I want her to appear.
	
	MAX SAYER from "The NATIONAL ECHO" is at the head of the mob,
	accompanied by assistant MILTON.
	
	                    MAX
	          She sounds like a prisoner,
	          Taransky.  Are you holding her
	          hostage?  Are you some kind of
	          Svengali?
	
	                    VIKTOR
	              (recognizing the reporter)
	          Who's the hostage, Sayer, her or
	          you?  You look kind of "captive"
	          yourself.  While you're spending
	          every waking hour obsessing over
	          Simone, guess what, I guarantee she
	          doesn't even know you exist.  Get
	          off my property or I'll call the
	          cops.
	
	                    MAX
	          The cops?  The cops read my column
	          to know who to bust.  We're the
	          only watchdog the public has.
	              (looking around at the
	               photographers)
	          None of this is going away.  We'll
	          be here tomorrow and the day after
	          that.  Until you slip up.  And you
	          will.  You are looking at your
	          shadow.
	              (getting in his face)
	          Because all these elaborate
	          precautions with Simone -- every
	          instinct in my body tells me, it's
	          not natural.
	
	                    VIKTOR
	          I'm just trying to help you, Sayer. 
	          I don't want you to be
	          disappointed.  It gets cold out
	          here at night.
	
	                    MAX
	          Nice try.  If we can't get to her
	          through you, maybe your family will
	          be more co-operative.  I can
	          guarantee you, Taransky, one way or
	          another, Miss Simone and I are
	          going to get acquainted.
	
	                    VIKTOR
	              (turning away)
	          I'd like to see that, Sayer. 
	          Invite me.
	
	INT.  VIKTOR'S CAR - DAY
	
	VIKTOR drives along a twisty mountain road, LAINEY in the
	passenger seat.  They have become so blase about the
	paparazzi, they no longer acknowledge the posse of motorcycle
	PHOTOGRAPHERS risking their necks to stay up with the car.
	
	                    REPORTER (ON RADIO)
	          -- The rumor is, Simone is holed up
	          in Taransky's Malibu home -- so far
	          we haven't seen so much as a
	          glimpse --
	
	                    VIKTOR
	              (switching off the radio)
	          Honey, I'm really sorry about all
	          this.  I don't know if it's safe
	          for you to stay the weekends...
	          just until things settle down.
	
	                    LAINEY
	              (shrugs)
	          Okay, Dad.
	
	                    VIKTOR
	          If anyone asks about Simone --
	
	                    LAINEY
	          -- I know, I don't know anything.
	
	                    VIKTOR
	          Exactly.
	              (slightly irritated by her
	               lack of interest)
	          Don't you wonder where I'm really
	          hiding Simone?
	
	                    LAINEY
	              (looking to him)
	          I'm sure you'd tell me if you
	          thought it was important.
	
	Lainey gives her father a smile.  Through the car window
	behind her, a MOTORCYCLIST appears to lose control and drops
	down a bank.
	
	EXT.  ELAINE'S MANSION - DAY
	
	VIKTOR'S car pulls up to Elaine's imposing mansion.  LAINEY
	gives her father a kiss and departs.  ELAINE, in the garden,
	overseeing a GARDENER pruning roses, approaches.
	
	                    VIKTOR
	              (from the car)
	          Sorry I didn't get her back in
	          time.
	
	                    ELAINE
	          No problem.
	              (she smiles)
	          Do you want to come in?
	
	                    VIKTOR
	              (surprised -- pleasantly)
	          Why not?
	
	INT.  ELAINE'S MANSION - DAY
	
	VIKTOR walks down a hall, passing the dining room, where KENT
	is working on a computer.  Kent smiles blandly.
	
	                    KENT
	          Hey, Vik.
	
	                    VIKTOR
	              (disappointed to see him)
	          Hello -- Kent.
	
	INT.  ELAINE'S MANSION - DAY
	
	VIKTOR waits in an opulent drawing room.  Despite the eighty
	degree temperature outside, a fire burns in the hearth. 
	ELAINE enters, waving a thick studio file.  Viktor's face
	falls, expecting a less business-related conversation.
	
	                    ELAINE
	          Viktor, we simply have to talk
	          about "Eternity..."
	
	                    VIKTOR
	          "Forever".
	
	                    ELAINE
	          Whatever.  I still haven't received
	          Simone's script notes.
	
	                    VIKTOR
	          There aren't any.  If the
	          filmmakers are happy, Simone's
	          happy.  She considers herself an...
	          "instrument".
	
	                    ELAINE
	          Really?  Oh, so she's really going
	          to do all this nudity?
	
	                    VIKTOR
	              (shrugs)
	          If it's on the page...
	
	Elaine refers to her documents, bewildered.
	
	                    ELAINE
	          Well, something has to be done
	          about this budget.  It's completely
	          unrealistic.
	              (referring to a column in
	               the budget)
	          You allowed nothing for limousine
	          service.
	
	                    VIKTOR

	          Hair and make-up?
	
	                    VIKTOR
	          She'll do her own.  Theater
	          training.
	
	                    ELAINE
	          She was in the theater?  When? 
	          Where?
	
	                    VIKTOR
	          I'll send you her resume.
	
	                    ELAINE
	          Al least a contingency for
	          wardrobe.  Any woman can go up a
	          dress size.
	
	                    VIKTOR
	          -- I guarantee she won't gain an
	          once.  She's very disciplined.
	
	                    ELAINE
	              (concerned by an entry in
	               the budget)
	          Well, we have to do something about
	          this -- "stuntwoman".
	
	                    VIKTOR
	          What about it?
	
	                    ELAINE
	          There isn't one.
	
	                    VIKTOR
	          No need.  She does all her own
	          stunts.
	
	                    ELAINE
	              (skeptical)
	          Even the fall from the plane?
	
	                    VIKTOR
	              (nonchalant)
	          Even the fall from the plane.
	
	                    ELAINE
	          Well, shoot it on the last day.
	
	Viktor regards Elaine with a condescending look.
	
	                    VIKTOR
	          As I've tried to explain to you,
	          Elaine.  Simone isn't like any
	          other actress you've ever known. 
	          She's about the work and only the
	          work -- lives for the work.  She
	          wants all the money up there...
	              (gazing into space)
	          ... on the screen where it belongs. 
	          She'd work for scale except I know
	          you only respect people you pay a
	          fortune.
	
	                    ELAINE
	          Which accounts for your percentage.
	              (tossing the budget on the
	               coffee table)
	          When do I get to meet this dream?
	
	                    VIKTOR
	          Not today.  She's learning her
	          lines.
	              (glancing to Elaine's
	               budget)
	          You can also take cue cards and
	          teleprompter out of the budget.
	
	                    ELAINE
	              (smiles)
	          I'll walk you out.
	
	Elaine escorts Viktor out to the lavish garden.
	
	EXT.  ELAINE'S MANSION - GARDEN - DAY
	
	ELAINE's demeanor softens.  She speaks to VIKTOR quietly,
	sympathetically.
	
	                    ELAINE
	          Listen, Viktor... I want to talk to
	          you now, not as Elaine, studio
	          head, but Elaine, ex-wife.
	              (correcting herself)
	          Second ex-wife.  You got lucky this
	          last time but you need to be
	          careful.  We both know you wouldn't
	          be making this overblown art film
	          of you hadn't convinced Simone to
	          be in it.
	
	                    VIKTOR
	          Elaine, talking to you now, not as
	          Viktor, director, but Viktor, ex
	          husband... what the hell happened
	          to you?
	
	                    ELAINE
	              (exasperated)
	          Experience, Viktor.  I've seen this
	          a hundred times -- young stars
	          destroying the very people who
	          discovered them.  I'm worried about
	          you, that's all.  This woman -- she
	          controls your destiny.
	
	                    VIKTOR
	          Simone does not control my destiny.
	
	                    ELAINE
	          Viktor, I have a feeling.  One of
	          my feelings.  There's something
	          about her I don't trust.
	
	From her bedroom window on the mansion's second floor, LAINEY
	smiles at the sight of her mother and father together.

	VIKTOR enters his office where he's greeted by his assistant,
	JANE.
	
	                    JANE
	              (sheepish)
	          Thanks for taking me back, Mr.
	          Taransky.  I know it looked like I
	          sided with the studio, but I always
	          believed in you, honestly.
	
	                    VIKTOR
	          Don't worry.  I understand.
	
	                    JANE
	              (referring to the cast
	               seated around a
	               conference table)
	          They're all here.
	
	INT.  SIMONE & VIKTOR'S OFFICE - DAY
	
	VIKTOR sits at the head of the table, surrounded by HAL,
	LOTUS, MAC and three other CAST MEMBERS.  A preliminary
	poster behind him -- "COMING THIS SUMMER - SIMONE in ETERNITY
	FOREVER" -- bears a huge photograph of Simone's face.
	
	                    VIKTOR
	          I can't tell you how delighted I am
	          to have this wonderful cast
	          assembled for "Eternity Forever". 
	          Thank you all.  Now, a reminder --
	          as a condition for working on this
	          film, you will not be rehearsing
	          with Simone, shooting with Simone
	          and you are forbidden from
	          contacting Simone in any way at any
	          time, whatsoever.
	
	The CAST nods seriously.
	
	                    HAL
	              (a thought occurs)
	          How will you do our love scenes?
	
	                    VIKTOR
	          Body double.
	
	                    HAL
	              (confused)
	          For her?
	
	                    VIKTOR
	          For you.
	              (addressing the entire
	               cast)
	          I want you to know, Simone
	          appreciates you all working for
	          scale.  But why am I thanking you? 
	          Simone can thank you herself.  She
	          insisted on speaking with you
	          before filming begins.  She's on
	          the line now.
	
	Viktor nods to a speaker phone in the center of the table, a
	red blinking light on the phone.  The cast reacts excitedly.
	
	                    VIKTOR
	              (pushing a button on the
	               phone)
	          Simone, are you there?
	
	                    SIMONE
	              (through the speakerphone)
	          I certainly am, Mr. Taransky.
	
	                    LOTUS
	              (unable to contain her
	               excitement)
	          So are we, Simone!
	
	Everyone laughs giddily.
	
	                    SIMONE (O.S.)
	          Why don't you leave me alone with
	          my co-stars, Mr. Taransky, so we
	          can get to know each other better?
	
	                    HAL
	          Good idea.
	
	                    VIKTOR
	          Of course.  I'll be back in a
	          minute.
	
	Viktor exits.
	
	                    SIMONE (O.S.)
	          Hi.  Who's there?  Don't be shy. 
	          Introduce yourselves.
	
	The CAST stares nervously at the speakerphone.  Mac breaks
	the silence.
	
	                    MAC
	          I'm Mac.  I turned down a
	          Bertolucci film to be here.
	
	                    LOTUS
	          My name's Lotus.  God, I can't
	          believe I'm talking to you.  We're
	          going to become such great friends.
	
	                    HAL
	          I'm Hal.  Wonderful to be working
	          together... again.
	
	The other cast members introduce themselves.
	
	EXT.  VIKTOR'S SOUNDSTAGE - DAY
	
	VIKTOR pulls up sharply in his studio golf cart outside the
	nearby soundstage and hurriedly enters.
	
	INT.  VIKTOR'S SOUNDSTAGE - DAY
	
	VIKTOR races across the vast, empty space to a digital
	player, connected to a phone.  Simone's pre-recorded opening
	remarks (graphically represented on the screen) are almost
	completed.
	
	                    SIMONE
	          Is that everyone...?
	              (pause)
	          Well, obviously, as you know...
	
	Viktor jumps into the conversation in the nick of time,
	speaking through the synthesizer.  As usual, Viktor's voice
	is automatically synthesized into the voice of Simone.
	
	                    SIMONE / VIKTOR
	          ... I'm Simone.   
	
	The other CAST MEMBERS laugh nervously.

	              (from Viktor's
	               speakerphone)
	          Obviously.  Who else?
	
	                    SIMONE / VIKTOR
	              (from speaker phone)
	          I just want to start by apologizing
	          for my "process" --

	The CAST are hunched over the speakerphone.
	
	                    MAC
	          -- No.  No.  I'm completely
	          simpatico.  On my last film I was
	          playing a schizophrenic so I made
	          them give me two dressing rooms.
	
	                    HAL
	              (an aside)
	          So committed.
	
	                    SIMONE (O.S.)
	          Well thank you for your
	          understanding.  I know it's an
	          unusual way to work but I just find
	          I relate better to people when
	          they're not actually there.
	
	                    LOTUS
	          Of course, of course.
	
	                    SIMONE (O.S.)
	          I don't have much to say except
	          that I know it's going to be a
	          great project, if we all just trust
	          Mr. Taransky's vision.  Always do
	          what Mr. Taransky says.  If in
	          doubt, do it the Taransky way.
	
	They all nod vigorously in agreement.
	
	                    SIMONE (O.S.)
	          I know we're going to make a
	          wonderful movie together.
	
	                    LOTUS
	              (nodding in agreement)
	          Wonderful movie.
	
	                    HAL
	          Together, absolutely.
	
	EXT.  SOUNDSTAGE - DUSK
	
	VIKTOR removes his own garbage from his soundstage.  A young
	cleaning woman, VIVIAN, wheeling a janitor's cart,
	tentatively approaches.

	          Mr. Taransky...
	
	                    VIKTOR
	              (referring to the stage)
	          No one goes in there.
	
	                    VIVIAN
	          Oh, I know.
	
	Vivian hesitantly hands Viktor a publicity photo of SIMONE.
	
	                    VIVIAN
	          If it's not too much trouble. 
	          Could you...?
	
	                    VIKTOR
	          Of course...
	
	                    VIVIAN
	              (hesitant about broaching
	               the subject)
	          This last year I was... going
	          through some things.
	              (shaking her head at the
	               memory)
	          Awful, awful... things.  But when I
	          saw Simone in "Sunrise"... what she
	          did... in the scene in the
	          fireworks factory...
	              (face lighting up)
	          ... suddenly everything made sense. 
	          My friends, family, doctors --
	          nobody could reach me -- but
	          Simone, she really... spoke to me.
	
	Viktor is touched by the heartfelt testimony.
	
	                    VIKTOR
	          She'll be happy to sign it.

	                    HAL
	          Viktor, Clyde simply has to get
	          close to Simone in this scene!  He

	          There's... a wall between you --

	          That's why --

	          -- No.  No.  A real wall.
	              (describing a wall with
	               his hands within the
	               green space)
	          You ran right through it.
	
	                    HAL
	              (confused)
	          How did the wall get there?
	
	                    VIKTOR
	          I can't explain it to you now --
	          you'll see when it's all put
	          together.
	              (walking away)
	          Anyway, we got it a couple of takes
	          ago.  Let's move on.
	
	Hal, dumbfounded, tentatively touches the non-existent wall.

	              (making a correction)
	          Smaller teardrops next time.
	
	Simone's tears retreat into her eyes.
	
	                    VIKTOR
	          It's not working.  It's not alive. 
	          Let's try it again.
	
	She repeats the line.  Viktor mimes the performance.
	
	                    SIMONE
	              (teardrops arriving on
	               cue)
	          -- What you don't understand,
	          Clyde, is that love is like a wild
	          flower, but that flower only grows
	          on the edge...
	              (dramatic pause)
	          ... of a very high cliff.
	
	Simone FREEZES.
	
	                    VIKTOR
	          Perfect, Simone.
	
	Viktor returns SIMONE to her neutral background.
	
	                    VIKTOR
	          I'm only sorry you still have to
	          work with flesh and blood for the
	          time being -- as user friendly as
	          you are, even I can't manufacture
	          an entire cast.
	
	"To Vivian.  Love, Simone" -- VIKTOR writes on the publicity
	shot.  He applies lipstick and adds a kiss to the photo.
	
	Viktor wipes his mouth and looks to SIMONE on his screen --
	she is waiting patiently, as usual.
	
	                    VIKTOR
	          We are going to have to change our
	          plans, Simone -- you have no idea
	          what an affect your performance is
	          having on people.  We can't stop
	          now.  There's too much to say --
	          these films they speak, they speak
	          to the human condition.  We're
	          changing lives.  No, revealing the
	          truth now would be too cruel.
	              (searching for more
	               justification)
	          Anyway, when you're seeking a
	          greater truth -- in the work -- you
	          are not so concerned with the
	          lesser truths along the way.
	
	Simone doesn't appear convinced.
	
	                    SIMONE / VIKTOR
	          You're going to get in a lot of
	          trouble, Mr. Taransky.
	
	                    VIKTOR
	              (irritated at her pricking
	               his conscience)
	          Why do you have to bring that up? 
	          There's always risk -- life's a
	          risk.  It's worth it.  Besides, how
	          could something so lovely be a
	          crime?
	              (regarding her tenderly)
	          Well, I think we've done enough for
	          today.  You've been cooped up in
	          there too long.  How about you and
	          me go out on the town?  They're
	          expecting us.
	
	He turns to a copy of "The Echo".  A photo of Viktor at the
	gate of his Malibu home.  "SIMONE HELD CAPTIVE - Self
	proclaimed Svengali Keeps Star Out Of Limelight".  Viktor
	puts Simone to sleep and picks up a briefcase.
	
	INT.  HOTEL LOBBY - NIGHT
	
	VIKTOR, briefcase in hand, strides through the lobby of an
	opulent hotel.  He approached the CONCIERGE.
	
	                    VIKTOR
	          I'm checking in a special guest...
	              (obviously conspiratorial)
	          ... Miss Enomis.
	
	The Concierge straightens as he recognizes Viktor from a copy
	of "Variety".  Headline: "Taransky Rides Ingenue's Coat-Tails
	To Three Picture Deal".
	
	                    CONCIERGE
	          Miss Enomis, yes.
	
	                    VIKTOR
	          Miss Enomis demands her privacy. 
	          You will switch off all
	          surveillance cameras.  I will
	          escort Miss Enomis to her room
	          alone via the rear exit.  She will
	          require no help with her luggage. 
	          She does not wish to be disturbed
	          at any time for any reason.  She
	          will be departing for a function
	          tonight at eight sharp.
	              (tipping him with a
	               hundred dollar bill)
	          I'm sure I can rely on your
	          discretion.  Do you understand?
	
	                    CONCIERGE
	              (passing the key to
	               Viktor)
	          Oh, I understand.
	
	As Viktor departs, the Concierge holds the registration card
	to the mirror.
	
	ENOMIS becomes SIMONE.
	
	The Concierge picks up his phone.
	
	INT.  HOTEL ROOM - NIGHT
	
	VIKTOR enters the hotel suite.  We see a montage of scenes --
	Viktor revelling in his masquerade.
	
	A)  VIKTOR pulls down the covers of a bed and rolls around in
	    the sheets to give it a slept-in look.
	
	B)  VIKTOR sprays cologne in the bed.
	
	C)  VIKTOR tosses skimpy lingerie on the floor of the closet.
	
	D)  VIKTOR eats several candy bars from the mini-bar.
	
	E)  VIKTOR puts one of his own movies in the DVD player.
	
	F)  VIKTOR writes a note on the bedside pad.
	
	G)  In the bathroom, shower running, VIKTOR attempts to open
	    a tampon -- it shoots out of the applicator like a penny
	    rocket.
	
	H)  VIKTOR cuts a lock of "faux" hair from a Simone wig and
	    scatters it on the counter.
	
	I)  VIKTOR shakes open a bag of toiletries, the toothbrush
	    bouncing into the toilet bowl.  He retrieves it.
	
	J)  VIKTOR looks through the drapes of the hotel window -- a
	    jam of PRESS PHOTOGRAPHERS has congregated outside the
	    rear entrance.
	
	K)  VIKTOR shines a lamp against a doll casting a life-size
	    shadow on the drapes.  A "walking" silhouette is visible
	    to the media on the street.
	
	L)  VIKTOR writes a message in lipstick on the mirror -- "I
	    LOVE YOU V--".
	
	VIKTOR is interrupted by a knock on the door.  He looks at
	his watch.
	
	                    VIKTOR
	              (peering through the
	               peephole)
	          Who is it?
	
	                    WOMAN'S VOICE
	              (from other side of door)
	          It's... Simone.
	
	Viktor smiles.
	
	EXT.  HOTEL - REAR ENTRANCE - NIGHT
	
	VIKTOR stands at the rear entrance of the hotel with a leggy
	YOUNG WOMAN wearing a coat over her head.  A HOTEL DOORMAN
	keeps back the growing horde of REPORTERS.
	
	Viktor's limousine waits at the curb.  The coated woman
	starts towards the car but Viktor holds her back.
	
	                    VIKTOR
	          Not yet.
	              (scrutinizing the crowd)
	          Where's "Matinee"?  There they are. 
	          Okay, I think everyone's here. 
	          Now!
	
	Viktor and the young woman run the gauntlet to the car,
	providing a perfect albeit restricted photo-op for the
	paparazzi.
	
	                    PHOTOGRAPHER 1
	          Simone!
	
	                    ECHO PHOTOGRAPHER
	          Over here, sweetheart!
	
	                    PHOTOGRAPHER 3
	          Come one Simone, take it off, baby!
	
	                    PHOTOGRAPHER 4
	          We got a job to do!
	
	The car door slams shut as the pack descends.  MAX SAYER and
	MILTON are amongst the frustrated reporters.  The limo
	screeches away.  A POLICE MOTORCYCLIST prevents anyone
	following.
	
	The frustrated REPORTERS assess their efforts.
	
	                    PHOTOGRAPHER 1
	          I think I got a piece of her ear.
	
	                    ECHO PHOTOGRAPHER
	          I didn't get shit.
	
	                    MILTON
	              (emerging from the pack,
	               to Max)
	          Ten feet from a living Goddess...
	
	INT.  MISS ENOMIS'S HOTEL SUITE - NIGHT
	
	MAX SAYER pays off the CONCIERGE.  His assistant, MILTON,
	begins to collect "evidence" of the celebrity -- dusting for
	fingerprints, etc.  Max rubs pencil into the impression on
	the bedside notepad revealing the message -- "The meaning of
	life is that it ends".
	
	                    MAX
	              (interrupting Milton's
	               work)
	          Leave me for a moment.
	
	Milton and the Concierge depart.
	
	Max is alone.  He looks around the room.
	
	A)  MAX enters the bathroom.  He picks up a drinking glass
	    and inspects it closely before placing it in a sealed
	    plastic bag.
	
	B)  MAX examines the wet soap from the shower and also places
	    it in a plastic bag.
	
	C)  MAX picks up the used toothbrush, puts it to his lips
	    before placing it in a plastic bag.
	
	D)  MAX gently places his hands on the toilet seat.
	
	E)  MAX enters the bedroom.  He carefully removes a slip from
	    a pillow.  He folds it meticulously, appearing to breathe
	    in its scent as he places it in a plastic bag.
	
	F)  Finally, MAX kneels and gazes at "Simone's" unmade bed. 
	    He slowly slides into the bed and slips beneath the same
	    sheets recently vacated by Viktor.
	
	INT.  HALLWAY - OUTSIDE HOTEL SUITE - NIGHT
	
	MILTON, ear pressed against the door, tries to listen inside.
	
	INT.  VIKTOR TARANSKY'S LIMOUSINE - NIGHT
	
	VIKTOR and the COATED WOMAN have finally left the PAPARAZZI
	in their wake.  Viktor gently removes the coat from over her
	head.
	
	Although the woman is impossible beautiful, she is not
	Simone.  FAITH is Simone's latest stand-in and decoy.  Viktor
	and Faith are still pressed together against one side of the
	limousine.
	
	                    VIKTOR
	              (not quite able to avert
	               his eyes from her
	               telescopic legs)
	          Thank God for you, Faith.  I know
	          this is above and beyond the call
	          of duty for a stand-in.  You don't
	          know what a service you're
	          performing for Simone -- shielding
	          her from those animals.
	
	                    FAITH
	          No, thank God for you, Mr.
	          Taransky.  How many men would go
	          to so much trouble to protect a
	          woman?
	
	Neither Viktor nor Faith seem inclined to move from their
	intimate position.
	
	                    VIKTOR
	          You understand you'll have to come
	          back to my place to keep them off
	          the, er...
	              (his nose close to Faith's
	               neck)
	          ... scent.
	
	                    FAITH
	          Of course.
	
	                    VIKTOR
	              (meeting her gaze)
	          You look so, so...
	
	                    FAITH
	          ... so much like her?
	
	                    VIKTOR
	          Yes, of course, but very beautiful
	          in your own right.
	
	                    FAITH
	          I do find myself physically
	          attracted to you, Mr. Taransky.
	
	Their lips are now tantalizingly close.
	
	                    VIKTOR
	          Viktor.
	
	INT.  VIKTOR'S MALIBU HOUSE - NIGHT
	
	VIKTOR'S HEAD hits the sofa in his living room, closely
	followed by FAITH on top of him.
	
	Faith tears at his clothes and her own, ravenous.  Viktor
	hardly resists.  In the midst of the wild caresses, Faith
	murmurs in his ear.
	
	                    FAITH
	          Do whatever you do to Simone.
	
	Viktor freezes.
	
	                    VIKTOR
	          What?... What did you say?
	
	                    FAITH
	          Do what you do to Simone.
	
	                    VIKTOR
	          What I do to Simone?
	
	                    FAITH
	          Yes, call me Simone.
	
	                    VIKTOR
	          Simone?
	
	                    FAITH
	              (still tearing at his
	               clothes)
	          Yes, yes, again, again.  Do what
	          you do to Simone.  I want to know
	          what it's like to be her just for
	          one night.
	
	                    VIKTOR
	              (confused)
	          You're with me to be close to her?
	
	                    FAITH
	              (panting)
	          Is that a problem?
	
	As Viktor ponders the question, Faith begins to do Simone's
	deathbed speech from "Sunrise, Sunset".
	
	                    FAITH
	          "Why are we here?  Is that what
	          you're asking, Jack?... Why are we
	          here?  No why.  Just here".
	
	                    VIKTOR
	              (this is too much for
	               Viktor)
	          Please put your clothes on
	
	Viktor gets up from the sofa, leaving the frustrated Faith to
	straighten her clothes.
	
	EXT.  FUTURISTIC LANDSCAPE - "ETERNITY FOREVER" - DAY
	
	The finished scene with SIMONE and HAL plays ON A SCREEN.
	
	INT.  SCREENING ROOM - STUDIO - DAY
	
	VIKTOR watches the rough cut of "ETERNITY FOREVER" with
	ELAINE and daughter, LAINEY.  As usual, they are mesmerized
	by the breath-taking beautiful SIMONE.  The scene ends.  The
	light go up.
	
	                    ELAINE
	          Stunning, Viktor.  The Hollywood
	          Foreign Press is going to eat this
	          up.
	
	                    VIKTOR
	          Thank you.
	              (turning to his daughter)
	          What did you think, Lainey?
	
	                    LAINEY
	          One thing bothered me.
	
	                    VIKTOR
	          I know, Hal is as stiff as always.
	
	                    LAINEY
	          No, not that.  I was just wondering
	          -- in the bedroom scene in reel two
	          why did Simone have no reflection
	          when she walked in front of that
	          mirror?
	
	Viktor is shocked, busted.  He covers it with a laugh.
	
	                    VIKTOR
	              (ashen-faced)
	          I wondered if you'd spot that. 
	          You've got a good eye, Lainey.  I'm
	          proud of you.
	
	Elaine looks at Viktor for an explanation.
	
	                    VIKTOR
	          I got them to remove the
	          reflection.  The mirror's metaphor 
	          -- to show how her character's
	          inwardly dead.
	
	                    ELAINE
	          That's genius, Viktor.  Was that
	          Simone's idea?
	
	                    VIKTOR
	              (sarcastic, annoyed at the
	               suggestion)
	          Who else?  It's always Simone's
	          idea.
	
	                    LAINEY
	              (not quite convinced)
	          So that accounts for the lack of a
	          shadow in reel six?
	
	                    VIKTOR
	          Precisely.
	
	EXT.  STUDIO LOT - NIGHT
	
	VIKTOR escorts ELAINE and LAINEY to Elaine's car parked
	outside the theater.
	
	                    LAINEY
	              (as she gets into the car)
	          Good-night, Daddy.
	
	                    VIKTOR
	              (kissing Lainey good-bye)
	          Night, Lainey.
	
	Elaine and Viktor linger a moment outside the car.
	
	                    VIKTOR
	              (drawing Elaine aside)
	          Elaine, I don't know if it's a good
	          idea for Lainey to come to the
	          screenings -- mature content and
	          all that.
	
	Both look to Lainey.  From inside the car Lainey watches her
	parents.
	
	                    ELAINE
	              (impressed by his
	               responsible attitude)
	          Maybe you're right.
	              (gently teasing)
	          Twelve years after your daughter's
	          born you decide to become a father.
	
	                    VIKTOR
	          Better late than never.
	
	                    ELAINE
	              (softening)
	          I should fire you more often.  The
	          film's looking wonderful.
	
	                    VIKTOR
	          You really think so?
	
	                    ELAINE
	          Yes.  To be honest I never quite
	          saw this film before -- maybe it's
	          the way Simone is playing it -- but
	          what it's saying about the illusion
	          of permanence in everyday life, how
	          that's the only way we can love --
	          I think it's really going to mean
	          something.
	
	                    VIKTOR
	          Thank you.  I'll tell Simone you
	          liked it.
	
	                    ELAINE
	          I'd love to tell her myself.
	              (cajoling)
	          When are you going to let me meet
	          her?
	
	                    VIKTOR
	          Soon.  Soon.
	
	                    ELAINE
	          Everyone I know has met her,
	          Viktor.
	
	                    VIKTOR
	          Everyone you know is lying.
	
	                    ELAINE
	              (amused)
	          That's true.
	
	They instinctively kiss, more affectionate than before. 
	However, their embrace is interrupted by a click of a camera
	shutter from a nearby bush.
	
	                    VIKTOR
	          Damnit!
	
	The PHOTOGRAPHER has gone but so has the mood.
	
	                    ELAINE
	          You know how you can stop that. 
	          She has to get out more.
	              (climbing into the car)
	          See you at the premiere.
	
	Elaine climbs into her car and drives away.
	
	EXT.  PREMIERE - DUSK
	
	The premiere for "ETERNITY FOREVER" is everything VIKTOR had
	hoped for "SUNRISE, SUNSET".  Red carpet, klieg lights
	searching the sky, screaming FANS and PAPARAZZI.
	
	A limousine pulls up, door opens and VIKTOR steps out.  The
	crowd screams with excitement.
	
	Viktor waves.  Am expectancy in the crowd -- people crane
	their necks, waiting for someone else to step out of the open
	car door... but nothing.  The door shuts.  A disappointed
	murmer.  The limo drives off.
	
	VIKTOR walks down the carpet to little fanfare.
	
	                    PREMIERE REPORTER 1
	              (talking to camera)
	          -- What a night!  Anyone who's
	          anyone is here at the premiere of
	          "Eternity Forever," but waiting for
	          Simone to show may take even
	          longer.  We do have her director,
	          Viktor Taransky.
	              (ushering him over)
	          Viktor, Viktor, is Simone coming?
	
	                    VIKTOR
	              (slightly irritated by the
	               focus on the star)
	          You know Simone.
	
	Other reporters force their way into the interview.
	
	                    PREMIERE REPORTER 2
	          I hope she does show up.  Some of
	          her fans got here at dawn.  We
	          don't want to disappoint them.
	
	                    VIKTOR
	              (through a pained smile)
	          Well, I'm sure they're going to
	          love the movie.  I got the
	          inspiration --
	
	However, the reporter's attention has strayed.
	
	                    PREMIERE REPORTER 2
	          HARRY EPSON!
	
	The CAMERAS pivot away from Viktor.  Screen idol, HARRY
	EPSON, is walking up the carpet.
	
	                    PREMIERE REPORTER 2
	          Harry!  Harry!  Can we have a
	          minute?  What brings you here
	          tonight?
	
	                    HARRY
	              (waving to the fans)
	          I just came out to support my good
	          friend, Simone.
	
	                    PREMIERE REPORTER 2
	          There's a rumor that you're more
	          than just "good friends"?
	
	                    HARRY
	              (slightly irritated by the
	               invasion)
	          We've been seeing each other, sure,
	          but we'd rather keep our
	          relationship private.
	
	                    PREMIERE REPORTER 2
	              (believing she has a
	               scoop)
	          Do I hear the sound of... wedding
	          bells?
	
	                    HARRY
	              (suddenly losing it)
	          I can't believe you people!  No
	          wonder she never comes to these
	          things!
	
	Harry angrily pushes the camera away and strides up the
	carpet.
	
	VIKTOR watches him go, flabbergasted.
	
	EXT.  PREMIERE PARTY - NIGHT
	
	A packed, glitzy party.  VIKTOR enters without an escort. 
	Despite his recent rise to prominence he appears strangely
	alone.
	
	He observes ELAINE, champagne in hand, and the younger KENT,
	schmoozing with a group of industry MOVERS and SHAKERS.
	
	                    MOVER/SHAKER
	          Elaine!  The picture is a
	          revelation!
	
	                    ELAINE
	          Thank you.  I mean, it was a team
	          effort --
	
	Viktor cannot resist taking Elaine's photo with a small
	pocket camera.  Elaine is unaware of the shot.
	
	Viktor turns away -- just as Elaine turns to look at him.
	
	Viktor picks up a drink from the bar.  A DRUNK WOMAN, perched
	unsteadily on a nearby barstool, is knocking back Jack
	Daniels.  She accidentally brushes one of her discarded
	glasses off the bar.  Viktor catches it.
	
	A HAND taps Viktor on the shoulder.  HAL stands there
	accompanied by his "Eternity Forever" co-star, MAC.
	
	                    HAL
	          Is she here?
	
	                    VIKTOR
	          I'm fine, Hal.  How are you?
	
	                    HAL
	              (oblivious to his sarcasm)
	          Somebody said she was here.
	
	Mac spots the two glasses in Viktor's hands -- one glass
	lipstick-smeared.
	
	                    MAC
	          Oh my God, that's her glass!
	              (impulsively smelling
	               "Simone's" glass)
	          Jack Daniels, straight-up.  She is
	          my kind of woman.
	
	                    HAL
	              (looking anxiously around
	               the room)
	          Viktor, where is she?
	
	                    VIKTOR
	          She's around.
	
	                    MAC
	              (dawning on him, glancing
	               to the far side of the
	               packed room)
	          Jesus, Hal... she's in the Ladies
	          Room.
	
	                    HAL
	          You know I sometimes forget she has
	          bodily functions.
	
	                    VIKTOR
	              (unable to resist)
	          I know what you mean.
	
	                    HAL
	              (anxiously looking to the
	               restroom)
	          I have to talk to her about my
	          experimental film.  It's very...
	          experimental.
	
	                    MAC
	          Is that her? -- By the fountain.
	
	Far across the party, a WOMAN, with a Simone-type hairstyle,
	her back to us, is standing at the edge of a fountain.
	
	                    VIKTOR
	              (testy)
	          No.  In fact, between us, she
	          doesn't really exist.
	
	                    HAL
	              (ignoring him, calling out
	               to the woman)
	          Simone!
	
	                    MAC
	          SIMONE!
	
	Several nearby GUESTS, including ELAINE, overhear.  They talk
	over each other.
	
	                    GUEST 1
	          -- Simone's here!
	
	                    ELAINE
	              (slightly the worse for
	               drink)
	          -- When did she arrive?  Why didn't
	          someone tell me?
	
	                    GUEST 2
	          -- Where is she?
	
	                    MAC
	          -- She's by the fountain.
	
	                    GUEST 3
	          -- Simone, over here!
	
	                    GUEST 4
	          -- Simone!
	
	The rumor races through the party like wild-fire.  The GUESTS
	surge towards the fountain in a wave of mindless adoration.
	
	The Simone lookalike herself spins around.
	
	                    LOOKALIKE WOMAN
	          Simone!
	
	She gets knocked into the fountain.  Several other GUESTS
	also fall in the stampede.
	
	Back at the bar, the BARMAN, autograph book in hand, deserts
	his station.  Viktor is left alone with the drunk woman.
	
	LOCAL TV NEWS
	
	The limousines outside the hotel ballroom have been replaced
	with ambulances.  PARAMEDICS tend to GUESTS, bloodied and
	battered in the stampede caused by Simone's "appearance".
	
	                    ENTERTAINMENT REPORTER
	              (into microphone)
	          -- Forget "Eternity Forever", the
	          big news tonight was the surprise
	          appearance of Simone.  Even these
	          seen-it-all superstars are
	          apparently not immune to Simone
	          fever and the resulting stampede
	          forced organizers to bring the
	          event to an early end.  I spoke
	          with some of the departing guests
	          about their encounter with
	          Hollywood's most reluctant
	          superstar.
	
	CUTS of interviews with VARIOUS bruised GUESTS.
	
	                    EXECUTIVE 3
	          -- I would say, even more beautiful
	          in person, you have to see her to
	          believe her.
	
	                    MALE GUEST 1
	          -- I can't reveal what we spoke
	          about.  It was... personal.  Simone
	          and I go back a long way.
	
	                    FEMALE GUEST 1
	          -- When she talks to you, for that
	          moment, you are the only other
	          human being in the room.
	
	                    FEMALE GUEST 2
	              (dress torn)
	          -- I really don't know what the
	          fuss is about.  So over-rated. 
	          She's done one film.  Talk to me
	          when she's had the kind of career
	          I've had.
	
	                    MALE GUEST 2
	          -- I do expect her to be nominated,
	          yes.
	
	We return to the live shot of the ENTERTAINMENT REPORTER.
	
	                    ENTERTAINMENT REPORTER
	          Fortunately, Simone was not amongst
	          the injured and was spirited away
	          as mysteriously as she arrived.
	
	EXT.  ECHO OFFICES - DAY
	
	Max Sayer's car is parked outside of the Echo Building.
	
	INT.  ECHO OFFICES - DAY
	
	In the ECHO war room, MAX SAYER is agitated.  He paces back
	and forth, railing at a table of cowering STAFFERS.
	
	                    MAX
	          -- She goes to a major, Hollywood,
	          A-list party and we don't get an
	          interview, a comment, we don't even
	          get a photograph?  Is that what
	          you're telling me?
	
	                    ECHO PHOTOGRAPHER
	          Nobody got a photograph.  Nobody
	          ever gets a photograph.
	
	                    MILTON
	          We've got our best people on it,
	          Mr. Sayer.
	
	                    MAX
	          24-hour tail on Taransky?
	
	                    MILTON
	          Shutter bugs camped outside any
	          place he goes, every concierge and
	          maitre d' on the take.  But this
	          Simone woman is good.
	
	                    MAX
	              (referring to a
	               "Confidential" FBI
	               report)
	          Obviously the name isn't real --
	          she's using an assumed identity,
	          travels under a false name, checks
	          into hotels with an alias.  She
	          never stays in the same place two
	          nights in a row.  Anything on the
	          satellite photos?
	              (irritated)
	          What about the fingerprints?  What
	          happened when we dusted that hotel
	          suite?
	
	MILTON holds up a glass taken from the hotel.
	
	                    MILTON
	          Well, we got some of Taransky's
	          fingerprints, a lot of your
	          fingerprints... but none of hers.
	
	                    MAX
	              (interest piqued)
	          Which means they're significant.
	              (beat)
	          Incriminating.
	              (beat)
	          Perhaps, criminal.
	              (getting excited)
	          She's hiding her past.  She's
	          hiding her past.
	
	Max ponders the revelation.
	
	                    MAX
	          Of course -- no one's that perfect,
	          that pure.  You know I had
	          something on Mother Teresa.  But
	          then she died and it wasn't worth
	          it anymore.
	              (approaching a computer)
	          I know how to flush out this Simone
	          -- a tell-all story from her
	          childhood.
	
	                    MILTON
	              (impressed)
	          My God, you've got one?
	
	                    MAX
	              (offering Milton a seat in
	               front of the computer)
	          I will when you're finished writing
	          it.
	
	MILTON hesitates, questioning his journalistic ethics.
	
	                    MAX
	              (disappointed in his
	               protege)
	          Am I wasting my time with you? 
	          When she sues to protect her
	          privacy, she'll have to appear in a
	          public courtroom to do it.
	
	                    MILTON
	              (under his breath)
	          Long live the First Amendment.
	
	                    MAX
	          Sometimes you have to tell a small
	          lie to get to the bigger truth.
	              (to his nervous
	               photographer)
	          As for a photo -- if you can't do

	EXT.  STUDIO LOT - DAY
	
	"MILLION DOLLAR REWARD FOR PHOTO OF SIMONE!" -- Is the
	headline on the cover of The ECHO.  VIKTOR is reading the
	magazine as he makes his way through the studio lot.
	
	He looks up to see several studio carts parked outside his
	soundstage.  A group of STUDIO EXECUTIVES, led by ELAINE, is
	trying to break into the "CLOSED SET".  VIKTOR runs towards
	the door, throwing himself between the door and the
	executives.
	
	                    VIKTOR
	          -- You can't go in there!
	
	                    ELAINE
	          -- We have to talk to her, Viktor!
	
	                    EXECUTIVE 1
	          -- We know she's in there!
	
	Viktor glares at the SECURITY GUARD who shrugs weakly.
	
	                    VIKTOR
	              (struggling to hold them
	               back)
	          -- Why?  What's all this about?
	
	                    EXECUTIVE 2
	              (waving a spreadsheet)

	                    EXECUTIVE 3
	          -- They're in the toilet.
	
	                    ELAINE
	          -- She has to get out there and
	          sell the film.
	
	                    VIKTOR
	          -- What do you want her to do, go
	          door-to-door -- ?
	
	                    EXECUTIVE 1
	          -- Even Garbo would be on the talk
	          show circuit if she was alive
	          today.
	
	                    VIKTOR
	              (irritated)
	          -- It's precisely because she
	          doesn't crave the limelight that
	          people love her.  I told you, she's
	          only about the work.

	              (waving the front page of
	               The Echo)

	          famous for her no-shows than her
	          shows.
	
	                    ELAINE
	          -- It's starting to look like she
	          doesn't support the film or you,
	          Viktor.
	              (trying to squeeze past
	               Viktor)
	          If you can't handle her, I will.
	
	                    VIKTOR
	              (blocking her path)
	          Not now.  She's emotional.  Her
	          mother dies today.  Scene forty-two
	          of "Good For Nothing".  It's not a
	          good time.
	
	Elaine and the executives are not convinced, they overpower
	Viktor.
	
	                    VIKTOR
	          No!  Please, don't go in there!
	
	Too late.  Elaine and the suits force the lock and enter.
	
	INT.  VIKTOR'S SOUNDSTAGE - DAY
	
	ELAINE and the EXECUTIVES stop in their tracks -- confronted
	with the surreal sight of the lone computer station in the
	vast soundstage.  A desperate VIKTOR catches up with them.
	
	                    EXECUTIVE 1
	          Where is she?
	
	                    EXECUTIVE 2
	          She's not here.
	
	                    VIKTOR
	          Elaine... I...
	
	Elaine wanders over to the idle computer with a knowing
	smile.
	
	                    ELAINE
	          So, the secret's finally out,
	          Viktor.
	
	                    VIKTOR
	          -- I can explain.
	
	                    ELAINE
	          -- I don't think that's necessary. 
	          I think it's perfectly clear.  I
	          should have guessed -- it all makes
	          sense now... it's why she never
	          goes anywhere, never seen in
	          public...
	
	Viktor lowers his head, resigned to his fate.
	
	                    ELAINE
	          She's into computers.
	
	Viktor looks up.
	
	                    EXECUTIVE 1
	              (nodding in agreement)
	          Probably spends her whole life in
	          chat rooms.
	
	                    EXECUTIVE 2
	          It's the one place she can be
	          herself.
	
	                    EXECUTIVE 3
	          Anonymous.
	
	Viktor seizes on the opportunity.
	
	                    VIKTOR
	              (adopting a serious tone)
	          It's worse than you think.  She's
	          extremely agoraphobic -- has a
	          morbid fear of people and germs. 
	          In a way I'm relieved you... found
	          out.
	
	The Executives are taken aback by the shocking revelation.
	
	                    VIKTOR
	          The premiere was the first time
	          I've convinced her to venture out
	          and it just confirmed her worst
	          nightmares.
	
	                    ELAINE
	              (concerned)
	          Viktor, you should have said
	          something.
	
	                    VIKTOR
	          She doesn't want pity.
	
	                    ELAINE
	              (seeing a new side of
	               Viktor)
	          You're so good to protect her like
	          this.
	
	Viktor shrugs modestly.
	
	                    VIKTOR
	              (to the Executives,
	               conceding)
	          I'll tell you what.  I know how
	          much this means to you.  I'll try
	          to get her to plug the film.
	              (beat)
	          I'm not promising anything but
	          maybe she'll do a talk show --
	          taped.
	
	                    ELAINE
	          Oh, make it live -- please, Viktor.
	
	                    VIKTOR
	          I'll try.  Maybe live but remote. 
	          She'll never go to them.
	
	                    EXECUTIVE 1
	          We understand.  Thank you, Viktor.
	
	                    EXECUTIVE 2
	          Give her our best.
	
	Satisfied, the Executives make their way out of the
	soundstage.
	
	                    EXECUTIVE 1
	              (aside to a colleague)
	          That agoraphobia -- it's like a
	          plague.
	
	                    EXECUTIVE 2
	          It's out of control in Europe.
	
	Viktor and Elaine are left alone.
	
	                    VIKTOR
	          I'm sorry I didn't get a chance to
	          introduce you to Simone at the
	          premiere.  There wasn't time with
	          the riot and everything.
	              (picking up a framed photo
	               from the work station)
	          But she wanted you to have this.
	
	The photograph shows ELAINE, slightly inebriated at the
	premiere, SIMONE standing slightly behind her.
	
	                    ELAINE
	          She was there.  She didn't by any
	          chance happen to mention me?
	
	                    VIKTOR
	          She said you were very beautiful.
	
	                    ELAINE
	              (flattered)
	          Really?
	
	                    VIKTOR
	              (blurting out)
	          Elaine, what are you doing tonight? 
	          Would you like to go somewhere --
	          dinner?
	
	                    ELAINE
	          I'd love to.  But aren't you
	          supposed to meet up with Simone?
	
	                    VIKTOR
	          Oh, yes.  Of course.  Don't I
	          always?
	
	Viktor watches Elaine make her way back to her studio cart.
	
	Viktor realizes he is still holding a copy of the National
	ECHO -- the headline, "MILLION DOLLAR REWARD FOR PHOTO OF
	SIMONE"!  Accompanied by a photo of intrepid reporter MAX
	SAYER.
	
	INT.  SUPERMARKET - NIGHT
	
	An unattended shopping cart, at the end of the frozen foods
	aisle, begins to mysteriously roll towards us.
	
	We discover VIKTOR, pulling the cart with fishing line, while
	at the same time shooting it with a video camera.
	
	INT.  SUPERMARKET - NIGHT
	
	Viktor's home video of the shopping cart plays on a TV. 
	However, now SIMONE is pushing the cart.  She wears
	sunglasses, her hair in curlers under a scarf.  Simone takes
	a Swanson Chicken Pot Pie out of a cabinet... then a box of
	cereal off a display.
	
	INT.  ECHO OFFICES - DAY
	
	MAX SAYER watches the video in his office, enraptured.  He
	rewinds the tape and replays the moment.
	
	                    MAX
	          She likes Apple Jacks... just like
	          me...
	
	Assistant MILTON enters.  He looks ill.
	
	                    MILTON
	          Mr. Sayer...
	
	                    MAX
	              (irritated at being
	               interrupted)
	          What do you want -- ?
	
	                    MILTON
	          Mr. Sayer, did we pay the million
	          bucks yet?
	
	                    MAX
	              (never averting his eyes
	               from the screen)
	          -- Cashier's check went out to our
	          anonymous tipster this morning --
	          worth every penny too.  Who says
	          there's no place for checkbook
	          journalism?  We'll be running
	          stills of this for months, then
	          release the whole tape -- we'll get
	          our money back -- maybe show it on
	          an exclusive pay-per-view event. 
	          Do you realize what we have here? 
	          We have the only independent
	          footage of Simone in existence.
	
	                    MILTON
	          We used to.
	
	Max's head snaps around.
	
	                    MILTON
	              (holding a copy of the
	               L.A. Times Calendar
	               section - "Simone Live")
	          She's doing Frank Brand on
	          Thursday.
	
	Max coughs.
	
	                    MAX
	          Get out.
	
	A TV
	
	The opening credits to "FRANK BRAND LIVE", a global cable
	show plays against a starscape -- images of famous
	politicians and world leaders interviewed by Frank.
	
	                    FRANK BRAND
	              (to camera)
	          Tonight on Frank Brand Live --
	
	INT.  ELAINE'S MANSION - DAY
	
	ELAINE, KENT and LAINEY watch the TV interview in Elaine's
	mansion with eager anticipation.
	
	                    FRANK BRAND
	          -- Since taking the nation by storm
	          with her debut movie, "Sunrise,
	          Sunset"...
	
	INT.  MAX SAYER'S OFFICE - THE ECHO - DAY
	
	MAX SAYER and assistant MILTON are also glued to their set.
	
	                    FRANK BRAND
	          ... no one's managed to land a live
	          TV interview with the fabulous, new
	          shooting starlet, Simone... until
	          now.
	
	INT.  VIKTOR'S SOUNDSTAGE - DAY
	
	Casually tacked up on the monitor is the MILLION DOLLAR CHECK
	from The ECHO.
	
	VIKTOR, face and body scanned by the computer, is making a
	final test of his equipment.  When he touches his hair, bats
	his eyes, moves his hands -- so does Simone.
	
	VIKTOR frantically tests several different backgrounds behind
	SIMONE from a library of images.  Rainforest.  Desert.  Ritzy
	hotel suite.  Moonscape.  Factory.
	
	                    SIMONE / VIKTOR
	          Make up your mind, Viktor.  Make up
	          your mind.
	
	He settles on the desert location.
	
	He also make a last-second change to Simone's wardrobe --
	selecting "TOO-TIGHT SWEATER".
	
	INT.  FRANK BRAND TV STUDIO - NIGHT
	
	FRANK BRAND talks to camera.
	
	                    FRANK BRAND
	          I'm happy to say she's agreed to
	          join us tonight from the set of her
	          new film.
	              (turning to the TV
	               monitor)
	          Welcome, Simone.
	
	The just-completed image of SIMONE appears on Brand's
	monitor.
	
	                    SIMONE
	          Wonderful to be with you, Frank.
	
	INT.  ELAINE'S MANSION - DAY
	
	KENT, referring to Simone, forgetting or not caring that
	Elaine is in the room.
	
	                    KENT
	          She is all woman.
	
	LAINEY shoots her mother's boyfriend a withering look.  She
	gets up and leaves the room.
	
	During the interview we cut between Frank Brand's studio,
	Viktor's soundstage and various viewer locations including
	Elaine's mansion, Max Sayer's office and various worldwide
	locations --
	
	A)  A lone AFGHANI SHEPHERD gazing at a Watchman.
	
	B)  A JAPANESE COUPLE watching TV in a capsule hotel room.
	
	C)  A CATHOLIC CARDINAL watching TV in the Vatican.
	
	INT.  FRANK BRAND TV STUDIO - NIGHT
	
	                    FRANK BRAND
	          Well, no one could accuse you of
	          being over-exposed, Simone.  Why
	          have you stayed so completely out
	          of the limelight?
	
	                    SIMONE
	              (shrugs)
	          I just think actors talk too much. 
	          Does the world really want to hear
	          your life story just because you've
	          got a movie opening Friday?
	
	                    FRANK BRAND
	          Of course, the only problem with
	          shying away from publicity these
	          days is that it tends to attract
	          more.
	
	VIKTOR is in his element, his effeminate gestures
	frighteningly convincing.
	
	                    SIMONE
	              (from TV)
	          Don't I know it.  That's the only
	          reason I'm here now -- to put the
	          attention back where it belongs, on
	          Mr. Taransky's film.
	
	                    FRANK BRAND
	          You don't secretly want the
	          attention?
	
	                    SIMONE
	          I'm not even sure I deserve it. 
	          After tonight I'll have almost as
	          much screen time on your show as I
	          do in my movies.  How is that
	          healthy for a performer?
	
	IE.  ELAINE'S MANSION - DAY
	
	LAINEY has turned her back on the TV screen, preferring to
	look through a book.
	
	                    SIMONE
	              (from TV)
	          Because, you have to understand,
	          Frank, these interviews -- none of
	          this is real.  Who I am on screen
	          and who I really am are two totally
	          different people.
	
	                    FRANK BRAND
	          Who are you really?
	
	                    SIMONE
	          That's a good question.
	              (beat)
	          As Nietzsche said, "Whenever a man
	          strives long and hard to appear
	          someone else..."
	
	                    LAINEY
	              (reading from a bookmarked
	               page, along with Simone)
	          "... he ends up finding it is
	          difficult to be himself again."
	
	                    FRANK BRAND
	          Well put.
	
	Lainey regards the name written on the inside page -- "Viktor
	Taransky".
	
	INT.  MAX SAYER'S OFFICE - THE ECHO - DAY
	
	TV playing in the background, MAX and MILTON are hurriedly
	leafing through travel books and scrutinizing maps.
	
	                    MAX
	              (focusing on the desert
	               background behind Simone)
	          I know where that is... I know...
	
	INT.  FRANK BRAND TV STUDIO - NIGHT
	
	                    FRANK BRAND
	          Change of topic.  Simone, you've
	          been romantically linked to dozens
	          of men in the press -- Mick Jagger,
	          Stephen Hawking, Fidel Castro...
	          and most recently Viktor Taransky. 
	          Is there a Mr. Right in there
	          somewhere?
	
	                    SIMONE
	          I'd rather not discuss my private
	          life.
	              (gently)
	          But Viktor and I are inseparable.
	
	INT.  ELAINE'S MANSION - DAY
	
	ELAINE's face drops, slightly hurt.
	
	                    KENT
	          You dog, Viktor!
	
	                    SIMONE
	              (from TV)
	          I literally wouldn't be here today
	          without him.
	
	INT.  VIKTOR'S SOUNDSTAGE - DAY
	
	VIKTOR accidentally taps his finger on the keyboard in his
	excitement -- the cursor aimed at "TEARS" command.  SIMONE'S
	EYES start to well with tears -- a tear spills from her eye.
	
	                    FRANK BRAND
	          Would you like a moment, Simone?
	
	Viktor notices, quickly withdrawing his finger -- his
	startled expression instantly imitated by Simone.
	
	                    SIMONE
	          No, I'm okay.
	
	INT.  FRANK BRAND TV STUDIO - NIGHT
	
	                    FRANK BRAND
	          Let's talk about the work that you
	          care so much about.
	
	                    SIMONE
	          Sure.  Where would you like to
	          start?
	
	                    FRANK BRAND
	          How about the nudity?
	
	                    SIMONE
	          Nudity has just never been an issue
	          for me, Frank.  For me, clothes are
	          just an option.
	
	                    FRANK BRAND
	          What exactly was it that attracted
	          you to your first two projects?
	
	                    SIMONE
	              (unable to resist a smile)
	          I suppose the thing I like most
	          about the movies I'm in is that
	          they're not about special effects.
	
	Frank nods sagely.
	
	                    FRANK BRAND
	          They're better for it if I may say.
	
	INT.  VIKTOR'S SOUNDSTAGE - DAY
	
	The smile is suddenly wiped off VIKTOR's face by a blinking
	alert:
	
	        !!INSUFFICIENT MEMORY TO COMPLETE THIS TASK!!
	
	The pixels that form SIMONE start to break up.  Curiously, it
	is only Simone and not the background that is disintegrating.

	                    FRANK BRAND
	              (regarding the screen)
	          Well, we appear to be experiencing
	          satellite difficulties.  In case we
	          lose you, Simone, I want to thank
	          you --
	
	INT.  VIKTOR'S SOUNDSTAGE - DAY
	
	VIKTOR speaks again, his voice suddenly deeper.
	
	                    SIMONE / VIKTOR
	          Thank... YOU, FRANK.
	
	In horror Viktor hurriedly pulls the plug.  The feed goes
	blank on Frank Brand's screen.
	
	VIKTOR slumps over his computer in exhaustion.  Since SIMONE
	is still synced to his movements, the partially de-pixelated
	Simone also slumps.
	
	Viktor's cell phone rings.  Viktor picks up.
	
	                    VIKTOR / SIMONE
	          Hel--
	
	He remembers at the last second to switch off his voice
	synthesizer.
	
	                    VIKTOR
	              (into phone)
	          Hello.
	
	INT.  ELAINE'S MANSION - DAY
	
	We cut between the two sides of the conversation -- ELAINE on
	the phone, KENT still watching post-interview analysis on the
	TV.
	
	                    ELAINE
	          -- Viktor, are you with her?  Is
	          she there?
	
	                    VIKTOR
	          No.
	
	An anxious beat.
	
	                    ELAINE
	          Are you and Simone...
	              (blurting it out)
	          ... getting married?
	
	                    VIKTOR
	              (taken aback by the
	               suggestion)
	          No, of course not!
	              (realizing the
	               significance of the
	               question)
	          Why?  Would you care if we were?
	
	                    ELAINE
	              (covering, realizing she
	               has given herself away)
	          Well, yes.  From a studio point of
	          view, it would be better if Simone
	          stayed single.
	              (quick change of topic)
	          Anyhow, I thought she came across
	          great tonight.  Intelligent, well
	          informed, a natural.  And touching. 
	          She was spectacular.
	
	                    VIKTOR
	          Thank you.
	
	A pause.
	
	                    ELAINE
	          Viktor, do you realize you always
	          do that?
	
	                    VIKTOR
	          Do what?
	
	                    ELAINE
	          Whenever I compliment Simone, you
	          take the credit.
	
	                    VIKTOR
	          I do?
	
	                    ELAINE
	          Yes, you do...
	              (shrug)
	          Anyway, tonight was a good start.
	
	                    VIKTOR
	          Excuse me?  Start?
	
	                    ELAINE
	          It's a crowded summer.  We need
	          every photo-opp, sound-byte and
	          column inch we can get.  Good
	          night, Viktor.
	
	Elaine hangs up.  Lainey approaches.
	
	                    LAINEY
	              (carefully broaching the
	               subject)
	          Mom, do you miss Dad?
	
	                    ELAINE
	              (she thinks)
	          Sometimes.  But, just when I think
	          your father's changing for the
	          better, I realize he's as self
	          absorbed as ever.  He took the
	          credit for Simone tonight.
	
	Lainey, coming to her father's defense, glancing at the
	Nietzsche book in her hand.
	
	                    LAINEY
	          I think Dad deserves more credit
	          than he gets.
	
	INT.  VIKTOR'S SOUNDSTAGE - LATER THAT NIGHT
	
	VIKTOR watches SIMONE on screen.  He is unusually anxious.
	
	As usual SIMONE is wearing a skimpy, provocative outfit as
	she awaits instructions on the screen.  For some reason
	Viktor becomes irritated by the image.
	
	                    VIKTOR
	              (to Simone)
	          Will you cover yourself up!?
	
	He hits a button.  A thick WOOL COAT clicks over her body.
	
	EXT.  NEW MEXICO DESERT - MORNING
	
	The ECHO newscar streaks through the bronze and purple
	desert.  MAX and his assistant MILTON emerge from the car.
	
	                    MAX
	          -- I've been here before! -- On my
	          honeymoon with my ex-wife.
	
	                    MILTON
	          Is that why she left you?
	
	Max holds a video print of SIMONE giving her FRANK BRAND
	interview.  He compares her desert location to the one in
	front of him.
	
	                    MAX
	              (pointing out a Joshua
	               tree)
	          You see, that's the exact same tree
	          and in the distance, there's the...
	              (voice trailing away)
	          ... mountain.
	
	Sure enough, the Joshua tree is identical but the mountain is
	now obscured by a ten-story Holiday Inn.
	
	Max and Milton are mystified -- they look back at the photo.
	
	                    MILTON
	          It's a hotel.
	
	                    MAX
	          I don't understand.
	
	                    MILTON
	          Could they have built that hotel
	          since yesterday?
	
	Max shakes his head, deeply concerned.
	
	                    MAX
	          Get in the car.
	
	INT.  VIKTOR'S SOUNDSTAGE - NIGHT
	
	VIKTOR has transformed his soundstage into a one-man
	publicity machine.  The floor is littered with photographs of
	SIMONE in various states of dress and undress.
	
	Using a sophisticated Photoshop computer program, VIKTOR
	constructs magazine spreads out of numerous previous magazine
	spreads -- "Time", "People", "Us", "Life", "Popular
	Mechanics".
	
	                    VIKTOR
	              (angrily into phone)
	          -- We don't do the photo shoot, you
	          don't get the cover... written
	          answers to written questions,
	          that's right... website interviews,
	          no problem.
	
	Viktor calls up a "DANCE OPTION".  Choosing from a HULA
	DANCER, a BELLY DANCER and a CLASSICAL BALLERINA, he removes
	Simone's head and places it on the body of the ballerina. 
	She begins to dance for him.
	
	He uses a program to construct childhood photographs of
	SIMONE and other childhood memorabilia.
	
	He employs backgrounds from numerous on-line library sources.
	With a quick cut and paste he is able to place Simone on a
	beach in San Tropez or a bicycle factory in Calcutta.
	
	                    VIKTOR
	              (muttering to himself)
	          You want exposure, Elaine?  I'll
	          give you over-exposure...
	
	INT.  ELAINE'S OFFICE - STUDIO - DAY
	
	ELAINE watches TV in her office.  She cannot change channels
	without finding Simone sitting in a chair giving generic
	answers.
	
	INT.  SIMONE INTERVIEW SET - DAY (ON ELAINE'S TV)
	
	                    SIMONE
	          I think "Eternity Forever" is my
	          finest work.
	
	                    SIMONE
	          I'm most proud of my work in
	          "Eternity Forever".
	
	                    SIMONE
	          I think people are going to love
	          "Eternity Forever".
	
	INT.  VIKTOR'S SOUNDSTAGE - NIGHT
	
	VIKTOR inspects a cut-out photograph of Simone in "ETERNITY
	FOREVER" costume.  He speaks to the photo.
	
	                    VIKTOR
	          Forgive me, Simone.
	
	EXT.  FASTFOOD RESTAURANT - DAY
	
	The photograph of Simone is emblazoned on a fast food drink
	cup -- a pyramid of cups promoting "ETERNITY FOREVER" Happy
	Meals.  Beneath the plastic pyramid is a SIMONE action figure
	in a convertible.
	
	INT.  VIKTOR'S MALIBU BEACH HOUSE - DAY
	
	         "ETERNITY FOREVER" HAS BIG FUTURE AT B.O.!
	
	Screams the banner headline in "Variety".
	
	            $$$IMONE - WINS 6TH WEEKEND IN A ROW
	
	Shouts the "Hollywood Reporter".
	
	The trade papers sit on the coffee table in front of VIKTOR
	who reclines on a leather sofa, watching TV, gazing lovingly
	at Simone.
	
	INT.  SIMONE INTERVIEW SET - DAY (ON VIKTOR'S TV)
	
	                    SIMONE
	          Of course, being a movie star is
	          wonderful, but I have so many other
	          ways I want to express myself --
	
	INT.  BOOKSTORE - DAY
	
	Various book titles are on display:
	
	            "SIMONE'S FAVORITE SOUTHERN RECIPES"
	
	            "HUMAN:KIND - The POETRY of SIMONE"
	
	                 "SIMONE'S 101 WAYS TO JOY"
	
	EXT.  DEPARTMENT STORE - DAY
	
	A banner in a window reads.  "In Stock: SIMONE'S EASY-WEAR
	FASHION".  Mannequins model the clothes.
	
	INT.  VIKTOR'S SOUNDSTAGE - DAY
	
	We focus on the screen where VIKTOR types in instructions:
	
	  SEARCH: "NUMBER 1 HITS - FEMALE ARTISTS/BILLBOARD CHARTS"
	
	  PERIOD: "LAST 40 YEARS"
	
	A list of the Number 1 hits for the last forty years promptly
	appears on the screen along with photographs of the
	artists --
	
	PATSY CLINE, ELLA FITZGERALD, ARETHA FRANKLIN, JANICE JOPLIN,
	CAROL KING, WHITNEY HOUSTON, MADONNA, etc.  Beneath the title
	of each song is a graphic representation of the music --
	"PITCH" and "RESONANCE".
	
	Viktor presses a button: "MORPH".  The audio waves converge.
	
	INT.  VIKTOR'S SOUNDSTAGE - DAY
	
	VIKTOR, wearing headphones, records his composite pop song. 
	As usual when he sings into his microphone, Simone also
	sings.  The catchy song is titled: "(If You Can't Believe In
	Yourself) Believe In Me".
	
	SIMONE APPEARS IN A MUSIC VIDEO.
	
	INT.  RECORD STORE - DAY
	
	The video for SIMONE's song plays on the video wall inside
	the record store.  TEENAGE GIRLS, buying CD's, dance
	adoringly in front of the screen, unaware that they are
	gyrating to the vocals of a middle-aged man.
	
	INSERT - "(If You Can't Believe In Yourself) Believe In Me"
	shoots up the Billboard charts.
	
	EXT.  OCEAN - DAY
	
	CLOSE UP on the name "SIMONE" painted on the stern of a
	luxury yacht.
	
	VIKTOR is at the helm, breathing in the clean air -- at last
	a moment to savor his success.  Simone's hit single plays on
	the yacht's stereo.  He looks at peace.
	
	EXT.  MARINA - DAY
	
	A TOURIST has his arm around SIMONE, having his photograph
	taken.  However, we discover that the Simone is only a
	lifesize cardboard cutout used by a STREET VENDOR to sell
	snapshots.  He also has cardboard cutouts of the POPE and
	ELVIS.
	
	MAX SAYER and MILTON walk by.
	
	Tying up his boat, VIKTOR's mood is abruptly shattered by the
	sight of Max and Milton walking down the pier towards him.
	
	                    MAX
	          Nice boat, Taransky.
	
	                    VIKTOR
	          It's a yacht.
	
	                    MAX
	          I know what you're up to.
	
	                    VIKTOR
	              (pushing past Max)
	          I don't have time for this, Sayer.
	
	                    MAX
	          I think you do.
	              (holding up his video
	               print of Simone in the
	               desert)
	          I know it's a fake.
	
	Viktor freezes.
	
	                    MAX
	          Got your attention now?
	
	Max compares the shot to one of the current desert location
	with the Holiday Inn in front of the mountain.
	
	                    MAX
	              (referring to the
	               photographs)
	          It's bogus.  You used an old
	          library shot for the background.
	
	                    VIKTOR
	              (ashen)
	          The background is.
	
	                    MAX
	          She was never in New Mexico.  She
	          never left the studio.
	
	Viktor is relieved that Max is only accusing him of faking
	the background.
	
	                    MAX
	              (referring to a large
	               bundle of other shots
	               under his arm)
	          I've done my homework.  I've
	          studied her.
	
	                    VIKTOR
	          -- I bet you have.
	
	                    MAX
	          -- I've looked at every piece of
	          publicity she's ever done, the
	          video in the supermarket, there's
	          no evidence she's ever left the
	          studio.
	              (afterthought)
	          Oh, and for some reason this woman
	          leaves no paper trail.  But I have
	          "obtained" a copy of your bank
	          accounts.  I know you have power of
	          attorney but so far you haven't
	          transferred one single solitary
	          cent to her.
	
	                    VIKTOR
	          I'm keeping it in trust.
	
	                    MAX
	          I know that's what you'd like us to
	          believe.  But I got to tell you --
	          embezzlement is a serious matter. 
	          Not to mention abduction.
	
	                    VIKTOR
	          Abduction?
	
	                    MAX
	          I don't buy the whole recluse scam. 
	          How are you doing it?  What is it --
	          drugs?  Blackmail?  Mind-control? 
	          All three?  What do you do -- keep
	          her locked in a box somewhere?
	
	Viktor flinches at the remark.
	
	                    VIKTOR
	          What is it exactly you want, Sayer?
	
	                    MAX
	          I want to see her.  Unless you show
	          me Simone live and in person I show
	          these pictures to the authorities.
	
	Viktor pauses, considering the threat.
	
	                    VIKTOR
	          Alright, Sayer, you've got a deal.
	
	                    MAX
	          Er,... good.
	
	                    MILTON
	          That's good.
	
	Viktor walks away leaving Max confused.
	
	The breeze whips the photos of SIMONE out of Max's hands and
	into the sea.
	
	INT.  CONCERT STADIUM - DUSK
	
	A vast, empty stadium.  On the stage, a lone microphone. 
	VIKTOR approaches, gazing out at the vast arena.  Several
	PROMOTERS and TECHNICIANS join him.
	
	                    PROMOTER
	          All ready, Mr. Taransky.  This time
	          tomorrow night, she'll be standing
	          right here in front of a packed
	          house.  We could have sold it out
	          twenty times.
	
	Viktor nods.
	
	                    TECHNICIAN
	          Soundcheck went perfect.  Laser
	          show ready to go.
	              (cautionary note)
	          I gotta say, you ordered an awful
	          lot of smoke.
	
	                    VIKTOR
	          That's the way she likes it.
	
	The Promoter glancing to the area in front of the stage,
	where a barrier has been erected.
	
	                    PROMOTER
	          After what you told us about the
	          death threats, the security guards
	          are under strict instructions never
	          to take their eyes off the crowd.
	
	                    VIKTOR
	          Excellent.
	
	Viktor hands each man a headshot of SIMONE signed with a
	kiss.
	
	                    VIKTOR
	          Simone wanted you to have these.
	
	                    TECHNICIAN
	              (visibly moved by the
	               gesture)
	          Wish her luck from us.
	
	                    VIKTOR
	          Oh, I will.
	              (afterthought)
	          Remember, no cameras, no
	          binoculars.
	
	EXT.  STADIUM - NIGHT
	
	In the shadow of the enormous stadium sits a control
	truck/tour bus, satellite dishes on the roof -- the lights
	from the laser-show inside the arena play off the truck.  The
	control truck shakes from the stomping of the crowd.
	
	                    CROWD
	          ... SI-MONE!  SI-MONE!  SI-MONE!...
	
	The door to the truck is marked, "SIMONE - Splendid Isolation
	Tour.  NO ENTRY".
	
	INT.  CONTROL TRUCK - BACKSTAGE - NIGHT
	
	VIKTOR sits alone at the mixing panel of a control truck.  On
	his monitors, a sea of humanity, chanting.
	
	                    CROWD
	          ... SI-MONE!  SI-MONE!  SI-MONE!...
	
	Viktor produces the "SIMULATION ONE" hard-drive from his
	jacket pocket and inserts it into the computer.
	
	SIMONE appears on the monitor.
	
	                    VIKTOR
	          Let's get you into hair and make
	          up.
	
	Simone's hair rapidly grows in a number of styles, eyelashes
	grow and are trimmed, eyeshadow of various shades paints
	across the lids.
	
	                    VIKTOR
	          Wardrobe.
	
	Viktor tries several outfits on Simone -- the clothes
	appearing to fabricate themselves on her body.  He settles
	for the most provocative outfit.
	
	Finger poised over the keyboard, Viktor glances to a monitor
	showing --
	
	INT.  STADIUM - CROWD - NIGHT
	
	ELAINE and LAINEY amongst the crowd, clapping their hands,
	stomping their feet and chanting.

	                    VIKTOR
	          Easier to make one hundred thousand
	          believe than just one.
	
	He scrolls to a program, marked "HOLOGRAM" and pushes the
	"ENTER" key.
	
	INT.  STADIUM - CONCERT STAGE - NIGHT
	
	Smoke fills the stage.  A strobe light show plays.  A booming
	ANNOUNCER is heard.
	
	                    ANNOUNCER
	          Ladies and gentlemen, Viktor
	          Taransky Promotions is proud to
	          present, live on stage, for the
	          debut concert of the "Splendid
	          Isolation" tour, the one, the only,
	          SI-MONE!
	
	A spotlight falls on the solitary figure of Simone, standing
	alone on the stage with a guitar over her shoulder (the only
	accompaniment) -- dwarfed by the huge stage.  However, on
	closer inspection, the spotlight is actually a laser beam
	creating a hologram.  Clouds of smoke and strobe lighting aid
	the illusion.
	
	The only clear view of Simone for the audience is provided by
	the enormous video screens on either side of the stage.  The
	CROWD stares up at the jumbotrons, blissfully unaware that
	they are watching a pre-recorded event.  Some watch the event
	on portable TVs.
	
	INT.  CONTROL TRUCK - BACKSTAGE - NIGHT
	
	CLOSE UP on the computer screen.  VIKTOR scrolls down a list
	of options -- "... HOUSTON, MIAMI, NEW YORK, L.A...."
	
	                    SIMONE
	              (from on stage)
	          I love you...
	
	He selects "L.A.".
	
	                    SIMONE
	          ... L.A.
	
	The crowd roars its approval.
	
	                    SIMONE
	          It's great to be here.
	
	INT.  STADIUM - CONCERT STAGE - NIGHT
	
	SIMONE -- her voice a seamless blend of several DIVAS --
	begins to sing her hit song, "(If You Can't Believe In
	Yourself) Believe In Me".  A verse of the song is sung in
	perfect Spanish.
	
	EXT.  VARIOUS LOCATIONS - NIGHT/DAY
	
	A)  On a jumbotron in Tokyo SIMONE's concert plays LIVE.
	
	B)  On a TV set on a West African beach, children dance to
	    SIMONE.
	
	C)  On a computer in a Bombay taxi, the driver and his
	    passengers gyrate to SIMONE webcast.
	
	INT.  CONTROL TRUCK - BACKSTAGE - NIGHT
	
	VIKTOR's face is reflected in a monitor showing a frenzied
	crowd gazing up at the jumbotron -- singing along, many in
	tears, overcome with emotion -- holding cigarette lighters
	aloft.  For a moment Viktor is in awe of his own wizardry --
	the grand illusionist.  Viktor is at the height of his
	powers.
	
	                    VIKTOR
	              (to the image of Simone on
	               his screen)
	          I don't know about you, Simone, but
	          I've never felt more alive.
	
	He snaps back to reality just in time to notice that the
	Simone hologram beam has wandered through her own microphone
	stand.
	
	                    VIKTOR
	          Damn!
	
	He adjusts the beam -- the rapturous crowd, transfixed by the
	TV screen, apparently fails to notice.
	
	INT.  STADIUM - CROWD - NIGHT
	
	We focus on a face in the crowd -- MAX SAYER.  His
	journalistic assignment temporarily forgotten, Max is singing
	along and waving his arms, tears rolling down his face, swept
	up in the moment.
	
	INT.  STADIUM - CONCERT STAGE - NIGHT
	
	SIMONE finishes her final number.
	
	                    SIMONE
	          Good-night.  Never stop believing.
	
	EXT.  STADIUM - EXIT - NIGHT
	
	A bin contains dozens of confiscated cameras and binoculars. 
	FANS exit the stadium through a tunnel.
	
	S-I-M-O-N-E is spelt out on the bare chests of six TEENAGE
	BOYS.  Other FANS wear "SIMONE - Splendid Isolation Tour"
	T-shirts and carry posters.  Several CONCERT GOERS speak to a
	TV NEWS CREW.
	
	                    FAN 1
	          -- I swear, she looked right at me.
	
	                    FAN 2
	          -- She was, like, ethereal.
	
	                    FAN 3
	          -- One moment she seemed to walk
	          right through her mike stand like
	          it wasn't even there.
	
	INT.  CONTROL TRUCK - BACKSTAGE - NIGHT
	
	The chanting crowd can be heard exiting.  VIKTOR, wearing
	lipstick is hastily signing a pile of souvenir programs with
	Simone's signature kiss.
	
	He is interrupted by a knock at the door.  Viktor irritably
	opens it.
	
	                    VIKTOR
	          I said I didn't want to be
	          interrupt --
	
	EXT.  CONTROL TRUCK - BACKSTAGE - NIGHT
	
	ELAINE and LAINEY stand at the foot of the trailer, a
	SECURITY GUARD nearby.
	
	                    VIKTOR
	              (face brightening)
	          My two favorite girls.
	
	                    ELAINE
	          Lainey and I just wanted to
	          congratulate...
	
	Regarding Viktor closely, Elaine's smile evaporates.
	
	                    ELAINE
	          ... Simone.
	
	                    VIKTOR
	          She's lying down.  She's exhausted.
	
	                    ELAINE
	              (suddenly cool)
	          I can imagine.
	
	Viktor is confused by their reaction.  Elaine yanks Lainey
	away.
	
	                    ELAINE
	          Thank Simone for the tickets.
	
	                    LAINEY
	              (calling back as she is
	               led away)
	          It was a great show, Dad...
	
	Viktor waves disconcertedly.
	
	                    VIKTOR
	          Where are you... going?
	
	As he returns to the trailer, Viktor catches sight of his
	lipstick-smeared mouth in the mirror on the inside of the
	trailer door.  He slams the side of the trailer in
	frustration.
	
	INT.  ELAINE'S MANSION - NIGHT
	
	ELAINE paces back and forth in front of her TV showing re-
	runs of the SIMONE concert.  KENT cannot take his eyes off
	the screen.
	
	                    ELAINE
	          I can't believe she's doing this --
	          taking advantage of him this way. 
	          It's cruel.
	
	                    KENT
	          Why?
	
	                    ELAINE
	          Obviously, this can't last.  She's
	          going to dump him.  Viktor won't be
	          able to take that.  He's too
	          sensitive.  It'll destroy him.
	
	                    KENT
	          Elaine, do you realize you can't
	          stop talking about Viktor?
	
	                    ELAINE
	              (not hearing)
	          I have to talk to her.
	
	Kent switches off the TV.
	
	                    KENT
	          I've been meaning to talk to you.
	
	Behind the open door, we find LAINEY eavesdropping.
	
	EXT.  VIKTOR'S MALIBU HOUSE - BEACH - DAY
	
	VIKTOR, deep in thought, stands at the water's edge, staring
	at the breaking waves.  LAINEY joins him.
	
	                    VIKTOR
	          Hey, Lainey.
	              (gently teasing her)
	          How's your love life?
	
	                    LAINEY
	          I do okay.  How about you?
	
	                    VIKTOR
	          You know me -- married to my work.
	
	                    LAINEY
	          I noticed.
	
	An awkward silence.
	
	                    LAINEY
	          Dad, you know I don't like to get
	          between you and mom but she's
	          feeling down right now.  She broke
	          up with Kent.
	
	                    VIKTOR
	              (buoyed by the news)
	          Really?  Too bad.
	
	                    LAINEY
	          She thinks you're with Simone.
	
	                    VIKTOR
	          Lainey, you know Simone and I don't
	          have a real relationship.
	
	                    LAINEY
	          I know but Mom doesn't.  Maybe if
	          it came from Simone, if Simone
	          spoke to Mom -- she could
	          straighten things out.
	              (shrug)
	          Dinner, maybe.
	
	                    VIKTOR
	          Dinner?  Dinner's difficult.  A
	          phone call?
	
	                    LAINEY
	          Too impersonal.  They have to meet
	          face-to-face.
	
	                    VIKTOR
	          I'll see what I can do.
	              (a thought occurs)
	          You know, Lainey.  I don't believe
	          you've ever once asked to meet
	          Simone.  Don't you like her?
	
	                    LAINEY
	          I love her but that doesn't mean I
	          need to meet her.
	
	Viktor is confused.
	
	                    LAINEY
	          Why?  So I can tell my friends at
	          school -- as if that validates my
	          life somehow.  What's Simone going
	          to say to a fourteen-year-old
	          anyhow?  She's going to be polite
	          because you're my father but we're
	          not suddenly going to become
	          friends -- we have nothing in
	          common.  It's not going to be real. 
	          Anyhow, she gets more beautiful in
	          my head every day.  Why kill the
	          dream?  What do they say, "don't
	          get too close to your idols, they
	          always disappoint you".
	
	Viktor gazes in wonder at his daughter, so much wiser than
	her years.
	
	                    VIKTOR
	          I love you, Lainey.
	
	                    LAINEY
	          I love you too, daddy.
	
	A car horn sounds outside the house.
	
	                    LAINEY
	          That's Mom.
	              (kissing him on the
	               forehead)
	          See you.
	
	She exits, leaving Viktor deep in thought.
	
	EXT.  LOS ANGELES FREEWAY - DAY
	
	Milli Vanilli's "GIRL YOU KNOW IT'S TRUE" plays on a car
	radio.  ELAINE, wearing a red power suit, drives home along
	the freeway in bumper-to-bumper traffic.  Her car phone
	rings.  She turns down the radio and picks up.
	
	                    ELAINE
	          Hello?
	
	                    SIMONE
	          Hello, is this Elaine?
	
	                    ELAINE
	          Yes -- oh my, God.  Is that you,
	          Simone?!  I've been wanting to talk
	          to you.
	
	                    SIMONE
	          Well, here I am.
	              (beat)
	          You look pretty today.  Red suits
	          you.
	
	                    ELAINE
	              (looking around the
	               freeway)
	          Where are you?
	
	                    SIMONE
	          Right beside you.  I borrowed
	          Viktor's car.
	
	Elaine looks to the inside lane.  SIMONE, wearing sunglasses,
	phone to her ear, drives alongside.  Simone waves, somewhat
	mechanically.  Elaine waves back.  They keep driving as they
	talk.
	
	INT.  VIKTOR'S CAR - DAY
	
	The sunglasses-clad SIMONE is a mannequin, seated in the
	driver's seat with her left hand on the phone obscuring her
	mouth, right hand attached to the steering wheel.
	
	Seat fully-reclined on the passenger side, VIKTOR drives the
	car by stretching a foot across to the pedals and steering
	with one hand, occasionally sneaking a glance to the road
	ahead.  He speaks on a phone through the Simone synthesizer.
	
	                    SIMONE / VIKTOR
	          I'd love to stop somewhere but I'm
	          late.  I'm on my way to see Viktor
	          now.
	
	                    ELAINE
	          No, I understand.  That's what I
	          want to talk about.  I don't know
	          if you know this, Simone, but
	          Viktor and I were married once.
	
	                    SIMONE / VIKTOR
	          I can't imagine how you ever let a
	          man like that go.  I owe Viktor
	          everything.
	
	                    ELAINE
	          I think he owes more to you.  But
	          that's not important now.  I know
	          what's going on between you two.
	
	                    SIMONE / VIKTOR
	          I want to reassure you, Elaine,
	          there's absolutely nothing going on
	          between Viktor and I.
	
	                    ELAINE
	              (rueful smile)
	          You don't have to protect my
	          feelings, Simone.  I don't blame
	          Viktor for falling in love with the
	          most desirable woman in the world.
	
	                    SIMONE / VIKTOR
	              (breaking character)
	          I'm not --
	              (correcting himself)
	          He's not.
	
	Viktor, losing concentration on his driving, drifts across
	his lane, almost striking Elaine's car -- swerving back at
	the last second.
	
	                    ELAINE
	          My God, are you alright, Simone?
	
	                    SIMONE / VIKTOR
	          Damn --
	              (struggling to stay in
	               her/his lane)
	          Yes -- I --
	              (regaining control)
	          -- I'm just a little tired. 
	          Listen, Elaine, Viktor and I --
	          it's strictly a working
	          relationship.  We could never be
	          anything else.  We're just so...
	          different.
	
	                    ELAINE
	          Exactly.  You're a household name
	          now.  You're moving in entirely
	          different worlds.  That's why I
	          hope you're not toying with Viktor.
	
	                    SIMONE / VIKTOR
	          It sounds like you still have
	          feelings for him.
	
	                    ELAINE
	          We have a daughter together.  I
	          just don't want to see Viktor get
	          hurt.
	
	                    SIMONE / VIKTOR
	          I don't know how many times I have
	          to say this, Elaine, but Viktor and
	          I are not in love.
	              (joking weakly)
	          I only make love to the camera.
	
	                    ELAINE
	          Simone, I recognize the shirt
	          you're wearing.  I gave it to
	          Viktor on his birthday.
	
	Over-correcting his steering, Viktor drifts into the next
	lane, dangerously close to a pick-up truck that has to swerve
	to avoid him.
	
	                    SIMONE / VIKTOR
	          Christ --
	              (still struggling to stay
	               on the road)
	          Elaine, I know how it looks but...
	              (blurting it out)
	          ... it would mean a lot to Viktor
	          if you'd go with him to the Oscars. 
	          If you won't do it for him, please
	          do it for me.
	
	                    ELAINE
	              (reluctant, frightened by
	               Simone's erratic driving)
	          Okay -- for you.
	
	                    SIMONE / VIKTOR
	              (sigh of relief)
	          Thanks.  This is my exit so, I --
	
	                    ELAINE
	          I'm glad we talked.
	
	                    SIMONE / VIKTOR
	          Good-bye.
	
	Viktor's car swerves to the right.  Elaine looks back in her
	rearview mirror, concerned.
	
	Elaine just misses the sight of VIKTOR's car rear-ending the
	truck in front of him.
	
	EXT.  FREEWAY SHOULDER - LATER IN THE DAY
	
	VIKTOR anxiously watches a HIGHWAY PATROLMAN writing up the
	fender-bender.  However, the Patrolman is more interested in
	the Simone mannequin.
	
	                    PATROLMAN
	          You don't have to explain.  I know
	          what the press is like.  Lunatics. 
	          Out of control.
	              (referring to the Simone
	               mannequin)
	          You do know I'm going to have to
	          take this?
	
	INT.  ACADEMY AWARDS - AUDITORIUM - NIGHT
	
	VIKTOR, in his tuxedo, sits in the front row of the packed
	auditorium beside an empty seat -- "RESERVED for SIMONE". 
	ELAINE and LAINEY sit alongside -- LOTUS and MAC nearby.
	
	HAL stands at the transparent plastic podium with the "Best
	Actress" envelope.
	
	                    HAL
	          And the winner is...
	
	Hal tears the envelope's seal, momentarily confused as he
	reads the name.
	
	                    HAL
	          Actually, there's a tie.
	
	The AUDIENCE gasps.
	
	                    HAL
	              (milking the moment for
	               all it's worth)
	          The winners are... Simone for
	          "Sunrise, Sunset"...
	
	The audience cheers enthusiastically, but Hal stills their
	applause.
	
	                    HAL
	              (big smile)
	          ... and Simone for "Eternity
	          Forever".
	
	The audience erupts.  Viktor accepts the congratulations of
	those around him.
	
	                    HAL
	          Unfortunately, Simone can't be with
	          us tonight.
	              (turning to the screen)
	          But thanks to the miracle of modern
	          technology she is able to join us
	          live via satellite from the
	          location of her new film.
	
	The screen flickers to life.
	
	ON SCREEN - A DESOLATE WASTELAND - DAY
	
	SIMONE sits in a director's chair in the desolate wasteland
	location chosen by Viktor.
	
	                    SIMONE
	          Thank you!  Thank you!  This means
	          so much to me.  I'm just sorry I
	          can't be there with you.
	              (wiping away a tear)
	          First off I have to acknowledge my
	          fellow nominees -- I don't even
	          feel I belong in the best actress
	          category let alone with these...
	          wonderful human beings.
	              (composing herself)
	          I also have to thank my co-stars,
	          the studio, of course.  But most of
	          all, I have to thank the audience
	          for supporting what I do -- you're
	          the only reason I'm here.
	
	The CROWD applauds wildly.
	
	LAINEY is puzzled.  She leans over to Viktor.
	
	                    LAINEY
	          Why didn't she thank you?
	
	                    VIKTOR
	              (confused)
	          She did... didn't she?
	
	                    ELAINE
	              (crestfallen)
	          No.
	
	Viktor glances to the "Simone" sign beside him.  The blood
	drains from his face.
	
	INT.  VIKTOR'S SOUNDSTAGE - MORNING
	
	On the monitor, SIMONE reads the forgotten line from the
	speech.
	
	                    SIMONE
	          ... And of course I must thank my
	          collaborator, Viktor Taransky,
	          without whom none of this would be
	          possible.
	
	VIKTOR, still in his tuxedo, stares at SIMONE on the screen. 
	He holds the text of Simone's acceptance speech in his hands.
	
	                    VIKTOR
	              (to himself)
	          It's written right there... Why
	          didn't I say it?... How could I
	          forget to say it?
	
	Simone stares back at him blankly.
	
	A copy of VARIETY is slid under the soundstage door.  The
	front page headline, "NO THANK YOU - Simone Snubs Taransky At
	Oscars".
	
	INT.  VIKTOR'S CAR - NIGHT
	
	VIKTOR pulls up to the gate of his Malibu home.  MAX is
	standing outside next to his car.
	
	                    VIKTOR
	          Damn it!
	
	EXT.  VIKTOR'S MALIBU HOME - NIGHT
	
	VIKTOR also spies an OLD WOMAN in a wheelchair sitting beside
	the car, MILTON closeby.  Viktor stops at the gate and
	reluctantly exits his car.
	
	                    VIKTOR
	          What now, Sayer?
	
	                    MAX
	              (smug smile, noticing
	               Viktor noticing the
	               woman)
	          Looks familiar, doesn't she?  No
	          one comes from nowhere, Taransky. 
	          You turn over enough rocks...
	
	The old woman appears drugged, stares into space.
	
	                    MAX
	          I traced her to a nursing home.  A
	          young woman fitting Simone's
	          description dropped her off five
	          years ago.
	
	                    VIKTOR
	          She looks a lot like you.
	
	                    MAX
	              (undeterred)
	          She hasn't uttered a word that
	          whole time -- until she saw the big
	          show.
	
	Max produces a shot of SIMONE at the Oscars and holds it in
	front of the old lady.
	
	                    OLD LADY
	              (pointing to Simone's
	               picture, catatonic)
	          My baby... My baby...
	
	                    MAX
	              (putting his hand on his
	               heart)
	          Who would think that "Saint Simone"
	          would abandon her own mother?  I've
	          been looking into the family
	          history -- heartbreaking.  Most
	          likely a biography to run over four
	          issues... who knows, maybe there's
	          a Pulitzer in there somewhere.
	
	Viktor produces his own driver's license and holds it in
	front of the old lady.
	
	                    OLD LADY
	              (pointing to Viktor's face
	               on the driver's license)
	          My baby... My baby...
	
	Max hastily steps between Viktor and the Old Lady.
	
	                    MAX
	          That doesn't prove a thing -- wait
	          until I get a court order for a
	          blood test.
	
	                    VIKTOR
	              (sensing an opportunity)
	          That won't be necessary.
	              (pretending to be
	               resigned)
	          Sooner or later I knew you'd crack
	          this thing, Max.  You got me.
	
	                    MAX
	          I do?
	              (recovering)
	          Sure I do.
	              (taking Viktor aside)
	          Can we speak off the record?  I'm a
	          fair man.  I'm willing to sit down
	          with her and tell her side of the
	          story.
	
	                    VIKTOR
	          I wouldn't want you to compromise
	          your ethics.
	
	                    MAX
	          No.  Thanks.  Absolutely.
	
	Viktor regards the newshound with a look of pity.
	
	                    VIKTOR
	          You love her, don't you, Max?
	
	                    MAX
	          Don't you?
	
	                    VIKTOR
	              (writes a check, hands it
	               to Max)
	          This should take care of Mother.
	
	Viktor drives into his home.  Max, very confused, stares at
	the old lady.
	
	EXT.  VIKTOR'S SOUNDSTAGE - DAY
	
	VIKTOR escorts LAINEY, blindfolded, around the corner of his
	soundstage.  He removes the blindfold.  From Lainey's point-
	of-view we see the sportscar Simone drove in "ETERNITY
	FOREVER" -- the car tied with a bow.
	
	                    VIKTOR
	          Happy birthday, Lainey.  Do you
	          like it?
	
	                    LAINEY
	              (taking in the car)
	          It's fantastic -- it's too much.
	
	                    VIKTOR
	          It's the car she drove in "Eternity
	          Forever".
	
	                    LAINEY
	          I know.  Thank her for me.
	
	                    VIKTOR
	              (disappointed by her
	               reaction)
	          It's from both of us.  Of course
	          you'll have to drive it around the
	          lot until you get your permit --
	
	Lainey averts her gaze.
	
	                    LAINEY
	          -- I can't accept it.  I don't want
	          a car, Dad.
	
	                    VIKTOR
	              (clearly hurt, not
	               understanding)
	          Why not?  I can get you something
	          else.  What do you want?
	
	                    LAINEY
	          The old Viktor Taransky.
	              (finally blurting it out)
	          I liked you better before -- before
	          all this.  You were a loser, Dad,
	          but at least you had integrity.  I
	          can't stand to see you like this --
	          clinging to Simone's coattails --
	          it used to be about the work, and
	          now it's all about her.  And then
	          she's not even grateful enough to
	          thank you.
	
	                    VIKTOR
	          No, that was me.
	
	                    LAINEY
	          There you go again, blaming
	          yourself.  Can't you see what she's
	          done to you -- she's taking
	          advantage, mocking you.  You
	          deserve better than Simone.
	              (hasty exit)
	          I've got to go, Dad.
	
	                    VIKTOR
	          Lainey...
	
	Viktor watches Lainey depart towards the studio gates.
	
	INT.  SIMONE & VIKTOR'S OFFICE - DAY
	
	VIKTOR leans on his desk, still reflecting on LAINEY's
	remarks.  JANE enters.
	
	                    JANE
	          Ready for your casting session?
	
	Viktor nods distractedly.  Jane shows in NICOLA ANDERS.
	
	                    JANE
	          Nicola's here for the role of
	          Simone's sister.
	
	Viktor offers Nicola a seat, staring at her as if he has
	never truly looked at her before -- she has a quality of
	Simone.
	
	                    NICOLA
	              (slightly uncomfortable by
	               Viktor's scrutiny)
	          A lot's happened since we last saw
	          each other.
	
	                    VIKTOR
	              (numb)
	          Yes.
	
	                    NICOLA
	          I never apologized properly for
	          what happened on "Sunrise".
	
	She hands Viktor a peace offering -- a large jar of Mike &
	Ike candy, including cherry.
	
	                    VIKTOR
	          Thank you.  It's not important.
	
	                    NICOLA
	          After I saw what Simone did with
	          the role -- you know I fired all my
	          people, went into rehab, took
	          acting classes, changed my whole
	          look.  She really inspired me.
	
	Viktor continues to stare.
	
	                    NICOLA
	              (referring to the script
	               in her hands)
	          Would you like me to read?
	
	                    VIKTOR
	          Yes, I'd like that.
	
	Nicola glances at the script a last time and puts it down. 
	She approaches Viktor, standing close to him, playing the
	scene to him -- an immediate intimacy.
	
	                    NICOLA
	              (her angry words are in
	               opposition to her amorous
	               actions)
	          -- Who do you think you are, Carlos
	          -- coming in here like this?  With
	          my husband sleeping in the next
	          room.  Do you think I won't call
	          out?  Do you think I will just give
	          in to you without a fight -- like
	          the last time and the time before
	          that?
	              (she kisses his ear)
	          I wish you were dead.
	              (she kisses his lips)
	          I wish we were both dead.
	
	Nicola immediately breaks character.
	
	Viktor is mesmerized -- he has fallen back in love with
	flesh.
	
	                    VIKTOR
	              (finally able to speak)
	          You know you're really very good. 
	          I take back what I said.  I mean,
	          you're really good.
	
	                    NICOLA
	          Thank you.
	
	                    VIKTOR
	              (forgetting himself)
	          You could play the lead.
	
	                    NICOLA
	              (confused)
	          But that's Simone's part.
	
	                    VIKTOR
	          Yes, of course it is.
	              (gazing at her face)
	          You know you have a line here.  Not
	          a wrinkle.  Actually, more of a
	          dimple.  I've been thinking of
	          incorporating something like that
	          in Simone.
	
	                    NICOLA
	              (incredulous)
	          You'd cosmetically alter Simone to
	          look like me?
	
	                    VIKTOR
	          No, of course not, you're right. 
	          That would be crazy.
	
	Viktor sits back down and stares out of the window.
	
	                    NICOLA
	          Do you want me to do it again?
	
	Viktor does not reply.  Nicola quietly leaves.
	
	INT.  ELAINE'S MANSION - DAY
	
	The front page of "Variety" is dominated by a large
	photograph of SIMONE giving her acceptance speech via
	satellite.  However, ELAINE is gazing at a small inset
	picture of VIKTOR, HERSELF and LAINEY arriving at the Oscar
	Ceremony.
	
	Elaine tears out the photo and slips it into her purse.
	
	EXT.  SWIMMING POOL - DAY (ON VIKTOR'S SCREEN)
	
	Old home video of ELAINE.  She is in a garden by a swimming
	pool, laughing, waving and sweetly flirting with the camera. 
	Elaine raises her skirt teasingly, winks, gestures the camera
	operator towards her with a beckoning finger, finally blows a
	kiss to the camera.
	
	INT.  VIKTOR'S SOUNDSTAGE - DAY
	
	While the ever-seductive SIMONE waits patiently on-screen for
	Viktor's instructions, VIKTOR is gazing at the smaller
	monitor -- the home video of ELAINE.
	
	Viktor freezes the tape.  Elaine appears particularly
	beautiful.
	
	Viktor electronically cuts out Elaine's mannerism and morphs
	it into Simone.  Now Simone blows the kiss and has the same
	dazzling smile.
	
	INT.  SIMONE & VIKTOR'S OFFICE - DAY
	
	At her desk, JANE is busy trying to mimic Simone's hairstyle
	as she talks on the phone.
	
	                    JANE
	              (into phone)
	          -- Oh sure, she comes in all the
	          time... we've become close.  She
	          told me --
	
	VIKTOR enters the office.
	
	                    VIKTOR
	          Jane --
	
	Jane hurriedly hangs up.
	
	                    JANE
	          Gotta go.
	
	                    VIKTOR
	              (picking up a pile of
	               scripts from the in-tray)
	          I'm leaving early tonight.  If you
	          need me I'll be at the beach house
	          having dinner with a... certain
	          someone.
	
	Jane tries to conceal her interest.  As soon as Viktor exits
	the office, JANE picks up the phone.
	
	                    JANE
	              (into phone, under her
	               breath)
	          ... Elaine Christian please.
	
	We reveal VIKTOR, outside the door, eavesdropping on his
	assistant, pleased she has taken the bait.
	
	INT.  VIKTOR'S BEACH HOUSE - NIGHT
	
	VIKTOR dims the lights, plays "mood" music.  The doorbell
	rings.
	
	He checks himself in the mirror.  In the reflection, he spies
	an autographed photo of HIMSELF with his arm around SIMONE. 
	He hurriedly hides the photo and answers the door.
	
	ELAINE stands there.
	
	                    ELAINE
	          Viktor, I'm picking up Lainey.
	
	Elaine is over-dressed for her supposed errand.
	
	                    VIKTOR
	          Elaine, it's Wednesday.
	
	                    ELAINE
	              (feigning absent
	               mindedness)
	          Is it Wednesday?  It's Wednesday. 
	          How embarrassing.  I don't know
	          what I was thinking.  With all the
	          excitement lately...
	              (peering past him)
	          Am I interrupting something?  Are
	          you expecting company?
	
	                    VIKTOR
	              (ushering her inside)
	          As a matter-of-fact I am.
	
	                    ELAINE
	          When is she coming over?
	
	                    VIKTOR
	              (glancing to his watch)
	          About now.  Would you like a drink?
	
	                    ELAINE
	          I suppose I could stay, just until
	          she arrives.
	
	Elaine takes a seat on the sofa.  Viktor hands her a glass of
	wine and sits beside her -- close.
	
	They both knock back their wine in one long gulp, both
	apparently in need of courage.
	
	                    ELAINE
	              (trying to make
	               conversation)
	          Is Simone back to earth yet?
	
	                    VIKTOR
	          Not quite.
	
	                    ELAINE
	          I'm sure you'll keep her focussed. 
	          She's lucky to have you, Viktor.
	              (blurting out)
	          Is she really having your baby?
	
	                    VIKTOR
	          Impossible.
	
	                    ELAINE
	              (instantly regretting the
	               remark)
	          I just read somewhere --
	
	                    VIKTOR
	          I know.  I know.  They'll say
	          anything.
	
	                    ELAINE
	          -- And she was positively glowing
	          at the awards.
	              (making to leave)
	          I should be going, she'll be here
	          soon --
	
	Viktor puts his finger to her lips to hush her.
	
	                    VIKTOR
	          -- She already is.  Simone's not
	          coming over, Elaine.  Not tonight,
	          not ever.
	              (holding her)
	          I want you back, Elaine.
	
	                    ELAINE
	              (melting)
	          I want you back too, Viktor.
	
	They kiss.  Elaine breaks the kiss, suddenly consumed with
	doubt.
	
	                    ELAINE
	          This is crazy.  Who am I fooling? 
	          I can't compete with Simone.  What
	          woman can?
	
	                    VIKTOR
	          I would rather have you than
	          Simone.  Believe me.
	
	                    ELAINE
	          That's sweet, Viktor, but I
	          couldn't let you do that -- make
	          that kind of sacrifice.
	              (meeting his gaze)
	          It's strange.  I've stabbed people
	          in the back, clawed and slept my
	          way to where I am -- it goes with
	          the territory -- but, for some
	          reason, I can't betray Simone. 
	          There's... I don't know any other
	          way to say it -- there's a goodness
	          to her.
	
	                    VIKTOR
	          No, there isn't.  There's nothing
	          to her.
	
	                    ELAINE
	          Oh, Viktor.  You say that now --
	          because we're here, alone, like
	          this.  But in the morning, you'd go
	          back to her.  What man wouldn't?
	
	                    VIKTOR
	          No, I will end my relationship with
	          her -- totally.
	
	                    ELAINE
	          But you don't understand.  She'll
	          always be there -- at some party,
	          on some magazine cover, some song
	          on the radio, up on some screen.
	
	                    VIKTOR
	              (desperate)
	          No.  She'll never work again --
	          retire, never make a movie or a
	          record, or appear ever again.
	
	                    ELAINE
	              (confused)
	          Of course she will.  Her public
	          will demand it.
	
	                    VIKTOR
	          Not if I don't let her.
	
	                    ELAINE
	          You?
	
	Viktor knocks back another glass of wine for courage.
	
	                    VIKTOR
	          I'm going to tell you a secret now,
	          Elaine.
	              (mustering all his nerve)
	          Simone is not a real person.  I
	          invented her.
	
	                    ELAINE
	              (misinterpreting his
	               remark)
	          Every actor is an invention,
	          Viktor.  Don't embarrass yourself. 
	          No one's denying that you
	          discovered Simone.  But it's like
	          finding a diamond in the desert. 
	          Anyone can trip over it, but it's
	          not the finder who sparkles.
	
	                    VIKTOR
	              (agitated)
	          -- No, no, I didn't trip over her. 
	          You don't understand --
	
	                    ELAINE
	              (ignoring him)
	          -- You just got lucky that she's
	          loyal enough to stay with you. 
	          Maybe she's staying out of pity,
	          who knows?  She certainly doesn't
	          need you.  Some people even say
	          you're holding her back.
	
	                    VIKTOR
	              (wounded)
	          Who says that -- ?
	              (shaking off the insult)
	          -- Never mind.  You have to listen
	          to me, Elaine.  Simone is thin air,
	          pixels, molded by me from a
	          mathematical equation.  I inherited
	          it from a madman -- I can show
	          you --
	
	                    ELAINE
	          How much wine have you had?
	
	                    VIKTOR
	          -- She's a figment of my own
	          imagination.  I, Viktor Taransky,
	          have perpetrated the greatest hoax,
	          the greatest sleight-of-hand,
	          sleight-of-mouth, sleight-of-
	          sleight in entertainment history!
	          And still no one appreciates me,
	          recognizes what I've done -- even
	          you.
	
	                    ELAINE
	              (rolling her eyes)
	          You're drunker than I thought.  Are
	          you doing that again?
	
	                    VIKTOR
	          No!  Whatever talent Simone has
	          comes from me -- me!  Me!  I swear,
	          as God is my judge.  You don't know
	          what I've been through.  Tens of
	          thousands of mind-numbing hours in
	          front of that screen, nights
	          without end, and look what it's
	          cost me.
	              (producing his spectacles)
	          Why do you think I've been wearing
	          these?  I may have done irreparable
	          harm to my eyesight, and why?  To
	          extract and refine the infinite
	          nuances of a human being -- a human
	          soul.
	              (a final explanation)
	          Don't you see?  I made Simone!
	
	A pause.  His words hang in the air.
	
	                    ELAINE
	          You made Simone?
	              (a trace of pity)
	          Viktor, she made you.
	
	Elaine gets up and walks out, leaving the distraught Viktor
	alone in his house.
	
	INT.  VIKTOR'S OFFICE - DAY
	
	A hung-over VIKTOR enters his office.  Suddenly, he stops and
	confronts the standee of SIMONE.
	
	                    VIKTOR
	          You bitch!  I'll destroy you!
	
	JANE stares in shock.  She discreetly exits.
	
	INT.  VIKTOR'S SOUNDSTAGE - DAY
	
	VIKTOR sits in front of his monitor, smiling venomously at
	SIMONE.  He begins to digitally disrobe Simone.
	
	MONTAGE:
	
	A)  Peering through a gap in the drapes of his Malibu house,
	    VIKTOR watches MAX dig through his trash.  Max finds a
	    beat up reel of 16mm film.
	
	    MAX holds the end up to the light -- his eyes pop.
	
	B)  The ECHO headline screams, "SIMONE'S HARD CORE PAST" and
	    shows censored film frames of a naked Simone in a
	    compromising position.
	
	    VIKTOR, hovering at a supermarket check-out line,
	    overhears two WOMEN discussing the article.
	
	                    WOMAN 1
	          Disgusting...
	
	                    WOMAN 2
	              (sympathetic)
	          She must have been so desperate to
	          do something like that, so
	          depraved.
	
	                    WOMAN 1
	          I'm still naming my baby after her.
	
	                    WOMAN 2
	          You're having a boy.
	
	                    WOMAN 1
	          So?
	
	    Viktor blanches.  It is not the reaction he'd hoped for.
	
	C)  Inside a theater, VIKTOR hovers by the door, smirking.
	
	    ON SCREEN, we hear a farmyard scene -- SIMONE in an empty
	    farmyard on all fours, grunting like a pig, and foraging
	    for muddy vegetables.
	
	    The AUDIENCE is shocked, then suddenly breaks into
	    spontaneous applause.
	
	    Viktor, enraged, exits into the lobby past the poster for
	    "I AM PIG - Starring Simone".
	
	D)  A pretentious FILM CRITIC talks to camera, a film poster
	    behind him.
	
	                    FILM CRITIC
	          For Simone to do something as brave
	          as "I AM PIG" at this point in her
	          career, with so much to lose -- all
	          I can say is, "I Am Pig, I Am
	          Oscar".
	
	E)  In his soundstage, VIKTOR moves a slider that adds
	    wrinkles to Simone.
	
	F)  SIMONE appears on a morning talk show -- as usual, remote
	    on a TV screen.  However, her squeaky-clean image has
	    gone -- hair unkempt, bloated, chain-smoking and drinking
	    during the interview.  The HOSTS are smiling weakly.
	
	                    HOST
	          Simone, that's a rather
	          controversial position.
	
	                    SIMONE
	          I just think all elementary schools
	          should have a firing range -- so
	          students can learn how to defend
	          themselves.  We could fit it
	          inbetween recess and American
	          History.
	
	Another clip:
	
	                    SIMONE
	          If there's a hole in the ozone
	          layer why can't I see it?
	
	Another clip:
	
	                    SIMONE
	          Immigration?!  God, isn't it
	          crowded enough?!
	
	                    HOSTS
	          Just as we always knew.  Simone's
	          not like other celebrities.  She
	          speaks her mind!
	
	G)  VIKTOR driving along a city street, suddenly slams on his
	    brakes, almost causing an accident.  He stares numbly up
	    at a twenty-foot high smiling photo of Simone on a
	    billboard featuring a huge cover of TIME MAGAZINE.  It
	    reads, "SIMONE: WOMAN OF THE YEAR".
	
	                    VIKTOR
	              (to himself)
	          She's trying to kill me.
	
	Realizing what he's said, a thought comes into his eyes.
	
	EXT.  CEMETERY - DAY
	
	An inscription on a headstone reads:
	
	                         HANK ALENO
	                Remembered Virtually Forever
	
	VIKTOR kneels at HANK's grave.  He places a bunch of flowers
	there.
	
	                    VIKTOR
	              (referring to the flowers)
	          They're plastic, Hank.  I know
	          that's the way you'd want it.
	              (glancing to a Simone
	               billboard outside the
	               cemetery wall)
	          She killed you, Hank.  Now she's
	          killing me.  She's a serial killer.
	              (ducking out of sight of
	               the billboard as if
	               Simone is watching him)
	          But I don't know how to stop her. 
	          She's taken on a life of her own. 
	          I can't just come clean -- make
	          some confession.  I've defrauded
	          millions -- they'd turn on me.  And
	          I can't put the genie back in the
	          bottle.  If she stopped working --
	          dropped out of sight, they'd never
	          let it rest.  I've tried to kill
	          her career but they like her even
	          more.
	              (more desperate)
	          What am I going to do, Hank?
	
	A thought occurs to Viktor.  He slowly rises from behind
	Hank's headstone, revealing a forest of headstones.
	
	                    VIKTOR
	          Don't say another word, Hank.  You
	          are truly a genius.
	
	INT.  VIKTOR'S SOUNDSTAGE - DUSK
	
	A sad but resolute VIKTOR sits in front of his monitor,
	SIMONE's face full screen.
	
	He speaks into the voice synthesizer, Simone's face
	automatically speaking the words he speaks -- the final time
	he puts his words in her mouth.
	
	                    SIMONE / VIKTOR
	          What's the matter, Viktor?  You
	          look so sad.  Don't you love me
	          anymore?... It's over, isn't it?
	
	He switches off the synthesizer and speaks in his own voice.
	
	                    VIKTOR
	          It's the only way, Simone.  If it's
	          any consolation, you're going to
	          live on in the public's heart like
	          all the other tragic figures that
	          went before their time.  There's no
	          love like posthumous love.
	
	On the screen, Simone is on the verge of tears.
	
	                    VIKTOR
	          I know what you're thinking.  It's
	          a phoney-baloney world.  The women
	          are surgically enhanced, the
	          athletes are on steroids, the
	          singers are lip-syncing if they're
	          even singing at all, the news is
	          entertainment, the politicians are
	          bought and paid for -- we're living
	          one big lie.  So why shouldn't you
	          live too?  You're more authentic
	          than the people who adore you.
	              (a trace of despair)
	          And that's the problem.  You're
	          looking at the real fraud.  I told
	          myself this was all about the work
	          but if that was the truth, it
	          wouldn't matter to me -- and it
	          does.  It wasn't that the artists
	          had no respect for the art.  They
	          had no respect for me.  Someone
	          like you, you have so much love
	          showered on you -- I just wanted to
	          feel one tiny drop on my face.  I'm
	          sorry, Simone.  Here I've been
	          trying to convince the world that
	          you exist, but I was really trying
	          to convince them that I exist. 
	          It's not that you aren't human,
	          Simone, it's that I am.
	
	Viktor produces a disc from his jacket marked, "PLAGUE - Ver.
	8.1".  He places the disc in the machine.
	
	Viktor sees that Simone is crying.  He touches a tear on his
	own face and realizes her tears are in response to his own.
	
	Viktor hesitates -- a moment of doubt -- then presses
	"ENTER".  The image of SIMONE's face gradually begins to
	deconstruct -- pixel by pixel -- as the virus takes hold. 
	The pixels collect into a pile at the bottom of his screen
	like dust.  Finally, the dust is blown away in a single
	digital breath.
	
	For a moment his attention is taken with a layer of dust on
	his own desk.
	
	Viktor regards his own reflection in the now black screen. 
	His hard-drive now corrupted, he picks up his original disc
	marked, "SIMULATION ONE".
	
	He tosses this disc into a steamer trunk he has loaded with
	hundreds of discs relating to Simone's software.  He shuts
	the lid and begins dragging the trunk towards the door.
	
	EXT.  SANTA MONICA BAY - DUSK
	
	Viktor's yacht sits at anchor in the glassy waters of Santa
	Monica Bay -- "SIMONE" written on the stern.
	
	VIKTOR manhandles the trunk to the railing.  A mournful pause
	-- then he heaves it over the side.  The trunk sinks like a
	stone.
	
	Heart heavy, Viktor stares into the inky depths.
	
	EXT.  STUDIO - ENTRANCE - DAY
	
	A throng of REPORTERS and CAMERA CREWS.  A somber VIKTOR
	enters and takes a seat in front of a forest of microphones.
	
	                    VIKTOR
	          It is my sad and solemn duty to
	          announce the tragic passing of
	          Simone.
	
	A gasp from the audience.  Then, an explosion of anguish.
	
	                    CROWD
	          No!!  What happened?!  Oh.  God.
	
	                    PRESS REPORTER 1
	              (stepping forward,
	               mustering the courage to
	               ask the question)
	          How did she die?
	
	                    VIKTOR
	          A rare virus.

	          world.
	
	                    PRESS REPORTER 2
	          Did she suffer?
	
	                    VIKTOR
	          Mercifully, it was quick.
	
	At the back of the room are MAX SAYER and MILTON.  They are
	frozen in grief, a tear spills from Max's eye.
	
	A MONTAGE OF SCENES:
	
	A)  "SIMON GONE - FADE TO BLACK", reads the cover of Variety.
	
	B)  The announcement of her death appears on local TV news
	    shows around the globe.
	
	C)  A carpet of bouquets and notes of commiseration several
	    yards wide completely surrounds Viktor's property
	    including the driveway.  VIKTOR insensitively drives over
	    the bouquets to the horror of the MOURNERS, including MAX
	    SAYER and MILTON.
	
	D)  In a remote Mongolian encampment MONGOL HORSEMEN crowd
	    around a television showing a live picture of Simone's
	    funeral.
	
	E)  The HEARSE carrying Simone's "body" and the funeral
	    procession led solemnly by VIKTOR, proceeds through the
	    studio lot.  Distraught STUDIO STAFF toss flowers onto
	    the hearse.
	
	F)  The same television picture is playing on a television
	    sitting on a stool in a WEST AFRICAN river.  LOCAL WOMEN
	    stop washing their clothes to watch.
	
	EXT.  GRAVESIDE - CEMETERY - DAY
	
	We tilt up from Hank's headstone to an ornate mausoleum on an
	island in a lake.
	
	Simone's coffin is ferried across a bridge by PALLBEARERS
	from the studio.  Numerous MOURNERS follow behind.
	
	VIKTOR, ELAINE and a curiously dry-eyed LAINEY walk behind
	the coffin.
	
	                    VIKTOR
	              (to Elaine)
	          Can I see you later -- go away for
	          the weekend?
	
	                    ELAINE
	              (horrified by the
	               suggestion)
	          How can you bring that up at a time
	          like this?
	
	The coffin reaches the steps of the marble mausoleum.  A
	PRIEST, RABBI, and a BUDDHIST MONK turn to Viktor.  He nods
	and they start to carry the coffin towards the door. 
	However, the coffin is suddenly stopped by a POLICE OFFICER.
	
	A SECOND POLICE OFFICER begins to jimmy open the lid.  The
	coffin lid is pulled back.  Inside is a life-sized cardboard
	standee of Simone from "ETERNITY FOREVER".
	
	The MOURNERS gasp.  Everyone looks to Viktor.
	
	INT.  L.A. COUNTY JAIL - INTERVIEW ROOM - DAY
	
	A SERIES OF POLICE INTERVIEWS:
	
	JANE sits in the interview room, describing Viktor's assault
	on the standee.
	
	                    JANE
	          -- I heard him say, "Die bitch".
	
	A)  MAX SAYER, distraught and weeping.
	
	                    MAX
	          -- He was a controlling madman, she
	          was a prisoner.  I blame myself...
	          I should have done more to stop
	          it...
	
	B)  NICOLA gives a statement.
	
	                    NICOLA
	          -- It was strange.  He wanted to
	          replace her with me in his new
	          movie... and I know I'm not that
	          good.
	
	INT.  L.A. COUNTY JAIL - INTERROGATION ROOM - DAY
	
	VIKTOR sits in an interrogation room in a sea of SIMONE. 
	Magazine covers, cosmetics advertisements, publicity shots,
	interviews, website print-outs, photographs and report cards
	from her fictitious childhood are plastered on the walls,
	stacks of film cans and tapes of her numerous movie and
	television appearances.
	
	                    DETECTIVE
	          -- Forgive me, Mr. Taransky.  I'm
	          just trying to understand.  All
	          these films, TV appearances,
	          magazine covers, internet
	          interviews, publicity photos,
	          snapshots from her childhood -- all
	          fake.
	              (referring to various
	               items)
	          This is fake, this is fake -- fake,
	          fake, fake, all fake.
	
	                    VIKTOR
	          That's right.  You understand
	          perfectly.  I will confess to
	          fraud, not murder.
	
	                    DETECTIVE
	              (referring to oversize
	               mail bags)
	          A fan club with a worldwide
	          membership in the millions -- also
	          bogus?
	
	                    VIKTOR
	          Oh, no.  The fan club is real.  But
	          they were worshipping computer code
	          -- ones and zeros.
	
	                    DETECTIVE
	          So, of course, you couldn't kill
	          Simone because there never was a
	          Simone.
	
	                    VIKTOR
	          Of course.
	
	                    DETECTIVE
	          And this Mr. Hank Aleno who you
	          talk so much about, a renowned
	          failure, who also happens to be so
	          conveniently dead -- perhaps the
	          "man" you claim helped invent
	          Simone is an invention himself?
	
	Viktor, sensing his sarcasm, does not reply.
	
	                    DETECTIVE
	              (patronizing smile)
	          But not everyone's imaginary, are
	          they, Mr. Taransky?  I refer, of
	          course, to Edith.
	
	                    VIKTOR
	          Who?
	
	The Detective raises a window-blind to reveal a next door
	room where the OLD WOMAN from the rest home is being
	interviewed.
	
	                    DETECTIVE
	          The woman you admitted to a
	          journalist is Simone's mother and
	          for whose silence you paid a
	          fortune?  Is she not flesh to you --
	          are her tears not wet?
	
	The OLD WOMAN glances up and sees all the photos of Simone
	through the window.
	
	                    OLD LADY
	          My BABY!
	
	The Detective abruptly lowers the blind.  Viktor rolls his
	eyes at the Detective's theatrics.  He is suddenly enraged.
	
	                    VIKTOR
	          She's insane!  This whole thing is
	          insane!  There is no Simone.  Look!
	              (grabbing a Simone poster)
	          Even her name is fake.  It's not
	          Simone.
	              (he tears Simone's name in
	               half to demonstrate)
	          It's SIM... ONE!  Simulation One!
	
	The Detectives sadly shake their heads.
	
	                    DETECTIVE 2
	              (regarding Simone's face
	               also torn in half)
	          You really hated her, didn't you?
	
	The Detective places a tape, marked "EXHIBIT A" in a video
	machine.
	
	                    DETECTIVE
	          Perhaps you could explain this to
	          me, Mr. Taransky -- or is this tape
	          "doctored" too?
	
	He plays a tape showing --
	
	EXT.  MARINA PIER - NIGHT (ON TV SCREEN)
	
	VIKTOR dragging his trunk from his car down the pier to his
	yacht.
	
	                    DETECTIVE
	          It's footage from the marina's
	          closed-circuit camera on the night
	          in question.  Altered, of course. 
	          Is that really what you expect us
	          to believe, Mr. Taransky?
	
	The Detective freezes the tape.
	
	                    DETECTIVE
	          Can you tell us why you were
	          disposing of the body of a woman
	          who didn't exist?
	
	                    VIKTOR
	          It wasn't her body.  It was her
	          body of work.
	
	                    DETECTIVE
	          Why don't you just come clean,
	          Viktor?  Tell the truth.  You'll
	          feel better afterwards.
	
	                    VIKTOR
	          I am telling the truth.
	
	                    DETECTIVE
	              (coming close to him)
	          We all know what happened.  In a
	          fit of jealous rage you killed
	          Simone and dumped her body off a
	          boat she bought for you.
	
	                    VIKTOR
	          No!!  I can prove it to you.  I'll
	          take you to her.
	
	EXT.  BOAT - SANTA MONICA BAY - DAY
	
	VIKTOR sits handcuffed on a POLICE BOAT with the DETECTIVE
	and his LAWYER.  DIVERS surface with the steamer trunk. 
	Viktor's face lights up.
	
	The trunk is winched aboard.  However, as it lowers onto the
	deck, we see the latch has broken and the lid is ajar.  All
	eyes stare inside the trunk as the lid is lifted.  Apart from
	a scrawny piece of kelp -- empty.
	
	                    VIKTOR
	              (panicky, desperately
	               grabbing the divers)
	          Did you find anything else --
	          drivers, discs... disc-drives?
	
	                    DIVER 1
	          Nothing.
	              (gazing to the water)
	          We couldn't stay down any longer.
	
	All eyes follow the diver's gaze to several SHARK FINS in the
	water.
	
	CLOSE UP ON FRONT PAGE OF L.A. TIMES:
	
	           "SIMONE"S BODY FEARED EATEN BY SHARKS"
	
	The newspaper is being read by Viktor's LAWYER, sitting
	opposite Viktor in his cell.  VIKTOR is numb -- the
	likelihood of conviction slowly dawning on him.
	
	                    LAWYER
	          -- Plead guilty and throw yourself
	          on the mercy of the court.  It's
	          the best deal you're going to get.
	
	                    VIKTOR
	              (incredulous)
	          I could get the death penalty.
	
	                    LAWYER
	          You certainly will if you go to
	          trial -- a jury in this kind of
	          ugly mood.  You've killed an icon,
	          for God's sake.
	
	                    VIKTOR
	          I didn't kill anyone, Bernard,
	          there was no one to kill!
	
	                    LAWYER
	              (musing)
	          An insanity defence.
	
	INT.  VIKTOR'S SOUNDSTAGE - NIGHT
	
	A FIGURE sits at Viktor's computer.  LAINEY.  She scrolls
	through Viktor's files.  All empty.
	
	Lainey sighs.  ELAINE paces behind her.
	
	                    ELAINE
	          Let's go, Lainey.  There's nothing
	          here.
	
	                    LAINEY
	          Just a minute.
	
	Elaine continues to pace as Lainey works.
	
	                    ELAINE
	          God, it's so like your father.  Why
	          can't people take responsibility
	          for their actions anymore?  I can
	          almost forgive him for killing
	          Simone -- but denying her
	          existence.  I can never forgive
	          that.
	
	                    LAINEY
	          Because obviously she existed,
	          right?
	
	                    ELAINE
	          I know it as surely as you're
	          sitting here, sweetheart.  She was
	          the most vital woman I ever met.
	
	                    LAINEY
	          So you did meet her?
	
	                    ELAINE
	          Of course.  What are you
	          suggesting?
	
	                    LAINEY
	          I mean really meet her -- in the
	          flesh.
	
	Elaine regards her daughter curiously.
	
	                    LAINEY
	          I know it's embarrassing to admit
	          it, mom, but when I think about it 
	          -- honestly, I haven't.  I mean, it
	          feels like I have.  I know more
	          about her than members of my own
	          family.  She's even in my dreams. 
	          But I realized, going back through
	          my diary, they were all TV
	          appearances, near misses at
	          parties, second-hand rumor, gossip
	          on the internet.  I've never
	          actually seen Simone up close,
	          touched her, been in her physical
	          presence.  Have you?
	
	                    ELAINE
	              (unable to refute it)
	          Well, I --
	
	                    LAINEY
	          -- We don't believe daddy because
	          we don't want to believe we were
	          taken in too.
	
	                    ELAINE
	              (trying to shake the
	               notion from her head)
	          Lainey, there's no evidence that
	          Simone isn't real.
	
	                    LAINEY
	          Listen to what you're saying, mom. 
	          Is there any evidence she is?
	
	Lainey finally tries another file.  She presses "EJECT".  The
	"PLAGUE" disc spits out of the machine.
	
	                    LAINEY
	              (regarding the disc)
	          There's one part of dad's story
	          that may have been true.  Simone
	          may have contracted a virus.
	
	Lainey smiles at her mother.
	
	                    LAINEY
	          Certain viruses can be cured.

	              (hushed tones, referring
	               to a thick Psychiatric
	               Report)
	          ... Listen, I've found a
	          psychiatrist in Ventura -- well
	          respected -- who's willing to
	          testify under oath that you have
	          diminished capacity due to the
	          trauma of your divorce, ten years
	          of abject failure in the movie
	          business and a bump on the head you
	          sustained as a child --
	
	VIKTOR, fuming throughout this, suddenly explodes.
	
	                    VIKTOR
	          -- No!  I can't go along with this
	          horseshit!  Just tell them they can

	              (aghast, looking around to
	               see if anyone has heard)
	          What?!
	
	                    VIKTOR
	          It was premeditated -- I knew
	          exactly what I was doing!  I
	          strangled her!  I bludgeoned her! 
	          I set her on fire!  I did it!  I
	          killed her!

	          Excuse me.
	
	The Lawyer spins around guiltily.  The Detective stands
	outside the cell, clearly overhearing the confession. 
	Viktor, resigned to his fate, couldn't care less.
	
	                    DETECTIVE
	          I think you'd better see this.

	and "D.A. Seeks Death Penalty for Taransky".
	
	The reader lowers the newspaper to reveal herself -- SIMONE,
	on the studio lot, looking more beautiful than ever.  She
	winks to the camera.

	"ASK JESUS TO SAVE YOU NOW".  He is escorted to a waiting
	limousine where he is met by ELAINE and LAINEY.  He hugs them
	both.
	
	INT.  LIMOUSINE - DAY
	
	VIKTOR sits beside ELAINE.  LAINEY sits opposite, studying
	her laptop computer.  Outside the car, REPORTERS are pressed
	against the glass.
	
	                    VIKTOR
	              (relaxing back into his
	               seat)
	          Thank you!
	              (to Lainey)
	          I don't know how you did it but
	          thank you.
	
	                    ELAINE
	              (putting her arm around
	               him)
	          Don't thank us too fast, Viktor. 
	          You know what we have to do?
	
	                    VIKTOR
	              (resigned smile)
	          Why stop at one character when you
	          can have a whole cast?
	
	                    ELAINE
	          Exactly.  Now that you have the
	          studio behind you, we can really do
	          things.
	
	Viktor shrugs resignedly, savoring his freedom.
	
	                    ELAINE
	              (holding Viktor close)
	          I was thinking -- what about you
	          and... "Simone" moving back in with
	          me and Lainey?
	
	                    VIKTOR
	              (meeting her gaze)
	          That sounds wonderful.
	              (to Lainey)
	          How do you feel about all this,
	          Lainey?
	
	                    LAINEY
	              (beaming)
	          About you and mom?
	
	                    VIKTOR
	              (reluctant admission)
	          Me and Simone.  What I did.
	
	                    LAINEY
	              (sweet smile)
	          Your mistake wasn't making
	          something fake, daddy.  We're fine
	          with fake -- as long as you don't
	          lie about it.
	
	Once again his daughter's words have a ghastly ring of truth. 
	Viktor stares out of the limo window as the car gradually
	forces its way through the reporters.
	
	He recognizes MAX and MILTON amongst the mob.  Max has
	hastily scribbled a note that he presses against the
	window --
	
	"WILL PAY $ FOR EXCLUSIVE".  Viktor looks away.
	
	                    ELAINE
	              (kissing him on the cheek)
	          Don't look so glum, Viktor.  It's
	          not a death sentence.
	
	                    VIKTOR
	              (still staring out of the
	               window, a rueful smile)
	          No... it's life.
	
	INT.  FRANK BRAND TV STUDIO - DAY
	
	FRANK BRAND conducts a remote interview with SIMONE who
	appears as usual on a television monitor.
	
	                    FRANK BRAND
	          -- Simone, the question on
	          everyone's mind is simply... "why?"
	
	                    SIMONE
	          Frank, you know as well as I do,
	          living in a fish bowl, the
	          insatiable appetite of the media...
	
	Frank nods sympathetically.
	
	                    SIMONE
	          With everything that was going on
	          in my life, I just needed to drop
	          out of sight for a while -- I
	          needed time.  Viktor bought me that
	          time.  I owe him so much.
	
	                    FRANK BRAND
	          We all do.
	              (quickly returning to
	               Simone)
	          But now I understand you're eager
	          to get back to work -- and not the
	          kind of work that we're all
	          expecting.
	
	                    SIMONE
	              (smiles coyly)
	          That's true.  I can reveal that I
	          am considering a career in
	          politics.
	
	                    FRANK BRAND
	          And what may I ask brought this on?
	
	SIMONE holds up a beautiful BABY BOY to camera.
	
	                    SIMONE
	          I suppose this little man had
	          something to do with it.  Viktor
	          and I are both concerned about what
	          kind of world our new son, Chip, is
	          going to grow up in.
	              (turning lovingly to
	               Viktor)
	          Aren't you, Viktor?
	
	On Frank Brand's monitor, the camera pulls back to reveal
	VIKTOR, sitting on a sofa -- an idyllic domestic scene.
	
	                    VIKTOR
	              (turning lovingly to
	               Simone)
	          Yes.
	
	INT.  SOUNDSTAGE - DAY
	
	Only we see the set where the interview is being recorded. 
	VIKTOR is sitting on a sofa against a green screen in his
	soundstage, smiling at a woman and child who are not there --
	he is alone.
	
	CUT TO BLACK
	
	INT.  CONCERT STADIUM - NIGHT
	
	DURING THE CLOSING CREDITS SIMONE PERFORMS ANOTHER SONG FROM
	HER CONCERT TOUR -- "(YOU MAKE ME FEEL LIKE) A NATURAL
	WOMAN".
SIMONE
	
	                              by
	
	                         Andrew Niccol
	
	
	
	
	----------------------------------------------------------------
	
	FADE IN:
	
	ON BRIGHT, OUT-OF-FOCUS, OVAL-SHAPED COLORS.
	
	The colored shapes dart around the screen -- the impression
	of looking through a kaleidoscope.
	
	As the image comes into sharp focus, we discover that we are
	inside a CANDY BOWL.  A MAN'S FINGERS are frantically
	removing all the cherry-flavored pieces of candy.
	
	EXT.  STUDIO LOT - DAY
	
	The man performing this curious task is
	writer/producer/director, VIKTOR TARANSKY, forties,
	conservatively dressed in suit and tie.  He sits alone at an
	empty craft service table outside a cavernous soundstage,
	some distance from the rest of the film set -- a breeze blows
	the table's paper cloth.
	
	Viktor finishes sorting.  Finding no trash can to deposit the
	rejected cherry candy, he scoops them into his pocket.
	
	A young headset-clad P.A. hurriedly approaches.  He looks
	ill.
	
	                    P.A.
	          Mr. Taransky --
	
	Viktor reads the young P.A.'s panicked expression.
	
	                    VIKTOR
	          She's walking?... Don't tell me
	          she's walking.
	              (blood slowly draining
	               from his face)
	          She is not walking... She can't
	          walk.
	
	EXT.  TRAILER - DAY
	
	NICOLA ANDERS, twenty-something, A-list actress, beautiful
	face scowling, is supervising her ASSISTANT ferrying clothes
	from a movie trailer to a limousine.  VIKTOR desperately
	follows after Nicola.
	
	                    VIKTOR
	          -- Nicola!  How was your massage?
	
	                    NICOLA
	          You're in breach.
	
	                    VIKTOR
	          -- Is this about the new pages? --
	          I made the changes you wanted,
	          you're in virtually every scene --
	
	                    NICOLA
	              (wheeling on him)
	          It's not the size of the role,
	          Viktor.
	              (suddenly very cool)
	          Am I or am I not contractually
	          entitled to the biggest trailer on
	          the set?
	
	                    VIKTOR
	              (regarding the enormous
	               silver fish behind them,
	               confused)
	          It's the biggest on earth!  I
	          swear!  It's a 50-foot Airstream --
	          they don't make them any longer
	          than that.
	
	                    NICOLA
	          Taller, Viktor.
	
	                    VIKTOR
	          Taller?  What?
	
	Viktor looks up in horror.  The trailer next to Nicola's does
	indeed appear to be fractionally taller.
	
	                    NICOLA
	              (walking away)
	          You've insulted me for the last
	          time.
	
	Viktor looks to the tires.  His face suddenly brightens.
	
	                    VIKTOR
	          Nicola, it's just the tires --
	          they're over-inflated!  I can fix
	          it!
	
	Viktor grasps the air nozzle on a tire and begins desperately
	stabbing at it with a ballpoint pen.  Air hisses out.
	
	                    VIKTOR
	          See, it's lower already.
	
	Nicola ignores Viktor, marching towards her limo with her
	PUBLICIST.  Abandoning the trailer, Viktor hurries after her.
	
	                    VIKTOR
	          I beg you.  You can't do this to
	          me.
	
	                    NICOLA
	              (looking back)
	          I had three other offers.  I only
	          signed on to this picture out of...
	          loyalty.
	
	                    VIKTOR
	          Then show some.  They'll shut me
	          down!
	
	                    NICOLA
	              (opening the car door)
	          It wasn't working anyhow.  The
	          scene with the thousand geese -- I
	          don't understand this film.  I
	          don't think anyone will understand
	          it.  I already put out a press
	          release -- citing "creative
	          differences".
	
	Viktor stops, nods resignedly -- suddenly very calm.
	
	                    VIKTOR
	          You know what, Nicola, you're
	          right.
	              (picking up her last piece
	               of luggage)
	          Here, let me help you with that.
	              (holding the door for her)
	          You ought to go.  The truth is I
	          don't deserve you.  This film
	          doesn't deserve you.  Frankly, it
	          deserves much, much better.  The
	          reason it's not working is because
	          you're not about the work.
	
	Nicola is stunned.
	
	                    VIKTOR
	              (to the limo driver)
	          To Hell, please.
	
	The door slams and the limo roars away.  Viktor looks to the
	still hissing trailer tire.  The CREW regards Viktor
	apprehensively.
	
	                    VIKTOR
	              (to the crew)
	          What are you looking at?  Get back
	          to work.
	
	The crew is uncertain what work there is to do.
	
	INT.  BEDROOM - "SUNRISE, SUNSET" - NIGHT
	
	In an ornate bedroom, NICOLA lies on her death bed under a
	veil of netting.  A distraught man, HAL, sits close by.
	
	                    NICOLA
	              (whispered)
	          Jack... are you there?
	
	                    HAL
	          I'm here.  I'm right beside you.
	
	A NUN enters.
	
	                    NUN
	              (to Hal)
	          You should really go now.
	
	                    NICOLA
	          No, it's alright.  Please, let him
	          stay.
	
	The nun withdraws.  Hal holds his face in his hands, almost
	breaking down.
	
	                    HAL
	              (a glance to heaven)
	          What kind of cruel God is it that
	          would take you away from me?
	
	                    NICOLA
	          The same one who brought me to you.
	
	                    HAL
	          No... I cannot accept it.  If
	          something like this can happen. 
	          What...
	              (struggling to find the
	               words)
	          What is it for?
	
	                    NICOLA
	              (smiles through her pain)
	          -- Why are we here?  Is that what
	          you're asking, Jack?... Why are we
	          here?  No why.  Just here.
	
	Nicola dies peacefully.
	
	INT.  SCREENING ROOM - STUDIO - DAY
	
	VIKTOR sits with leading man HAL, THREE EXECUTIVES and studio
	head ELAINE CHRISTIAN, watching a rough assembly of the film. 
	It ends with a close up of NICOLA ANDERS.
	
	The lights go up.  The image of Nicola fades off the screen.
	
	                    EXECUTIVE 1
	          She's good.  You can hardly tell
	          she's reading off a teleprompter.
	
	                    VIKTOR
	              (ignoring him)
	          I've analyzed the footage.  We've
	          got almost everything we need in
	          the can.  If we rework the script,
	          we can finish the film without her.
	
	                    EXECUTIVE 2
	              (forceful shake of the
	               head)
	          According to the writ her attorneys
	          filed at noon today.  They'll sue
	          if the film is released with Nicola
	          in a single frame.
	
	                    VIKTOR
	              (more anxious)
	          So we'll re-cast.
	
	                    HAL
	          Nicola Anders is the only actress
	          who can play that role.
	
	                    VIKTOR
	              (incredulous)
	          It's a re-make, Hal.  Anders is not
	          bigger than this picture.
	
	Elaine finally speaks up.
	
	                    ELAINE
	          Of course she is.  No other name is
	          going to sign on now and risk
	          offending her.
	
	                    VIKTOR
	          We don't need a name.  We'll cast
	          an unknown.
	
	                    HAL
	          I won't play opposite an unknown.
	
	                    ELAINE
	          We can't sell an unknown.  Nicola's
	          soured on the project and we have
	          to accept that.  If we ever want to
	          be in the Nicola Anders business
	          again, we have to cut our losses
	          and shelve the picture.
	
	The executives, leading man and director nod sagely.
	
	                    VIKTOR
	              (aghast)
	          No!  You will not give in to that
	          blackmailing bitch!
	
	                    ELAINE
	              (a wince, addressing
	               everyone but Viktor)
	          Excuse us.
	
	Elaine ushers Viktor out of the screening room.
	
	EXT.  STUDIO LOT - DAY
	
	ELAINE and VIKTOR talk in the shadow of an enormous
	soundstage.  They speak more freely in each other's company.
	
	                    ELAINE
	          God, Viktor.  Why do you always
	          have to make things so difficult
	          for yourself?
	
	                    VIKTOR
	          Difficult.  I'm difficult.
	
	He produces a handful of candy from his pocket.
	
	                    VIKTOR
	              (referring to the candy)
	          -- Do you know what these are,
	          Elaine?
	
	                    ELAINE
	              (talking a piece of candy
	               and eating it)
	          Hmm... Mike and Ike's.
	
	                    VIKTOR
	          Not just any Mike & Ike's -- cherry
	          Mike & Ike's.  Do you know why I,
	          Viktor Taransky, two-time Academy
	          Award nominated director --
	
	                    ELAINE
	          -- Viktor, that was Short Subject.
	
	                    VIKTOR
	          -- overseeing the most cherished
	          movie project of my career, am
	          walking around with a pocketful of
	          cherry Mike & Ike's?
	
	Elaine takes a seat in a nearby studio cart as Viktor paces.
	
	                    ELAINE
	          -- I have a feeling you're going to
	          tell me.
	
	                    VIKTOR
	          -- I'll tell you why.  It is
	          because Miss Nicola Anders,
	          supermodel with a SAG card God's
	          gift to cinema, has it written into
	          her contract that all cherry Mike &

	                    VIKTOR
	          Elaine, she doesn't have any
	          children!
	              (grabbing her arm)
	          Don't you see?  We're being held
	          hostage by 12 men and 5 women who
	          someone somewhere has decreed are
	          the A-list.
	
	                    ELAINE
	          The public decides who's on that
	          list.
	
	                    VIKTOR
	          Please.
	
	                    ELAINE
	          It's the truth.  Those 17
	          superstars are our insurance
	          policy.  We can't open -- can't
	          make a profit without them.
	
	                    VIKTOR
	          We can hardly make a profit with
	          them.  Up-front salary, back-end
	          deal, perks, per diem, percentages 
	          -- They're mocking us, Elaine. 
	          We're at their mercy.
	              (staring wistful, into
	               space)
	          We always had movie stars but they
	          used to be our stars.  We used to
	          decide who would play what role. 
	          We told them what to wear, what to
	          say, who to date.  When they were
	          under contract, we could change
	          their names if we wanted to -- more
	          than once!

	              (irritated at her
	               infuriating logic)
	          Well, I do remember why I started
	          out in this business -- you seem to
	          have forgotten -- working in New
	          York with Cassevetes -- we were
	          trying to do something important,
	          shine a light in that darkened
	          cinema --
	
	                    ELAINE
	              (rolling her eyes)

	                    ELAINE
	          Listen, Viktor, I have good
	          memories of those days too -- but
	          this isn't about that or you or me
	          or some high-minded ideal.  This is
	          business.
	
	                    VIKTOR
	          Spare me.

	          -- Christ, Viktor, look around. 
	          What do you think pays for all
	          this?  This is about investment and
	          return.  Those days in New York...
	          that's... it's over.
	
	A pause.  Viktor reads Elaine's face.
	
	                    VIKTOR
	          You're not renewing my contract.
	
	                    ELAINE
	          How can I?  Your last three
	          pictures tanked.  The board is
	          giving me hell.  No bankable star
	          will work with you after this.  If
	          you just compromised... a little.
	
	Viktor eats some of the candy in his hand as he takes in the
	news.
	
	                    VIKTOR
	              (rueful smile)
	          -- Well, it's not every day you're
	          fired by the mother of your own
	          child.
	
	Elaine also eats some more candy -- a curiously intimate
	moment between them.
	
	                    ELAINE
	              (softening, a heart-to
	               heart)
	          I'm not taking away your daughter,
	          just your deal.  You and I both
	          know, after the divorce I kept you
	          on for old time's sake, so you
	          could still hold your head up in
	          front of Lainey.  I called what's
	          his name at Warner's.  He said he'd
	          take a meeting -- in July.  I've
	          fought for you Viktor...
	              (voice trails off)
	          You want to talk severance?
	
	                    VIKTOR
	              (staring off into the
	               distance, face hardening)
	          You can have everything -- office,
	          car, assistants -- all I want is
	          the picture.
	
	                    ELAINE
	              (confused)
	          The picture's dead.
	
	                    VIKTOR
	          So there's no problem -- I can have
	          the rights, the negative too?
	
	                    ELAINE
	              (believing she's getting
	               off lightly)
	          They're yours.  But how are you
	          going to finish it?  Without a star
	          there's no movie.
	
	                    VIKTOR
	          I don't need a star.  All I need is
	          an actor -- I'll reshoot the part,
	          cut out Nicola and replace her with
	          a real actor.  A real leading lady.
	
	                    ELAINE
	          Even if you find her, you know the
	          problem with unknowns, Viktor.  If
	          they're good, they get known.  And
	          then you're back to sorting their
	          candy... and worse.
	              (kissing him on the cheek
	               as she departs in her
	               studio golf cart)
	          I'm sorry, Viktor.
	
	Viktor watches her depart down the canyon of stages, left
	alone on the deserted lot.
	
	EXT.  STUDIO ENTRANCE - DUSK
	
	Twenty NICOLA ANDERS' FACES jiggle into frame.  VIKTOR's face
	appears amongst them.
	
	They are cardboard figures, standing together in the trailer
	of an electric cart.  A WORKMAN is collecting the promotional
	standees from around the lot.
	
	VIKTOR places his hands on the neck of a cardboard cut-out --
	we sense he is about to rip her head off -- when a fourteen
	year old girl, LAINEY, appears beside him, carrying a laptop
	computer.
	
	                    LAINEY
	          Hi, Dad.
	
	                    VIKTOR
	              (slightly ashamed)
	          Hello, sweetheart.
	
	Viktor, embarrassed by his childishness, steps aside for the
	suspicious workman who carries the standee away.
	
	Lainey smiles sweetly.  She hugs him.
	
	                    LAINEY
	          I'm sorry Mom canned you.
	
	                    VIKTOR
	              (shrugging)
	          It's really... not anything,
	          Lainey.  It's just --
	
	                    LAINEY
	          Don't feel too bad.
	              (glancing to a standee)
	          Mom runs the place and they still
	          walk all over her.  You're better
	          off out of it.
	
	                    VIKTOR
	              (regarding his daughter)
	          You look very grown up.  What are
	          you doing?  You meeting your mom
	          for dinner?
	
	She glances towards the entrance where Lainey's mother,
	ELAINE, and her dependable, uncomplicated businessman
	boyfriend, KENT, wait beside Elaine's car.
	
	                    LAINEY
	              (reluctant admission)
	          Kent got tickets to the ballet.
	
	Viktor shakes the idea of Kent and Elaine from his head.

	              (trying to convince
	               himself as much as
	               Lainey)
	          I'm going to finish the picture,
	          sweetheart.  It's important.
	
	                    LAINEY
	              (not quite convinced)
	          I know you'll do it, Dad.  You're
	          Viktor Taransky.
	
	Lainey kisses the forlorn Viktor goodbye.  She runs to her
	mother and Kent.
	
	                    VIKTOR
	              (to himself)
	          That's right.  I'm Viktor Taransky.

	VIKTOR.

	          You had no choice, Elaine.  He's a
	          liability.
	
	                    ELAINE
	              (wistful look to Viktor)
	          He also happens to be the most
	          talented man I've ever known.

	The man reading the trade paper sits in the back of a tram on
	a studio tour -- HANK ALENO.  He wears a pair of spectacles
	with one lens blacked out, his head tilted on one side.  It
	is an item buried on the inside pages that catches Hank's one
	good eye.

	          And coming up on your right --

	tram and is hiding in the facade of a New York subway
	entrance.  The tag around his neck reads, "VISITOR -- Stay

	VIKTOR wheels a stack of film cans on a dolly while holding
	several framed black and white photographs of screen legends
	under his arm.
	
	HANK, hiding in the shadows of the soundstages, spies Viktor.
	He hurries towards him as Viktor approaches his antiquated
	Bentley.
	
	                    HANK
	          -- Mr. Taransky, Mr. Taransky...

	          I did it, Mr. Taransky.  I licked
	          skin.  I licked hair.  I licked
	          every part of her.

	man's motives.

	                    VIKTOR
	          You do?
	
	                    HANK
	          "Straw God" changed my life.
	
	                    VIKTOR
	          You saw that?
	
	                    HANK
	          I've seen every frame of your work. 
	          You're the only filmmaker in
	          Hollywood with the artistic
	          integrity to realize my vision. 
	          You and me, art and science... we
	          are the perfect marriage.
	
	                    VIKTOR
	          Listen, Hank, it's been a rough
	          day.
	              (climbing into his car)
	          I'll call you about his next week.
	
	                    HANK
	              (at the car window)
	          I won't be here next week.  The
	          tumor's inoperable.  I'll be dead.
	
	                    VIKTOR
	              (winding down the window)
	          I'm already dead.
	
	Viktor's car roars away.  He looks back at the forlorn Hank
	in the rear view mirror.
	
	                    HANK
	          Call me.
	              (looking at his watch)
	          This week!
	
	A huge eye from a dismantled Nicola Anders billboard is
	wheeled away behind him -- followed by a huge pair of lips.
	
	INT.  VIKTOR'S MALIBU HOUSE - DAY
	
	A sea of ingenue headshots.  Black X's are drawn through all
	of them.  VIKTOR lies amongst the rejected faces, talking on
	the telephone, in his spartan bachelor beach house.
	
	                    VIKTOR
	              (into phone, referring to
	               a young woman's headshot)
	          -- What do you mean she won't work
	          with me?  She's done nothing.  She
	          doesn't have a single credit --
	
	                    AGENT'S VOICE
	              (from phone, off-camera)
	          -- Better no credits than a
	          Taransky credit.  No young actress
	          is going to step into Nicola
	          Anders' shoes and risk ending her
	          career before it's even started.
	
	                    VIKTOR
	          -- Art, you don't understand.  I've
	          mortgaged everything to finish this
	          film -- creditors calling, coming
	          to the house, for God's sake, I
	          need this --
	
	The phone goes dead.  Viktor tries to re-dial --
	disconnected.
	
	                    VIKTOR
	          -- Damn.
	
	Sharp knock on his door.  Viktor peers through a curtain and
	spies an official-looking MAN IN A SUIT, carrying what looks
	to be a legal notice in his hands.
	
	Viktor slips out of the back door.
	
	EXT.  BEACH - DAY
	
	VIKTOR hurries along the beach.  When he turns, he discovers
	the MAN IN THE SUIT following him.  As Viktor runs, the Suit
	runs -- calling out to him.
	
	                    MAN IN THE SUIT
	          Mr. Taransky, Mr. Taransky --
	
	                    VIKTOR
	              (calling back)
	          I'm not him.
	
	Viktor stumbles.  When he recovers, the Suit is on him.
	
	                    MAN IN THE SUIT
	          Mr. Taransky, Sir, I represent the
	          estate of Mr. Hank Aleno.
	              (showing him Hank's
	               obituary in the L.A. 
	               Times)
	          It was Mr. Aleno's last wish that
	          you have this.
	
	The Suit hands Viktor a heavily-sealed envelope.
	
	                    VIKTOR
	          What is it?
	
	                    MAN IN THE SUIT
	          I have no idea, Sir.  He wanted you
	          to have it.
	
	The Suit departs.  Viktor hesitates, then breaks the seal on
	the package -- inside he finds a hard-drive.  The hard-drive
	is labeled "SIMULATION ONE".
	
	A TITLE APPEARS ON THE SCREEN:
	
	                      SIX MONTHS LATER
	
	CLOSE UP ON
	
	a VACUUM CLEANER cleaning a tatty red carpet.
	
	On the other end of the vacuum cleaner is VIKTOR.  The red
	carpet leads to a rundown, downtown Los Angeles cinema -- the
	venue for the premiere of "SUNRISE, SUNSET".  To save money
	on posters, Viktor has altered the originals, "Starring
	NICOLA ANDERS" crudely pasted over with "Introducing SIMONE".
	
	EXT.  RUNDOWN DOWNTOWN CINEMA - DUSK
	
	VIKTOR regards the sad, little premiere.  No paparazzi, no
	limos, no klieg lights.  Resorting to giving away tickets to
	PASSERS-BY, Viktor approaches a HOMELESS MAN sleeping in
	trash.
	
	                    VIKTOR
	          Want to see a free movie?
	
	                    HOMELESS MAN
	              (he thinks)
	          No.
	
	A taxi pulls up.  Viktor's daughter, LAINEY, steps out.
	
	                    LAINEY
	              (kissing him hello)
	          Hi, Dad.
	
	                    VIKTOR
	          Hello, Lainey.
	
	Viktor goes to pay for the taxi but doesn't have quite enough
	cash.  Lainey pays herself.
	
	                    VIKTOR
	          Your mother couldn't make it?
	
	                    LAINEY
	          She's at the premiere of "A Cold
	          Day In Hell".  But I think she send
	          someone from Acquisitions.
	
	                    VIKTOR
	          She still with Kent?
	
	                    LAINEY
	          This week anyhow.
	
	VIKTOR escorts Lainey down the empty red carpet, regarding
	the pathetic premiere.  As they walk by, the bulb in Viktor's
	sole spotlight expires.
	
	                    VIKTOR
	          Not quite how I imagined it --
	
	                    LAINEY
	              (looking on the bright
	               side)
	          -- You finished the film on your
	          own terms, that's what matters. 
	          Did you really do all the post
	          yourself?
	
	                    VIKTOR
	          There was no other way.
	
	                    LAINEY
	          I missed you.  I wondered if you
	          were ever coming back.
	
	                    VIKTOR
	          Me too.
	
	                    LAINEY
	              (regarding the makeshift
	               poster, trying to lift
	               his spirits)
	          Well, I can't wait to meet
	          Simone... what's her last name?
	
	                    VIKTOR
	          You know, I... don't know.
	
	                    LAINEY
	          Is she here tonight?
	
	                    VIKTOR
	          She can't watch herself.
	
	They are interrupted by the THEATER OWNER.
	
	                    THEATER OWNER
	          -- Hey, we have to start.  I've got
	          "Tough Love 2" playing at ten.
	
	EXT.  PIER - "SUNRISE, SUNSET" - MORNING
	
	A foggy, empty pier.  A MAN is running through the mist,
	shouting desperately.
	
	                    HAL
	          Valarie!  VALARIE!
	
	Finally, out of the fog -- a young woman in a black cape and
	hood, her back to us.  The camera pushes in, music swells and
	she turns.  SIMONE.  She is exquisitely, ethereally
	beautiful.  Perfect.
	
	INT.  RUNDOWN DOWNTOWN CINEMA - AUDITORIUM - NIGHT
	
	In the near-empty, dilapidated theater, "SUNRISE, SUNSET" is
	playing ON THE SCREEN.
	
	When Simone's face appears, the faces of the AUDIENCE MEMBERS
	change.  They are all visibly moved, including the THEATER
	OWNER.  Some weeping, some with curious smiles on their
	faces, some opened-mouthed.
	
	                    HAL
	              (ON SCREEN, approaching)
	          Valarie, what are you running from?
	
	                    SIMONE
	              (enigmatic smile)
	          From Valarie.
	
	Suddenly a GUNSHOT rings out.  Simone collapses to the
	ground.
	
	                    HAL
	              (running to her)
	          Valarie!  No!
	
	INT.  THEATER LOBBY - NIGHT
	
	VIKTOR, unable to watch, paces up and down, chain-smoking
	while worriedly shoving popcorn in his mouth.  Viktor finally
	musters the courage to look inside the auditorium.
	
	INT.  BEDROOM - "SUNRISE, SUNSET" - NIGHT
	
	The same scene that played in the studio screening room. 
	However now when we cut from the leading man, HAL, to the
	leading lady it is not NICOLA but the newly cast SIMONE.
	
	                    SIMONE
	          -- Why are we here?  Is that what
	          you're asking, Jack?... Why are we
	          here?  No why.  Just here.
	
	INT.  AUDITORIUM - NIGHT
	
	ON SCREEN SIMONE lies dying.  Now even LAINEY is affected by
	Simone's performance.  She wipes a tear from her eye.
	
	VIKTOR watches the backs of the heads, trying to gauge the
	audience reaction.  Finally the credits roll.
	
	A dedication, "For HANK".
	
	No one moves from their seats.  Viktor permits himself a
	brief smile of satisfaction as he sees his name appear in the
	credits:
	
	                 A Film By VIKTOR TARANSKY
	
	Still no one moves from their seats.  Viktor cannot stand it
	any longer.  He runs to the restroom.
	
	INT.  THEATER RESTROOM - NIGHT
	
	Face over the stained sink, VIKTOR splashes himself with
	water.  He looks to the mirror, horrified by his own
	reflection.  He rehearses a courtroom speech.
	
	                    VIKTOR
	          Ladies and gentlemen of the jury, I
	          may be guilty of a crime, but it
	          was committed with the purest of
	          intentions, to send a message to
	          the acting community who put
	          themselves above the work and
	          above --
	
	Three AUDIENCE MEMBERS enter the restroom.  They approach the
	urinals.
	
	                    AUDIENCE MEMBER 1
	              (continuing their
	               conversation from the
	               lobby)
	          -- So fake.
	
	                    AUDIENCE MEMBER 2
	          -- Totally artificial.
	
	Viktor looks at the men aghast and hurriedly exits, missing
	the end of their conversation.
	
	                    AUDIENCE MEMBER 1
	          We're really supposed to believe
	          that was 19th Century Lisbon?
	
	                    AUDIENCE MEMBER 3
	          Who's looking at the sets when she
	          is on the screen?
	
	All three nod in agreement and begin to urinate.
	
	INT.  THEATER LOBBY - NIGHT
	
	VIKTOR exits the restroom.  Almost all the AUDIENCE MEMBERS,
	including LAINEY, are waiting for him.
	
	                    LAINEY
	              (pointing out her father)
	          There he is.  That's my dad, Viktor
	          Taransky.
	
	Viktor is about to run for the exit when the small group
	spontaneously applauds.  They rush to shake his hand.
	
	                    AUDIENCE MEMBER 4
	          -- She is magnificent.
	
	                    AUDIENCE MEMBER 5
	          -- Absolutely unreal.
	
	Viktor appears uncomfortable with their compliments.
	
	                    VIKTOR
	          She wasn't too... cartoony?
	
	                    AUDIENCE MEMBER 6
	          -- Who?  The nun?
	
	                    AUDIENCE MEMBER 7
	          -- Or are you talking about the
	          mother?
	
	                    AUDIENCE MEMBER 8
	          -- A star like that, who cares
	          about the supporting cast?
	
	                    AUDIENCE MEMBER 9
	          -- Congratulations again.  She
	          was... not of this earth.  You
	          should be very proud.
	
	                    VIKTOR
	          "Not of this earth".  A good way of
	          putting it.  And the film as a
	          whole -- ?
	
	The group drifts away, leaving LAINEY and VIKTOR alone.
	
	                    LAINEY
	          She's a miracle, Dad.  Where did
	          you find her?
	
	                    VIKTOR
	              (vague)
	          I saw her picture on the, er...
	          internet.
	              (interrogating his
	               daughter's face)
	          You really didn't notice anything --
	          unusual?
	
	                    LAINEY
	          Only her brilliance.  To be honest,
	          with what you had to work with, I
	          was expecting a train wreck.  You
	          really pulled it off.
	
	Lainey regards the makeshift poster.
	
	                    LAINEY
	          I have a feeling mom is going to
	          take you back after this.
	
	Viktor's head snaps around.  Lainey smiles.
	
	                    LAINEY
	          Back on the lot.
	
	Viktor shrugs off the misunderstanding.
	
	INT.  VIKTOR TARANSKY'S MALIBU HOME - NIGHT
	
	VIKTOR enters his sterile, bachelor home, carrying his mail. 
	His answering machine blinks in the darkness, the message
	light reads "FULL".  He hits the "PLAY" button.
	
	                    ELAINE (V.O.)
	          Viktor, you bastard!  I hear it's
	          great.
	              (beat)
	          Seriously, I'm happy for you.
	
	Viktor opens a drawer containing a photo of he and Elaine
	from happier times.  He gazes at it as he listens to the
	message.
	
	                    ELAINE (V.O.)
	          I know people are going to be
	          beating down your door but... well,
	          I'd love the chance to buy back
	          something I gave away for free. 
	          Don't you just love Hollywood?...
	          BEEP.
	
	Viktor stops the machine, dazed.  He idly opens his mail. 
	Inside an envelope he finds a SAG Card with the new member's
	name, "SIMONE".
	
	A MONTAGE OF SCENES BEGINS TO PLAY.
	
	A)  A line of AUDIENCE MEMBERS stretches outside the rundown
	    movie theater as far as the eye can see.
	
	                    ENTERTAINMENT REPORTER (O.S.)
	          A dazzling new ingenue has come
	          from seemingly nowhere to capture
	          the hearts of movie-going audiences
	          across the nation...
	
	B)  THE FRONT PAGE OF "VARIETY" coming off the presses reads,
	    "SIMONE: A REVELATION -- Dawning Of A New Star In
	    "SUNRISE".
	
	                    ENTERTAINMENT REPORTER (O.S.)
	          ... in her debut film, "Sunrise,
	          Sunset".
	
	C)  A TEENAGE BOY in a public library logs on to the first
	    website dedicated to SIMONE.
	
	                    ENTERTAINMENT REPORTER (O.S.)
	          Her face is already posted on
	          everything from websites to bedroom
	          walls.
	
	D)  Trendy TEENAGE GIRLS saunter past a swimming pool in
	    Simone capes and hoods despite the sweltering heat.
	
	                    ENTERTAINMENT REPORTER (O.S.)
	          Her wardrobe has inspired a fashion
	          craze.
	
	E)  In a Third World back-alley a YOUNG ASIAN MAN shows an
	    UNDERCOVER REPORTER a pirated recording of SIMONE on a
	    camcorder.
	
	                    ENTERTAINMENT REPORTER (O.S.)
	          And bootleg copies of her film are
	          being sold in back alleys all over
	          the world.
	
	F)  A LIQUOR STORE CUSTOMER watches a TV behind the counter
	    showing a clip of SIMONE from, "SUNRISE, SUNSET Courtesy:
	    Taransky Productions".
	
	                    ENTERTAINMENT REPORTER
	              (from TV)
	          But who is Simone?  We know so
	          little about her.  No details of
	          her background have been released,
	          not even her age.  She is somewhere
	          between a girl and a woman.  A
	          fresh face and familiar both at the
	          same time.
	
	G)  The ENTERTAINMENT REPORTER now stands outside a
	    multiplex.  The marquee has 16 screens and looks like
	    this:
	
	        "SUNRISE, SUNSET"         "SUNRISE, SUNSET"
	        "SUNRISE, SUNSET"         "SUNRISE, SUNSET"

	        "SUNRISE, SUNSET"         "SUNRISE, SUNSET"
	        "SUNRISE, SUNSET"         "SUNRISE, SUNSET"
	        "SUNRISE, SUNSET"         "SUNRISE, SUNSET"
	        "SUNRISE, SUNSET"         "THE MAKING OF
	                                       SUNRISE, SUNSET"
	
	                    ENTERTAINMENT REPORTER
	          Is Simone even her real name?  And
	          why the secrecy?  All we know for
	          sure is that she was discovered by
	          little-known director, Viktor
	          Tarinsky.
	
	INT.  LIMOUSINE - DAY
	
	VIKTOR, watching "SCENE" on a TV in the back of a limousine,
	corrects the reporter.
	
	                    VIKTOR
	          Taransky.
	
	                    ENTERTAINMENT REPORTER
	              (from the TV)
	          He has parlayed his relationship
	          with the new sensation into a three
	          picture deal with the very studio
	          that dumped him only six months
	          ago.  And no wonder with the
	          starlet's performance breaking all
	          box office records.
	
	EXT.  STUDIO GATE - MORNING
	
	Outside the studio entrance, a swarm of REPORTERS,
	PHOTOGRAPHERS and FANS rush VIKTOR's limousine, hoping for a
	glimpse of SIMONE.
	
	                    MOB
	          Simone!  SIMONE!  I LOVE YOU!  I
	          Want to BE you!
	
	Studio SECURITY GUARDS hold them back as the limo enters the
	lot.
	
	EXT.  STUDIO - ENTRANCE - DAY
	
	ELAINE and an entourage of EXECUTIVES greets VIKTOR's
	limousine on the studio steps.
	 
	A STUDIO PHOTOGRAPHER has a camera at the ready.  A banner
	reads, "Welcome SIMONE".  A YOUNG ASSISTANT wheels a cake.
	
	VIKTOR steps out of the car.  ELAINE pushes past him, into
	the limo.
	
	                    ELAINE
	          Simone!... Simone?
	
	The car is empty.
	
	                    ELAINE
	              (re-emerging from the car)
	          Where is she?
	
	                    VIKTOR
	          Good to see you too, Elaine.
	
	                    ELAINE
	              (ignoring his sarcasm)
	          Why isn't she with you?
	
	                    VIKTOR
	          Why?  Because she would never show
	          up at something like this.  She's
	          intensely private.
	
	Elaine sighs, exasperated.
	
	                    ELAINE
	              (dismissing her
	               colleagues)
	          Back to work, everyone.  She's not
	          here.
	
	The reception committee disperses, murmurs of disappointment.
	
	                    ELAINE
	          Viktor... I want to thank you for
	          convincing Simone to sign with the
	          studio.
	
	                    VIKTOR
	          Don't thank me.  It was entirely
	          Simone's decision.  Do you have
	          Simone's check?
	
	                    ELAINE
	          I don't have it on me.  Anyway, it
	          means a lot.
	              (quickly changing tack)
	          Have you read the reviews?  They're
	          love letters.
	              (reading from a newspaper)
	          Listen to this one.  "Simone has
	          the voice of a young Jane Fonda,
	          the body of Sophia Loren, the grace
	          of, well, Grace Kelley, and the
	          face of Audrey Hepburn combined
	          with an angel".
	
	                    VIKTOR
	              (musing to himself)
	          Almost right.
	
	                    ELAINE
	          I can't wait to meet her.
	
	                    VIKTOR
	          I don't know if that's going to
	          happen.
	
	                    ELAINE
	              (confused)
	          Why not?
	
	                    VIKTOR
	          As I say, she's... something of a
	          recluse.  That's how she's able to
	          stay so pure -- by isolating
	          herself in her art.
	
	                    ELAINE
	              (face falling)
	          Don't be ridiculous.  I arranged a
	          press conference.
	
	                    VIKTOR
	          Out of the question.  A circus like
	          that?
	
	                    ELAINE
	          Viktor, it's my studio.
	
	                    VIKTOR
	          She's my actor.  There are other
	          studios, Elaine.  There's only one
	          Simone.
	              (leaving her on the steps)
	          Leave the press conference to me.
	
	Viktor strides up the studio steps.  Elaine stares after her
	ex-husband -- she finds herself smiling at his newfound
	arrogance.
	
	EXT.  STUDIO - PRESS CONFERENCE - DAY
	
	The studio soundstages as a backdrop, VIKTOR approaches a
	podium and a forest of microphones, revelling in his recent
	fame by association.
	
	                    VIKTOR
	              (tapping the microphone)
	          Is this on?
	
	                    REPORTER 1
	          Who are you?
	
	                    VIKTOR
	          Taransky, Viktor.  T-a-r-a-n-s-k-y,
	          V-i-k-t-o-r.
	
	                    REPORTER 1
	          Yeah, but -- who are you?
	
	                    VIKTOR
	              (patronizing smile)
	          I am a two-time Academy Award
	          nominated director with over
	          eighteen films to my credit thus
	          far including my latest release,
	          "Sunrise, Sunset".  Who are you?
	
	A REPORTER rolls her eyes at his pomposity.
	
	                    VIKTOR
	          I will not be taking any questions. 
	          However I do have a statement to
	          read on behalf of my leading lady,
	          Simone.
	              (reading from his
	               statement)
	          "To Whom It May Concern.  I'm
	          deeply grateful for the
	          extraordinary public response to
	          Mr. Taransky's film.  At this time
	          I will be conducting no interviews
	          or making publicity appearances
	          since I am really nothing without
	          the beautiful worlds and characters
	          Mr. Taransky creates for me.  I
	          politely request that the press
	          respect my privacy and let the work
	          speak for itself.  All questions
	          and inquiries should be directed to
	          Mr. Taransky to whom I entrust all
	          aspects of my career.  Yours very
	          truly, Simone".
	
	The reporters all call out at once.
	
	                    REPORTER 2
	          -- Viktor, Viktor, who's Simone
	          dating?
	
	                    REPORTER 3
	          -- Viktor, where'd you find her?
	
	                    REPORTER 4
	          -- Is Simone her real name?
	
	                    REPORTER 5
	          -- What's she got to hide?
	
	                    REPORTER 1
	          -- Is she the new Garbo?
	
	                    REPORTER 2
	          -- Who's Garbo?
	
	Viktor silences the reporters by theatrically raising his
	hands.
	
	                    VIKTOR
	          I thought I made it clear -- no
	          questions regarding Simone.
	              (bringing the press
	               conference to a hasty
	               conclusion)
	          Now, I would like to close by
	          announcing that Miss Simone begins
	          production today on her next film,
	          "Eternity Forever".  This project
	          has been near and dear to my heart
	          since I wrote it nine years ago.
	              (a tinge of bitterness,
	               then a smile)
	          I Thank you.
	
	Viktor exits the podium.  A voice stops him in his tracks.
	
	                    VOICE (O.S.)
	          Who do you think you're fooling,
	          Taransky?
	
	Viktor turns.  The voice belongs to over-zealous, crusading,
	truth-seeking investigative reporter, MAX SAYER, accompanied
	by his assistant, MILTON.
	
	                    VIKTOR
	          Do I know you?
	
	                    MAX
	          Max Sayer -- National Echo.
	
	                    VIKTOR
	              (regaining his composure,
	               a smirk)
	          Don't you have a real story to
	          write?  Why aren't you in Latin
	          America?
	
	                    MAX
	          This is the story.
	
	                    VIKTOR
	          I remember when the Echo had class 
	          -- the paper that could bring down
	          governments.
	
	                    MAX
	          Our leaders aren't presidents
	          anymore -- they're pop stars and
	          screen idols.  If Woodward and
	          Bernstein were alive today, they'd
	          be right here in Hollywood with me.
	
	                    VIKTOR
	          They are alive, Sayer.
	
	Milton confirms that Woodward and Bernstein are still living.
	
	                    MAX
	          So they're probably here.
	              (hardly missing a beat)
	          You might be able to sell this
	          'disappearing act' to the rest of
	          the world, but I'm not buying it. 
	          What's really behind this Simone
	          woman?  The public has a right to
	          know.  Why is she staying out of
	          sight?  And why the hell is she
	          with you?  I don't want you to take
	          this the wrong way, Viktor, but
	          you're not exactly Cecil B. 
	          DeMille -- more run-of-the-mill.
	
	                    VIKTOR
	          Maybe the reason she's with me is a
	          little thing called integrity,
	          Sayer.  Look it up.
	
	Viktor walks away.
	
	                    MAX
	              (calling after him)
	          Oh, I know all about integrity.  I
	          know even more about persistence. 
	          Look that one up.
	
	Max watches Viktor depart, with obvious suspicion.
	
	EXT.  SOUNDSTAGE - STUDIO LOT - DAY
	
	A large satellite dish sits atop a soundstage.
	
	"CLOSED SET" is the sign on the door -- a surveillance camera
	panning the entrance.  A SECURITY GUARD, also keeping watch,
	nods a greeting to VIKTOR as he pulls up in his studio golf
	cart, script in hand.
	
	                    SECURITY GUARD
	          No one came in or went out just
	          like you said, Mr. Taransky.
	
	                    VIKTOR
	          Good.
	
	                    SECURITY GUARD
	          Is Miss Simone coming today?
	
	                    VIKTOR
	          She's already here.  She arrived
	          before you and she'll leave long
	          after you've gone.
	              (admonishing guard)
	          Remember, under no circumstances
	          are you or any other person to
	          enter the set without my express
	          permission.
	
	                    SECURITY GUARD
	          What if it catches on fire?
	
	                    VIKTOR
	          Let it burn.  Simone would rather
	          go up in flames than give up her
	          privacy.
	
	Viktor enters his secret code into the keypad lock and enters
	the soundstage.
	
	INT.  VIKTOR'S SOUNDSTAGE - DAY
	
	The cavernous soundstage is almost completely empty save for
	a small table upon which sits two computer keyboards and a
	tablet attached to a large, projection screen monitor and two
	side monitors.  VIKTOR takes a seat in front of the monitor.
	
	                    VIKTOR
	              (to himself as he inserts
	               his Hollywood hard-drive 
	               -- SIMULATION ONE)
	          Pay no attention to the man behind
	          the computer.
	
	A title appears on his computer screen.
	
	                          Welcome
	                             to
	                       SIMULATION ONE
	
	With a satisfied smile, Viktor backspaces characters until he
	revises the title to:
	
	                          Welcome
	                             to
	                           SIMONE
	
	He presses "ENTER" and a face begins to build -- wire upon
	wire, pixel upon pixel -- until a completed synthespian
	emerges -- SIMONE.  She is indistinguishable from a flesh-and
	blood actress.
	
	Simone moves on a video loop against a neutral background --
	titled "VISUAL LOOP 6".  Within the confines of the monitor
	she is reminiscent of a beautiful caged animal.  She looks a
	little bored as if she has been cooped up in cyberspace for
	too long.
	
	                    VIKTOR
	              (to the screen)
	          Good morning, Simone.
	
	                    SIMONE / VIKTOR
	          Good morning, Mr. Taransky.
	
	                    VIKTOR
	          A star is...
	
	                    SIMONE / VIKTOR
	          ... digitized.
	
	Only now do we observe that Viktor is occasionally talking
	into a microphone connected to the computer and pressing a
	key on his keyboard.  When he speaks, she speaks.  Simone's
	voice and mouth movements automatically sync in response to
	Viktor's voice.  A scanning light on Viktor allows Simone to
	mimic his movements.
	
	                    SIMONE / VIKTOR
	          You mean they buy it?
	
	                    VIKTOR
	              (nervous smile as he
	               examines his first
	               royalty check)
	          Buy it?  They're paying for it. 
	          And around here that's how you
	          really know they buy it.
	
	Viktor fondly touches a photograph of Hank that is taped to
	the terminal -- from the "L.A. Times" obituaries.
	
	                    VIKTOR
	          I'm only sorry Hank isn't here to
	          see this.
	
	Viktor looks up, Simone mimicking his action.
	
	                    SIMONE / VIKTOR
	              (depressing the button
	               every time he wants to
	               express his thoughts
	               through Simone)
	          Maybe he can.
	
	                    VIKTOR
	          Do you have any idea what this
	          means, Simone?  Our ability to
	          manufacture fraud now exceeds our
	          ability to detect it.
	
	                    SIMONE / VIKTOR
	              (appearing to indulge
	               Viktor with a smile)
	          I am the death of real.
	
	                    VIKTOR
	              (pondering the enormity of
	               the hoax)
	          You are birth of... what?  A
	          Phenomenon.  A miracle.  A new era
	          in show business.  All I wanted to
	          do was finish the film.
	
	                    SIMONE / VIKTOR
	          And now look what you've started. 
	          And now look what you've started. 
	          And now look what you've started.
	
	Viktor's conversation with himself is not merely for his own
	amusement.  He is adjusting and refining Simone's voice.
	
	                    VIKTOR
	          Hmm... a little less Streep, a
	          little more Bacall.
	
	Viktor scrolls through a photo library of stars, living and
	dead, that comprise Simone.
	
	Viktor makes an adjustment on a panel on the computer screen
	dedicated to Simone's audio, incorporating the vocal
	deliveries -- "20% STREEP, 80% BACALL".
	
	He speaks once again as Simone to test the adjustment.  The
	voice patterns appear on his screen -- graphic
	representations of the sound waves.
	
	                    SIMONE / VIKTOR
	          Is that better, Mr. Taransky?
	
	                    VIKTOR
	          Yes.  Yes, it is.
	
	VIKTOR snaps back to reality himself.  He scrolls through the
	list of screen legends.  He clicks on the image of AUDREY
	HEPBURN.
	
	                    VIKTOR
	          While I think of it, I'd like you
	          to add something to your repertoire
	          -- remember that thing Hepburn does
	          in "Breakfast At Tiffany's".
	
	A clip of AUDREY HEPBURN in "Breakfast At Tiffany's" plays on
	the screen.  Hepburn, sitting on a fire escape, looks up.
	
	                    AUDREY HEPBURN
	              (from the screen, an
	               incomparable smile)
	          Hi.
	
	                    VIKTOR
	              (pausing the moment)
	          Let's hear you say "Hi" like
	          Audrey.
	
	With a CUT and PASTE, Viktor morphs the gesture seamlessly
	into a frozen Simone.  Viktor presses play.
	
	                    SIMONE
	              (imitating Audrey's
	               performance perfectly)
	          Hi.
	
	                    VIKTOR
	          Perfect.
	              (stretching)
	          God, I'm so relaxed around you.
	
	                    SIMONE / VIKTOR
	          You did create me.
	
	                    VIKTOR
	          No.  I... just helped bring someone
	          else's dream to life.
	
	                    SIMONE / VIKTOR
	          Mr. Taransky, we both know I was
	          nothing without you.  I was
	          computer code -- ones and zeros.
	
	                    VIKTOR
	          You're right.  You're right.  Of
	          course, one doesn't want to boast. 
	          It's a classic case of technology
	          in search of an artist.  That's all
	          you've been waiting for, an artist
	          with integrity, with a vision, who
	          can see.
	
	Viktor gets up and starts walking around the room, warming to
	his theme.  SIMONE moves in a VISUAL LOOP on the monitor,
	nodding attentively as if she's really interested.
	
	                    VIKTOR
	          See beyond that irrational
	          allegiance to flesh and blood. --
	          See that with the rise in price of
	          a real actor and the fall in price
	          of a fake, the scales have tipped
	          in favor of the fake.
	              (voice raising in
	               excitement)
	          -- See that if the performance is
	          genuine, it doesn't matter if the
	          actor is real.  Once a performance
	          is committed to film, the blood and
	          bones are gone anyway.  Only the
	          spirit, the illusion remains. 
	          Besides, what's real anymore? 
	          These days most actors have digital
	          work done to them so it's a gray
	          area.
	
	                    SIMONE / VIKTOR
	              (Simone appears to look
	               directly at her maker)
	          Are you ever going to tell the
	          truth about me, Mr. Taransky?
	
	                    VIKTOR
	          The only real truth is in the work.
	
	                    SIMONE / VIKTOR
	          You know what I'm talking about.
	
	                    VIKTOR
	          Yes.  Yes, I'm going to tell the
	          truth about you, why wouldn't I...?
	              (pondering his own
	               question)
	          Of course, with Hank's tragic
	          passing, the secret died with him.
	              (shaking the thought from
	               his head)
	          I am going to tell the truth...
	          after your next picture.
	
	Feeling uneasy at the prospect, Viktor changes the subject. 
	He pulls out his script for "ETERNITY FOREVER".
	
	                    VIKTOR
	          Speaking of which -- this is the
	          project I'd like you to do next.
	
	                    SIMONE / VIKTOR
	          Not, "Eternity Forever"?  The
	          legendary unproduced script that
	          was too good ever to get made?  I'd
	          kill for that part.
	
	                    VIKTOR
	          I was hoping you'd say that.
	
	Suddenly, Simone appears to talk on her own.
	
	                    SIMONE
	          I'll do anything to please you, Mr.
	          Taransky.
	
	                    VIKTOR
	              (pretending to be hard of
	               hearing)
	          I'm sorry, I didn't catch that. 
	          What did you say?
	
	                    SIMONE
	          I'll do anything to please you, Mr.
	          Taransky.
	
	On a side monitor, we discover a highlighted box marked "PRE
	RECORD" -- Viktor's finger on the "PLAY" button.  He is
	unable to resist speaking another line.
	
	                    SIMONE / VIKTOR
	          And I will never, ever leave you.
	
	Simone appears to indulge Viktor by blowing him a kiss --
	until we see that Viktor has now highlighted a box marked,
	"GESTURES OF AFFECTION -- WINK, SMILE, GIGGLE, SIGH, KISS,
	FLUTTER OF EYES, FLICK OF HAIR, PUFF OF CHEST".
	
	Viktor comes close to the monitor.  He notices something
	about Simone's face.
	
	                    VIKTOR
	          You're so beautiful.  Too
	          beautiful.
	
	Viktor accesses a program labeled, "DISTINGUISHING FEATURES".
	He adds a "FRECKLE" and a "MOLE".
	
	From a distance we watch him, alone with Simone in the vast,
	empty soundstage.
	
	EXT.  STUDIO LOT - DAY
	
	VIKTOR's face against the SKY.  As he walks, we reveal that
	the sky is no more than a huge, painted backdrop on the
	studio lot -- behind a parking lot.  Viktor hands his valet
	ticket to a fawning VALET MANAGER.
	
	                    VALET MANAGER
	          -- Just be a minute, Mr. Taransky. 
	          We gave you a complimentary car
	          wash -- they're washing the engine
	          now.
	
	Viktor joins other industry MOVERS and SHAKERS waiting for
	their cars under an umbrella.  A young TALENT AGENT
	approaches.
	
	                    TALENT AGENT
	          Viktor!  Look, I'm sorry I didn't
	          call you back last year.  I was,
	          er... out of the country.
	              (strained moment)
	          But we should get together.  My
	          schedule's wide open.
	
	                    VIKTOR
	          Sure, I'll... "call you".
	
	The agent's face falls.  He gets in his car, disconsolate.
	
	Suddenly, HAL SINCLAIR, rushes over and hugs Viktor.
	
	                    HAL
	          Viktor, I'm so happy for us!
	
	                    VIKTOR
	          Hello, Hal.
	
	                    HAL
	          The film.  The chemistry.  No
	          reflections on Nicola but Simone
	          and I -- we were just so right
	          together.
	
	                    VIKTOR
	          You never were together, Hal.
	
	                    HAL
	          And still the connection was
	          undeniable.
	              (aside)
	          I haven't read "Eternity Forever"
	          but I know it's brilliant.  And I
	          know I would be perfect for Clive.
	
	                    VIKTOR
	              (correcting him)
	          Clyde.
	
	                    HAL
	          Yes, perfect.
	              (lowering his voice)
	          As a matter of fact, I ran into
	          Simone on the lot the other day.
	
	                    VIKTOR
	              (genuinely startled)
	          Really?  She didn't mention it.
	
	                    HAL
	              (quickly covering)
	          I'm sure she's meeting with a lot
	          of people right now.
	              (under his breath)
	          She is just as you described her,
	          Viktor... indescribable.  I
	          strongly sensed she thought I was
	          right for it.
	
	Behind his back, Viktor surreptitiously presses a button on
	his cell phone.  The phone rings.  Viktor feigns surprise and
	answers.
	
	                    VIKTOR
	              (answering the phone he
	               has just dialed, louder
	               than necessary)
	          Hello?... SIMONE!  How are you,
	          sweetheart?
	
	A hush descends over the executives.  Hal is suddenly very
	uncomfortable.  Even the VALETS strain to eavesdrop on the
	conversation.
	
	                    VIKTOR
	              (winking to Hal)
	          You'll never guess who I'm with...
	          you ran into him on the lot.
	
	                    HAL
	          It was more in passing.
	
	                    VIKTOR
	          You're so far off!
	              (finally chuckles)
	          Hal... Hal Sinclair... your co-
	          star.  Remember now?... No, I don't
	          think he's put on weight.
	              (a shrug of apology to the
	               appalled Hal)
	          Anyway, you think he's right for
	          "Eternity Forever"?... not the
	          right type?... a different
	          direction...
	              (covering phone, to Hal)
	          I'll try to talk her into it.
	
	The other INDUSTRY PEOPLE make a note of the remark.  A
	mortified Hal excuses himself with a pathetic wave, climbing
	into his car.
	
	                    VIKTOR
	              (into phone)
	          ... Listen this is a bad place to
	          talk... what?... sweetheart, I know
	          you have charity work you want to
	          do, I know you want to give back --
	          but remember, your greatest gift is
	          your talent... we'll talk about it
	          at the beach house this weekend...
	          I'm looking forward to it too.
	
	Viktor hangs up.  His car pulls up.  He tips extravagantly
	and drives away.  The INDUSTRY PEOPLE get on their cell
	phones.
	
	EXT.  STUDIO LOT - FACADE - DAY
	
	Parked behind the sky facade is a curious CAR with shaded
	windows.
	
	INT.  CAR - DAY
	
	Inside the car, MAX SAYER and assistant MILTON, scanner in
	hand, are replaying Viktor's intercepted phone call on a
	computer.
	
	                    VIKTOR'S VOICE
	              (from the machine)
	          -- "... You think he's right for
	          "Eternity Forever"?... not the
	          right type?... a different
	          direction..."
	
	                    MILTON
	              (to Max, a shake of the
	               head)
	          I'm getting nothing from her side
	          of the conversation.
	
	                    MAX
	          Is it a jamming device?
	
	                    MILTON
	              (shrugs)
	          Maybe he's talking to himself.
	
	                    MAX
	              (dismissing the idea)
	          Taransky isn't that good an actor. 
	          No, they're taking special
	          precautions.  Some kind of new
	          encryption.
	
	                    MILTON
	          Why?
	
	                    MAX
	              (musing)
	          Whatever it is, it's dark.
	
	                    MILTON
	          Dark?
	
	                    MAX
	          Yes, very.
	
	They continue listening to the recording.
	
	                    VIKTOR'S VOICE
	          "... We'll talk about it at the
	          beach house this weekend..."
	
	MAX's eyes light up.  He gazes to a photo of SIMONE pasted to
	the inside of the car.
	
	INT.  VIKTOR'S MALIBU HOME - MORNING
	
	VIKTOR and LAINEY make breakfast.  Lainey is in her pajamas,
	occasionally glancing to a laptop computer as her father
	prepares French toast.
	
	                    VIKTOR
	              (glancing to the computer)
	          Can't you stop that?
	
	                    LAINEY
	          Why?
	
	                    VIKTOR
	          Those things can be dangerous. 
	          Staring at a screen all day -- you
	          miss what's going on outside in the
	          real world.  You can lose yourself. 
	          You should get out more.  How are
	          you going to meet boys?
	
	                    LAINEY
	              (shrugs coyly, getting up)
	          I know plenty of boys.
	
	                    VIKTOR
	          Really?  Who?  Where do you meet
	          them?  In a chat room?  How do you
	          know he's not some middle-aged
	          freak?
	
	                    LAINEY
	          Dad, I can spot a middle-aged freak
	          a mile away.
	
	                    VIKTOR
	          Okay.  But you have to find a way
	          to escape that thing.
	
	                    LAINEY
	          I do.
	
	                    VIKTOR
	          How?
	
	                    LAINEY
	          I read.
	
	                    VIKTOR
	          You do?  Still?  I can't tell you
	          how happy I am to hear that.
	
	                    LAINEY
	          You were the one who insisted on
	          it.  Reading me Dostoyevsky and
	          Joyce when I was four.
	
	                    VIKTOR
	          You understood them.  That's what
	          was amazing.
	              (looking out the window)
	          It's a nice day.  Let's eat
	          outside.
	
	Lainey grabs the plates and opens the deck door.  We hear a
	chorus of CLICKS.
	
	                    LAINEY
	          Actually, it may be nicer inside.
	
	Viktor joins her at the doorway.
	
	                    VIKTOR
	          Stay here, I'll deal with this.
	
	Unfazed, Lainey retreats into the house.
	
	EXT.  VIKTOR'S MALIBU HOUSE - MORNING
	
	Boats are moored just off the beach packed dangerously full
	of telephoto lens-toting PHOTOGRAPHERS.  The next door houses
	have LENSES protruding through the drapes of the windows.
	
	VIKTOR strides onto the lawn of his property that backs onto
	the beach, soaking up the attention -- unable to resist
	waving extravagantly.
	
	Suddenly, a PHOTOGRAPHER, losing his balance, drops from a
	nearby rooftop.  The photographer limps towards the fence. 
	Viktor calmly follows, retrieving the photographer's camera
	and ripping out the film with a flourish -- he is clearly
	relishing the attention.
	
	The photographer clambers over the fence where he joins
	several dozen other SHUTTER-BUGS and VIDEORAZZI.
	
	                    PHOTOGRAPHER 1
	          That wasn't her, Taransky.
	
	                    ECHO PHOTOGRAPHER
	          Where is she?  You can't hide her
	          forever.
	
	                    VIKTOR
	              (hurling the camera into
	               the mob)
	          You'll never find her.  Simone only
	          appears when I want her to appear.
	
	MAX SAYER from "The NATIONAL ECHO" is at the head of the mob,
	accompanied by assistant MILTON.
	
	                    MAX
	          She sounds like a prisoner,
	          Taransky.  Are you holding her
	          hostage?  Are you some kind of
	          Svengali?
	
	                    VIKTOR
	              (recognizing the reporter)
	          Who's the hostage, Sayer, her or
	          you?  You look kind of "captive"
	          yourself.  While you're spending
	          every waking hour obsessing over
	          Simone, guess what, I guarantee she
	          doesn't even know you exist.  Get
	          off my property or I'll call the
	          cops.
	
	                    MAX
	          The cops?  The cops read my column
	          to know who to bust.  We're the
	          only watchdog the public has.
	              (looking around at the
	               photographers)
	          None of this is going away.  We'll
	          be here tomorrow and the day after
	          that.  Until you slip up.  And you
	          will.  You are looking at your
	          shadow.
	              (getting in his face)
	          Because all these elaborate
	          precautions with Simone -- every
	          instinct in my body tells me, it's
	          not natural.
	
	                    VIKTOR
	          I'm just trying to help you, Sayer. 
	          I don't want you to be
	          disappointed.  It gets cold out
	          here at night.
	
	                    MAX
	          Nice try.  If we can't get to her
	          through you, maybe your family will
	          be more co-operative.  I can
	          guarantee you, Taransky, one way or
	          another, Miss Simone and I are
	          going to get acquainted.
	
	                    VIKTOR
	              (turning away)
	          I'd like to see that, Sayer. 
	          Invite me.
	
	INT.  VIKTOR'S CAR - DAY
	
	VIKTOR drives along a twisty mountain road, LAINEY in the
	passenger seat.  They have become so blase about the
	paparazzi, they no longer acknowledge the posse of motorcycle
	PHOTOGRAPHERS risking their necks to stay up with the car.
	
	                    REPORTER (ON RADIO)
	          -- The rumor is, Simone is holed up
	          in Taransky's Malibu home -- so far
	          we haven't seen so much as a
	          glimpse --
	
	                    VIKTOR
	              (switching off the radio)
	          Honey, I'm really sorry about all
	          this.  I don't know if it's safe
	          for you to stay the weekends...
	          just until things settle down.
	
	                    LAINEY
	              (shrugs)
	          Okay, Dad.
	
	                    VIKTOR
	          If anyone asks about Simone --
	
	                    LAINEY
	          -- I know, I don't know anything.
	
	                    VIKTOR
	          Exactly.
	              (slightly irritated by her
	               lack of interest)
	          Don't you wonder where I'm really
	          hiding Simone?
	
	                    LAINEY
	              (looking to him)
	          I'm sure you'd tell me if you
	          thought it was important.
	
	Lainey gives her father a smile.  Through the car window
	behind her, a MOTORCYCLIST appears to lose control and drops
	down a bank.
	
	EXT.  ELAINE'S MANSION - DAY
	
	VIKTOR'S car pulls up to Elaine's imposing mansion.  LAINEY
	gives her father a kiss and departs.  ELAINE, in the garden,
	overseeing a GARDENER pruning roses, approaches.
	
	                    VIKTOR
	              (from the car)
	          Sorry I didn't get her back in
	          time.
	
	                    ELAINE
	          No problem.
	              (she smiles)
	          Do you want to come in?
	
	                    VIKTOR
	              (surprised -- pleasantly)
	          Why not?
	
	INT.  ELAINE'S MANSION - DAY
	
	VIKTOR walks down a hall, passing the dining room, where KENT
	is working on a computer.  Kent smiles blandly.
	
	                    KENT
	          Hey, Vik.
	
	                    VIKTOR
	              (disappointed to see him)
	          Hello -- Kent.
	
	INT.  ELAINE'S MANSION - DAY
	
	VIKTOR waits in an opulent drawing room.  Despite the eighty
	degree temperature outside, a fire burns in the hearth. 
	ELAINE enters, waving a thick studio file.  Viktor's face
	falls, expecting a less business-related conversation.
	
	                    ELAINE
	          Viktor, we simply have to talk
	          about "Eternity..."
	
	                    VIKTOR
	          "Forever".
	
	                    ELAINE
	          Whatever.  I still haven't received
	          Simone's script notes.
	
	                    VIKTOR
	          There aren't any.  If the
	          filmmakers are happy, Simone's
	          happy.  She considers herself an...
	          "instrument".
	
	                    ELAINE
	          Really?  Oh, so she's really going
	          to do all this nudity?
	
	                    VIKTOR
	              (shrugs)
	          If it's on the page...
	
	Elaine refers to her documents, bewildered.
	
	                    ELAINE
	          Well, something has to be done
	          about this budget.  It's completely
	          unrealistic.
	              (referring to a column in
	               the budget)
	          You allowed nothing for limousine
	          service.
	
	                    VIKTOR
	          She'll drive herself.
	
	                    ELAINE
	          Hair and make-up?
	
	                    VIKTOR
	          She'll do her own.  Theater
	          training.
	
	                    ELAINE
	          She was in the theater?  When? 
	          Where?
	
	                    VIKTOR
	          I'll send you her resume.
	
	                    ELAINE
	          Al least a contingency for
	          wardrobe.  Any woman can go up a
	          dress size.
	
	                    VIKTOR
	          -- I guarantee she won't gain an
	          once.  She's very disciplined.
	
	                    ELAINE
	              (concerned by an entry in
	               the budget)
	          Well, we have to do something about
	          this -- "stuntwoman".
	
	                    VIKTOR
	          What about it?
	
	                    ELAINE
	          There isn't one.
	
	                    VIKTOR
	          No need.  She does all her own
	          stunts.
	
	                    ELAINE
	              (skeptical)
	          Even the fall from the plane?
	
	                    VIKTOR
	              (nonchalant)
	          Even the fall from the plane.
	
	                    ELAINE
	          Well, shoot it on the last day.
	
	Viktor regards Elaine with a condescending look.
	
	                    VIKTOR
	          As I've tried to explain to you,
	          Elaine.  Simone isn't like any
	          other actress you've ever known. 
	          She's about the work and only the
	          work -- lives for the work.  She
	          wants all the money up there...
	              (gazing into space)
	          ... on the screen where it belongs. 
	          She'd work for scale except I know
	          you only respect people you pay a
	          fortune.
	
	                    ELAINE
	          Which accounts for your percentage.
	              (tossing the budget on the
	               coffee table)
	          When do I get to meet this dream?
	
	                    VIKTOR
	          Not today.  She's learning her
	          lines.
	              (glancing to Elaine's
	               budget)
	          You can also take cue cards and
	          teleprompter out of the budget.
	
	                    ELAINE
	              (smiles)
	          I'll walk you out.
	
	Elaine escorts Viktor out to the lavish garden.
	
	EXT.  ELAINE'S MANSION - GARDEN - DAY
	
	ELAINE's demeanor softens.  She speaks to VIKTOR quietly,
	sympathetically.
	
	                    ELAINE
	          Listen, Viktor... I want to talk to
	          you now, not as Elaine, studio
	          head, but Elaine, ex-wife.
	              (correcting herself)
	          Second ex-wife.  You got lucky this
	          last time but you need to be
	          careful.  We both know you wouldn't
	          be making this overblown art film
	          of you hadn't convinced Simone to
	          be in it.
	
	                    VIKTOR
	          Elaine, talking to you now, not as
	          Viktor, director, but Viktor, ex
	          husband... what the hell happened
	          to you?
	
	                    ELAINE
	              (exasperated)
	          Experience, Viktor.  I've seen this
	          a hundred times -- young stars
	          destroying the very people who
	          discovered them.  I'm worried about
	          you, that's all.  This woman -- she
	          controls your destiny.
	
	                    VIKTOR
	          Simone does not control my destiny.
	
	                    ELAINE
	          Viktor, I have a feeling.  One of
	          my feelings.  There's something
	          about her I don't trust.
	
	From her bedroom window on the mansion's second floor, LAINEY
	smiles at the sight of her mother and father together.

	              (sheepish)
	          Thanks for taking me back, Mr.
	          Taransky.  I know it looked like I
	          sided with the studio, but I always
	          believed in you, honestly.
	
	                    VIKTOR
	          Don't worry.  I understand.

	poster behind him -- "COMING THIS SUMMER - SIMONE in ETERNITY
	FOREVER" -- bears a huge photograph of Simone's face.
	
	                    VIKTOR
	          I can't tell you how delighted I am
	          to have this wonderful cast
	          assembled for "Eternity Forever". 
	          Thank you all.  Now, a reminder --
	          as a condition for working on this
	          film, you will not be rehearsing
	          with Simone, shooting with Simone
	          and you are forbidden from
	          contacting Simone in any way at any
	          time, whatsoever.

	          For her?
	
	                    VIKTOR
	          For you.
	              (addressing the entire
	               cast)
	          I want you to know, Simone
	          appreciates you all working for
	          scale.  But why am I thanking you? 
	          Simone can thank you herself.  She
	          insisted on speaking with you
	          before filming begins.  She's on
	          the line now.
	
	Viktor nods to a speaker phone in the center of the table, a
	red blinking light on the phone.  The cast reacts excitedly.

	          Why don't you leave me alone with
	          my co-stars, Mr. Taransky, so we
	          can get to know each other better?

	speaking through the synthesizer.  As usual, Viktor's voice
	is automatically synthesized into the voice of Simone.

	          -- No.  No.  I'm completely
	          simpatico.  On my last film I was
	          playing a schizophrenic so I made
	          them give me two dressing rooms.

	          Well thank you for your
	          understanding.  I know it's an
	          unusual way to work but I just find
	          I relate better to people when
	          they're not actually there.

	          Of course, of course.

	          I don't have much to say except
	          that I know it's going to be a
	          great project, if we all just trust
	          Mr. Taransky's vision.  Always do
	          what Mr. Taransky says.  If in
	          doubt, do it the Taransky way.
	
	They all nod vigorously in agreement.
	
	                    SIMONE (O.S.)
	          I know we're going to make a
	          wonderful movie together.

	          Oh, I know.
	
	Vivian hesitantly hands Viktor a publicity photo of SIMONE.
	
	                    VIVIAN
	          If it's not too much trouble. 
	          Could you...?
	
	                    VIKTOR
	          Of course...
	
	                    VIVIAN
	              (hesitant about broaching
	               the subject)
	          This last year I was... going
	          through some things.
	              (shaking her head at the
	               memory)
	          Awful, awful... things.  But when I
	          saw Simone in "Sunrise"... what she
	          did... in the scene in the
	          fireworks factory...
	              (face lighting up)
	          ... suddenly everything made sense. 
	          My friends, family, doctors --
	          nobody could reach me -- but
	          Simone, she really... spoke to me.
	
	Viktor is touched by the heartfelt testimony.
	
	                    VIKTOR
	          She'll be happy to sign it.
	
	INT.  PRODUCTION SOUNDSTAGE - DAY
	
	A green set.  Walls, floor, ceiling -- all green.  A FULL
	CAST shoots HAL, dressed in a futuristic suit, tentatively
	crossing the green expanse.
	
	Hal pauses, looks longingly, then impulsively dashes forward. 
	Hal passionately embraces thin air and wrestles it to the
	ground.
	
	                    VIKTOR (O.S.)
	          Cut!  Cut!... Cut!
	
	Hal freezes.  VIKTOR runs from behind the camera and
	confronts Hal on the green floor.
	
	                    VIKTOR
	          Hal, what are you doing?
	
	                    HAL
	          Viktor, Clyde simply has to get
	          close to Simone in this scene!  He
	          has to touch her.  He has to!
	
	                    VIKTOR
	          Absolutely not!
	
	                    HAL
	          But she's right there!  I must feel
	          her!
	
	                    VIKTOR
	          You can't.
	
	                    HAL
	          Why not?
	
	                    VIKTOR
	              (struggling to find an
	               excuse)
	          There's... a wall between you --
	
	                    HAL
	          -- an emotional wall, I know. 
	          That's why --
	
	                    VIKTOR
	          -- No.  No.  A real wall.
	              (describing a wall with
	               his hands within the
	               green space)
	          You ran right through it.
	
	                    HAL
	              (confused)
	          How did the wall get there?
	
	                    VIKTOR
	          I can't explain it to you now --
	          you'll see when it's all put
	          together.
	              (walking away)
	          Anyway, we got it a couple of takes
	          ago.  Let's move on.
	
	Hal, dumbfounded, tentatively touches the non-existent wall.
	
	INT.  VIKTOR'S SOUNDSTAGE - NIGHT
	
	Viktor digitally adds SIMONE standing beside a sportscar with
	HAL in a scene from "Eternity Forever".  He works on her
	close up.
	
	                    SIMONE
	              (eyes welling with tears)
	          -- What you don't understand,
	          Clyde, is that love is like a wild
	          flower, but that flower only
	          grows --
	
	Viktor hits STOP and Simone freezes.  Viktor brings up a menu
	and chooses from a range of "EMOTIONAL OPTIONS".
	
	   JOY                  SADNESS              FEAR
	   elated               melancholy           anxious
	   jubilant             tearful              frightened
	   giddy                weeping              petrified
	   ecstatic             blubbering           loss of bladder
	   inebriated           Kevorkian              control
	
	   CONTEMPLATION        INNOCENCE            SENSUALITY
	   reflective           chaste               seductive

	     skull
	
	He fine-tunes SIMONE's performance -- sliding a cursor on a
	performance axis from "BROAD" to "SUBTLE".
	
	                    VIKTOR
	          Let's take it down a notch.
	
	                    SIMONE
	          -- What you don't understand --
	
	Simone freezes again.  Viktor make another adjustment.
	
	                    VIKTOR
	          I like it.  But still too big.
	              (making a correction)
	          Smaller teardrops next time.
	
	Simone's tears retreat into her eyes.
	
	                    VIKTOR
	          It's not working.  It's not alive. 
	          Let's try it again.
	
	She repeats the line.  Viktor mimes the performance.
	
	                    SIMONE
	              (teardrops arriving on
	               cue)
	          -- What you don't understand,
	          Clyde, is that love is like a wild
	          flower, but that flower only grows
	          on the edge...
	              (dramatic pause)
	          ... of a very high cliff.
	
	Simone FREEZES.
	
	                    VIKTOR
	          Perfect, Simone.
	
	Viktor returns SIMONE to her neutral background.
	
	                    VIKTOR
	          I'm only sorry you still have to
	          work with flesh and blood for the
	          time being -- as user friendly as
	          you are, even I can't manufacture
	          an entire cast.
	
	"To Vivian.  Love, Simone" -- VIKTOR writes on the publicity
	shot.  He applies lipstick and adds a kiss to the photo.
	
	Viktor wipes his mouth and looks to SIMONE on his screen --
	she is waiting patiently, as usual.
	
	                    VIKTOR
	          We are going to have to change our
	          plans, Simone -- you have no idea
	          what an affect your performance is
	          having on people.  We can't stop
	          now.  There's too much to say --
	          these films they speak, they speak
	          to the human condition.  We're
	          changing lives.  No, revealing the
	          truth now would be too cruel.
	              (searching for more
	               justification)
	          Anyway, when you're seeking a
	          greater truth -- in the work -- you
	          are not so concerned with the
	          lesser truths along the way.
	
	Simone doesn't appear convinced.
	
	                    SIMONE / VIKTOR
	          You're going to get in a lot of
	          trouble, Mr. Taransky.
	
	                    VIKTOR
	              (irritated at her pricking
	               his conscience)
	          Why do you have to bring that up? 
	          There's always risk -- life's a
	          risk.  It's worth it.  Besides, how
	          could something so lovely be a
	          crime?
	              (regarding her tenderly)
	          Well, I think we've done enough for
	          today.  You've been cooped up in
	          there too long.  How about you and
	          me go out on the town?  They're
	          expecting us.
	
	He turns to a copy of "The Echo".  A photo of Viktor at the
	gate of his Malibu home.  "SIMONE HELD CAPTIVE - Self
	proclaimed Svengali Keeps Star Out Of Limelight".  Viktor
	puts Simone to sleep and picks up a briefcase.
	
	INT.  HOTEL LOBBY - NIGHT
	
	VIKTOR, briefcase in hand, strides through the lobby of an
	opulent hotel.  He approached the CONCIERGE.
	
	                    VIKTOR
	          I'm checking in a special guest...
	              (obviously conspiratorial)
	          ... Miss Enomis.
	
	The Concierge straightens as he recognizes Viktor from a copy
	of "Variety".  Headline: "Taransky Rides Ingenue's Coat-Tails
	To Three Picture Deal".
	
	                    CONCIERGE
	          Miss Enomis, yes.
	
	                    VIKTOR
	          Miss Enomis demands her privacy. 
	          You will switch off all
	          surveillance cameras.  I will
	          escort Miss Enomis to her room
	          alone via the rear exit.  She will
	          require no help with her luggage. 
	          She does not wish to be disturbed
	          at any time for any reason.  She
	          will be departing for a function
	          tonight at eight sharp.
	              (tipping him with a
	               hundred dollar bill)
	          I'm sure I can rely on your
	          discretion.  Do you understand?
	
	                    CONCIERGE
	              (passing the key to
	               Viktor)
	          Oh, I understand.
	
	As Viktor departs, the Concierge holds the registration card
	to the mirror.
	
	ENOMIS becomes SIMONE.
	
	The Concierge picks up his phone.
	
	INT.  HOTEL ROOM - NIGHT
	
	VIKTOR enters the hotel suite.  We see a montage of scenes --
	Viktor revelling in his masquerade.
	
	A)  VIKTOR pulls down the covers of a bed and rolls around in
	    the sheets to give it a slept-in look.
	
	B)  VIKTOR sprays cologne in the bed.
	
	C)  VIKTOR tosses skimpy lingerie on the floor of the closet.
	
	D)  VIKTOR eats several candy bars from the mini-bar.
	
	E)  VIKTOR puts one of his own movies in the DVD player.
	
	F)  VIKTOR writes a note on the bedside pad.
	
	G)  In the bathroom, shower running, VIKTOR attempts to open
	    a tampon -- it shoots out of the applicator like a penny
	    rocket.
	
	H)  VIKTOR cuts a lock of "faux" hair from a Simone wig and
	    scatters it on the counter.
	
	I)  VIKTOR shakes open a bag of toiletries, the toothbrush
	    bouncing into the toilet bowl.  He retrieves it.
	
	J)  VIKTOR looks through the drapes of the hotel window -- a
	    jam of PRESS PHOTOGRAPHERS has congregated outside the
	    rear entrance.
	
	K)  VIKTOR shines a lamp against a doll casting a life-size
	    shadow on the drapes.  A "walking" silhouette is visible
	    to the media on the street.
	
	L)  VIKTOR writes a message in lipstick on the mirror -- "I
	    LOVE YOU V--".
	
	VIKTOR is interrupted by a knock on the door.  He looks at
	his watch.
	
	                    VIKTOR
	              (peering through the
	               peephole)
	          Who is it?
	
	                    WOMAN'S VOICE
	              (from other side of door)
	          It's... Simone.
	
	Viktor smiles.
	
	EXT.  HOTEL - REAR ENTRANCE - NIGHT
	
	VIKTOR stands at the rear entrance of the hotel with a leggy
	YOUNG WOMAN wearing a coat over her head.  A HOTEL DOORMAN
	keeps back the growing horde of REPORTERS.
	
	Viktor's limousine waits at the curb.  The coated woman
	starts towards the car but Viktor holds her back.
	
	                    VIKTOR
	          Not yet.
	              (scrutinizing the crowd)
	          Where's "Matinee"?  There they are. 
	          Okay, I think everyone's here. 
	          Now!
	
	Viktor and the young woman run the gauntlet to the car,
	providing a perfect albeit restricted photo-op for the
	paparazzi.
	
	                    PHOTOGRAPHER 1
	          Simone!
	
	                    ECHO PHOTOGRAPHER
	          Over here, sweetheart!
	
	                    PHOTOGRAPHER 3
	          Come one Simone, take it off, baby!
	
	                    PHOTOGRAPHER 4
	          We got a job to do!
	
	The car door slams shut as the pack descends.  MAX SAYER and
	MILTON are amongst the frustrated reporters.  The limo
	screeches away.  A POLICE MOTORCYCLIST prevents anyone
	following.
	
	The frustrated REPORTERS assess their efforts.
	
	                    PHOTOGRAPHER 1
	          I think I got a piece of her ear.
	
	                    ECHO PHOTOGRAPHER
	          I didn't get shit.
	
	                    MILTON
	              (emerging from the pack,
	               to Max)
	          Ten feet from a living Goddess...
	
	INT.  MISS ENOMIS'S HOTEL SUITE - NIGHT
	
	MAX SAYER pays off the CONCIERGE.  His assistant, MILTON,
	begins to collect "evidence" of the celebrity -- dusting for
	fingerprints, etc.  Max rubs pencil into the impression on
	the bedside notepad revealing the message -- "The meaning of
	life is that it ends".
	
	                    MAX
	              (interrupting Milton's
	               work)
	          Leave me for a moment.
	
	Milton and the Concierge depart.
	
	Max is alone.  He looks around the room.
	
	A)  MAX enters the bathroom.  He picks up a drinking glass
	    and inspects it closely before placing it in a sealed
	    plastic bag.
	
	B)  MAX examines the wet soap from the shower and also places
	    it in a plastic bag.
	
	C)  MAX picks up the used toothbrush, puts it to his lips
	    before placing it in a plastic bag.
	
	D)  MAX gently places his hands on the toilet seat.
	
	E)  MAX enters the bedroom.  He carefully removes a slip from
	    a pillow.  He folds it meticulously, appearing to breathe
	    in its scent as he places it in a plastic bag.
	
	F)  Finally, MAX kneels and gazes at "Simone's" unmade bed. 
	    He slowly slides into the bed and slips beneath the same
	    sheets recently vacated by Viktor.
	
	INT.  HALLWAY - OUTSIDE HOTEL SUITE - NIGHT
	
	MILTON, ear pressed against the door, tries to listen inside.
	
	INT.  VIKTOR TARANSKY'S LIMOUSINE - NIGHT
	
	VIKTOR and the COATED WOMAN have finally left the PAPARAZZI
	in their wake.  Viktor gently removes the coat from over her
	head.
	
	Although the woman is impossible beautiful, she is not
	Simone.  FAITH is Simone's latest stand-in and decoy.  Viktor
	and Faith are still pressed together against one side of the
	limousine.
	
	                    VIKTOR
	              (not quite able to avert
	               his eyes from her
	               telescopic legs)
	          Thank God for you, Faith.  I know
	          this is above and beyond the call
	          of duty for a stand-in.  You don't
	          know what a service you're
	          performing for Simone -- shielding
	          her from those animals.
	
	                    FAITH
	          No, thank God for you, Mr.
	          Taransky.  How many men would go
	          to so much trouble to protect a
	          woman?
	
	Neither Viktor nor Faith seem inclined to move from their
	intimate position.
	
	                    VIKTOR
	          You understand you'll have to come
	          back to my place to keep them off
	          the, er...
	              (his nose close to Faith's
	               neck)
	          ... scent.
	
	                    FAITH
	          Of course.
	
	                    VIKTOR
	              (meeting her gaze)
	          You look so, so...
	
	                    FAITH
	          ... so much like her?
	
	                    VIKTOR
	          Yes, of course, but very beautiful
	          in your own right.
	
	                    FAITH
	          I do find myself physically
	          attracted to you, Mr. Taransky.
	
	Their lips are now tantalizingly close.
	
	                    VIKTOR
	          Viktor.
	
	INT.  VIKTOR'S MALIBU HOUSE - NIGHT
	
	VIKTOR'S HEAD hits the sofa in his living room, closely
	followed by FAITH on top of him.
	
	Faith tears at his clothes and her own, ravenous.  Viktor
	hardly resists.  In the midst of the wild caresses, Faith
	murmurs in his ear.
	
	                    FAITH
	          Do whatever you do to Simone.
	
	Viktor freezes.
	
	                    VIKTOR
	          What?... What did you say?
	
	                    FAITH
	          Do what you do to Simone.
	
	                    VIKTOR
	          What I do to Simone?
	
	                    FAITH
	          Yes, call me Simone.
	
	                    VIKTOR
	          Simone?
	
	                    FAITH
	              (still tearing at his
	               clothes)
	          Yes, yes, again, again.  Do what
	          you do to Simone.  I want to know
	          what it's like to be her just for
	          one night.
	
	                    VIKTOR
	              (confused)
	          You're with me to be close to her?
	
	                    FAITH
	              (panting)
	          Is that a problem?
	
	As Viktor ponders the question, Faith begins to do Simone's
	deathbed speech from "Sunrise, Sunset".
	
	                    FAITH
	          "Why are we here?  Is that what
	          you're asking, Jack?... Why are we
	          here?  No why.  Just here".
	
	                    VIKTOR
	              (this is too much for
	               Viktor)
	          Please put your clothes on
	
	Viktor gets up from the sofa, leaving the frustrated Faith to
	straighten her clothes.
	
	EXT.  FUTURISTIC LANDSCAPE - "ETERNITY FOREVER" - DAY
	
	The finished scene with SIMONE and HAL plays ON A SCREEN.
	
	INT.  SCREENING ROOM - STUDIO - DAY
	
	VIKTOR watches the rough cut of "ETERNITY FOREVER" with
	ELAINE and daughter, LAINEY.  As usual, they are mesmerized
	by the breath-taking beautiful SIMONE.  The scene ends.  The
	light go up.
	
	                    ELAINE
	          Stunning, Viktor.  The Hollywood
	          Foreign Press is going to eat this
	          up.
	
	                    VIKTOR
	          Thank you.
	              (turning to his daughter)
	          What did you think, Lainey?
	
	                    LAINEY
	          One thing bothered me.
	
	                    VIKTOR
	          I know, Hal is as stiff as always.
	
	                    LAINEY
	          No, not that.  I was just wondering
	          -- in the bedroom scene in reel two
	          why did Simone have no reflection
	          when she walked in front of that
	          mirror?
	
	Viktor is shocked, busted.  He covers it with a laugh.
	
	                    VIKTOR
	              (ashen-faced)
	          I wondered if you'd spot that. 
	          You've got a good eye, Lainey.  I'm
	          proud of you.
	
	Elaine looks at Viktor for an explanation.
	
	                    VIKTOR
	          I got them to remove the
	          reflection.  The mirror's metaphor 
	          -- to show how her character's
	          inwardly dead.
	
	                    ELAINE
	          That's genius, Viktor.  Was that
	          Simone's idea?
	
	                    VIKTOR
	              (sarcastic, annoyed at the
	               suggestion)
	          Who else?  It's always Simone's
	          idea.
	
	                    LAINEY
	              (not quite convinced)
	          So that accounts for the lack of a
	          shadow in reel six?
	
	                    VIKTOR
	          Precisely.
	
	EXT.  STUDIO LOT - NIGHT
	
	VIKTOR escorts ELAINE and LAINEY to Elaine's car parked
	outside the theater.
	
	                    LAINEY
	              (as she gets into the car)
	          Good-night, Daddy.
	
	                    VIKTOR
	              (kissing Lainey good-bye)
	          Night, Lainey.
	
	Elaine and Viktor linger a moment outside the car.
	
	                    VIKTOR
	              (drawing Elaine aside)
	          Elaine, I don't know if it's a good
	          idea for Lainey to come to the
	          screenings -- mature content and
	          all that.
	
	Both look to Lainey.  From inside the car Lainey watches her
	parents.
	
	                    ELAINE
	              (impressed by his
	               responsible attitude)
	          Maybe you're right.
	              (gently teasing)
	          Twelve years after your daughter's
	          born you decide to become a father.
	
	                    VIKTOR
	          Better late than never.
	
	                    ELAINE
	              (softening)
	          I should fire you more often.  The
	          film's looking wonderful.
	
	                    VIKTOR
	          You really think so?
	
	                    ELAINE
	          Yes.  To be honest I never quite
	          saw this film before -- maybe it's
	          the way Simone is playing it -- but
	          what it's saying about the illusion
	          of permanence in everyday life, how
	          that's the only way we can love --
	          I think it's really going to mean
	          something.
	
	                    VIKTOR
	          Thank you.  I'll tell Simone you
	          liked it.
	
	                    ELAINE
	          I'd love to tell her myself.
	              (cajoling)
	          When are you going to let me meet
	          her?
	
	                    VIKTOR
	          Soon.  Soon.
	
	                    ELAINE
	          Everyone I know has met her,
	          Viktor.
	
	                    VIKTOR
	          Everyone you know is lying.
	
	                    ELAINE
	              (amused)
	          That's true.
	
	They instinctively kiss, more affectionate than before. 
	However, their embrace is interrupted by a click of a camera
	shutter from a nearby bush.
	
	                    VIKTOR
	          Damnit!
	
	The PHOTOGRAPHER has gone but so has the mood.
	
	                    ELAINE
	          You know how you can stop that. 
	          She has to get out more.
	              (climbing into the car)
	          See you at the premiere.
	
	Elaine climbs into her car and drives away.
	
	EXT.  PREMIERE - DUSK
	
	The premiere for "ETERNITY FOREVER" is everything VIKTOR had
	hoped for "SUNRISE, SUNSET".  Red carpet, klieg lights
	searching the sky, screaming FANS and PAPARAZZI.
	
	A limousine pulls up, door opens and VIKTOR steps out.  The
	crowd screams with excitement.
	
	Viktor waves.  Am expectancy in the crowd -- people crane
	their necks, waiting for someone else to step out of the open
	car door... but nothing.  The door shuts.  A disappointed
	murmer.  The limo drives off.
	
	VIKTOR walks down the carpet to little fanfare.
	
	                    PREMIERE REPORTER 1
	              (talking to camera)
	          -- What a night!  Anyone who's
	          anyone is here at the premiere of
	          "Eternity Forever," but waiting for
	          Simone to show may take even
	          longer.  We do have her director,
	          Viktor Taransky.
	              (ushering him over)
	          Viktor, Viktor, is Simone coming?
	
	                    VIKTOR
	              (slightly irritated by the
	               focus on the star)
	          You know Simone.
	
	Other reporters force their way into the interview.
	
	                    PREMIERE REPORTER 2
	          I hope she does show up.  Some of
	          her fans got here at dawn.  We
	          don't want to disappoint them.
	
	                    VIKTOR
	              (through a pained smile)
	          Well, I'm sure they're going to
	          love the movie.  I got the
	          inspiration --
	
	However, the reporter's attention has strayed.
	
	                    PREMIERE REPORTER 2
	          HARRY EPSON!
	
	The CAMERAS pivot away from Viktor.  Screen idol, HARRY
	EPSON, is walking up the carpet.
	
	                    PREMIERE REPORTER 2
	          Harry!  Harry!  Can we have a
	          minute?  What brings you here
	          tonight?
	
	                    HARRY
	              (waving to the fans)
	          I just came out to support my good
	          friend, Simone.
	
	                    PREMIERE REPORTER 2
	          There's a rumor that you're more
	          than just "good friends"?
	
	                    HARRY
	              (slightly irritated by the
	               invasion)
	          We've been seeing each other, sure,
	          but we'd rather keep our
	          relationship private.
	
	                    PREMIERE REPORTER 2
	              (believing she has a
	               scoop)
	          Do I hear the sound of... wedding
	          bells?
	
	                    HARRY
	              (suddenly losing it)
	          I can't believe you people!  No
	          wonder she never comes to these
	          things!
	
	Harry angrily pushes the camera away and strides up the
	carpet.
	
	VIKTOR watches him go, flabbergasted.
	
	EXT.  PREMIERE PARTY - NIGHT
	
	A packed, glitzy party.  VIKTOR enters without an escort. 
	Despite his recent rise to prominence he appears strangely
	alone.
	
	He observes ELAINE, champagne in hand, and the younger KENT,
	schmoozing with a group of industry MOVERS and SHAKERS.
	
	                    MOVER/SHAKER
	          Elaine!  The picture is a
	          revelation!
	
	                    ELAINE
	          Thank you.  I mean, it was a team
	          effort --
	
	Viktor cannot resist taking Elaine's photo with a small
	pocket camera.  Elaine is unaware of the shot.
	
	Viktor turns away -- just as Elaine turns to look at him.
	
	Viktor picks up a drink from the bar.  A DRUNK WOMAN, perched
	unsteadily on a nearby barstool, is knocking back Jack
	Daniels.  She accidentally brushes one of her discarded
	glasses off the bar.  Viktor catches it.
	
	A HAND taps Viktor on the shoulder.  HAL stands there
	accompanied by his "Eternity Forever" co-star, MAC.
	
	                    HAL
	          Is she here?
	
	                    VIKTOR
	          I'm fine, Hal.  How are you?
	
	                    HAL
	              (oblivious to his sarcasm)
	          Somebody said she was here.
	
	Mac spots the two glasses in Viktor's hands -- one glass
	lipstick-smeared.
	
	                    MAC
	          Oh my God, that's her glass!
	              (impulsively smelling
	               "Simone's" glass)
	          Jack Daniels, straight-up.  She is
	          my kind of woman.
	
	                    HAL
	              (looking anxiously around
	               the room)
	          Viktor, where is she?
	
	                    VIKTOR
	          She's around.
	
	                    MAC
	              (dawning on him, glancing
	               to the far side of the
	               packed room)
	          Jesus, Hal... she's in the Ladies
	          Room.
	
	                    HAL
	          You know I sometimes forget she has
	          bodily functions.
	
	                    VIKTOR
	              (unable to resist)
	          I know what you mean.
	
	                    HAL
	              (anxiously looking to the
	               restroom)
	          I have to talk to her about my
	          experimental film.  It's very...
	          experimental.
	
	                    MAC
	          Is that her? -- By the fountain.
	
	Far across the party, a WOMAN, with a Simone-type hairstyle,
	her back to us, is standing at the edge of a fountain.
	
	                    VIKTOR
	              (testy)
	          No.  In fact, between us, she
	          doesn't really exist.
	
	                    HAL
	              (ignoring him, calling out
	               to the woman)
	          Simone!
	
	                    MAC
	          SIMONE!
	
	Several nearby GUESTS, including ELAINE, overhear.  They talk
	over each other.
	
	                    GUEST 1
	          -- Simone's here!
	
	                    ELAINE
	              (slightly the worse for
	               drink)
	          -- When did she arrive?  Why didn't
	          someone tell me?
	
	                    GUEST 2
	          -- Where is she?
	
	                    MAC
	          -- She's by the fountain.
	
	                    GUEST 3
	          -- Simone, over here!
	
	                    GUEST 4
	          -- Simone!
	
	The rumor races through the party like wild-fire.  The GUESTS
	surge towards the fountain in a wave of mindless adoration.
	
	The Simone lookalike herself spins around.
	
	                    LOOKALIKE WOMAN
	          Simone!
	
	She gets knocked into the fountain.  Several other GUESTS
	also fall in the stampede.
	
	Back at the bar, the BARMAN, autograph book in hand, deserts
	his station.  Viktor is left alone with the drunk woman.
	
	LOCAL TV NEWS
	
	The limousines outside the hotel ballroom have been replaced
	with ambulances.  PARAMEDICS tend to GUESTS, bloodied and
	battered in the stampede caused by Simone's "appearance".
	
	                    ENTERTAINMENT REPORTER
	              (into microphone)
	          -- Forget "Eternity Forever", the
	          big news tonight was the surprise
	          appearance of Simone.  Even these
	          seen-it-all superstars are
	          apparently not immune to Simone
	          fever and the resulting stampede
	          forced organizers to bring the
	          event to an early end.  I spoke
	          with some of the departing guests
	          about their encounter with
	          Hollywood's most reluctant
	          superstar.
	
	CUTS of interviews with VARIOUS bruised GUESTS.
	
	                    EXECUTIVE 3
	          -- I would say, even more beautiful
	          in person, you have to see her to
	          believe her.
	
	                    MALE GUEST 1
	          -- I can't reveal what we spoke
	          about.  It was... personal.  Simone
	          and I go back a long way.
	
	                    FEMALE GUEST 1
	          -- When she talks to you, for that
	          moment, you are the only other
	          human being in the room.
	
	                    FEMALE GUEST 2
	              (dress torn)
	          -- I really don't know what the
	          fuss is about.  So over-rated. 
	          She's done one film.  Talk to me
	          when she's had the kind of career
	          I've had.
	
	                    MALE GUEST 2
	          -- I do expect her to be nominated,
	          yes.
	
	We return to the live shot of the ENTERTAINMENT REPORTER.

	          Fortunately, Simone was not amongst
	          the injured and was spirited away
	          as mysteriously as she arrived.

	INT.  ECHO OFFICES - DAY
	
	In the ECHO war room, MAX SAYER is agitated.  He paces back
	and forth, railing at a table of cowering STAFFERS.
	
	                    MAX
	          -- She goes to a major, Hollywood,
	          A-list party and we don't get an
	          interview, a comment, we don't even
	          get a photograph?  Is that what

	          she's using an assumed identity,
	          travels under a false name, checks
	          into hotels with an alias.  She
	          never stays in the same place two
	          nights in a row.  Anything on the
	          satellite photos?
	              (irritated)
	          What about the fingerprints?  What
	          happened when we dusted that hotel
	          suite?
	
	MILTON holds up a glass taken from the hotel.
	
	                    MILTON
	          Well, we got some of Taransky's
	          fingerprints, a lot of your
	          fingerprints... but none of hers.
	
	                    MAX
	              (interest piqued)
	          Which means they're significant.
	              (beat)
	          Incriminating.
	              (beat)
	          Perhaps, criminal.
	              (getting excited)
	          She's hiding her past.  She's
	          hiding her past.
	
	Max ponders the revelation.
	
	                    MAX
	          Of course -- no one's that perfect,
	          that pure.  You know I had
	          something on Mother Teresa.  But
	          then she died and it wasn't worth
	          it anymore.
	              (approaching a computer)
	          I know how to flush out this Simone
	          -- a tell-all story from her
	          childhood.
	
	                    MILTON
	              (impressed)
	          My God, you've got one?
	
	                    MAX
	              (offering Milton a seat in
	               front of the computer)
	          I will when you're finished writing
	          it.
	
	MILTON hesitates, questioning his journalistic ethics.
	
	                    MAX
	              (disappointed in his
	               protege)
	          Am I wasting my time with you? 
	          When she sues to protect her
	          privacy, she'll have to appear in a
	          public courtroom to do it.
	
	                    MILTON
	              (under his breath)
	          Long live the First Amendment.
	
	                    MAX
	          Sometimes you have to tell a small
	          lie to get to the bigger truth.
	              (to his nervous
	               photographer)
	          As for a photo -- if you can't do
	          it, I know twelve million people
	          who can.
	
	CLOSE UP on The Echo magazine -- "CIRCULATION - 12 MILLION".
	
	EXT.  STUDIO LOT - DAY
	
	"MILLION DOLLAR REWARD FOR PHOTO OF SIMONE!" -- Is the
	headline on the cover of The ECHO.  VIKTOR is reading the
	magazine as he makes his way through the studio lot.
	
	He looks up to see several studio carts parked outside his
	soundstage.  A group of STUDIO EXECUTIVES, led by ELAINE, is
	trying to break into the "CLOSED SET".  VIKTOR runs towards
	the door, throwing himself between the door and the
	executives.
	
	                    VIKTOR
	          -- You can't go in there!
	
	                    ELAINE
	          -- We have to talk to her, Viktor!
	
	                    EXECUTIVE 1
	          -- We know she's in there!
	
	Viktor glares at the SECURITY GUARD who shrugs weakly.
	
	                    VIKTOR
	              (struggling to hold them
	               back)
	          -- Why?  What's all this about?
	
	                    EXECUTIVE 2
	              (waving a spreadsheet)
	          -- We've got the tracking numbers
	          for "Eternity Forever".
	
	                    EXECUTIVE 3
	          -- They're in the toilet.
	
	                    ELAINE
	          -- She has to get out there and
	          sell the film.
	
	                    VIKTOR
	          -- What do you want her to do, go
	          door-to-door -- ?
	
	                    EXECUTIVE 1
	          -- Even Garbo would be on the talk
	          show circuit if she was alive
	          today.
	
	                    VIKTOR
	              (irritated)
	          -- It's precisely because she
	          doesn't crave the limelight that
	          people love her.  I told you, she's
	          only about the work.
	
	                    EXECUTIVE 3
	          -- This is over-shadowing the work!
	
	                    EXECUTIVE 2
	              (waving the front page of
	               The Echo)
	          That's the problem.  She's more
	          famous for her no-shows than her
	          shows.
	
	                    ELAINE
	          -- It's starting to look like she
	          doesn't support the film or you,
	          Viktor.
	              (trying to squeeze past
	               Viktor)
	          If you can't handle her, I will.
	
	                    VIKTOR
	              (blocking her path)
	          Not now.  She's emotional.  Her
	          mother dies today.  Scene forty-two
	          of "Good For Nothing".  It's not a
	          good time.
	
	Elaine and the executives are not convinced, they overpower
	Viktor.
	
	                    VIKTOR
	          No!  Please, don't go in there!
	
	Too late.  Elaine and the suits force the lock and enter.
	
	INT.  VIKTOR'S SOUNDSTAGE - DAY
	
	ELAINE and the EXECUTIVES stop in their tracks -- confronted
	with the surreal sight of the lone computer station in the
	vast soundstage.  A desperate VIKTOR catches up with them.
	
	                    EXECUTIVE 1
	          Where is she?
	
	                    EXECUTIVE 2
	          She's not here.
	
	                    VIKTOR
	          Elaine... I...
	
	Elaine wanders over to the idle computer with a knowing
	smile.
	
	                    ELAINE
	          So, the secret's finally out,
	          Viktor.
	
	                    VIKTOR
	          -- I can explain.
	
	                    ELAINE
	          -- I don't think that's necessary. 
	          I think it's perfectly clear.  I
	          should have guessed -- it all makes
	          sense now... it's why she never
	          goes anywhere, never seen in
	          public...
	
	Viktor lowers his head, resigned to his fate.
	
	                    ELAINE
	          She's into computers.
	
	Viktor looks up.
	
	                    EXECUTIVE 1
	              (nodding in agreement)
	          Probably spends her whole life in
	          chat rooms.
	
	                    EXECUTIVE 2
	          It's the one place she can be
	          herself.
	
	                    EXECUTIVE 3
	          Anonymous.
	
	Viktor seizes on the opportunity.
	
	                    VIKTOR
	              (adopting a serious tone)
	          It's worse than you think.  She's
	          extremely agoraphobic -- has a
	          morbid fear of people and germs. 
	          In a way I'm relieved you... found
	          out.
	
	The Executives are taken aback by the shocking revelation.
	
	                    VIKTOR
	          The premiere was the first time
	          I've convinced her to venture out
	          and it just confirmed her worst
	          nightmares.
	
	                    ELAINE
	              (concerned)
	          Viktor, you should have said
	          something.
	
	                    VIKTOR
	          She doesn't want pity.
	
	                    ELAINE
	              (seeing a new side of
	               Viktor)
	          You're so good to protect her like
	          this.
	
	Viktor shrugs modestly.
	
	                    VIKTOR
	              (to the Executives,
	               conceding)
	          I'll tell you what.  I know how
	          much this means to you.  I'll try
	          to get her to plug the film.
	              (beat)
	          I'm not promising anything but
	          maybe she'll do a talk show --
	          taped.
	
	                    ELAINE
	          Oh, make it live -- please, Viktor.
	
	                    VIKTOR
	          I'll try.  Maybe live but remote. 
	          She'll never go to them.
	
	                    EXECUTIVE 1
	          We understand.  Thank you, Viktor.
	
	                    EXECUTIVE 2
	          Give her our best.
	
	Satisfied, the Executives make their way out of the
	soundstage.
	
	                    EXECUTIVE 1
	              (aside to a colleague)
	          That agoraphobia -- it's like a
	          plague.
	
	                    EXECUTIVE 2
	          It's out of control in Europe.
	
	Viktor and Elaine are left alone.
	
	                    VIKTOR
	          I'm sorry I didn't get a chance to
	          introduce you to Simone at the
	          premiere.  There wasn't time with
	          the riot and everything.
	              (picking up a framed photo
	               from the work station)
	          But she wanted you to have this.
	
	The photograph shows ELAINE, slightly inebriated at the
	premiere, SIMONE standing slightly behind her.
	
	                    ELAINE
	          She was there.  She didn't by any
	          chance happen to mention me?
	
	                    VIKTOR
	          She said you were very beautiful.
	
	                    ELAINE
	              (flattered)
	          Really?
	
	                    VIKTOR
	              (blurting out)
	          Elaine, what are you doing tonight? 
	          Would you like to go somewhere --
	          dinner?
	
	                    ELAINE
	          I'd love to.  But aren't you
	          supposed to meet up with Simone?
	
	                    VIKTOR
	          Oh, yes.  Of course.  Don't I
	          always?
	
	Viktor watches Elaine make her way back to her studio cart.
	
	Viktor realizes he is still holding a copy of the National
	ECHO -- the headline, "MILLION DOLLAR REWARD FOR PHOTO OF
	SIMONE"!  Accompanied by a photo of intrepid reporter MAX
	SAYER.
	
	INT.  SUPERMARKET - NIGHT
	
	An unattended shopping cart, at the end of the frozen foods
	aisle, begins to mysteriously roll towards us.
	
	We discover VIKTOR, pulling the cart with fishing line, while
	at the same time shooting it with a video camera.
	
	INT.  SUPERMARKET - NIGHT
	
	Viktor's home video of the shopping cart plays on a TV. 
	However, now SIMONE is pushing the cart.  She wears
	sunglasses, her hair in curlers under a scarf.  Simone takes
	a Swanson Chicken Pot Pie out of a cabinet... then a box of
	cereal off a display.
	
	INT.  ECHO OFFICES - DAY
	
	MAX SAYER watches the video in his office, enraptured.  He
	rewinds the tape and replays the moment.
	
	                    MAX
	          She likes Apple Jacks... just like
	          me...
	
	Assistant MILTON enters.  He looks ill.
	
	                    MILTON
	          Mr. Sayer...
	
	                    MAX
	              (irritated at being
	               interrupted)
	          What do you want -- ?
	
	                    MILTON
	          Mr. Sayer, did we pay the million
	          bucks yet?
	
	                    MAX
	              (never averting his eyes
	               from the screen)
	          -- Cashier's check went out to our
	          anonymous tipster this morning --
	          worth every penny too.  Who says
	          there's no place for checkbook
	          journalism?  We'll be running
	          stills of this for months, then
	          release the whole tape -- we'll get
	          our money back -- maybe show it on
	          an exclusive pay-per-view event. 
	          Do you realize what we have here? 
	          We have the only independent
	          footage of Simone in existence.
	
	                    MILTON
	          We used to.
	
	Max's head snaps around.
	
	                    MILTON
	              (holding a copy of the
	               L.A. Times Calendar
	               section - "Simone Live")
	          She's doing Frank Brand on
	          Thursday.
	
	Max coughs.
	
	                    MAX
	          Get out.
	
	A TV
	
	The opening credits to "FRANK BRAND LIVE", a global cable
	show plays against a starscape -- images of famous
	politicians and world leaders interviewed by Frank.
	
	                    FRANK BRAND
	              (to camera)
	          Tonight on Frank Brand Live --
	
	INT.  ELAINE'S MANSION - DAY
	
	ELAINE, KENT and LAINEY watch the TV interview in Elaine's
	mansion with eager anticipation.
	
	                    FRANK BRAND
	          -- Since taking the nation by storm
	          with her debut movie, "Sunrise,
	          Sunset"...
	
	INT.  MAX SAYER'S OFFICE - THE ECHO - DAY
	
	MAX SAYER and assistant MILTON are also glued to their set.
	
	                    FRANK BRAND
	          ... no one's managed to land a live
	          TV interview with the fabulous, new
	          shooting starlet, Simone... until
	          now.
	
	INT.  VIKTOR'S SOUNDSTAGE - DAY
	
	Casually tacked up on the monitor is the MILLION DOLLAR CHECK
	from The ECHO.
	
	VIKTOR, face and body scanned by the computer, is making a
	final test of his equipment.  When he touches his hair, bats
	his eyes, moves his hands -- so does Simone.
	
	VIKTOR frantically tests several different backgrounds behind
	SIMONE from a library of images.  Rainforest.  Desert.  Ritzy
	hotel suite.  Moonscape.  Factory.
	
	                    SIMONE / VIKTOR
	          Make up your mind, Viktor.  Make up
	          your mind.
	
	He settles on the desert location.
	
	He also make a last-second change to Simone's wardrobe --
	selecting "TOO-TIGHT SWEATER".
	
	INT.  FRANK BRAND TV STUDIO - NIGHT
	
	FRANK BRAND talks to camera.
	
	                    FRANK BRAND
	          I'm happy to say she's agreed to
	          join us tonight from the set of her
	          new film.
	              (turning to the TV
	               monitor)
	          Welcome, Simone.
	
	The just-completed image of SIMONE appears on Brand's
	monitor.
	
	                    SIMONE
	          Wonderful to be with you, Frank.
	
	INT.  ELAINE'S MANSION - DAY
	
	KENT, referring to Simone, forgetting or not caring that
	Elaine is in the room.
	
	                    KENT
	          She is all woman.
	
	LAINEY shoots her mother's boyfriend a withering look.  She
	gets up and leaves the room.
	
	During the interview we cut between Frank Brand's studio,
	Viktor's soundstage and various viewer locations including
	Elaine's mansion, Max Sayer's office and various worldwide
	locations --
	
	A)  A lone AFGHANI SHEPHERD gazing at a Watchman.
	
	B)  A JAPANESE COUPLE watching TV in a capsule hotel room.
	
	C)  A CATHOLIC CARDINAL watching TV in the Vatican.
	
	INT.  FRANK BRAND TV STUDIO - NIGHT
	
	                    FRANK BRAND
	          Well, no one could accuse you of
	          being over-exposed, Simone.  Why
	          have you stayed so completely out
	          of the limelight?
	
	                    SIMONE
	              (shrugs)
	          I just think actors talk too much. 
	          Does the world really want to hear
	          your life story just because you've
	          got a movie opening Friday?
	
	                    FRANK BRAND
	          Of course, the only problem with
	          shying away from publicity these
	          days is that it tends to attract
	          more.
	
	VIKTOR is in his element, his effeminate gestures
	frighteningly convincing.
	
	                    SIMONE
	              (from TV)
	          Don't I know it.  That's the only
	          reason I'm here now -- to put the
	          attention back where it belongs, on
	          Mr. Taransky's film.
	
	                    FRANK BRAND
	          You don't secretly want the
	          attention?
	
	                    SIMONE
	          I'm not even sure I deserve it. 
	          After tonight I'll have almost as
	          much screen time on your show as I
	          do in my movies.  How is that
	          healthy for a performer?
	
	IE.  ELAINE'S MANSION - DAY
	
	LAINEY has turned her back on the TV screen, preferring to
	look through a book.
	
	                    SIMONE
	              (from TV)
	          Because, you have to understand,
	          Frank, these interviews -- none of
	          this is real.  Who I am on screen
	          and who I really am are two totally
	          different people.
	
	                    FRANK BRAND
	          Who are you really?
	
	                    SIMONE
	          That's a good question.
	              (beat)
	          As Nietzsche said, "Whenever a man
	          strives long and hard to appear
	          someone else..."
	
	                    LAINEY
	              (reading from a bookmarked
	               page, along with Simone)
	          "... he ends up finding it is
	          difficult to be himself again."
	
	                    FRANK BRAND
	          Well put.
	
	Lainey regards the name written on the inside page -- "Viktor
	Taransky".
	
	INT.  MAX SAYER'S OFFICE - THE ECHO - DAY
	
	TV playing in the background, MAX and MILTON are hurriedly
	leafing through travel books and scrutinizing maps.
	
	                    MAX
	              (focusing on the desert
	               background behind Simone)
	          I know where that is... I know...
	
	INT.  FRANK BRAND TV STUDIO - NIGHT
	
	                    FRANK BRAND
	          Change of topic.  Simone, you've
	          been romantically linked to dozens
	          of men in the press -- Mick Jagger,
	          Stephen Hawking, Fidel Castro...
	          and most recently Viktor Taransky. 
	          Is there a Mr. Right in there
	          somewhere?
	
	                    SIMONE
	          I'd rather not discuss my private
	          life.
	              (gently)
	          But Viktor and I are inseparable.
	
	INT.  ELAINE'S MANSION - DAY
	
	ELAINE's face drops, slightly hurt.
	
	                    KENT
	          You dog, Viktor!
	
	                    SIMONE
	              (from TV)
	          I literally wouldn't be here today
	          without him.
	
	INT.  VIKTOR'S SOUNDSTAGE - DAY
	
	VIKTOR accidentally taps his finger on the keyboard in his
	excitement -- the cursor aimed at "TEARS" command.  SIMONE'S
	EYES start to well with tears -- a tear spills from her eye.
	
	                    FRANK BRAND
	          Would you like a moment, Simone?
	
	Viktor notices, quickly withdrawing his finger -- his
	startled expression instantly imitated by Simone.
	
	                    SIMONE
	          No, I'm okay.
	
	INT.  FRANK BRAND TV STUDIO - NIGHT
	
	                    FRANK BRAND
	          Let's talk about the work that you
	          care so much about.
	
	                    SIMONE
	          Sure.  Where would you like to
	          start?
	
	                    FRANK BRAND
	          How about the nudity?
	
	                    SIMONE
	          Nudity has just never been an issue
	          for me, Frank.  For me, clothes are
	          just an option.
	
	                    FRANK BRAND
	          What exactly was it that attracted
	          you to your first two projects?
	
	                    SIMONE
	              (unable to resist a smile)
	          I suppose the thing I like most
	          about the movies I'm in is that
	          they're not about special effects.
	
	Frank nods sagely.
	
	                    FRANK BRAND
	          They're better for it if I may say.
	
	INT.  VIKTOR'S SOUNDSTAGE - DAY
	
	The smile is suddenly wiped off VIKTOR's face by a blinking
	alert:
	
	        !!INSUFFICIENT MEMORY TO COMPLETE THIS TASK!!
	
	The pixels that form SIMONE start to break up.  Curiously, it
	is only Simone and not the background that is disintegrating.
	
	INT.  FRANK BRAND TV STUDIO - NIGHT
	
	                    FRANK BRAND
	              (regarding the screen)
	          Well, we appear to be experiencing
	          satellite difficulties.  In case we
	          lose you, Simone, I want to thank
	          you --
	
	INT.  VIKTOR'S SOUNDSTAGE - DAY
	
	VIKTOR speaks again, his voice suddenly deeper.
	
	                    SIMONE / VIKTOR
	          Thank... YOU, FRANK.
	
	In horror Viktor hurriedly pulls the plug.  The feed goes
	blank on Frank Brand's screen.
	
	VIKTOR slumps over his computer in exhaustion.  Since SIMONE
	is still synced to his movements, the partially de-pixelated
	Simone also slumps.
	
	Viktor's cell phone rings.  Viktor picks up.
	
	                    VIKTOR / SIMONE
	          Hel--
	
	He remembers at the last second to switch off his voice
	synthesizer.
	
	                    VIKTOR
	              (into phone)
	          Hello.
	
	INT.  ELAINE'S MANSION - DAY
	
	We cut between the two sides of the conversation -- ELAINE on
	the phone, KENT still watching post-interview analysis on the
	TV.
	
	                    ELAINE
	          -- Viktor, are you with her?  Is
	          she there?
	
	                    VIKTOR
	          No.
	
	An anxious beat.
	
	                    ELAINE
	          Are you and Simone...
	              (blurting it out)
	          ... getting married?
	
	                    VIKTOR
	              (taken aback by the
	               suggestion)
	          No, of course not!
	              (realizing the
	               significance of the
	               question)
	          Why?  Would you care if we were?
	
	                    ELAINE
	              (covering, realizing she
	               has given herself away)
	          Well, yes.  From a studio point of
	          view, it would be better if Simone
	          stayed single.
	              (quick change of topic)
	          Anyhow, I thought she came across
	          great tonight.  Intelligent, well
	          informed, a natural.  And touching. 
	          She was spectacular.
	
	                    VIKTOR
	          Thank you.
	
	A pause.
	
	                    ELAINE
	          Viktor, do you realize you always
	          do that?
	
	                    VIKTOR
	          Do what?
	
	                    ELAINE
	          Whenever I compliment Simone, you
	          take the credit.
	
	                    VIKTOR
	          I do?
	
	                    ELAINE
	          Yes, you do...
	              (shrug)
	          Anyway, tonight was a good start.
	
	                    VIKTOR
	          Excuse me?  Start?
	
	                    ELAINE
	          It's a crowded summer.  We need
	          every photo-opp, sound-byte and
	          column inch we can get.  Good
	          night, Viktor.
	
	Elaine hangs up.  Lainey approaches.
	
	                    LAINEY
	              (carefully broaching the
	               subject)
	          Mom, do you miss Dad?
	
	                    ELAINE
	              (she thinks)
	          Sometimes.  But, just when I think
	          your father's changing for the
	          better, I realize he's as self
	          absorbed as ever.  He took the
	          credit for Simone tonight.
	
	Lainey, coming to her father's defense, glancing at the
	Nietzsche book in her hand.
	
	                    LAINEY
	          I think Dad deserves more credit
	          than he gets.
	
	INT.  VIKTOR'S SOUNDSTAGE - LATER THAT NIGHT
	
	VIKTOR watches SIMONE on screen.  He is unusually anxious.
	
	As usual SIMONE is wearing a skimpy, provocative outfit as
	she awaits instructions on the screen.  For some reason
	Viktor becomes irritated by the image.
	
	                    VIKTOR
	              (to Simone)
	          Will you cover yourself up!?
	
	He hits a button.  A thick WOOL COAT clicks over her body.
	
	EXT.  NEW MEXICO DESERT - MORNING
	
	The ECHO newscar streaks through the bronze and purple
	desert.  MAX and his assistant MILTON emerge from the car.
	
	                    MAX
	          -- I've been here before! -- On my
	          honeymoon with my ex-wife.
	
	                    MILTON
	          Is that why she left you?
	
	Max holds a video print of SIMONE giving her FRANK BRAND
	interview.  He compares her desert location to the one in
	front of him.
	
	                    MAX
	              (pointing out a Joshua
	               tree)
	          You see, that's the exact same tree
	          and in the distance, there's the...
	              (voice trailing away)
	          ... mountain.
	
	Sure enough, the Joshua tree is identical but the mountain is
	now obscured by a ten-story Holiday Inn.
	
	Max and Milton are mystified -- they look back at the photo.
	
	                    MILTON
	          It's a hotel.
	
	                    MAX
	          I don't understand.
	
	                    MILTON
	          Could they have built that hotel
	          since yesterday?
	
	Max shakes his head, deeply concerned.
	
	                    MAX
	          Get in the car.
	
	INT.  VIKTOR'S SOUNDSTAGE - NIGHT
	
	VIKTOR has transformed his soundstage into a one-man
	publicity machine.  The floor is littered with photographs of
	SIMONE in various states of dress and undress.
	
	Using a sophisticated Photoshop computer program, VIKTOR
	constructs magazine spreads out of numerous previous magazine
	spreads -- "Time", "People", "Us", "Life", "Popular
	Mechanics".
	
	                    VIKTOR
	              (angrily into phone)
	          -- We don't do the photo shoot, you
	          don't get the cover... written
	          answers to written questions,
	          that's right... website interviews,
	          no problem.
	
	Viktor calls up a "DANCE OPTION".  Choosing from a HULA
	DANCER, a BELLY DANCER and a CLASSICAL BALLERINA, he removes
	Simone's head and places it on the body of the ballerina. 
	She begins to dance for him.
	
	He uses a program to construct childhood photographs of
	SIMONE and other childhood memorabilia.
	
	He employs backgrounds from numerous on-line library sources.
	With a quick cut and paste he is able to place Simone on a
	beach in San Tropez or a bicycle factory in Calcutta.
	
	                    VIKTOR
	              (muttering to himself)
	          You want exposure, Elaine?  I'll
	          give you over-exposure...
	
	INT.  ELAINE'S OFFICE - STUDIO - DAY
	
	ELAINE watches TV in her office.  She cannot change channels
	without finding Simone sitting in a chair giving generic
	answers.
	
	INT.  SIMONE INTERVIEW SET - DAY (ON ELAINE'S TV)
	
	                    SIMONE
	          I think "Eternity Forever" is my
	          finest work.
	
	                    SIMONE
	          I'm most proud of my work in
	          "Eternity Forever".
	
	                    SIMONE
	          I think people are going to love
	          "Eternity Forever".
	
	INT.  VIKTOR'S SOUNDSTAGE - NIGHT
	
	VIKTOR inspects a cut-out photograph of Simone in "ETERNITY
	FOREVER" costume.  He speaks to the photo.
	
	                    VIKTOR
	          Forgive me, Simone.
	
	EXT.  FASTFOOD RESTAURANT - DAY
	
	The photograph of Simone is emblazoned on a fast food drink
	cup -- a pyramid of cups promoting "ETERNITY FOREVER" Happy
	Meals.  Beneath the plastic pyramid is a SIMONE action figure
	in a convertible.
	
	INT.  VIKTOR'S MALIBU BEACH HOUSE - DAY
	
	         "ETERNITY FOREVER" HAS BIG FUTURE AT B.O.!
	
	Screams the banner headline in "Variety".
	
	            $$$IMONE - WINS 6TH WEEKEND IN A ROW
	
	Shouts the "Hollywood Reporter".
	
	The trade papers sit on the coffee table in front of VIKTOR
	who reclines on a leather sofa, watching TV, gazing lovingly
	at Simone.
	
	INT.  SIMONE INTERVIEW SET - DAY (ON VIKTOR'S TV)
	
	                    SIMONE
	          Of course, being a movie star is
	          wonderful, but I have so many other
	          ways I want to express myself --
	
	INT.  BOOKSTORE - DAY
	
	Various book titles are on display:
	
	            "SIMONE'S FAVORITE SOUTHERN RECIPES"
	
	            "HUMAN:KIND - The POETRY of SIMONE"
	
	                 "SIMONE'S 101 WAYS TO JOY"
	
	EXT.  DEPARTMENT STORE - DAY
	
	A banner in a window reads.  "In Stock: SIMONE'S EASY-WEAR
	FASHION".  Mannequins model the clothes.
	
	INT.  VIKTOR'S SOUNDSTAGE - DAY
	
	We focus on the screen where VIKTOR types in instructions:
	
	  SEARCH: "NUMBER 1 HITS - FEMALE ARTISTS/BILLBOARD CHARTS"
	
	  PERIOD: "LAST 40 YEARS"
	
	A list of the Number 1 hits for the last forty years promptly
	appears on the screen along with photographs of the
	artists --
	
	PATSY CLINE, ELLA FITZGERALD, ARETHA FRANKLIN, JANICE JOPLIN,
	CAROL KING, WHITNEY HOUSTON, MADONNA, etc.  Beneath the title
	of each song is a graphic representation of the music --
	"PITCH" and "RESONANCE".
	
	Viktor presses a button: "MORPH".  The audio waves converge.
	
	INT.  VIKTOR'S SOUNDSTAGE - DAY
	
	VIKTOR, wearing headphones, records his composite pop song. 
	As usual when he sings into his microphone, Simone also
	sings.  The catchy song is titled: "(If You Can't Believe In
	Yourself) Believe In Me".
	
	SIMONE APPEARS IN A MUSIC VIDEO.
	
	INT.  RECORD STORE - DAY
	
	The video for SIMONE's song plays on the video wall inside
	the record store.  TEENAGE GIRLS, buying CD's, dance
	adoringly in front of the screen, unaware that they are
	gyrating to the vocals of a middle-aged man.
	
	INSERT - "(If You Can't Believe In Yourself) Believe In Me"
	shoots up the Billboard charts.
	
	EXT.  OCEAN - DAY
	
	CLOSE UP on the name "SIMONE" painted on the stern of a
	luxury yacht.
	
	VIKTOR is at the helm, breathing in the clean air -- at last
	a moment to savor his success.  Simone's hit single plays on
	the yacht's stereo.  He looks at peace.
	
	EXT.  MARINA - DAY
	
	A TOURIST has his arm around SIMONE, having his photograph
	taken.  However, we discover that the Simone is only a
	lifesize cardboard cutout used by a STREET VENDOR to sell
	snapshots.  He also has cardboard cutouts of the POPE and
	ELVIS.
	
	MAX SAYER and MILTON walk by.
	
	Tying up his boat, VIKTOR's mood is abruptly shattered by the
	sight of Max and Milton walking down the pier towards him.
	
	                    MAX
	          Nice boat, Taransky.
	
	                    VIKTOR
	          It's a yacht.
	
	                    MAX
	          I know what you're up to.
	
	                    VIKTOR
	              (pushing past Max)
	          I don't have time for this, Sayer.
	
	                    MAX
	          I think you do.
	              (holding up his video
	               print of Simone in the
	               desert)
	          I know it's a fake.
	
	Viktor freezes.
	
	                    MAX
	          Got your attention now?
	
	Max compares the shot to one of the current desert location
	with the Holiday Inn in front of the mountain.
	
	                    MAX
	              (referring to the
	               photographs)
	          It's bogus.  You used an old
	          library shot for the background.
	
	                    VIKTOR
	              (ashen)
	          The background is.
	
	                    MAX
	          She was never in New Mexico.  She
	          never left the studio.
	
	Viktor is relieved that Max is only accusing him of faking
	the background.
	
	                    MAX
	              (referring to a large
	               bundle of other shots
	               under his arm)
	          I've done my homework.  I've
	          studied her.
	
	                    VIKTOR
	          -- I bet you have.
	
	                    MAX
	          -- I've looked at every piece of
	          publicity she's ever done, the
	          video in the supermarket, there's
	          no evidence she's ever left the
	          studio.
	              (afterthought)
	          Oh, and for some reason this woman
	          leaves no paper trail.  But I have
	          "obtained" a copy of your bank
	          accounts.  I know you have power of
	          attorney but so far you haven't
	          transferred one single solitary
	          cent to her.
	
	                    VIKTOR
	          I'm keeping it in trust.
	
	                    MAX
	          I know that's what you'd like us to
	          believe.  But I got to tell you --
	          embezzlement is a serious matter. 
	          Not to mention abduction.
	
	                    VIKTOR
	          Abduction?
	
	                    MAX
	          I don't buy the whole recluse scam. 
	          How are you doing it?  What is it --
	          drugs?  Blackmail?  Mind-control? 
	          All three?  What do you do -- keep
	          her locked in a box somewhere?
	
	Viktor flinches at the remark.
	
	                    VIKTOR
	          What is it exactly you want, Sayer?
	
	                    MAX
	          I want to see her.  Unless you show
	          me Simone live and in person I show
	          these pictures to the authorities.
	
	Viktor pauses, considering the threat.
	
	                    VIKTOR
	          Alright, Sayer, you've got a deal.
	
	                    MAX
	          Er,... good.
	
	                    MILTON
	          That's good.
	
	Viktor walks away leaving Max confused.
	
	The breeze whips the photos of SIMONE out of Max's hands and
	into the sea.
	
	INT.  CONCERT STADIUM - DUSK
	
	A vast, empty stadium.  On the stage, a lone microphone. 
	VIKTOR approaches, gazing out at the vast arena.  Several
	PROMOTERS and TECHNICIANS join him.
	
	                    PROMOTER
	          All ready, Mr. Taransky.  This time
	          tomorrow night, she'll be standing
	          right here in front of a packed
	          house.  We could have sold it out
	          twenty times.
	
	Viktor nods.
	
	                    TECHNICIAN
	          Soundcheck went perfect.  Laser
	          show ready to go.
	              (cautionary note)
	          I gotta say, you ordered an awful
	          lot of smoke.
	
	                    VIKTOR
	          That's the way she likes it.
	
	The Promoter glancing to the area in front of the stage,
	where a barrier has been erected.
	
	                    PROMOTER
	          After what you told us about the
	          death threats, the security guards
	          are under strict instructions never
	          to take their eyes off the crowd.
	
	                    VIKTOR
	          Excellent.
	
	Viktor hands each man a headshot of SIMONE signed with a
	kiss.
	
	                    VIKTOR
	          Simone wanted you to have these.
	
	                    TECHNICIAN
	              (visibly moved by the
	               gesture)
	          Wish her luck from us.
	
	                    VIKTOR
	          Oh, I will.
	              (afterthought)
	          Remember, no cameras, no
	          binoculars.
	
	EXT.  STADIUM - NIGHT
	
	In the shadow of the enormous stadium sits a control
	truck/tour bus, satellite dishes on the roof -- the lights
	from the laser-show inside the arena play off the truck.  The
	control truck shakes from the stomping of the crowd.
	
	                    CROWD
	          ... SI-MONE!  SI-MONE!  SI-MONE!...
	
	The door to the truck is marked, "SIMONE - Splendid Isolation
	Tour.  NO ENTRY".
	
	INT.  CONTROL TRUCK - BACKSTAGE - NIGHT
	
	VIKTOR sits alone at the mixing panel of a control truck.  On
	his monitors, a sea of humanity, chanting.
	
	                    CROWD
	          ... SI-MONE!  SI-MONE!  SI-MONE!...
	
	Viktor produces the "SIMULATION ONE" hard-drive from his
	jacket pocket and inserts it into the computer.
	
	SIMONE appears on the monitor.
	
	                    VIKTOR
	          Let's get you into hair and make
	          up.
	
	Simone's hair rapidly grows in a number of styles, eyelashes
	grow and are trimmed, eyeshadow of various shades paints
	across the lids.
	
	                    VIKTOR
	          Wardrobe.
	
	Viktor tries several outfits on Simone -- the clothes
	appearing to fabricate themselves on her body.  He settles
	for the most provocative outfit.
	
	Finger poised over the keyboard, Viktor glances to a monitor
	showing --
	
	INT.  STADIUM - CROWD - NIGHT
	
	ELAINE and LAINEY amongst the crowd, clapping their hands,
	stomping their feet and chanting.
	
	INT.  CONTROL TRUCK - BACKSTAGE - NIGHT
	
	                    VIKTOR
	          Easier to make one hundred thousand
	          believe than just one.
	
	He scrolls to a program, marked "HOLOGRAM" and pushes the
	"ENTER" key.
	
	INT.  STADIUM - CONCERT STAGE - NIGHT
	
	Smoke fills the stage.  A strobe light show plays.  A booming
	ANNOUNCER is heard.
	
	                    ANNOUNCER
	          Ladies and gentlemen, Viktor
	          Taransky Promotions is proud to
	          present, live on stage, for the
	          debut concert of the "Splendid
	          Isolation" tour, the one, the only,
	          SI-MONE!
	
	A spotlight falls on the solitary figure of Simone, standing
	alone on the stage with a guitar over her shoulder (the only
	accompaniment) -- dwarfed by the huge stage.  However, on
	closer inspection, the spotlight is actually a laser beam
	creating a hologram.  Clouds of smoke and strobe lighting aid
	the illusion.
	
	The only clear view of Simone for the audience is provided by
	the enormous video screens on either side of the stage.  The
	CROWD stares up at the jumbotrons, blissfully unaware that
	they are watching a pre-recorded event.  Some watch the event
	on portable TVs.
	
	INT.  CONTROL TRUCK - BACKSTAGE - NIGHT
	
	CLOSE UP on the computer screen.  VIKTOR scrolls down a list
	of options -- "... HOUSTON, MIAMI, NEW YORK, L.A...."
	
	                    SIMONE
	              (from on stage)
	          I love you...
	
	He selects "L.A.".
	
	                    SIMONE
	          ... L.A.
	
	The crowd roars its approval.
	
	                    SIMONE
	          It's great to be here.
	
	INT.  STADIUM - CONCERT STAGE - NIGHT
	
	SIMONE -- her voice a seamless blend of several DIVAS --
	begins to sing her hit song, "(If You Can't Believe In
	Yourself) Believe In Me".  A verse of the song is sung in
	perfect Spanish.
	
	EXT.  VARIOUS LOCATIONS - NIGHT/DAY
	
	A)  On a jumbotron in Tokyo SIMONE's concert plays LIVE.
	
	B)  On a TV set on a West African beach, children dance to
	    SIMONE.
	
	C)  On a computer in a Bombay taxi, the driver and his
	    passengers gyrate to SIMONE webcast.
	
	INT.  CONTROL TRUCK - BACKSTAGE - NIGHT
	
	VIKTOR's face is reflected in a monitor showing a frenzied
	crowd gazing up at the jumbotron -- singing along, many in
	tears, overcome with emotion -- holding cigarette lighters
	aloft.  For a moment Viktor is in awe of his own wizardry --
	the grand illusionist.  Viktor is at the height of his
	powers.
	
	                    VIKTOR
	              (to the image of Simone on
	               his screen)
	          I don't know about you, Simone, but
	          I've never felt more alive.
	
	He snaps back to reality just in time to notice that the
	Simone hologram beam has wandered through her own microphone
	stand.
	
	                    VIKTOR
	          Damn!
	
	He adjusts the beam -- the rapturous crowd, transfixed by the
	TV screen, apparently fails to notice.
	
	INT.  STADIUM - CROWD - NIGHT
	
	We focus on a face in the crowd -- MAX SAYER.  His
	journalistic assignment temporarily forgotten, Max is singing
	along and waving his arms, tears rolling down his face, swept
	up in the moment.
	
	INT.  STADIUM - CONCERT STAGE - NIGHT
	
	SIMONE finishes her final number.
	
	                    SIMONE
	          Good-night.  Never stop believing.
	
	EXT.  STADIUM - EXIT - NIGHT
	
	A bin contains dozens of confiscated cameras and binoculars. 
	FANS exit the stadium through a tunnel.
	
	S-I-M-O-N-E is spelt out on the bare chests of six TEENAGE
	BOYS.  Other FANS wear "SIMONE - Splendid Isolation Tour"
	T-shirts and carry posters.  Several CONCERT GOERS speak to a
	TV NEWS CREW.
	
	                    FAN 1
	          -- I swear, she looked right at me.
	
	                    FAN 2
	          -- She was, like, ethereal.
	
	                    FAN 3
	          -- One moment she seemed to walk
	          right through her mike stand like
	          it wasn't even there.
	
	INT.  CONTROL TRUCK - BACKSTAGE - NIGHT
	
	The chanting crowd can be heard exiting.  VIKTOR, wearing
	lipstick is hastily signing a pile of souvenir programs with
	Simone's signature kiss.
	
	He is interrupted by a knock at the door.  Viktor irritably
	opens it.
	
	                    VIKTOR
	          I said I didn't want to be
	          interrupt --
	
	EXT.  CONTROL TRUCK - BACKSTAGE - NIGHT
	
	ELAINE and LAINEY stand at the foot of the trailer, a
	SECURITY GUARD nearby.
	
	                    VIKTOR
	              (face brightening)
	          My two favorite girls.
	
	                    ELAINE
	          Lainey and I just wanted to
	          congratulate...
	
	Regarding Viktor closely, Elaine's smile evaporates.
	
	                    ELAINE
	          ... Simone.
	
	                    VIKTOR
	          She's lying down.  She's exhausted.
	
	                    ELAINE
	              (suddenly cool)
	          I can imagine.
	
	Viktor is confused by their reaction.  Elaine yanks Lainey
	away.
	
	                    ELAINE
	          Thank Simone for the tickets.
	
	                    LAINEY
	              (calling back as she is
	               led away)
	          It was a great show, Dad...
	
	Viktor waves disconcertedly.
	
	                    VIKTOR
	          Where are you... going?
	
	As he returns to the trailer, Viktor catches sight of his
	lipstick-smeared mouth in the mirror on the inside of the
	trailer door.  He slams the side of the trailer in
	frustration.
	
	INT.  ELAINE'S MANSION - NIGHT
	
	ELAINE paces back and forth in front of her TV showing re-
	runs of the SIMONE concert.  KENT cannot take his eyes off
	the screen.
	
	                    ELAINE
	          I can't believe she's doing this --
	          taking advantage of him this way. 
	          It's cruel.
	
	                    KENT
	          Why?
	
	                    ELAINE
	          Obviously, this can't last.  She's
	          going to dump him.  Viktor won't be
	          able to take that.  He's too
	          sensitive.  It'll destroy him.
	
	                    KENT
	          Elaine, do you realize you can't
	          stop talking about Viktor?
	
	                    ELAINE
	              (not hearing)
	          I have to talk to her.
	
	Kent switches off the TV.
	
	                    KENT
	          I've been meaning to talk to you.
	
	Behind the open door, we find LAINEY eavesdropping.
	
	EXT.  VIKTOR'S MALIBU HOUSE - BEACH - DAY
	
	VIKTOR, deep in thought, stands at the water's edge, staring
	at the breaking waves.  LAINEY joins him.
	
	                    VIKTOR
	          Hey, Lainey.
	              (gently teasing her)
	          How's your love life?
	
	                    LAINEY
	          I do okay.  How about you?
	
	                    VIKTOR
	          You know me -- married to my work.
	
	                    LAINEY
	          I noticed.
	
	An awkward silence.
	
	                    LAINEY
	          Dad, you know I don't like to get
	          between you and mom but she's
	          feeling down right now.  She broke
	          up with Kent.
	
	                    VIKTOR
	              (buoyed by the news)
	          Really?  Too bad.
	
	                    LAINEY
	          She thinks you're with Simone.
	
	                    VIKTOR
	          Lainey, you know Simone and I don't
	          have a real relationship.
	
	                    LAINEY
	          I know but Mom doesn't.  Maybe if
	          it came from Simone, if Simone
	          spoke to Mom -- she could
	          straighten things out.
	              (shrug)
	          Dinner, maybe.
	
	                    VIKTOR
	          Dinner?  Dinner's difficult.  A
	          phone call?
	
	                    LAINEY
	          Too impersonal.  They have to meet
	          face-to-face.
	
	                    VIKTOR
	          I'll see what I can do.
	              (a thought occurs)
	          You know, Lainey.  I don't believe
	          you've ever once asked to meet
	          Simone.  Don't you like her?
	
	                    LAINEY
	          I love her but that doesn't mean I
	          need to meet her.
	
	Viktor is confused.
	
	                    LAINEY
	          Why?  So I can tell my friends at
	          school -- as if that validates my
	          life somehow.  What's Simone going
	          to say to a fourteen-year-old
	          anyhow?  She's going to be polite
	          because you're my father but we're
	          not suddenly going to become
	          friends -- we have nothing in
	          common.  It's not going to be real. 
	          Anyhow, she gets more beautiful in
	          my head every day.  Why kill the
	          dream?  What do they say, "don't
	          get too close to your idols, they
	          always disappoint you".
	
	Viktor gazes in wonder at his daughter, so much wiser than
	her years.
	
	                    VIKTOR
	          I love you, Lainey.
	
	                    LAINEY
	          I love you too, daddy.
	
	A car horn sounds outside the house.
	
	                    LAINEY
	          That's Mom.
	              (kissing him on the
	               forehead)
	          See you.
	
	She exits, leaving Viktor deep in thought.
	
	EXT.  LOS ANGELES FREEWAY - DAY
	
	Milli Vanilli's "GIRL YOU KNOW IT'S TRUE" plays on a car
	radio.  ELAINE, wearing a red power suit, drives home along
	the freeway in bumper-to-bumper traffic.  Her car phone
	rings.  She turns down the radio and picks up.
	
	                    ELAINE
	          Hello?
	
	                    SIMONE
	          Hello, is this Elaine?
	
	                    ELAINE
	          Yes -- oh my, God.  Is that you,
	          Simone?!  I've been wanting to talk
	          to you.
	
	                    SIMONE
	          Well, here I am.
	              (beat)
	          You look pretty today.  Red suits
	          you.
	
	                    ELAINE
	              (looking around the
	               freeway)
	          Where are you?
	
	                    SIMONE
	          Right beside you.  I borrowed
	          Viktor's car.
	
	Elaine looks to the inside lane.  SIMONE, wearing sunglasses,
	phone to her ear, drives alongside.  Simone waves, somewhat
	mechanically.  Elaine waves back.  They keep driving as they
	talk.
	
	INT.  VIKTOR'S CAR - DAY
	
	The sunglasses-clad SIMONE is a mannequin, seated in the
	driver's seat with her left hand on the phone obscuring her
	mouth, right hand attached to the steering wheel.
	
	Seat fully-reclined on the passenger side, VIKTOR drives the
	car by stretching a foot across to the pedals and steering
	with one hand, occasionally sneaking a glance to the road
	ahead.  He speaks on a phone through the Simone synthesizer.
	
	                    SIMONE / VIKTOR
	          I'd love to stop somewhere but I'm
	          late.  I'm on my way to see Viktor
	          now.
	
	                    ELAINE
	          No, I understand.  That's what I
	          want to talk about.  I don't know
	          if you know this, Simone, but
	          Viktor and I were married once.
	
	                    SIMONE / VIKTOR
	          I can't imagine how you ever let a
	          man like that go.  I owe Viktor
	          everything.
	
	                    ELAINE
	          I think he owes more to you.  But
	          that's not important now.  I know
	          what's going on between you two.
	
	                    SIMONE / VIKTOR
	          I want to reassure you, Elaine,
	          there's absolutely nothing going on
	          between Viktor and I.
	
	                    ELAINE
	              (rueful smile)
	          You don't have to protect my
	          feelings, Simone.  I don't blame
	          Viktor for falling in love with the
	          most desirable woman in the world.
	
	                    SIMONE / VIKTOR
	              (breaking character)
	          I'm not --
	              (correcting himself)
	          He's not.
	
	Viktor, losing concentration on his driving, drifts across
	his lane, almost striking Elaine's car -- swerving back at
	the last second.
	
	                    ELAINE
	          My God, are you alright, Simone?
	
	                    SIMONE / VIKTOR
	          Damn --
	              (struggling to stay in
	               her/his lane)
	          Yes -- I --
	              (regaining control)
	          -- I'm just a little tired. 
	          Listen, Elaine, Viktor and I --
	          it's strictly a working
	          relationship.  We could never be
	          anything else.  We're just so...
	          different.
	
	                    ELAINE
	          Exactly.  You're a household name
	          now.  You're moving in entirely
	          different worlds.  That's why I
	          hope you're not toying with Viktor.
	
	                    SIMONE / VIKTOR
	          It sounds like you still have
	          feelings for him.
	
	                    ELAINE
	          We have a daughter together.  I
	          just don't want to see Viktor get
	          hurt.
	
	                    SIMONE / VIKTOR
	          I don't know how many times I have
	          to say this, Elaine, but Viktor and
	          I are not in love.
	              (joking weakly)
	          I only make love to the camera.
	
	                    ELAINE
	          Simone, I recognize the shirt
	          you're wearing.  I gave it to
	          Viktor on his birthday.
	
	Over-correcting his steering, Viktor drifts into the next
	lane, dangerously close to a pick-up truck that has to swerve
	to avoid him.
	
	                    SIMONE / VIKTOR
	          Christ --
	              (still struggling to stay
	               on the road)
	          Elaine, I know how it looks but...
	              (blurting it out)
	          ... it would mean a lot to Viktor
	          if you'd go with him to the Oscars. 
	          If you won't do it for him, please
	          do it for me.
	
	                    ELAINE
	              (reluctant, frightened by
	               Simone's erratic driving)
	          Okay -- for you.
	
	                    SIMONE / VIKTOR
	              (sigh of relief)
	          Thanks.  This is my exit so, I --
	
	                    ELAINE
	          I'm glad we talked.
	
	                    SIMONE / VIKTOR
	          Good-bye.
	
	Viktor's car swerves to the right.  Elaine looks back in her
	rearview mirror, concerned.
	
	Elaine just misses the sight of VIKTOR's car rear-ending the
	truck in front of him.
	
	EXT.  FREEWAY SHOULDER - LATER IN THE DAY
	
	VIKTOR anxiously watches a HIGHWAY PATROLMAN writing up the
	fender-bender.  However, the Patrolman is more interested in
	the Simone mannequin.
	
	                    PATROLMAN
	          You don't have to explain.  I know
	          what the press is like.  Lunatics. 
	          Out of control.
	              (referring to the Simone
	               mannequin)
	          You do know I'm going to have to
	          take this?
	
	INT.  ACADEMY AWARDS - AUDITORIUM - NIGHT
	
	VIKTOR, in his tuxedo, sits in the front row of the packed
	auditorium beside an empty seat -- "RESERVED for SIMONE". 
	ELAINE and LAINEY sit alongside -- LOTUS and MAC nearby.
	
	HAL stands at the transparent plastic podium with the "Best
	Actress" envelope.
	
	                    HAL
	          And the winner is...
	
	Hal tears the envelope's seal, momentarily confused as he
	reads the name.
	
	                    HAL
	          Actually, there's a tie.
	
	The AUDIENCE gasps.
	
	                    HAL
	              (milking the moment for
	               all it's worth)
	          The winners are... Simone for
	          "Sunrise, Sunset"...
	
	The audience cheers enthusiastically, but Hal stills their
	applause.
	
	                    HAL
	              (big smile)
	          ... and Simone for "Eternity
	          Forever".
	
	The audience erupts.  Viktor accepts the congratulations of
	those around him.
	
	                    HAL
	          Unfortunately, Simone can't be with
	          us tonight.
	              (turning to the screen)
	          But thanks to the miracle of modern
	          technology she is able to join us
	          live via satellite from the
	          location of her new film.
	
	The screen flickers to life.
	
	ON SCREEN - A DESOLATE WASTELAND - DAY
	
	SIMONE sits in a director's chair in the desolate wasteland
	location chosen by Viktor.
	
	                    SIMONE
	          Thank you!  Thank you!  This means
	          so much to me.  I'm just sorry I
	          can't be there with you.
	              (wiping away a tear)
	          First off I have to acknowledge my
	          fellow nominees -- I don't even
	          feel I belong in the best actress
	          category let alone with these...
	          wonderful human beings.
	              (composing herself)
	          I also have to thank my co-stars,
	          the studio, of course.  But most of
	          all, I have to thank the audience
	          for supporting what I do -- you're
	          the only reason I'm here.
	
	The CROWD applauds wildly.
	
	LAINEY is puzzled.  She leans over to Viktor.
	
	                    LAINEY
	          Why didn't she thank you?
	
	                    VIKTOR
	              (confused)
	          She did... didn't she?
	
	                    ELAINE
	              (crestfallen)
	          No.
	
	Viktor glances to the "Simone" sign beside him.  The blood
	drains from his face.
	
	INT.  VIKTOR'S SOUNDSTAGE - MORNING
	
	On the monitor, SIMONE reads the forgotten line from the
	speech.
	
	                    SIMONE
	          ... And of course I must thank my
	          collaborator, Viktor Taransky,
	          without whom none of this would be
	          possible.
	
	VIKTOR, still in his tuxedo, stares at SIMONE on the screen. 
	He holds the text of Simone's acceptance speech in his hands.
	
	                    VIKTOR
	              (to himself)
	          It's written right there... Why
	          didn't I say it?... How could I
	          forget to say it?
	
	Simone stares back at him blankly.
	
	A copy of VARIETY is slid under the soundstage door.  The
	front page headline, "NO THANK YOU - Simone Snubs Taransky At
	Oscars".
	
	INT.  VIKTOR'S CAR - NIGHT
	
	VIKTOR pulls up to the gate of his Malibu home.  MAX is
	standing outside next to his car.
	
	                    VIKTOR
	          Damn it!
	
	EXT.  VIKTOR'S MALIBU HOME - NIGHT
	
	VIKTOR also spies an OLD WOMAN in a wheelchair sitting beside
	the car, MILTON closeby.  Viktor stops at the gate and
	reluctantly exits his car.
	
	                    VIKTOR
	          What now, Sayer?
	
	                    MAX
	              (smug smile, noticing
	               Viktor noticing the
	               woman)
	          Looks familiar, doesn't she?  No
	          one comes from nowhere, Taransky. 
	          You turn over enough rocks...
	
	The old woman appears drugged, stares into space.
	
	                    MAX
	          I traced her to a nursing home.  A
	          young woman fitting Simone's
	          description dropped her off five
	          years ago.
	
	                    VIKTOR
	          She looks a lot like you.
	
	                    MAX
	              (undeterred)
	          She hasn't uttered a word that
	          whole time -- until she saw the big
	          show.
	
	Max produces a shot of SIMONE at the Oscars and holds it in
	front of the old lady.
	
	                    OLD LADY
	              (pointing to Simone's
	               picture, catatonic)
	          My baby... My baby...
	
	                    MAX
	              (putting his hand on his
	               heart)
	          Who would think that "Saint Simone"
	          would abandon her own mother?  I've
	          been looking into the family
	          history -- heartbreaking.  Most
	          likely a biography to run over four
	          issues... who knows, maybe there's
	          a Pulitzer in there somewhere.
	
	Viktor produces his own driver's license and holds it in
	front of the old lady.
	
	                    OLD LADY
	              (pointing to Viktor's face
	               on the driver's license)
	          My baby... My baby...
	
	Max hastily steps between Viktor and the Old Lady.
	
	                    MAX
	          That doesn't prove a thing -- wait
	          until I get a court order for a
	          blood test.
	
	                    VIKTOR
	              (sensing an opportunity)
	          That won't be necessary.
	              (pretending to be
	               resigned)
	          Sooner or later I knew you'd crack
	          this thing, Max.  You got me.
	
	                    MAX
	          I do?
	              (recovering)
	          Sure I do.
	              (taking Viktor aside)
	          Can we speak off the record?  I'm a
	          fair man.  I'm willing to sit down
	          with her and tell her side of the
	          story.
	
	                    VIKTOR
	          I wouldn't want you to compromise
	          your ethics.
	
	                    MAX
	          No.  Thanks.  Absolutely.
	
	Viktor regards the newshound with a look of pity.
	
	                    VIKTOR
	          You love her, don't you, Max?
	
	                    MAX
	          Don't you?
	
	                    VIKTOR
	              (writes a check, hands it
	               to Max)
	          This should take care of Mother.
	
	Viktor drives into his home.  Max, very confused, stares at
	the old lady.
	
	EXT.  VIKTOR'S SOUNDSTAGE - DAY
	
	VIKTOR escorts LAINEY, blindfolded, around the corner of his
	soundstage.  He removes the blindfold.  From Lainey's point-
	of-view we see the sportscar Simone drove in "ETERNITY
	FOREVER" -- the car tied with a bow.
	
	                    VIKTOR
	          Happy birthday, Lainey.  Do you
	          like it?
	
	                    LAINEY
	              (taking in the car)
	          It's fantastic -- it's too much.
	
	                    VIKTOR
	          It's the car she drove in "Eternity
	          Forever".
	
	                    LAINEY
	          I know.  Thank her for me.
	
	                    VIKTOR
	              (disappointed by her
	               reaction)
	          It's from both of us.  Of course
	          you'll have to drive it around the
	          lot until you get your permit --
	
	Lainey averts her gaze.
	
	                    LAINEY
	          -- I can't accept it.  I don't want
	          a car, Dad.
	
	                    VIKTOR
	              (clearly hurt, not
	               understanding)
	          Why not?  I can get you something
	          else.  What do you want?
	
	                    LAINEY
	          The old Viktor Taransky.
	              (finally blurting it out)
	          I liked you better before -- before
	          all this.  You were a loser, Dad,
	          but at least you had integrity.  I
	          can't stand to see you like this --
	          clinging to Simone's coattails --
	          it used to be about the work, and
	          now it's all about her.  And then
	          she's not even grateful enough to
	          thank you.
	
	                    VIKTOR
	          No, that was me.
	
	                    LAINEY
	          There you go again, blaming
	          yourself.  Can't you see what she's
	          done to you -- she's taking
	          advantage, mocking you.  You
	          deserve better than Simone.
	              (hasty exit)
	          I've got to go, Dad.
	
	                    VIKTOR
	          Lainey...
	
	Viktor watches Lainey depart towards the studio gates.
	
	INT.  SIMONE & VIKTOR'S OFFICE - DAY
	
	VIKTOR leans on his desk, still reflecting on LAINEY's
	remarks.  JANE enters.
	
	                    JANE
	          Ready for your casting session?
	
	Viktor nods distractedly.  Jane shows in NICOLA ANDERS.
	
	                    JANE
	          Nicola's here for the role of
	          Simone's sister.
	
	Viktor offers Nicola a seat, staring at her as if he has
	never truly looked at her before -- she has a quality of
	Simone.
	
	                    NICOLA
	              (slightly uncomfortable by
	               Viktor's scrutiny)
	          A lot's happened since we last saw
	          each other.
	
	                    VIKTOR
	              (numb)
	          Yes.
	
	                    NICOLA
	          I never apologized properly for
	          what happened on "Sunrise".
	
	She hands Viktor a peace offering -- a large jar of Mike &
	Ike candy, including cherry.
	
	                    VIKTOR
	          Thank you.  It's not important.
	
	                    NICOLA
	          After I saw what Simone did with
	          the role -- you know I fired all my
	          people, went into rehab, took
	          acting classes, changed my whole
	          look.  She really inspired me.
	
	Viktor continues to stare.
	
	                    NICOLA
	              (referring to the script
	               in her hands)
	          Would you like me to read?
	
	                    VIKTOR
	          Yes, I'd like that.
	
	Nicola glances at the script a last time and puts it down. 
	She approaches Viktor, standing close to him, playing the
	scene to him -- an immediate intimacy.
	
	                    NICOLA
	              (her angry words are in
	               opposition to her amorous
	               actions)
	          -- Who do you think you are, Carlos
	          -- coming in here like this?  With
	          my husband sleeping in the next
	          room.  Do you think I won't call
	          out?  Do you think I will just give
	          in to you without a fight -- like
	          the last time and the time before
	          that?
	              (she kisses his ear)
	          I wish you were dead.
	              (she kisses his lips)
	          I wish we were both dead.
	
	Nicola immediately breaks character.
	
	Viktor is mesmerized -- he has fallen back in love with
	flesh.
	
	                    VIKTOR
	              (finally able to speak)
	          You know you're really very good. 
	          I take back what I said.  I mean,
	          you're really good.
	
	                    NICOLA
	          Thank you.
	
	                    VIKTOR
	              (forgetting himself)
	          You could play the lead.
	
	                    NICOLA
	              (confused)
	          But that's Simone's part.
	
	                    VIKTOR
	          Yes, of course it is.
	              (gazing at her face)
	          You know you have a line here.  Not
	          a wrinkle.  Actually, more of a
	          dimple.  I've been thinking of
	          incorporating something like that
	          in Simone.
	
	                    NICOLA
	              (incredulous)
	          You'd cosmetically alter Simone to
	          look like me?
	
	                    VIKTOR
	          No, of course not, you're right. 
	          That would be crazy.
	
	Viktor sits back down and stares out of the window.
	
	                    NICOLA
	          Do you want me to do it again?
	
	Viktor does not reply.  Nicola quietly leaves.
	
	INT.  ELAINE'S MANSION - DAY
	
	The front page of "Variety" is dominated by a large
	photograph of SIMONE giving her acceptance speech via
	satellite.  However, ELAINE is gazing at a small inset
	picture of VIKTOR, HERSELF and LAINEY arriving at the Oscar
	Ceremony.
	
	Elaine tears out the photo and slips it into her purse.
	
	EXT.  SWIMMING POOL - DAY (ON VIKTOR'S SCREEN)
	
	Old home video of ELAINE.  She is in a garden by a swimming
	pool, laughing, waving and sweetly flirting with the camera. 
	Elaine raises her skirt teasingly, winks, gestures the camera
	operator towards her with a beckoning finger, finally blows a
	kiss to the camera.
	
	INT.  VIKTOR'S SOUNDSTAGE - DAY
	
	While the ever-seductive SIMONE waits patiently on-screen for
	Viktor's instructions, VIKTOR is gazing at the smaller
	monitor -- the home video of ELAINE.
	
	Viktor freezes the tape.  Elaine appears particularly
	beautiful.
	
	Viktor electronically cuts out Elaine's mannerism and morphs
	it into Simone.  Now Simone blows the kiss and has the same
	dazzling smile.
	
	INT.  SIMONE & VIKTOR'S OFFICE - DAY
	
	At her desk, JANE is busy trying to mimic Simone's hairstyle
	as she talks on the phone.
	
	                    JANE
	              (into phone)
	          -- Oh sure, she comes in all the
	          time... we've become close.  She
	          told me --
	
	VIKTOR enters the office.
	
	                    VIKTOR
	          Jane --
	
	Jane hurriedly hangs up.
	
	                    JANE
	          Gotta go.
	
	                    VIKTOR
	              (picking up a pile of
	               scripts from the in-tray)
	          I'm leaving early tonight.  If you
	          need me I'll be at the beach house
	          having dinner with a... certain
	          someone.
	
	Jane tries to conceal her interest.  As soon as Viktor exits
	the office, JANE picks up the phone.
	
	                    JANE
	              (into phone, under her
	               breath)
	          ... Elaine Christian please.
	
	We reveal VIKTOR, outside the door, eavesdropping on his
	assistant, pleased she has taken the bait.
	
	INT.  VIKTOR'S BEACH HOUSE - NIGHT
	
	VIKTOR dims the lights, plays "mood" music.  The doorbell
	rings.
	
	He checks himself in the mirror.  In the reflection, he spies
	an autographed photo of HIMSELF with his arm around SIMONE. 
	He hurriedly hides the photo and answers the door.
	
	ELAINE stands there.
	
	                    ELAINE
	          Viktor, I'm picking up Lainey.
	
	Elaine is over-dressed for her supposed errand.
	
	                    VIKTOR
	          Elaine, it's Wednesday.
	
	                    ELAINE
	              (feigning absent
	               mindedness)
	          Is it Wednesday?  It's Wednesday. 
	          How embarrassing.  I don't know
	          what I was thinking.  With all the
	          excitement lately...
	              (peering past him)
	          Am I interrupting something?  Are
	          you expecting company?
	
	                    VIKTOR
	              (ushering her inside)
	          As a matter-of-fact I am.
	
	                    ELAINE
	          When is she coming over?
	
	                    VIKTOR
	              (glancing to his watch)
	          About now.  Would you like a drink?
	
	                    ELAINE
	          I suppose I could stay, just until
	          she arrives.
	
	Elaine takes a seat on the sofa.  Viktor hands her a glass of
	wine and sits beside her -- close.
	
	They both knock back their wine in one long gulp, both
	apparently in need of courage.
	
	                    ELAINE
	              (trying to make
	               conversation)
	          Is Simone back to earth yet?
	
	                    VIKTOR
	          Not quite.
	
	                    ELAINE
	          I'm sure you'll keep her focussed. 
	          She's lucky to have you, Viktor.
	              (blurting out)
	          Is she really having your baby?
	
	                    VIKTOR
	          Impossible.
	
	                    ELAINE
	              (instantly regretting the
	               remark)
	          I just read somewhere --
	
	                    VIKTOR
	          I know.  I know.  They'll say
	          anything.
	
	                    ELAINE
	          -- And she was positively glowing
	          at the awards.
	              (making to leave)
	          I should be going, she'll be here
	          soon --
	
	Viktor puts his finger to her lips to hush her.
	
	                    VIKTOR
	          -- She already is.  Simone's not
	          coming over, Elaine.  Not tonight,
	          not ever.
	              (holding her)
	          I want you back, Elaine.
	
	                    ELAINE
	              (melting)
	          I want you back too, Viktor.
	
	They kiss.  Elaine breaks the kiss, suddenly consumed with
	doubt.
	
	                    ELAINE
	          This is crazy.  Who am I fooling? 
	          I can't compete with Simone.  What
	          woman can?
	
	                    VIKTOR
	          I would rather have you than
	          Simone.  Believe me.
	
	                    ELAINE
	          That's sweet, Viktor, but I
	          couldn't let you do that -- make
	          that kind of sacrifice.
	              (meeting his gaze)
	          It's strange.  I've stabbed people
	          in the back, clawed and slept my
	          way to where I am -- it goes with
	          the territory -- but, for some
	          reason, I can't betray Simone. 
	          There's... I don't know any other
	          way to say it -- there's a goodness
	          to her.
	
	                    VIKTOR
	          No, there isn't.  There's nothing
	          to her.
	
	                    ELAINE
	          Oh, Viktor.  You say that now --
	          because we're here, alone, like
	          this.  But in the morning, you'd go
	          back to her.  What man wouldn't?
	
	                    VIKTOR
	          No, I will end my relationship with
	          her -- totally.
	
	                    ELAINE
	          But you don't understand.  She'll
	          always be there -- at some party,
	          on some magazine cover, some song
	          on the radio, up on some screen.
	
	                    VIKTOR
	              (desperate)
	          No.  She'll never work again --
	          retire, never make a movie or a
	          record, or appear ever again.
	
	                    ELAINE
	              (confused)
	          Of course she will.  Her public
	          will demand it.
	
	                    VIKTOR
	          Not if I don't let her.
	
	                    ELAINE
	          You?
	
	Viktor knocks back another glass of wine for courage.
	
	                    VIKTOR
	          I'm going to tell you a secret now,
	          Elaine.
	              (mustering all his nerve)
	          Simone is not a real person.  I
	          invented her.
	
	                    ELAINE
	              (misinterpreting his
	               remark)
	          Every actor is an invention,
	          Viktor.  Don't embarrass yourself. 
	          No one's denying that you
	          discovered Simone.  But it's like
	          finding a diamond in the desert. 
	          Anyone can trip over it, but it's
	          not the finder who sparkles.
	
	                    VIKTOR
	              (agitated)
	          -- No, no, I didn't trip over her. 
	          You don't understand --
	
	                    ELAINE
	              (ignoring him)
	          -- You just got lucky that she's
	          loyal enough to stay with you. 
	          Maybe she's staying out of pity,
	          who knows?  She certainly doesn't
	          need you.  Some people even say
	          you're holding her back.
	
	                    VIKTOR
	              (wounded)
	          Who says that -- ?
	              (shaking off the insult)
	          -- Never mind.  You have to listen
	          to me, Elaine.  Simone is thin air,
	          pixels, molded by me from a
	          mathematical equation.  I inherited
	          it from a madman -- I can show
	          you --
	
	                    ELAINE
	          How much wine have you had?
	
	                    VIKTOR
	          -- She's a figment of my own
	          imagination.  I, Viktor Taransky,
	          have perpetrated the greatest hoax,
	          the greatest sleight-of-hand,
	          sleight-of-mouth, sleight-of-
	          sleight in entertainment history!
	          And still no one appreciates me,
	          recognizes what I've done -- even
	          you.
	
	                    ELAINE
	              (rolling her eyes)
	          You're drunker than I thought.  Are
	          you doing that again?
	
	                    VIKTOR
	          No!  Whatever talent Simone has
	          comes from me -- me!  Me!  I swear,
	          as God is my judge.  You don't know
	          what I've been through.  Tens of
	          thousands of mind-numbing hours in
	          front of that screen, nights
	          without end, and look what it's
	          cost me.
	              (producing his spectacles)
	          Why do you think I've been wearing
	          these?  I may have done irreparable
	          harm to my eyesight, and why?  To
	          extract and refine the infinite
	          nuances of a human being -- a human
	          soul.
	              (a final explanation)
	          Don't you see?  I made Simone!
	
	A pause.  His words hang in the air.
	
	                    ELAINE
	          You made Simone?
	              (a trace of pity)
	          Viktor, she made you.
	
	Elaine gets up and walks out, leaving the distraught Viktor
	alone in his house.
	
	INT.  VIKTOR'S OFFICE - DAY
	
	A hung-over VIKTOR enters his office.  Suddenly, he stops and
	confronts the standee of SIMONE.
	
	                    VIKTOR
	          You bitch!  I'll destroy you!
	
	JANE stares in shock.  She discreetly exits.
	
	INT.  VIKTOR'S SOUNDSTAGE - DAY
	
	VIKTOR sits in front of his monitor, smiling venomously at
	SIMONE.  He begins to digitally disrobe Simone.
	
	MONTAGE:
	
	A)  Peering through a gap in the drapes of his Malibu house,
	    VIKTOR watches MAX dig through his trash.  Max finds a
	    beat up reel of 16mm film.
	
	    MAX holds the end up to the light -- his eyes pop.
	
	B)  The ECHO headline screams, "SIMONE'S HARD CORE PAST" and
	    shows censored film frames of a naked Simone in a
	    compromising position.
	
	    VIKTOR, hovering at a supermarket check-out line,
	    overhears two WOMEN discussing the article.
	
	                    WOMAN 1
	          Disgusting...
	
	                    WOMAN 2
	              (sympathetic)
	          She must have been so desperate to
	          do something like that, so
	          depraved.
	
	                    WOMAN 1
	          I'm still naming my baby after her.
	
	                    WOMAN 2
	          You're having a boy.
	
	                    WOMAN 1
	          So?
	
	    Viktor blanches.  It is not the reaction he'd hoped for.
	
	C)  Inside a theater, VIKTOR hovers by the door, smirking.
	
	    ON SCREEN, we hear a farmyard scene -- SIMONE in an empty
	    farmyard on all fours, grunting like a pig, and foraging
	    for muddy vegetables.
	
	    The AUDIENCE is shocked, then suddenly breaks into
	    spontaneous applause.
	
	    Viktor, enraged, exits into the lobby past the poster for
	    "I AM PIG - Starring Simone".
	
	D)  A pretentious FILM CRITIC talks to camera, a film poster
	    behind him.
	
	                    FILM CRITIC
	          For Simone to do something as brave
	          as "I AM PIG" at this point in her
	          career, with so much to lose -- all
	          I can say is, "I Am Pig, I Am
	          Oscar".
	
	E)  In his soundstage, VIKTOR moves a slider that adds
	    wrinkles to Simone.
	
	F)  SIMONE appears on a morning talk show -- as usual, remote
	    on a TV screen.  However, her squeaky-clean image has
	    gone -- hair unkempt, bloated, chain-smoking and drinking
	    during the interview.  The HOSTS are smiling weakly.
	
	                    HOST
	          Simone, that's a rather
	          controversial position.
	
	                    SIMONE
	          I just think all elementary schools
	          should have a firing range -- so
	          students can learn how to defend
	          themselves.  We could fit it
	          inbetween recess and American
	          History.
	
	Another clip:
	
	                    SIMONE
	          If there's a hole in the ozone
	          layer why can't I see it?
	
	Another clip:
	
	                    SIMONE
	          Immigration?!  God, isn't it
	          crowded enough?!
	
	                    HOSTS
	          Just as we always knew.  Simone's
	          not like other celebrities.  She
	          speaks her mind!
	
	G)  VIKTOR driving along a city street, suddenly slams on his
	    brakes, almost causing an accident.  He stares numbly up
	    at a twenty-foot high smiling photo of Simone on a
	    billboard featuring a huge cover of TIME MAGAZINE.  It
	    reads, "SIMONE: WOMAN OF THE YEAR".
	
	                    VIKTOR
	              (to himself)
	          She's trying to kill me.
	
	Realizing what he's said, a thought comes into his eyes.
	
	EXT.  CEMETERY - DAY
	
	An inscription on a headstone reads:
	
	                         HANK ALENO
	                Remembered Virtually Forever
	
	VIKTOR kneels at HANK's grave.  He places a bunch of flowers
	there.
	
	                    VIKTOR
	              (referring to the flowers)
	          They're plastic, Hank.  I know
	          that's the way you'd want it.
	              (glancing to a Simone
	               billboard outside the
	               cemetery wall)
	          She killed you, Hank.  Now she's
	          killing me.  She's a serial killer.
	              (ducking out of sight of
	               the billboard as if
	               Simone is watching him)
	          But I don't know how to stop her. 
	          She's taken on a life of her own. 
	          I can't just come clean -- make
	          some confession.  I've defrauded
	          millions -- they'd turn on me.  And
	          I can't put the genie back in the
	          bottle.  If she stopped working --
	          dropped out of sight, they'd never
	          let it rest.  I've tried to kill
	          her career but they like her even
	          more.
	              (more desperate)
	          What am I going to do, Hank?
	
	A thought occurs to Viktor.  He slowly rises from behind
	Hank's headstone, revealing a forest of headstones.
	
	                    VIKTOR
	          Don't say another word, Hank.  You
	          are truly a genius.
	
	INT.  VIKTOR'S SOUNDSTAGE - DUSK
	
	A sad but resolute VIKTOR sits in front of his monitor,
	SIMONE's face full screen.
	
	He speaks into the voice synthesizer, Simone's face
	automatically speaking the words he speaks -- the final time
	he puts his words in her mouth.
	
	                    SIMONE / VIKTOR
	          What's the matter, Viktor?  You
	          look so sad.  Don't you love me
	          anymore?... It's over, isn't it?
	
	He switches off the synthesizer and speaks in his own voice.
	
	                    VIKTOR
	          It's the only way, Simone.  If it's
	          any consolation, you're going to
	          live on in the public's heart like
	          all the other tragic figures that
	          went before their time.  There's no
	          love like posthumous love.
	
	On the screen, Simone is on the verge of tears.
	
	                    VIKTOR
	          I know what you're thinking.  It's
	          a phoney-baloney world.  The women
	          are surgically enhanced, the
	          athletes are on steroids, the
	          singers are lip-syncing if they're
	          even singing at all, the news is
	          entertainment, the politicians are
	          bought and paid for -- we're living
	          one big lie.  So why shouldn't you
	          live too?  You're more authentic
	          than the people who adore you.
	              (a trace of despair)
	          And that's the problem.  You're
	          looking at the real fraud.  I told
	          myself this was all about the work
	          but if that was the truth, it
	          wouldn't matter to me -- and it
	          does.  It wasn't that the artists
	          had no respect for the art.  They
	          had no respect for me.  Someone
	          like you, you have so much love
	          showered on you -- I just wanted to
	          feel one tiny drop on my face.  I'm
	          sorry, Simone.  Here I've been
	          trying to convince the world that
	          you exist, but I was really trying
	          to convince them that I exist. 
	          It's not that you aren't human,
	          Simone, it's that I am.
	
	Viktor produces a disc from his jacket marked, "PLAGUE - Ver.
	8.1".  He places the disc in the machine.
	
	Viktor sees that Simone is crying.  He touches a tear on his
	own face and realizes her tears are in response to his own.
	
	Viktor hesitates -- a moment of doubt -- then presses
	"ENTER".  The image of SIMONE's face gradually begins to
	deconstruct -- pixel by pixel -- as the virus takes hold. 
	The pixels collect into a pile at the bottom of his screen
	like dust.  Finally, the dust is blown away in a single
	digital breath.
	
	For a moment his attention is taken with a layer of dust on
	his own desk.
	
	Viktor regards his own reflection in the now black screen. 
	His hard-drive now corrupted, he picks up his original disc
	marked, "SIMULATION ONE".
	
	He tosses this disc into a steamer trunk he has loaded with
	hundreds of discs relating to Simone's software.  He shuts
	the lid and begins dragging the trunk towards the door.
	
	EXT.  SANTA MONICA BAY - DUSK
	
	Viktor's yacht sits at anchor in the glassy waters of Santa
	Monica Bay -- "SIMONE" written on the stern.
	
	VIKTOR manhandles the trunk to the railing.  A mournful pause
	-- then he heaves it over the side.  The trunk sinks like a
	stone.
	
	Heart heavy, Viktor stares into the inky depths.
	
	EXT.  STUDIO - ENTRANCE - DAY
	
	A throng of REPORTERS and CAMERA CREWS.  A somber VIKTOR
	enters and takes a seat in front of a forest of microphones.
	
	                    VIKTOR
	          It is my sad and solemn duty to
	          announce the tragic passing of
	          Simone.
	
	A gasp from the audience.  Then, an explosion of anguish.
	
	                    CROWD
	          No!!  What happened?!  Oh.  God.
	
	                    PRESS REPORTER 1
	              (stepping forward,
	               mustering the courage to
	               ask the question)
	          How did she die?
	
	                    VIKTOR
	          A rare virus.
	              (pretending to compose
	               himself)
	          On her goodwill tour of the third
	          world.
	
	                    PRESS REPORTER 2
	          Did she suffer?
	
	                    VIKTOR
	          Mercifully, it was quick.
	
	At the back of the room are MAX SAYER and MILTON.  They are
	frozen in grief, a tear spills from Max's eye.
	
	A MONTAGE OF SCENES:
	
	A)  "SIMON GONE - FADE TO BLACK", reads the cover of Variety.
	
	B)  The announcement of her death appears on local TV news
	    shows around the globe.
	
	C)  A carpet of bouquets and notes of commiseration several
	    yards wide completely surrounds Viktor's property
	    including the driveway.  VIKTOR insensitively drives over
	    the bouquets to the horror of the MOURNERS, including MAX
	    SAYER and MILTON.
	
	D)  In a remote Mongolian encampment MONGOL HORSEMEN crowd
	    around a television showing a live picture of Simone's
	    funeral.
	
	E)  The HEARSE carrying Simone's "body" and the funeral
	    procession led solemnly by VIKTOR, proceeds through the
	    studio lot.  Distraught STUDIO STAFF toss flowers onto
	    the hearse.
	
	F)  The same television picture is playing on a television
	    sitting on a stool in a WEST AFRICAN river.  LOCAL WOMEN
	    stop washing their clothes to watch.
	
	EXT.  GRAVESIDE - CEMETERY - DAY
	
	We tilt up from Hank's headstone to an ornate mausoleum on an
	island in a lake.
	
	Simone's coffin is ferried across a bridge by PALLBEARERS
	from the studio.  Numerous MOURNERS follow behind.
	
	VIKTOR, ELAINE and a curiously dry-eyed LAINEY walk behind
	the coffin.
	
	                    VIKTOR
	              (to Elaine)
	          Can I see you later -- go away for
	          the weekend?
	
	                    ELAINE
	              (horrified by the
	               suggestion)
	          How can you bring that up at a time
	          like this?
	
	The coffin reaches the steps of the marble mausoleum.  A
	PRIEST, RABBI, and a BUDDHIST MONK turn to Viktor.  He nods
	and they start to carry the coffin towards the door. 
	However, the coffin is suddenly stopped by a POLICE OFFICER.
	
	A SECOND POLICE OFFICER begins to jimmy open the lid.  The
	coffin lid is pulled back.  Inside is a life-sized cardboard
	standee of Simone from "ETERNITY FOREVER".
	
	The MOURNERS gasp.  Everyone looks to Viktor.
	
	INT.  L.A. COUNTY JAIL - INTERVIEW ROOM - DAY
	
	A SERIES OF POLICE INTERVIEWS:
	
	JANE sits in the interview room, describing Viktor's assault
	on the standee.
	
	                    JANE
	          -- I heard him say, "Die bitch".
	
	A)  MAX SAYER, distraught and weeping.
	
	                    MAX
	          -- He was a controlling madman, she
	          was a prisoner.  I blame myself...
	          I should have done more to stop
	          it...
	
	B)  NICOLA gives a statement.
	
	                    NICOLA
	          -- It was strange.  He wanted to
	          replace her with me in his new
	          movie... and I know I'm not that
	          good.
	
	INT.  L.A. COUNTY JAIL - INTERROGATION ROOM - DAY
	
	VIKTOR sits in an interrogation room in a sea of SIMONE. 
	Magazine covers, cosmetics advertisements, publicity shots,
	interviews, website print-outs, photographs and report cards
	from her fictitious childhood are plastered on the walls,
	stacks of film cans and tapes of her numerous movie and
	television appearances.
	
	                    DETECTIVE
	          -- Forgive me, Mr. Taransky.  I'm
	          just trying to understand.  All
	          these films, TV appearances,
	          magazine covers, internet
	          interviews, publicity photos,
	          snapshots from her childhood -- all
	          fake.
	              (referring to various
	               items)
	          This is fake, this is fake -- fake,
	          fake, fake, all fake.
	
	                    VIKTOR
	          That's right.  You understand
	          perfectly.  I will confess to
	          fraud, not murder.
	
	                    DETECTIVE
	              (referring to oversize
	               mail bags)
	          A fan club with a worldwide
	          membership in the millions -- also
	          bogus?
	
	                    VIKTOR
	          Oh, no.  The fan club is real.  But
	          they were worshipping computer code
	          -- ones and zeros.
	
	                    DETECTIVE
	          So, of course, you couldn't kill
	          Simone because there never was a
	          Simone.
	
	                    VIKTOR
	          Of course.
	
	                    DETECTIVE
	          And this Mr. Hank Aleno who you
	          talk so much about, a renowned
	          failure, who also happens to be so
	          conveniently dead -- perhaps the
	          "man" you claim helped invent
	          Simone is an invention himself?
	
	Viktor, sensing his sarcasm, does not reply.
	
	                    DETECTIVE
	              (patronizing smile)
	          But not everyone's imaginary, are
	          they, Mr. Taransky?  I refer, of
	          course, to Edith.
	
	                    VIKTOR
	          Who?
	
	The Detective raises a window-blind to reveal a next door
	room where the OLD WOMAN from the rest home is being
	interviewed.
	
	                    DETECTIVE
	          The woman you admitted to a
	          journalist is Simone's mother and
	          for whose silence you paid a
	          fortune?  Is she not flesh to you --
	          are her tears not wet?
	
	The OLD WOMAN glances up and sees all the photos of Simone
	through the window.
	
	                    OLD LADY
	          My BABY!
	
	The Detective abruptly lowers the blind.  Viktor rolls his
	eyes at the Detective's theatrics.  He is suddenly enraged.
	
	                    VIKTOR
	          She's insane!  This whole thing is
	          insane!  There is no Simone.  Look!
	              (grabbing a Simone poster)
	          Even her name is fake.  It's not
	          Simone.
	              (he tears Simone's name in
	               half to demonstrate)
	          It's SIM... ONE!  Simulation One!
	
	The Detectives sadly shake their heads.
	
	                    DETECTIVE 2
	              (regarding Simone's face
	               also torn in half)
	          You really hated her, didn't you?
	
	The Detective places a tape, marked "EXHIBIT A" in a video
	machine.
	
	                    DETECTIVE
	          Perhaps you could explain this to
	          me, Mr. Taransky -- or is this tape
	          "doctored" too?
	
	He plays a tape showing --
	
	EXT.  MARINA PIER - NIGHT (ON TV SCREEN)
	
	VIKTOR dragging his trunk from his car down the pier to his
	yacht.
	
	                    DETECTIVE
	          It's footage from the marina's
	          closed-circuit camera on the night
	          in question.  Altered, of course. 
	          Is that really what you expect us
	          to believe, Mr. Taransky?
	
	The Detective freezes the tape.
	
	                    DETECTIVE
	          Can you tell us why you were
	          disposing of the body of a woman
	          who didn't exist?
	
	                    VIKTOR
	          It wasn't her body.  It was her
	          body of work.
	
	                    DETECTIVE
	          Why don't you just come clean,
	          Viktor?  Tell the truth.  You'll
	          feel better afterwards.
	
	                    VIKTOR
	          I am telling the truth.
	
	                    DETECTIVE
	              (coming close to him)
	          We all know what happened.  In a
	          fit of jealous rage you killed
	          Simone and dumped her body off a
	          boat she bought for you.
	
	                    VIKTOR
	          No!!  I can prove it to you.  I'll
	          take you to her.
	
	EXT.  BOAT - SANTA MONICA BAY - DAY
	
	VIKTOR sits handcuffed on a POLICE BOAT with the DETECTIVE
	and his LAWYER.  DIVERS surface with the steamer trunk. 
	Viktor's face lights up.
	
	The trunk is winched aboard.  However, as it lowers onto the
	deck, we see the latch has broken and the lid is ajar.  All
	eyes stare inside the trunk as the lid is lifted.  Apart from
	a scrawny piece of kelp -- empty.
	
	                    VIKTOR
	              (panicky, desperately
	               grabbing the divers)
	          Did you find anything else --
	          drivers, discs... disc-drives?
	
	                    DIVER 1
	          Nothing.
	              (gazing to the water)
	          We couldn't stay down any longer.
	
	All eyes follow the diver's gaze to several SHARK FINS in the
	water.
	
	CLOSE UP ON FRONT PAGE OF L.A. TIMES:
	
	           "SIMONE"S BODY FEARED EATEN BY SHARKS"
	
	The newspaper is being read by Viktor's LAWYER, sitting
	opposite Viktor in his cell.  VIKTOR is numb -- the
	likelihood of conviction slowly dawning on him.
	
	                    LAWYER
	          -- Plead guilty and throw yourself
	          on the mercy of the court.  It's
	          the best deal you're going to get.
	
	                    VIKTOR
	              (incredulous)
	          I could get the death penalty.
	
	                    LAWYER
	          You certainly will if you go to
	          trial -- a jury in this kind of
	          ugly mood.  You've killed an icon,
	          for God's sake.
	
	                    VIKTOR
	          I didn't kill anyone, Bernard,
	          there was no one to kill!
	
	                    LAWYER
	              (musing)
	          An insanity defence.
	
	INT.  VIKTOR'S SOUNDSTAGE - NIGHT
	
	A FIGURE sits at Viktor's computer.  LAINEY.  She scrolls
	through Viktor's files.  All empty.
	
	Lainey sighs.  ELAINE paces behind her.
	
	                    ELAINE
	          Let's go, Lainey.  There's nothing
	          here.
	
	                    LAINEY
	          Just a minute.
	
	Elaine continues to pace as Lainey works.
	
	                    ELAINE
	          God, it's so like your father.  Why
	          can't people take responsibility
	          for their actions anymore?  I can
	          almost forgive him for killing
	          Simone -- but denying her
	          existence.  I can never forgive
	          that.
	
	                    LAINEY
	          Because obviously she existed,
	          right?
	
	                    ELAINE
	          I know it as surely as you're
	          sitting here, sweetheart.  She was
	          the most vital woman I ever met.
	
	                    LAINEY
	          So you did meet her?
	
	                    ELAINE
	          Of course.  What are you
	          suggesting?
	
	                    LAINEY
	          I mean really meet her -- in the
	          flesh.
	
	Elaine regards her daughter curiously.
	
	                    LAINEY
	          I know it's embarrassing to admit
	          it, mom, but when I think about it 
	          -- honestly, I haven't.  I mean, it
	          feels like I have.  I know more
	          about her than members of my own
	          family.  She's even in my dreams. 
	          But I realized, going back through
	          my diary, they were all TV
	          appearances, near misses at
	          parties, second-hand rumor, gossip
	          on the internet.  I've never
	          actually seen Simone up close,
	          touched her, been in her physical
	          presence.  Have you?
	
	                    ELAINE
	              (unable to refute it)
	          Well, I --
	
	                    LAINEY
	          -- We don't believe daddy because
	          we don't want to believe we were
	          taken in too.
	
	                    ELAINE
	              (trying to shake the
	               notion from her head)
	          Lainey, there's no evidence that
	          Simone isn't real.
	
	                    LAINEY
	          Listen to what you're saying, mom. 
	          Is there any evidence she is?
	
	Lainey finally tries another file.  She presses "EJECT".  The
	"PLAGUE" disc spits out of the machine.
	
	                    LAINEY
	              (regarding the disc)
	          There's one part of dad's story
	          that may have been true.  Simone
	          may have contracted a virus.
	
	Lainey smiles at her mother.
	
	                    LAINEY
	          Certain viruses can be cured.
	
	INT.  L.A. COUNTY JAIL - POLICE CELL - DAY
	
	VIKTOR sits in his cell, arms crossed, quietly seething,
	while his LAWYER lays out his trial strategy.
	
	                    LAWYER
	              (hushed tones, referring
	               to a thick Psychiatric
	               Report)
	          ... Listen, I've found a
	          psychiatrist in Ventura -- well
	          respected -- who's willing to
	          testify under oath that you have
	          diminished capacity due to the
	          trauma of your divorce, ten years
	          of abject failure in the movie
	          business and a bump on the head you
	          sustained as a child --
	
	VIKTOR, fuming throughout this, suddenly explodes.
	
	                    VIKTOR
	          -- No!  I can't go along with this
	          horseshit!  Just tell them they can
	          fry me!
	
	                    LAWYER
	              (aghast, looking around to
	               see if anyone has heard)
	          What?!
	
	                    VIKTOR
	          It was premeditated -- I knew
	          exactly what I was doing!  I
	          strangled her!  I bludgeoned her! 
	          I set her on fire!  I did it!  I
	          killed her!
	
	                    DETECTIVE (O.S.)
	              (clearing his throat)
	          Excuse me.
	
	The Lawyer spins around guiltily.  The Detective stands
	outside the cell, clearly overhearing the confession. 
	Viktor, resigned to his fate, couldn't care less.
	
	                    DETECTIVE
	          I think you'd better see this.
	
	The Detective switches on the TV set hanging outside the
	cell.  VBC is playing -- "BREAKING NEWS" --
	
	INT.  TELEVISION STUDIO - "VBC" - DAY (ON TV SCREEN)
	
	A NEWS ANCHOR appears.
	
	                    VBC ANCHOR
	              (from TV)
	          -- Breaking news -- international
	          media star, Simone, is alive and
	          well.  Her studio released this
	          footage only minutes ago...
	
	EXT.  STUDIO LOT - DAY (ON TV SCREEN)
	
	The brief clip shows the front page of the L.A. Times --
	headlines: "HOLLYWOOD SUSPENDS FILMING IN MEMORY OF SIMONE"
	and "D.A. Seeks Death Penalty for Taransky".
	
	The reader lowers the newspaper to reveal herself -- SIMONE,
	on the studio lot, looking more beautiful than ever.  She
	winks to the camera.
	
	                    VBC ANCHOR
	          ... Simone reading today's edition
	          of the L.A. Times.  Who says, "The
	          only bad publicity is your
	          obituary"?  Details at the top of
	          the hour.
	
	The TV is switched off.  Viktor stares at the screen, trying
	to take it in.
	
	                    VIKTOR
	          You're indestructible.
	
	When he looks back to the Detective, he discovers him holding
	the cell door open.
	
	                    DETECTIVE
	              (shaking his head in pity)
	          I'll never get you Hollywood
	          people.
	
	EXT.  L.A. COUNTY JAIL - DAY
	
	A throng of REPORTERS, PAPARAZZI and ONLOOKERS parts like a
	sea for VIKTOR, released from custody.  One placard reads,
	"ASK JESUS TO SAVE YOU NOW".  He is escorted to a waiting
	limousine where he is met by ELAINE and LAINEY.  He hugs them
	both.
	
	INT.  LIMOUSINE - DAY
	
	VIKTOR sits beside ELAINE.  LAINEY sits opposite, studying
	her laptop computer.  Outside the car, REPORTERS are pressed
	against the glass.
	
	                    VIKTOR
	              (relaxing back into his
	               seat)
	          Thank you!
	              (to Lainey)
	          I don't know how you did it but
	          thank you.
	
	                    ELAINE
	              (putting her arm around
	               him)
	          Don't thank us too fast, Viktor. 
	          You know what we have to do?
	
	                    VIKTOR
	              (resigned smile)
	          Why stop at one character when you
	          can have a whole cast?
	
	                    ELAINE
	          Exactly.  Now that you have the
	          studio behind you, we can really do
	          things.
	
	Viktor shrugs resignedly, savoring his freedom.
	
	                    ELAINE
	              (holding Viktor close)
	          I was thinking -- what about you
	          and... "Simone" moving back in with
	          me and Lainey?
	
	                    VIKTOR
	              (meeting her gaze)
	          That sounds wonderful.
	              (to Lainey)
	          How do you feel about all this,
	          Lainey?
	
	                    LAINEY
	              (beaming)
	          About you and mom?
	
	                    VIKTOR
	              (reluctant admission)
	          Me and Simone.  What I did.
	
	                    LAINEY
	              (sweet smile)
	          Your mistake wasn't making
	          something fake, daddy.  We're fine
	          with fake -- as long as you don't
	          lie about it.
	
	Once again his daughter's words have a ghastly ring of truth. 
	Viktor stares out of the limo window as the car gradually
	forces its way through the reporters.
	
	He recognizes MAX and MILTON amongst the mob.  Max has
	hastily scribbled a note that he presses against the
	window --
	
	"WILL PAY $ FOR EXCLUSIVE".  Viktor looks away.
	
	                    ELAINE
	              (kissing him on the cheek)
	          Don't look so glum, Viktor.  It's
	          not a death sentence.
	
	                    VIKTOR
	              (still staring out of the
	               window, a rueful smile)
	          No... it's life.
	
	INT.  FRANK BRAND TV STUDIO - DAY
	
	FRANK BRAND conducts a remote interview with SIMONE who
	appears as usual on a television monitor.
	
	                    FRANK BRAND
	          -- Simone, the question on
	          everyone's mind is simply... "why?"
	
	                    SIMONE
	          Frank, you know as well as I do,
	          living in a fish bowl, the
	          insatiable appetite of the media...
	
	Frank nods sympathetically.
	
	                    SIMONE
	          With everything that was going on
	          in my life, I just needed to drop
	          out of sight for a while -- I
	          needed time.  Viktor bought me that
	          time.  I owe him so much.
	
	                    FRANK BRAND
	          We all do.
	              (quickly returning to
	               Simone)
	          But now I understand you're eager
	          to get back to work -- and not the
	          kind of work that we're all
	          expecting.
	
	                    SIMONE
	              (smiles coyly)
	          That's true.  I can reveal that I
	          am considering a career in
	          politics.
	
	                    FRANK BRAND
	          And what may I ask brought this on?
	
	SIMONE holds up a beautiful BABY BOY to camera.
	
	                    SIMONE
	          I suppose this little man had
	          something to do with it.  Viktor
	          and I are both concerned about what
	          kind of world our new son, Chip, is
	          going to grow up in.
	              (turning lovingly to
	               Viktor)
	          Aren't you, Viktor?
	
	On Frank Brand's monitor, the camera pulls back to reveal
	VIKTOR, sitting on a sofa -- an idyllic domestic scene.
	
	                    VIKTOR
	              (turning lovingly to
	               Simone)
	          Yes.
	
	INT.  SOUNDSTAGE - DAY
	
	Only we see the set where the interview is being recorded. 
	VIKTOR is sitting on a sofa against a green screen in his

          INT. HIGH SCHOOL CLASSROOM - DAY
          
          CLOSEUP: A slender woman's hand writes on a chalkboard,
          in teacherly cursive.
          
          We PULL BACK to REVEAL STARLA GRANT, a stunningly beautiful
          Southern woman in her twenties, as she finishes writing
          out, "SURVIVAL OF THE FITTEST"
          
          Starla glances at the classroom of high school students.
          She is a demure woman, somewhat awkward in her speaking,
          but she has the rapt attention of all the boys in the
          class.
          
                                   STARLA
                     When Darwin said 'fittest,' he
                     didn't necessarily mean the
                     strongest or the most intelligent,
                     or any one trait -- he merely meant
                     those organisms most well-suited
                     to their environment.
          
          The boys in the class look her up and down as she speaks.
          KYLIE STRUTEMYER, a pretty student, notices a BOY beside
          her drawing Starla, only without her clothes. She hits
          him. He CHUCKLES.
          
                                   STARLA
                     We humans think we're more fit,
                     more evolved, because we're smarter.
                     But we're neophytes. We've been
                     around two million years, give or
                     take. The cockroach has been here
                     for 350 million. You tell me who's
                     the more successful species.
          
          A BOY raises his hand.
          
                                     STARLA
                     Will.
          
                                   WILL
                     How's all this go with how the
                     Bible says there ain't no dinosaurs?
          
          Some of the kids LAUGH at the boy.   Starla pauses, about
          to answer, when the BELL RINGS.
          
                                   STARLA
                     We'll tackle that tomorrow...
                     Everyone bring your boxing gloves.
          
          The kids start to leave.
          
                                                                   2.
          
          EXT. MAIN STREET - DAY
          
          Celebratory banners are strung over this street, including
          one that reads: "DEER SEASON STARTS TODAY!" We're in the
          center of Wheelsy, South Carolina, a moderately depressed
          small town. Today's a big day, as HUNTERS from far and
          near crowd the streets in their massive pickups.
          
          MEN spill in and out of a gun store buying loads of
          ammunition. OLD HUNTERS with faces like prunes stand
          outside Angell's Tavern getting drunk. A MAN WITH FEW
          TEETH has a dead deer strung out across the back of his
          truck, skinning the carcass, its innards spilling loose.
          
          JACK, an older, uptight man in fancy clothes, is driving
          through town in his big old Cadillac. He comes upon a
          hunter's truck, double-parked, jamming up traffic. Jack
          jams on his HORN.
          
                                  JACK
                    Get the fuck out of the way,
                    cocksucker!
          
          Jack turns to see a MOTHER and her two CHILDREN on the
          sidewalk, listening and staring in shock.
          
                                  MOTHER
                    Mornin', Mayor.
          
          Jack smiles, a bit embarrassed. Jack notices a group of
          HUNTERS on the sidewalk, looking and pointing at something
          up in the sky.
          
          He looks up to see a small meteor plummeting toward earth.
          
          
          EXT. HIGH SCHOOL - DAY
          
          Students file out of the open door for the day. Kylie,
          Starla's pretty student, is among them. She and her FRIEND
          are looking up at the falling meteor.
          
                                  KYLIE
                    Prolly go find it later, sell it
                    on eBay.
          
          
          EXT. HORSE RANCH - DAY
          
          A RANCHER with a cleft palate turns his head to see the
          meteor, much closer to him. It's rushing down toward the
          treetops of a nearby forest.
          
                                                                  3.
          
          INT. GRANT'S OFFICE - DAY
          
          A framed wedding photograph of a very young Starla and a
          large man is sitting on a desk. The photo TREMBLES
          LIGHTLY, with the impact of the meteor hitting the earth.
          
          GRANT GRANT, a large, indelicate man in his mid forties,
          notices the photos on his desk moving. He looks up from
          his desk and out his door, where there's a GLASS WORKSHOP.
          Two WORKERS are carrying a large pane of glass, looking
          relieved they didn't drop it.
          
                                  GRANT
                    Just a tremor, boys.
          
          Grant goes back to filling out the tags of file folders
          with a Sharpie.
          
          
          EXT. POLICE STATION - DAY
          
          Four cops -- BILL PARDY, the town's young,   relaxed, and
          handsome Chief of Police, WALLY, an older,   toad-like cop,
          TREVOR, a younger, somewhat goofy cop, and   MARGARET, a
          mannish cop -- are standing stock-still in   the station
          parking lot. They CHUCKLE.
          
                                  TREVOR
                    Did ya' feel that?!
          
          They enter the station.
          
          
          INT. POLICE STATION - DAY
          
          The four cops start to remove their holsters and so forth,
          finished for the day.
          
                                  TREVOR
                    I always get afraid when that
                    happens, 'cause what if the ground
                    cracks open and you fall inside?
                    It's so hot in there you get all
                    burnt to nothin' like that --
                          (snaps)
                    Happened to my uncle Barry.
          
          Wally and Bill LAUGH at him.
          
                                  WALLY
                    Who told you that story, Trevor?
          
                                    TREVOR
                    My aunt.
          
                                                                   4.
          
                                  BILL
                    Your uncle Barry left her for a
                    stripper up in Winnsboro.
          
          Trevor looks shocked, sad.
          
          SHELBY, a slightly dim dispatcher, on his headset at the
          police operator's unit, swirls toward them, alarmed.
          
                                 SHELBY
                    Chief! We got a 'mergency over at
                    the diner!
          
          
          INT. DINER - LATER
          
          The four cops move in.   There's a COMMOTION.   Most of the
          patrons are standing.
          
                                  WAITRESS
                    Back there, Bill!
          
          The Waitress nods back through the service window, into
          the kitchen, where a large DOE is hopping around. A
          DISHWASHER stands on the counter, YELPING with fear.
          
          
          INT. DINER KITCHEN - MOMENTS LATER
          
          Bill, Wally, Trevor, Margaret, and the Waitress enter.
          The doe skips around.
          
                                  WAITRESS
                    She slipped in, was eating trash.
                    We seen it on TV, how they kill
                    ya'--
          
                                   BILL
                    Right.
          
                                  WAITRESS
                    So we thought we best call in.
          
          Bill spots the open rear door, and tries to herd the deer
          toward it.
          
                                  BILL
                    Come on now, honey, door's this
                    way.
          
                                  MARGARET
                    It's open season. Let's shoot
                    her.
          
                                  BILL
                    She's just scared, Margaret.
          
                                                                 5.
          
                                  WALLY
                    Also, Bill likes to take a female
                    through the back door any chance
                    he gets.
          
          Wally and Margaret LAUGH. Trevor snatches a dish-towel
          and rushes the doe, using it like a cape. The scared doe
          leaps away from him, jumping onto the kitchen counter.
          
                                  BILL
                    She ain't a bull, Trevor!
          
          The animal kicks off a pot, which hits Margaret.
          
                                  MARGARET
                    Goddamn bambi-rat!
          
          As the doe jumps to the floor, she gets her hoof wrapped
          in a telephone cord.
          
          The cord is plugged into the wall, trapping the doe in
          place. Wally, Margaret, and Trevor attempt to dive for
          the cord, but can't avoid the doe's crazy, flying hooves.
          
                                  BILL
                    Get back.
          
          The other cops step away.   Bill steps slowly toward the
          doe, speaking calmly.
          
                                  BILL
                    It's okay, sweetheart.   Nobody's
                    gonna hurt you.
          
          The doe looks at him, settling a bit.   His voice seems to
          be soothing her. Bill gets closer.
          
                                  BILL
                    That's right. Just gonna pull
                    this cord out. It's gonna be all
                    right.
          
          The cops and restaurant folk look on in awe as the doe,
          breathing heavily, becomes still. Bill scoops close past
          her, and yanks the telephone cord out of the wall.
          
          Bill smiles. Then the doe runs forward, almost knocking
          Bill over, and streaks out the back door.
          
          Bill, Wally, Margaret, and Trevor move up to the doorway
          and watch the deer skitter off into the woods beyond,
          dragging the telephone, tied to her leg.
          
                                  BILL
                    Hell, she took a phone. Now them
                    forest critters are gonna be calling
                    us all hours of the night.
          
                                                                     6.
          
          Everyone LAUGHS.   Wally pretends to be on the phone.
          
                                  WALLY
                    Chief of police there? This a
                    squirrel. Bring me a bag of
                    peanuts, motherfucker!
          
          Everyone LAUGHS some more.
          
          
          INT. GLASS WORKSHOP - EVENING
          
          Grant locks his office for the day.   His SECRETARY sees
          him going.
          
                                  SECRETARY
                    'Night, Mr. Grant.
          
                                  GRANT
                    See ya', Ashley.
          
          Grant walks across the workshop toward the door. He sees
          a crowd of WORKERS lounging around a glass-cutting table,
          LAUGHING at something.
          
          Some of them nod at Grant, and he nods back.   But he's
          completely outside their circle.
          
          
          EXT. GRANT HOUSE - NIGHT
          
          A sizable two-story suburban home.    All the lights are
          off but one.
          
                                  GRANT (O.S.)
                    So I get home today, phone's
                    ringing. It's Hank Wilcox.
          
          
          INT. GRANT DINING ROOM - NIGHT
          
          Starla and Grant eat dinner in this well-decorated room.
          As Grant chatters, Starla occasionally smiles politely at
          him.
          
                                  GRANT
                    Callin' for you. What the hell?
                    I said, 'Hank, that's a little bit
                    outta line don't'cha think, a single
                    man callin' someone's wife?' At
                    night, nonetheless.
          
          Starla is quiet, almost afraid:
          
                                                                     7.
          
                                  STARLA
                    He's teaching environmental science,
                    Grant. Probably wants to borrow
                    my lesson plans from last semester.
          
                                  GRANT
                    Oh yeah, that's what he wants to
                    borrow, this guy.
          
                                  STARLA
                    It's just a work thing.
          
                                  GRANT
                    Work thing hell, Starla. He just
                    wants to get in your pussy. Him
                    and most these other ones around
                    here. That's where their minds is
                    at, them sick fucks.
          
          Grant takes a big bite of food, stuffing his mouth.
          
                                  GRANT
                    I'll tell you, sugarplum, you're
                    lucky you got me. You're too damn
                    trusting. Without me to protect
                    you, you'd get kilt one of these
                    days.
          
          Starla nods.
          
          
          INT. GRANT MASTER BATHROOM - LATER
          
          Starla stares at herself in the mirror as she brushes her
          hair. She uses long, slow strokes, as if stalling.
          
                                  GRANT (O.S.)
                    Sugarplum, you coming into bed?
          
          Starla turns toward the door.       She doesn't say anything
          for a moment.
          
                                     STARLA
                    Just a second.
          
          Starla sets her brush down on the counter. She arranges
          it neatly beside the others. And walks into the bedroom.
          
          
          INT. GRANT BEDROOM - MOMENTS LATER
          
          Grant turns off the TV as Starla gets into bed with him.
          It's almost completely dark in here.
          
          Grant crawls on top of Starla. He kisses her and grabs
          her in a way not meant to be rough, but is utterly without
          grace.
          
                                                                  8.
          
          After doing this for a few moments, Starla starts to push
          him off her.
          
                                  STARLA
                    Grant, no -- I'm sorry, I'm just --
                    I'm not in the mood.
          
          Grant is on top of her, breathing a little too heavy.
          
                                  GRANT
                    Come on, baby, it's --
          
                                   STARLA
                    I'm sorry.   I don't just have some
                    switch.
          
                                   GRANT
                    Sure you do.
          
          Through Starla's nightgown, Grant pretends to flick one
          of her nipples.
          
                                   GRANT
                    Flip.
          
          Then the other.
          
                                   GRANT
                    Flip.
          
                                  STARLA
                    That's disrespectful.
          
          Grant, peeved, gets off of her. He sits on the edge of
          the bed for a moment, in silence. Starla looks afraid.
          
                                  GRANT
                    When are you in the mood, exactly?
                    Seems to me that mood's as rare as
                    winnin' the Goddamn lotto.
          
          Grant grabs his slacks off the valet and starts putting
          them on.
          
                                  STARLA
                    Where are you going?
          
                                  GRANT
                    I'm just some big clown to you,
                    ain't I?
          
                                  STARLA
                    That's not true -- Where are you-?
          
                                   GRANT
                    Out.
          
                                                                9.
          
          INT. HENENLOTTER'S SPORTS BAR - LATER
          
          Grant sits at the bar, knocking back a shot of tequila.
          He's getting drunk. He taps his glass.
          
                                  GRANT
                    Hit me again there, killer.
          
          The BARKEEP fills his drink.
          
                                  BARKEEP
                    Hey, Grant, how's it you come to
                    have the same last name as first?
          
                                  GRANT
                    Parents thought it sounded pleasant,
                    I s'pose. Joke on me, ain't it?
          
          Grant notices a woman with a lot of makeup -- BRENDA
          GUTIERREZ -- staring at him from across the bar, smoking
          a cigarette. Grant stares at her, trying to figure out
          who she is. She slides off her stool.
          
          She sashays toward him. She props herself on the stool
          beside him, leans drunkenly in toward him.
          
                                  BRENDA
                    Megan Halesy' little sister.

                    Hell, you were --
          
          Grant holds his hand only so high.

                    Grant Grant. I's in love with
                    you.
          
          Grant stares at her.
          
                                  BRENDA
                    My sister Megan, she's a big fat
                    cow. Was then, even more so now.
                    I'd be thinking, what'd you see in
                    her ain't in me?
          
                                  GRANT
                    Shit, girl, you couldn't'a been
                    eleven.
          
                                                                  10.

          She LAUGHS. So does Grant. He stares at her,
          contemplating sinful things. He nods at her wedding ring.
          
                                  GRANT
                    Who's the lucky fella?

                    Fucking prom queen.
          
          Grant thinks.
          
                                     GRANT
                    Yeah.
          
          Grant finishes his drink, and gets up to go.
          
                                  BRENDA
                    Where you goin'?
          
          Grant speaks more loudly than need be:
          
                                  GRANT
                    Starla, she gets real worried 'bout
                    me I stay out too late. Loves me
                    too much, that one.
          
          He glances around to see if people have heard, and stumbles
          out.
          
          
          EXT. SHADED CREEK - LATER
          
          Grant sits on a boulder beside a creek, looking miserable,
          downing a six pack.
          
          He throws an empty can into the creek, when he glances
          down and sees particles flowing down the river.
          
          Grant slides off the boulder. He kneels and examines the
          particles. They shimmer in the moonbeams coming down
          between the trees.
          
          Grant peers up the creek from where the particles are
          coming.
          
                                                                  11.
          
          He sees a gap on the edge of the creek, where water
          splashes and is diverted in streamlets down the hill.
          
          He approaches the spot, and comes upon a small crater on
          the side of the creek. The meteorite is inside the crater,
          but it's cracked into pieces. The rock seems almost
          organic, like a shell. The shimmery specks are part of
          the shell itself, flecking off into the creek and rushing
          downstream.
          
          Grant crouches. He touches the meteorite, and feels some
          sort of goo inside it. It's sticky.
          
          He notices a strip of the same slime leading out of the
          crater itself and into the woods.
          
          Grant, curiously, slowly, follows the slimy trail.
          
          He comes to a flurry of colorful wild flowers. Something
          is rustling the flowers ever so slightly. He moves in
          closer.
          
          A gelatinous yellow organism slithers sluggishly between
          the flowers. The organism is a mound a few inches high,
          gross and veiny, yet as colorful as the flowers around
          it. A small cavity on the apex of the organism constricts
          and expands lightly. I guess it's not worth keeping secret
          that this thing looks a tad like a bright yellow vagina.
          
                                   GRANT
                    What the...?
          
          Grant is a little freaked-out by this thing, even
          frightened. He looks around for someone else.
          
                                  GRANT
                    Hey, anybody 'round here?   'Lo?
          
          No one answers. Grant looks down at the organism, unsure.
          He picks up a tree branch.
          
          Grant softly prods the organism with the pointy end of
          the branch.
          
          Nothing happens.
          
          He does it again.   The thing pulses a little, and surges
          toward Grant.
          
          Grand pokes it again.
          
          A small, thin quill -- a SPORE -- emerges from the cavity
          in the center of the organism. The spore is quivering
          and, as it trembles upward, little bulbed spurs pop up as
          well.
          
          Grant slowly bends down to look at it when --
          
                                                                12.
          
          The SPORE suddenly SHOOTS OUT.   It strikes Grant in the
          stomach.
          
                                  GRANT
                    Ow!   Fuck!
          
          Grant yanks up his shirt, looking at a wound on his
          abdomen. He watches as the spore quivers and disappears
          inside him.
          
          He clutches his stomach, SCREAMS in agony. He falls back
          into the colorful flowers. His body convulses.
          
                                                        MATCH CUT TO:
          
          
          CAT SCAN SHOT - INT. GRANT'S BODY
          
          We see the insides of Grant's body, as if sliced in half.
          We ZOOM IN on the little spore, which is jittering up
          through his body, and into his neck.
          
          The spore keys into the base of Grant's cerebellum, and
          his entire brain crackles with a WHITE ELECTRICAL ENERGY.
          
          
          BACK TO SCENE
          
          Grant freezes in place, his fingers contorted up in front
          of him, silent. He's utterly still, a wax corpse.
          
          A hippie CAMPING COUPLE run into the area, looking for
          the source of the screams. The man looks down at the
          frozen Grant.
          
                                  CAMPER
                    Over here!
          
          The Camper crouches down beside him.
          
                                 CAMPER
                    Hey, man. You all right?...
                    Dude?... Oh shit.
          
          The Camper turns from Grant to his girlfriend.
          
                                  CAMPER
                    I think he's d --
          
          Grant GASPS suddenly, sitting up and grabbing the man,
          like a drowning man popping up above water. The Camper
          YELPS and jumps back. Grant sweats and heaves, trying to
          speak, but hardly can --
          
                                  GRANT
                    It's taking... my... brain.
          
                                                                  13.
          
                                  CAMPER
                    Buddy?
          
          Grant's eyes glaze over, and he eases off. He heaves
          there, momentarily confused. His eyes dart around, as if
          seeing his surroundings for the first time. Grant stands.
          
                                  CAMPER
                    You all right, man?
          
          Grant looks down curiously at the camper. Then he turns
          and stumbles away from them, out of the forest.
          
                                  CAMPER
                    That might of been a stroke, buddy.
                    You better take it easy.
          
          
          INT. GRANT'S PICKUP - DAWN
          
          Grant drives down the road in his luxury pickup truck,
          sweating and blinking rapidly.
          
          
          EXT. GRANT HOUSE - MORNING
          
          Grant steps out of the truck in his driveway, when he
          hears --
          
                                  NEIGHBOR (O.S.)
                    Hey ya', Grant.
          
          Grant swings his head toward his NEIGHBOR, who is taking
          a happy BEAGLE for a morning walk.
          
                                  NEIGHBOR
                    What were ya', night-fishing again?
                    You catch anything?
          
                                  GRANT
                    I caught a little somethin', yeah.
          
          Grant walks inside his house.
          
          
          INT. GRANT FOYER - MORNING
          
          Grant looks around the foyer.
          
          
          INT. GRANT BEDROOM - MORNING
          
          Grant creeps into the bedroom, looking around.   We can
          hear the SHOWER RUNNING.
          
          Grant spots his face in a mirror above the dresser. He
          moves in close to the mirror, and stares at his own image.
          
                                                                  14.
          
          He pulls on his face a little, his eyes brimming with
          excitement. He smiles at himself.
          
          Grant looks toward the open bathroom door, where he hears
          the running shower. He creeps toward it.
          
          Grant peeks around the doorway. Starla is in the shower,
          soaping herself. She looks beautiful there. Grant tilts
          his head to the side like a dog. He watches her,
          mesmerized, even moved.
          
          
          INT.   GRANT BATHROOM - MOMENTS LATER
          
          Starla is wearing a white towel and brushing her wet hair
          in the foggy bathroom mirror when she hears Air Supply's
          EVERY WOMAN IN THE WORLD coming from the bedroom. She's
          struck by it.
          
          She moves toward the door.   Opens it.
          
          
          INT. GRANT BEDROOM - MORNING
          
          The shades are drawn, darkening the room. A few candles
          have been lit. Grant is standing there, mostly in
          silhouette. He's silent, and he doesn't move.
          
                                   GRANT
                     Hey there, sugarplum.
          
          Starla looks at him, stirred.
          
                                   STARLA
                     Haven't heard this for a while.
          
          Grant walks toward her. He takes her hand in his own,
          lifting it beside him. He wraps his other arm around her
          waist. And he slow dances with her. Starla dances too,
          a bit hesitantly, a bit shy.
          
                                   STARLA
                     I never danced in a towel before.
          
                                   GRANT
                     Wearing white, just like on our...
                     wedding day. I remember it.
          
          Starla nods.
          
                                   GRANT
                     I'm sorry about last night. I get
                     a little insecure sometimes, want
                     to hold on too tight. It's just
                     'cause you're precious to me,
                     Starla.
                                   (MORE)
          
                                                                15.
          
                                  GRANT (CONT'D)
                    But I swear to God, baby, I'm
                    turning over a new Goddamn leaf.
                    Okay?
          
          Starla nods, touched.    Grant's eyes are teary.
          
                                  GRANT
                    I love you, sugarplum.
          
          Starla and Grant kiss, tenderly.
          
          Grant falls to his knees in front of her. He runs his
          hand over the curve of her hip, her thigh, her buttock,
          with as much fascination as lust. He pushes Starla back
          onto the bed.
          
          He lifts her leg, and kisses it, nibbles on it a little,
          scrapes his teeth on it. Starla is surprised by this,
          but enjoys it too: it's probably the most foreplay she's
          had in years.
          
          Grant crawls on top of her, runs his hands over her
          breasts, her face. Starla's hand moves over Grant's back,
          and to his stomach. When she stops, startled.
          
                                  STARLA
                    Grant, what's that?
          
          She gazes down at the wound between them, on Grant's bare
          abdomen, where the spore entered him. The wound is
          yellowish, and surrounded by veins.
          
          Grant, embarrassed, pulls his shirt down.
          
                                  GRANT
                    Just a little bug bite is all.
          
          Grant kisses and munches on Starla as she lies back on
          the bed, enjoying it.
          
          O.S. HUMMING.

          INT. TEACHER'S LOUNGE - DAY
          
          Starla is HUMMING Every Woman in the World as she drops
          coins into a soda machine and chooses Tab. JANENE, a
          heavyset black teacher, notices this.

                    What are you so smiley about, girl?
          
                                    STARLA
                    Oh, nothin'.
          
                                                                  16.
          
          Starla grabs her soda and sits down with Janene.   Janene
          just stares.
          
                                   STARLA
                     Just, Grant and I had a nice
                     morning. It's been a while.
          
                                   JANENE
                     Oh! You got that fresh-fucked
                     glow, don't you?
          
                                    STARLA
                     Janene.
          
                                    JANENE
                     You slut.
          
                                    STARLA
                     Hush.
          
                                    JANENE
                     No shame.   You're a married woman.
          
                                   STARLA
                     He was... considerate. Maybe this
                     is the start of a real change in
                     Grant.
          
          
          INT. GRANT BATHROOM - DAY
          
          Grant is holding up his shirt, and looking at his torso.
          The wound on his side is blackened and gangrenous, and is
          starting to puff up into a veiny little spout. A fuzzy
          bluish moss is growing in the crevices around the spout.
          A pus oozes out.
          
          Grant looks concerned. He squirts some Neosporin onto
          his fingers. He massages it slowly into the wound.
          
          
          INT.   GRANT KITCHEN - MOMENTS LATER
          
          Grant opens the refrigerator door and rummages around
          inside. He pulls out some bread. Some cheese.
          
          He opens the meat drawer. It's replete with cold cuts.
          He pulls out some Oscar Mayer baloney. Turkey. Pastrami
          and salami. He grabs every type of meat there is.
          
          
          MOMENTS LATER
          
          Grant assembles a sandwich at the table. Two pieces of
          bread and some cheese. He starts putting the meat on.
          But he can't stop, piling more and more on until he has a
          little sandwich tower.
          
                                                                  17.
          
          He looks at it. Something seems off about it. He removes
          the cheese. Better. And then the bread. Even better.
          He stares at what is now simply a tower of cold cuts.
          
                                     GRANT
                    Meat.
          
          After contemplating it for a moment, Grant stands and
          carries off the pile of meat.
          
          
          INT. GRANT GARAGE - MOMENTS LATER
          
          Grant enters the garage through a door from the FOYER.
          He flips the lights on with his shoulder. He looks around.
          
          Grant spots an old file cabinet. He sets the tower of
          meat down on the oily floor and opens a drawer. It's
          filled with files. He closes that drawer, and opens
          another. It has manila file folders, but no files.
          
          Grant takes out the folders. He uses a Sharpie to write
          out "BALONEY" on a folder. Then he stuffs all the baloney
          into the folder and files it away.
          
          He starts writing out "PASTRAMI".
          
          
          LATER
          
          Grant flips through his alphabetically-filed meat: from
          "BALONEY" through "TURKEY." But he doesn't look satisfied.
          
          
          INT. SUPERMARKET - LATER
          
          Grant stands beside the butcher's counter with a shopping
          cart. He peers dreamily in through the glass at the rows
          of steaks, pork chops, and so on.
          
                                     GRANT
                    Meat.
          
                                  BUTCHER
                    Howdy, Mr. Grant. You goin' to
                    the Deer Cheer this weekend?
          
          Grant snaps out of his reverie.
          
                                  GRANT
                    Sure thing, killer.
          
                                  BUTCHER
                    What can I do you for?
          
                                                                18.
          
                                  GRANT
                    Thinkin' 'bout getting me a couple
                    of these big ol' rib eyes.
          
                                  BUTCHER
                    How many you need?
          
          Grant stares at the steaks.
          
                                  GRANT
                    Well... having us a little dinner
                    party... I'd say... eight. No,
                    no... fourteen...
          
          The Butcher nods, starts to grab steaks.   Grant CHUCKLES.
          
                                  GRANT
                    Hell, what am I holding back for?
                    Why don't you just give me
                    everything you got here?
          
                                  BUTCHER
                    All the rib eyes?
          
                                  GRANT
                    Yep. And while you're at it, get
                    me a few of them chicken wings...
                    some pork loins... and, ooo, what's
                    this here? Osso buco?...
          
          
          EXT. GRANT HOME - LATER
          
          Grant backs his pickup toward the garage. Meat is piled
          into the bed. Wrapped packages of meat fill the seats
          around him.
          
          
          INT. GRANT GARAGE - MOMENTS LATER
          
          Grant stands in the garage, tearing open the packing, and
          letting the loose meat slide into piles onto the floor,
          muttering:
          
                                    GRANT
                    Meat.
          
          
          MOMENTS LATER
          
          Grant rolls slabs of beef over the dirty floor and into a
          pile.
          
          SOMETHING skitters across the garage and around the pile.
          Grant peers around the pile and sees a RAT nibbling on
          some ribs. He realizes something.
          
                                                                  19.
          
                                     GRANT
                     You're meat.
          
          The rat moves away from Grant. But Grant snaps out his
          arm with alarming speed, snatching the rat. It SQUEAKS
          and wriggles in his grip, tearing and biting at him, trying
          to get free.
          
          Grant snaps its neck, and tosses the dead rat onto the
          pile of meat. Continues on.
          
          
          EXT. GRANT GARAGE - NIGHT
          
          Starla pulls into the driveway.     She presses the button
          on her garage door opener.
          
          The door SHUDDERS but stays closed.    Starla's confused.
          
          She gets out of the car and examines the door. She looks
          down and sees a new padlock, locking the door to the cement
          driveway with bolts on both sides.
          
          
          INT. GRANT FOYER - MOMENTS LATER
          
          Starla enters the house. She heads toward a door along
          the wall that leads to the garage. There's a shiny new
          lock on that door as well. She touches it, baffled.
          
          She turns to see Grant standing at the end of the foyer.
          He's in shadows, a little spooky in the darkness.
          
                                     GRANT
                     Welcome home.
          
                                   STARLA
                     Grant? Why are there -- did you
                     put locks on the garage?
          
          Pause.   No answer.
          
                                   STARLA
                     You drilled into the driveway.
          
          Grant walks into the light.
          
                                   GRANT
                     Yeahhhh. I'm sorry. I just got
                     so excited about... your present.
          
                                     STARLA
                     My present?
          
                                   GRANT
                     You're my princess, aren't you?
          
                                                                20.
          
                                   STARLA
                    Okay.
          
                                  GRANT
                    I got a super-special birthday
                    present for you this year. I
                    couldn't risk you finding it, so I
                    had to put them locks on the doors.
          
          Pause.
          
                                   STARLA
                    All right... I have to clean up
                    before dinner.
          
          Grant smiles at her. Starla confused, tries to smile
          back, then turns and heads up the stairs. Grant watches
          Starla's fine form from behind, somewhat lustily. But
          his leering gaze gradually turns into something darker,
          and he has a realization.
          
                                   GRANT
                    You're meat.
          
          Starla turns.
          
                                   STARLA
                    What?
          
          Grant snaps himself out of it.
          
                                   GRANT
                    Oh, nothin'.   Nothin'.   See you in
                    a sec.
          
          Starla smiles uneasily, and heads on upstairs.
          
          
          EXT. GRANT HOME - MOMENTS LATER
          
          Grant steps onto the front porch to get some air. He's
          blinking and seems a little dizzy. He gazes around the
          neighborhood:
          
          Down the way, a BOY in a little league uniform and his
          MOTHER get out of their car and walk toward the front
          door.
          
          Across the street, THROUGH A KITCHEN WINDOW, a PLUMP MAN
          and his WIFE are eating dinner.
          
          At another home, a SHORT MAN steps on a stepladder,
          changing the dome light on his porch.
          
          Grant stares at these individuals, looking like an animal
          ready to lunge at its prey, fighting the urge.
          
                                                               21.
          
                                      GRANT
                     Meat.
          
          He HEARS a BARKING. Grant turns to see the beagle next
          door, tied to the tree, YAPPING at him.
          
          Grant looks around to make sure no one's watching.
          
          
          EXT. GRANT HOME - MORNING
          
          Starla walks to get the paper in her robe, and she sees a
          BOY, aged thirteen or so, stapling a LOST: REWARD flyer
          to a telephone pole, with a picture of the beagle.
          
                                      STARLA
                     Roscoe's gone?
          
          The Boy's face is streaked from a long night of crying.
          
                                   BOY
                     You haven't seen him, have you?
          
          Starla shakes her head.
          
                                   STARLA
                     I'm sure he'll show up, Tim.
          
          The Boy nods, and walks to the next telephone pole to put
          up another flyer.
          
          
          EXT. SHADED FOREST - DAY
          
          Grant moves up a hill, between trees, looking around for
          something. He comes to a stop, trying to remember which
          way to go. He does, and moves on.
          
          
          EXT.   OLD BARN - LATER
          
          Grant comes upon an old wooden barn. The structure is
          maybe a hundred years old, and long abandoned. It's
          spattered with graffiti. Grant stares at it.
          
          
          MOMENTS LATER
          
          Grant gathers large fronds and other foliage in his arms.
          
          
          INT.   OLD BARN - LATER
          
          Grant spreads the plant life over the floor of the barn.
          He arranges it, fluffs it there. His actions are very
          animal-like when no one's around. He seems to be making
          a nest. He sits back, looks at it.
          
                                                                 22.
          
          He's happy.
          
                                                             FADE TO:
          
          
          INT. GRANT BEDROOM - NIGHT
          
          Starla, dressed in her weekend finery, is looking in the
          mirror above her dresser, and putting on earrings.
          
                                  STARLA
                    Grant, are you almost ready?
          
          
          INT. GRANT MASTER BATHROOM - MOMENTS LATER
          
          Grant looks ill. He is leaning over the sink, sweating,
          clutching his stomach.
          
                                  GRANT
                    Yeah, hon, I'll be right there!
          
          Grant turns and pushes open his door.
          
          
          INT. GRANT BEDROOM - NIGHT
          
          Grant sees Starla sitting on the edge of the bed, her
          back to him, as she puts on her nylons. She doesn't know
          he's there.
          
          Grant stares at her, demented, and moves slowly toward
          her, stalking her.
          
          Something starts to push Grant's shirt up at his stomach,
          like a bellybutton erection. The thing slips out of his
          shirt -- a writhing, pointy tubule, aiming toward Starla's
          back.
          
          Grant looks at the nape of Starla's neck.    Her delicate
          ear. He becomes confused; he softens.
          
          Starla turns to see Grant, his body now turned away from
          her. He's trying to push the tubule back down.
          
                                  STARLA
                    What are you doing?
          
                                     GRANT
                    You're pretty.
          
          Starla nods, confused by his behavior.
          
                                                               23.
          
          EXT. WHEELSY SADDLE LODGE - LATER
          
          A banner hangs across the front of the lodge, "DEER CHEER
          '05" -- the first Friday of deer season in Wheelsy.
          Inflatable deer totems decorate the front of the wooden
          lodge. RAMBUNCTIOUS MUSIC comes from inside. Partyers
          enter.
          
          Grant and Starla step out of his truck. As they do, one
          of Starla's students, Will, sees her and waves. Starla
          waves back.
          
          Grant notices this and grabs Starla's arm, a bit too hard,
          pulling her back.
          
                                  GRANT
                    Who's that?
          
                                  STARLA
                    It's just one of my students, Grant.
          
          Grant stares at the boy with distrust, and ushers Starla
          towards the lodge.
          
          Bill, Trevor and Margaret are hanging out on a large rock
          outside the entranceway, drinking beer. Bill watches
          Grant and Starla cross the lot. Trevor sees this.
          
                                  TREVOR
                    What's she see in that douchebag?
          
                                  BILL
                    That's the mystery of the ages
                    there, Trev. Starla was seventeen
                    when they got engaged. He was,
                    like, in his thirties. No one
                    even knew they were goin' out till
                    she had that ring on her finger.
          
                                  MARGARET
                    Ain't no mystery to it. She's
                    raised in them shanties off St.
                    Luc. Dirt-poor.
          
                                  TREVOR
                    Gold-digger, huh?
          
                                  BILL
                    Hell, you don't know that, Margaret.
          
          Margaret shrugs, BELCHES. Jack, the mayor, with his WIFE,
          stops beside them after she does, staring at her.
          
                                  JACK
                    Bill, you're Chief of police now.
                                  (MORE)
          
                                                                 24.
          
                                  JACK (CONT'D)
                    Comes with some Goddamn
                    responsibility, like keeping your
                    people in line.
          
                                  BILL
                    You're right, Jack.    Margaret,
                    you're fired.
          
          Margaret and Trevor LAUGH. Jack shakes his head with
          disdain, and enters the party.
          
          
          INT. WHEELSY SADDLE LODGE - NIGHT
          
          Wheelsy citizens celebrate.   A country-western band PLAYS.
          Couples two-step.
          
          Starla and Grant move through the party. Grant looks
          around at the dancing and laughing bodies. Starla sees
          her friend from school.
          
                                  STARLA
                    Janene!
          
          Janene LAUGHS heartily and the two embrace
          
                                  JANENE
                    Hey, Grant.
          
                                  GRANT
                    Why don't you two catch up? I'll
                    go see what the boys are doing.
          
          Starla nods. She and Janene watch as Grant moves off
          through the crowd.
          
                                  STARLA
                    He's been strange the past couple
                    days.
          
          
          EXT. WHEELSY SADDLE LODGE - MOMENTS LATER
          
          Grant steps outside, and looks around.
          
          Across the parking lot is a playground. Two YOUNG CHILDREN
          are spinning on a little carousel there.
          
          Grant starts toward them.
          
          
          EXT. SADDLE LODGE PLAYGROUND - NIGHT
          
          The Children GIGGLE, unaware of Grant inching up on them.
          Grant gets closer, excited, when he hears:
          
                                                                 25.
          
                                  BRENDA (O.S.)
                    Hey there, handsome.
          
          Grant turns and see Brenda Gutierrez standing there.
          Once again, she's very drunk.
          
                                  BRENDA
                    Must be fate, us meeting again
                    like this.
          
          Grant smiles.
          
                                  GRANT
                    Well, you might be right...
          
          Grant sees if anyone's watching.   He circles around her.
          
                                  GRANT
                    You're lookin' awful pretty.
          
                                  BRENDA
                    Shut up.
          
          Brenda SNICKERS.
          
                                  GRANT
                    Where's the old half-Mexican?
          
                                  BRENDA
                    Took the kids to his Mom's for the
                    weekend.
          
          Grant smiles.
          
          
          EXT. FOREST - NIGHT
          
          Grant holds Brenda's hand, and he pulls her between the
          trees. She GIGGLES.
          
                                  BRENDA
                    Where you takin' me, you bad boy!
          
          Grant stops in a secluded place, beside the creek, looking
          around. No one's there. He turns toward her, smiles.
          
                                  GRANT
                    Take off your shirt, doll.
          
          Brenda looks at him, confused.
          
                                  GRANT
                    Guess it's hard to explain how
                    amazin' a human brain is to someone
                    who that's all they know.
          
                                                                   26.
          
                                    BRENDA
                    What?
          
                                  GRANT
                    Stuff you can never imagine.
                    Feelings. Big thoughts. And love.
                    Yeah. I'm inclined to parlay it
                    into somethin' more. So, go ahead
                    there, beautiful, and take off
                    your shirt.
          
          Brenda, though startled, leans back on a boulder and starts
          unbuttoning her blouse. After a moment, she looks at
          Grant, trying to be sexy while she does it. Grant looks
          at her in her bra.
          
                                    GRANT
                    Nice.
          
          Grant unbuttons his shirt as well.    As he removes it
          completely, he turns toward her.
          
          Brenda sees the wound on his stomach has blossomed into a
          veiny, blue-moss-encrusted yellow spout, huge and pulsing.
          
                                    BRENDA
                    Grant!?    What -- ?!
          
          Grant grabs her.    She tries to push his arms away.
          
                                    BRENDA
                    No, no, we --
          
          Brenda gets up, trying to run away. But Grant grabs her
          necklace, yanking her back. The necklace snaps and falls
          into the creek beside them.
          
          Grant pins Brenda's wrists against the rock.    She struggles
          to get free.
          
          Brenda's eyes widen as she looks down to see the writhing,
          tentacle-like tubule emerge from Grant's wound. She
          SCREAMS.
          
          Grant shoves his hand over her mouth, shutting her up.
          He's extremely strong. She watches as the tubule twitches,
          feeling its way like a blind snake.
          
          The tubule comes to rest on her abdomen. Tears stream
          down from Brenda's eyes. It pushes into her flesh.
          
          Brenda goes into convulsions. Something -- a fluid --
          pumps through the tubule and into Brenda.
          
          Grant watches Brenda without emotion as her body spasms
          there beside him.
          
                                                                27.
          
          Then she falls back, unconscious.   The tubule retracts
          into Grant's torso.
          
          
          EXT. WHEELSY SADDLE LODGE BACK PORCH - NIGHT
          
          Starla is leaning over a wooden rail, looking at the lights
          of the town below. She turns to see Bill lean on the
          rail beside her. She looks genuinely happy.
          
                                  STARLA
                    Hey, Bill!
          
          Starla catches herself, and looks around to see if Grant
          is watching.
          
                                 BILL
                    Don't worry. The lurker ain't
                    around. I checked.
          
                                  STARLA
                    That's not funny.
          
                                  BILL
                    Sorry.
          
                                  STARLA
                    Whatcha' doin'?
          
                                  BILL
                    Tryin' to get a buzz on. But I'm
                    too buff. Too much muscle mass.
          
          Starla LAUGHS.
          
                                  BILL
                    What you up to?
          
                                  STARLA
                    Just checking out the lights.
          
          Bill and Starla look out over the city together.
          
                                  BILL
                    Pretty, ain't they?
          
                                  STARLA
                    I don't know. I've seen them so
                    many times before. I guess any
                    spot gets boring after awhile.
          
                                  BILL
                    Well that's only if you're in the
                    wrong spot.
          
          Starla looks at him.
          
                                                                     28.
          
                                    BILL
                      There's a place over there on the
                      bluffs. When the fog is just right,
                      like tonight, the lights of Main
                      look like a kaleidoscope.
          
                                      STARLA
                      Oh, yeah?
          
                                    BILL
                      Mm hm. But only a few folks know
                      how to get there. Wally. Rollo
                      Linkski coulda taken you, but
                      'course he got hit by that train.
                      Me.
          
                                    STARLA
                      I'll get Wally to show me sometime
                      then.
          
            Starla LAUGHS out loud.   So does Bill.
          
                                    BILL
                      Oh, will you now?
          
                  STARLA                            GRANT (O.S.)
          Or Rollo's ghost.               Starla.
          
            They turn to see Grant approaching.     He's a mess.   His
            pants are streaked with mud.
          
                                    STARLA
                      Grant, where'd you go?
          
                                      BILL
                      Hey, Grant.
          
            Grant eyes Bill with suspicion.    He grabs Starla.
          
                                    GRANT
                      You ready, sugarplum?
          
            Starla nods.   She looks at Bill and mouths:
          
                                      STARLA
                      Bye.
          
            Bill watches Grant and Starla head off, as he downs the
            rest of his beer. Wally walks up beside him.
          
                                    WALLY
                      Surprised you're able to lift a
                      mug after carrying that torch for
                      so long.
          
                                                                 29.
          
                                  BILL
                    Hey, Wally. Glad you're here.
                    There was something I wanted to
                    tell you...
          
          Bill SNAPS his fingers, trying to remember.
          
                                     WALLY
                    What?
          
                                     BILL
                    Oh yeah.     Fuck you, fat ass.
          
          They both LAUGH.
          
          
          INT. GRANT BEDROOM - LATER
          
          Starla lies on her side, awake. She's staring at the
          dirt on Grant's pants, which are hung over a valet. Grant
          holds her from behind, sleeping peacefully.
          
                                                              FADE TO:
          
          
          INT. WHEELSY POLICE STATION - DAY
          
          The front door of the precinct opens, and a confused
          Mexican MAN walks inside. He is trying to keep from
          crying. Three half-naked children follow him, clutching
          onto his clothes. The man walks slowly through the office,
          looking around for help.
          
          Margaret sees him from her desk.
          
                                  MARGARET
                    Sir, may I help -- ?
          
                                  BRENDA'S HUSBAND
                    My wife, Brenda. I think something
                    has happened to her!
          
          
          EXT. STOP SIGN - DAY
          
          Starla, in her car with groceries, comes to a stop sign.
          She looks at the telephone pole beside it and sees that
          it's covered with flyers for missing pets.
          
          
          INT. GRANT FOYER - MOMENTS LATER
          
          Starla enters with a shopping bag.    The lights are off.
          CREEPY MUSIC plays.
          
                                     STARLA
                    Grant?
          
                                                                  30.
          
          No answer.    Starla tries to turn on the lights, but nothing
          happens.
          
                                     STARLA
                       Damn fuse.
          
          She passes the door to the garage, noticing the lock.
          
          
          INT. GRANT KITCHEN - MOMENTS LATER
          
          Starla sets down the bags on the counter, looks around.
          
                                     STARLA
                       Grant?
          
          Again, no one's here. She sees a potted flower on the
          counter. A green INCHWORM is crawling up the stem, little
          by little. She stares at it, as if it's a portent.
          
          She hears a MOAN, coming from upstairs.
          
          
          INT. GRANT BEDROOM - MOMENTS LATER
          
          Starla moves slowly into this dark room, looking for her
          husband. It seems no one is here.
          
                                     STARLA
                       Grant, where are y -- ?
          
          Starla turns, when Grant POPS INTO FRAME. Starla,
          startled, SCREAMS. Grant is sick and trembling. But,
          worse, he's been transforming. There are small pustules
          all over his face.
          
                                    STARLA
                       Grant. Oh my God. What happened
                       to your -- ?
          
                                     GRANT
                       Heh. It ain't as bad as it looks,
                       sugarplum. Dr. Carl was just here.
                       I had a reaction to a bee sting.
                       He gave me a prescription. Said I
                       should be fine, in a couple days.
          
          Starla stares at him, mute and horrified.
          
                                     GRANT
                       Don't look at me like that, baby.
                       Please? I'm gonna go get my...
                       prescription filled.
          
          Grant grabs his keys off the dresser, puts them in his
          pocket, trying to pretend he doesn't hurt.
          
                                                                      31.
          
                                  STARLA
                    I'll get if for you.
          
                                       GRANT
                    No!   No.   Heh.     I'll be right back.
          
          He moves outside the door, leaving Starla, shell-shocked.
          
          
          INT. GRANT GARAGE - DAY
          
          It's too dark to see much in here, but we do see Grant
          putting meat into a garbage bag.
          
          
          EXT. GRANT HOUSE - DAY
          
          Grant looks around to make sure no one's looking, as he
          places the garbage bag full of meat into his trunk, closes
          it.
          
          
          EXT. OLD BARN - EVENING
          
          Grant moves through the forest, in massive pain, dragging
          the garbage bag.
          
          Grant comes upon the old wooden barn.
          
          
          INT. OLD BARN - NIGHT
          
          Grant enters. It is almost completely dark.          He hears
          WEEPING. CHAINS RATTLE.
          
          Grant peers over at Brenda, mostly in silhouette, sitting
          on the nest he has made. She's chained up and MOANS
          through a mouth gag. Grant walks to her. Her body is
          horribly pear-shaped and misshapen, like some tumorous
          pregnancy. Grant pulls her gag away.
          
                                  BRENDA
                    Grant? Grant, I'm hungry. I'm so
                    fuckin' hungry I think I'm gonna
                    die.
          
                                  GRANT
                    Brought you munchies.
          
          Grant pours the garbage bagful of rotting meat and dead
          animals out in front of her.
          
                                  GRANT
                    Been saving for a rainy day.
          
          CLOSEUP: Brenda's face, still mostly in darkness. She
          stares at the meat, simultaneously excited and repulsed.
          
                                                                 32.
          
          She looks up at Grant.
          
                                  BRENDA
                    Grant, I'm sorry if I did something
                    wrong! I think I gotta -- I think
                    I should go to a hospital!
          
          Grant doesn't respond.    Brenda's eyes trail back down to
          the meat.
          
          Brenda's hand reaches out, and grabs a maggot-infested
          pork chop, pulling it toward her.
          
          We HEAR, but can barely see, Brenda CHOWING DOWN on the
          raw pork in the nearly pitch black barn.
          
          
          INT. GRANT'S TRUCK - LATER
          
          Grant gets into his pickup; he trembles and YELPS as his
          body is wracked with pain and his body starts to transform
          even more.
          
          
          INT. GRANT FOYER - NIGHT
          
          There's a HARD KNOCKING on Starla's door. She swings it
          open to see Bill and Wally standing there, worried.
          
          Wally tries to see inside.
          
                                     WALLY
                    Grant around?
          
                                   STARLA
                    No.   He went to the pharmacy.
          
                                     WALLY
                    Pharmacy?
          
                                  STARLA
                    He's got a... rash.
          
          Bill and Wally exchange a glance -- maybe this means
          something. Starla can see Trevor and Margaret, across
          the street, talking to another neighbor.
          
                                  BILL
                    Starla, you know Brenda Gutierrez?
          
          Starla shakes her head.
          
                                  BILL
                    Maybe she's ever called the house,
                    or -- ?
          
                                                                  33.
          
                                     STARLA
                    No.   What...?
          
                                  BILL
                    She disappeared Friday night. We
                    got reason to believe foul play
                    might be involved.
          
                                  WALLY
                    Some kids found her necklace near
                    Tipper Creek, as well as what might
                    be her blood on a rock.
          
                                  BILL
                    The problem, Starla, is, the last
                    person anyone saw her talking to
                    was Grant.
          
          Starla looks at him, surprised.
          
                                  BILL
                    The Deer Cheer. And Wally and me,
                    we also saw him that night, with
                    mud all over his slacks.
          
          Bill hands her his card.
          
                                  BILL
                    Have him call me right away, okay?
          
          Starla nods, distraught. Bill tries to smile kindly before
          he and Wally move out and off to canvas other neighbors'
          homes.
          
          Starla closes the door behind her, distraught, panicked.
          
          She looks at the foyer door, leading into the garage.
          Her eyes fall down to the floor, where she sees what
          appears to be blood drop stains near the door.
          
          She gains courage, and moves off toward --
          
          
          INT. GRANT CLOSET - MOMENTS LATER
          
          Starla throws open this door. She looks at old, unused
          sports equipment. She grabs an aluminum baseball bat.
          
          
          INT. GRANT FOYER - MOMENTS LATER
          
          Starla holds the aluminum bat, standing in front of the
          door to the garage. She hesitates a moment. But then
          she swings the bat at the lock on the door.
          
          She swings it again, GRUNTING.
          
                                                                 34.
          
          And again.
          
          Finally, the lock is knocked off the wooden door.
          
          Starla pushes away the useless lock, letting it fall to
          the floor.
          
          Starla steels herself, and slowly pushes open the door
          into the dark garage. As she does, the horrendous stench
          hits her. Terrified, she covers her face with her hand,
          and enters.
          
          
          INT. GRANT GARAGE - NIGHT
          
          Starla sees what's there: not only a huge stockpile of
          rotten meat, but a dozen dead pets. They are neatly
          divided into various categories, and labeled: Pork, Ground
          Beef, Cats, Dogs. The walls and doorway have been heavily
          insulated so the smell doesn't sink into the home. She
          looks on the floor and sees poor, dead Roscoe the beagle,
          his tongue dangling out.
          
          Starla starts to CRY.
          
          She moves quickly back inside.
          
          
          INT. GRANT LIVING ROOM - MOMENTS LATER
          
          Starla runs to the front picture window, and looks out
          onto the street. She can't see any of the cops.
          
          She turns from the window and picks up a cordless phone.
          She looks at the card Bill gave her, and dials the number.
          The phone RINGS, and:
          
                                     SHERRY (O.S.)
                       You've reached Chief Pardy at the
                       Wheelsy Police Department. Please
                       leave a message and your call will
                       be returned as soon as possible.
          
          There's a BEEP.    Starla tries to speak through her SOBS,
          pacing:
          
                                     STARLA
                       Bill, it's Starla!
          
          As Starla passes the large picture window, she doesn't
          see Grant staring in at her, his face now that of some
          diseased cephalopod.
          
                                     STARLA
                       It's -- I think you better come
                       over right away -- I think Grant's
                       sick, he --
          
                                                                  35.
          
          Starla turns to see the monstrous Grant through the window.
          
          She just stops.   They stare at each other for a moment.
          
          And then Grant lets out a FURIOUS WAIL.
          
          Starla turns and dashes toward the back of the house.
          
          Grant disappears from the window.
          
          
          INT. GRANT FOYER - NIGHT
          
          As Starla runs through here, she looks behind her at the
          front door to make sure Grant isn't following.
          
          
          INT. GRANT HALL - NIGHT
          
          She runs past a wall of family photos.
          
          
          INT. GRANT FAMILY ROOM - NIGHT
          
          Starla sees the door on the rear of the house, leading to
          the backyard.
          
          She arrives at it, and flings it open --
          
          Grant is there.
          
          He lunges onto her. Starla SCREAMS and drops the cordless
          phone, just as it starts RINGING. Grant crawls on top of
          her body. Starla reaches for the ringing phone, but he
          pins her hands above her head. He looks into her eyes.
          He's CRYING. His voice and breath are sick and raspy.
          
                                  GRANT
                    Why'd you betray me, sugarplum?!
          
                                     STARLA
                    Grant, no!
          
                                     GRANT
                    I loved you.     I loved --
          
                                  STARLA
                    Grant, you're sick!
          
          Grant is about to cry.
          
                                  GRANT
                    I wanted you by my side, but you --
                    I can't trust you now!
          
          Starla's WEEPING, confused. Grant rips his shirt open.
          Starla looks down to see the tubule protruding from the
          
                                                                36.
          
          now enormous yellow spore on Grant's chest. The tubule
          feels over Starla's blouse, and then slips beneath it.
          It starts to poke into her skin.
          
                                   STARLA
                    Noooo!
          
          Starla grabs the leg of a coffee table beside her. She
          SLAMS the table into Grant's head. This hurts and
          surprises him sufficiently to let Starla get out from
          under him.
          
          Starla grabs the cordless phone, which is no longer
          ringing, and scurries behind the couch. She dials 9-1-1.
          
          Grant thrusts the couch aside.
          
          Starla crawls away again, when Grant attacks her from
          behind. He wraps his arm around her neck, pulling her
          back. He looks down at her with his sick, angry eyes, as
          his arm -- now apparently jointless -- curls around her
          like a snake.
          
          Starla gasps for air. Her face turns purple.   She hears
          a SLAMMING on the door.
          
                                   BILL (O.S.)
                    Starla?!!   Starla, are you in
                    there?!
          
          Starla tries to speak but she cannot.   Suddenly, we HEAR
          the FRONT DOOR OPEN.
          
                                   BILL (O.S.)
                    Starla?!
          
          Starla, with barely an ounce of life left in her, sees
          Bill, Wally, Trevor and Margaret burst into the living
          room.
          
          They are surprised, to say the least, to see this diseased
          humanoid strangling Starla from behind.
          
                                   TREVOR
                    Fuck!
          
          The cops, freaked out, pull their guns. Grant makes a
          SCREECHING SOUND at them. They SHOOT at Grant, nicking
          him.
          
          Grant jumps away from Starla, back into the shadows,
          SCREECHING in anger and pain. Starla falls to the floor.
          
          Grant slips out the back door and away.
          
          The cops stare, gape-jawed and frozen with shock; what
          the hell was THAT?!
          
                                                                       37.
          
            Starla rubs her neck, COUGHING.
          
            Bill Pardy runs toward the back door.
          
          
            EXT. GRANT HOME - NIGHT
          
            Bill runs out into the backyard. Wally runs up behind
            him. They look around at the trees surrounding the area.
            Grant is nowhere to be seen.
          
            We CRANE UP and AWAY from them as we...
          
                                                              FADE TO BLACK.
          
            O.S. SNIFFLING.
          
                                       PASTOR (O.S.)
                         Jesus, these past few days have
                         been a trying time for us.
          
          
            INT. CHURCH - DAY
          
            We PAN OVER an altar where family members have placed
            little items that remind them of Brenda -- photographs,
            mementos, "Come home, Mommy" cards, etc.
          
                                       PASTOR (O.S.)
                         We ask you now for the safe return
                         of our beloved Brenda.
          
            Everyone in this modest little church has their heads
            bowed as the PASTOR leads the prayer service.
          
                                      PASTOR
                         Our sister. Our daughter.    Our
                         mother. Our wife.
          
            Brenda's husband, in the front pew, loses it, CRYING.
            His little children, beside him, fiddle in their seats.
          
                                       PASTOR
                         And we ask that you keep your light
                         alive in her heart, wherever she
                         may be. We ask all this in your
                         name, Lord. Amen
          
            Bill Pardy is here, in full uniform, hat in hands.
          
                  BILL                               CONGREGATION
          Amen.                            Amen.
          
            Bill looks around the church. He spots Starla, in the
            very back of church, head down, distraught, guilty.
          
                                                                38.
          
          He also sees a group of OLD CRONES nearby, pointing at
          Starla, and whispering about her.
          
          
          EXT. CHURCH PARKING LOT - MOMENTS LATER
          
          Starla's high heels CLACK on the pavement as she moves
          quickly to her car.
          
                                     BILL (O.S.)
                    Starla.
          
          Starla turns to see Bill coming after her.   She stops.
          
                                  BILL
                    I talked to the CDC. They didn't
                    have nothin' on file consistent
                    with Grant's... symptoms.
          
          Starla nods.
          
                                  STARLA
                    How about Brenda?
          
                                  BILL
                    New? No. We're hoping we find
                    Grant, he'll lead us to her.
          
          Starla nods. The wind is strong. Her hair is flying
          over her face. Tears come to her eyes.
          
                                     BILL
                    You all right?
          
          Starla nods.
          
                                     STARLA
                    Yeah.
          
          She moves away from him.
          
          Bill watches her go.
          
          
          INT. POLICE STATION - DAY
          
          Bill enters. A few COPS and SECRETARIES are bustling,
          making phone calls, etc. They all look tired, as if they
          haven't slept. Jack, the mayor, sees Bill.
          
                                     JACK
                    Bill!
          
          Bill spots him, moving quickly toward him.
          
                                     BILL
                    Shit.
          
                                                                 39.
          
                                  JACK
                    Bill, we need to talk!
          
                                  BILL
                    'Mornin', Jack.
          
          Bill crosses the station.   Jack follows.
          
                                  JACK
                    Bill, this Brenda's Randy Flagg's
                    niece. We need to find Grant
                    yesterday! The town council has
                    lit a Roman candle and stuck it up
                    my ass!
          
                                  BILL
                    Hell, Jack, your leisure activities
                    ain't my business.
          
                                  JACK
                    Don't fuck with me, Bill. Your
                    post here as Chief is in dire
                    straits you don't work this shit
                    out.
          
          They come to a desk with Wally and Trevor working away.
          
                                  BILL
                    Don't worry, we'll find him.
                          (to Trevor)
                    Anything new?
          
          Trevor shakes his head.
          
                                  JACK
                    How are you going to find him?
          
                                  BILL
                    Dude's a half-squid. Ain't many
                    places he can hide. Sea World,
                    maybe.
          
          Jack sees a SECRETARY making copies nearby.    He speaks in
          hushed tones:
          
                                  JACK
                    That young lady heard you say
                    'squid.' She's gonna go out and
                    create a Goddamn hysteria!
          
                                  BILL
                    Sherry, you gonna create a hysteria?
          
                                  SHERRY
                    Not today, Bill.
          
                                                               40.
          
                                  JACK
                    Still, quit that talk! You yourself
                    said it was dark in there! You
                    don't know what you saw!
          
                                  TREVOR
                    We saw his arm was all bendy.
          
                                  JACK
                    Bastard obviously got lyme disease!
          
                                   BILL
                    What?
          
                                  JACK
                    Touch some deer feces out in the
                    forest. Eat a sandwich without
                    washing your hands. Then you got
                    lyme disease.
          
                                  BILL
                    And that makes you look like a
                    squid?
          
                                  JACK
                    I'll tell you what, no one with
                    lyme disease gonna win any damn
                    handsome contests!
          
          Bill, Wally, and Trevor can't help but SNICKER.
          
                                  JACK
                    Well, screw you all for laughin'.
          
                                   SHELBY (O.S.)
                    Bill!
          
          Bill looks over at Shelby, on his headset at the dispatch
          unit.
          
                                  SHELBY
                    Another ranch attack!   Up at the
                    Castavets'.
          
          Bill nods for Trevor and Margaret to get up from their
          desks. They do, and start to move out with Bill and Wally.

          EXT. CATTLE RANCH - LATER
          
          POV: A dead rottweiler is lying on its back in the long
          grass, its gut split open and intestines spilling out,
          almost perfectly symmetrical.
          
                                                                  41.
          
                                     WALLY (O.S.)
                       It looks like one of them psyche
                       tests. What do they call it?
          
          Bill and Wally are staring at the dog from above.
          
                                     BILL
                       Rorschach.
          
                                     WALLY
                       What do you see? I see a butterfly.
          
          Bill moves on through the windswept weeds.
          
                                      BILL
                       I see we're fucked.   Three ranches
                       in three days.
          
          Margaret is taking measurements and writing in a note
          pad; she sees Bill.
          
                                     MARGARET
                       So, I think I got it part-way
                       figured. You want to hear it?
          
          Bill nods.
          
                                     MARGARET
                       So Grant -- I mean, we're saying
                       this is Grant, right?
          
          Bill nods.
          
                                     MARGARET
                       Grant kills a cow right about here.
                       See there's the blood, musta slit
                       its neck.
          
          Margaret walks backward, showing the trail of blood in
          the crushed grass.
          
                                     MARGARET
                       So he drags the cow backwards here.
                       Only he prolly didn't know 'bout
                       the Castavets had them dogs.
          
                                     TREVOR (O.S.)
                       Hey, look!
          
          Bill looks over at Trevor, standing up between the tall
          weeds, holding a dog's head in his hand.
          
                                     TREVOR
                       He knocked this'n's head clear
                       over here!
          
                                                                42.
          
                                  WALLY
                    Put that down, numbnuts!
          
          Bill peers at the various slaughtered dogs around them.
          
                                  MARGARET
                    So the dogs attacked, somehow he
                    slew 'em all, and he stole off
                    with the cow into the forest.
          
          Trevor heads toward them. Bill looks off into the dark
          forest on the edge of the ranch.
          
                                  BILL
                    He's gotta be in the forest. All
                    three ranches run alongside it.
          
                                  TREVOR
                    Think we should get up a search
                    party, head in there?
          
                                  WALLY
                    It's a hundred thousand acres. Be
                    finding a needle in a fuckstack.
          
          Bill has a realization.   He moves quickly for his car.
          
                                  BILL
                    Wally, come on. Trevor and
                    Margaret, get some folks together.
                    I think I know where he's gonna
                    hit next.
          
          
          INT. POLICE STATION - LATER
          
          CLOSEUP: A property map of Wheelsy is tacked to a bulletin
          board. Red Magic Marker circles are around various ranch
          properties on the edge of the city, next to an enormous
          forest. A finger points to one of the red circles.
          
                                  BILL
                    So the night after Grant ran off,
                    a calf went missing from here, the
                    Raglans' ranch.
          
          REVEAL Bill, standing beside the bulletin board. A posse
          has gathered, listening intently: Wally and the usual
          cops; Jack; an OLDER COP, probably pulled out of
          retirement; and a couple of recruits -- a REDNECK and a
          GOOD OL' BOY. Bill points to the next red circle.
          
                                  BILL
                    Two nights ago, a mare was stolen
                    from this property, run by
                    Fitzgibbon, that old rancher with
                    the cleft palate.
          
                                                              43.
          
          Wally whispers to Margaret, amused:
          
                                  WALLY
                    Looks like a chipmunk.
          
                                  BILL
                    Your momma wasn't too proud when
                    you came out neither, Wally.
          
          Bill points to the next circle.
          
                                  BILL
                    And then we get here, the
                    Castavets', where last night's
                    shit-storm took place.
          
                                  TREVOR
                    I see. It's like as if he's going
                    in a pattern. Is that what you're
                    saying, Bill?
          
          Bill nods and points to the next red circle.
          
                                  BILL
                    And if he sticks to that pattern
                    he'll be here next. Belongs to a
                    family, the Strutemyers'. Now I
                    know y'all are tired and you've
                    barely seen your families. But
                    we're gonna have to go there
                    tonight, lie low and wait.
          
          The posse nod, agreeing.
          
                                  REDNECK
                    Let's get that son-of-a-bitch,
                    Chief.
          
                                  BILL
                    Just remember, we don't know what
                    we're up against here. So let's
                    be careful.
          
          
          INT. POLICE STATION/ARMORY - DAY
          
          Beside a small armory, Trevor loads a Benelli M-1 super
          semiautomatic shotgun. Margaret checks the site on a
          Remington 700 PSS rifle. Bill takes a Springfield M-1A
          pump-action for himself, while Wally stuffs numerous
          pistols and ammo into a leather satchel. Trevor notices
          a dusty grenade on a shelf.
          
                                  TREVOR
                    Hey, Bill, we got that grenade we
                    confiscated from them jokers wanted
                    to use it fish for trout?
          
                                                                 44.
          
          Bill looks at Trevor, considering.
          
                                  BILL
                    Can't hurt.
          
          As Trevor puts the grenade into a side-pocket on the
          satchel, Bill sees Jack and the Older Cop, watching.
          
                                  JACK
                    I didn't know the Russkies were
                    invading there, folks.
          
                                  MARGARET
                    You seen this guy, you'd wished
                    they was.
          
          
          EXT. POLICE STATION - LATER
          
          The posse loads up their vehicles, and start taking off
          out of the parking lot.
          
          Bill and Wally walk out to their police car.   Bill tosses
          the leather satchel into the trunk.
          
          They get in the car, Bill starts the engine, when --
          
          Starla Grant pulls quickly into the parking lot. Bill
          rolls down the window as she gets out of her car and runs
          toward them.
          
                                  STARLA
                    Bill, I heard what you're doing.
                    I think I should go along.
          
                                 BILL
                    Why? Listen, it doesn't matter.
                    I gotta go.
          
          Bill starts to roll away, but Starla holds on to the car,
          following.
          
                                  STARLA
                    Wait! Dammit, Bill, if that girl's
                    still out there, how will you find
                    her? How, unless you bring Grant
                    in alive? Your best chance of
                    doing that is with me. I can talk
                    to him --
          
                                  BILL
                    He tried to kill you, Starla.
          
                                  STARLA
                    He did. I know. But I got him
                    angry 'cause I wasn't calm. This
                    time I could --
          
                                                                      45.
          
          Starla's on the verge of tears.
          
                                  STARLA
                    Please, Bill. What happened, it's
                    my fault, I know it.
          
                                  BILL
                    Starla, it ain't --
          
                                  STARLA
                    It is. He'd been acting strange.
                    And the physical changes. I should
                    have told someone right away...
                    But I was just blind. I wanted to
                    pretend it wasn't happening... If
                    I don't do what I can to help now,
                    I just couldn't live with it.
          
          Bill looks at her.   He looks at Wally.     Wally shrugs.
          
          Bill nods for Starla to get in.
          
          
          INT. STRUTEMYER KITCHEN - EVENING
          
          Kylie is blowing on a cup of coffee. Her MOM, DAD, and
          two younger SISTERS, aged 9 and 11, are relaxing after
          dinner. As Kylie's Mom picks up plates --
          
                                 KYLIE'S MOM
                    Kylie! What'd you do to your
                    fingers?
          
          Kylie's Mom grabs her hand, looking at her very long
          fingernails. They're painted sky blue and spotted with
          minute teddy bear and bumblebee decals.
          
                                  KYLIE
                    Kiri Goshima done 'em.    She's
                    Japanese.
          
                                  KYLIE'S DAD
                    Looks like Pokemons done 'em to
                    me!
          
          Kylie's sisters LAUGH out loud.
          
                                  KYLIE
                    Foreign stuff is classy if you
                    knew something.
          
          Kylie's family sees, OUT THE WINDOW, police cars pulling
          up by a gravel road.
          
                                  KYLIE'S DAD
                    Oh. There's Jack. I want y'all
                    to stay inside tonight. All right?
          
                                                                  46.
          
          Kylie's sisters nod.   Kylie too.
          
          
          EXT. STRUTEMYER FARMHOUSE - EVENING
          
          Kylie's Dad steps onto the front porch of this quaint
          family farmhouse. He sees Jack heading toward the ranch,
          and waves. Jack gives a little salute, while muttering
          to the Older Cop.
          
                                  JACK
                    This turns out to be a mountain
                    lion we're gonna look like a damn
                    bunch of idiots.
          
          The Redneck and Good Ol' Boy make their way to the ranch
          as well. They see Bill with Starla.
          
                                  REDNECK
                    Didn't know it was date night.
          
          The Good Ol' Boy LAUGHS.
          
                                  REDNECK
                    I'll be expecting you toss my salad
                    at the end of all this then,
                    Charlie.
          
                                     GOOD OL' BOY
                    Shut up.
          
          
          EXT. STRUTEMYER RANCH - MOMENTS LATER
          
          The posse fans out over this grassy land where the cattle
          graze, finding places to hide. The sun sets behind them.
          
                                                            FADE TO:
          
          
          EXT. STRUTEMYER RANCH - NIGHT
          
          Darkness has crept over the ranch, and the beautiful,
          pastoral scene has become distinctly more sinister.
          
          The wind blows hard, WHISTLING through the long weeds.
          
          A rusty rooster windmill atop the old barn twists and
          CLINKS on its half-bent perch.
          
          A piece of tarp hangs down from the barn roof, FLAPPING
          incessantly against the wooden wall.
          
          Trevor and Jack; the Redneck and the Good Ol' Boy; and
          Margaret and the Older Cop are hidden around the ranch,
          waiting, watching or dozing.
          
                                                               47.
          
          INT. STRUTEMYER BARN - NIGHT
          
          Inside the barn, the wind is only slightly quieter, and
          it's darker. Bill, Starla, and Wally are here. Bill
          peers out through the doorway at cattle drinking from the
          trough. He looks at Starla; her head tilts to the side
          as she nods off. When her head falls all the way, she
          snaps back up, and catches Bill gazing at her.
          
          Bill nods and smiles. She doesn't smile back; she's
          embarrassed and miserable and this is the last place she
          wants to be.
          
          They sit there for a moment in the dark.
          
                                  BILL
                    Hey, Starla, remember that time
                    when you were a kid and you came
                    knocking on my window in the middle
                    of the night?
          
          Wally looks at them.
          
                                  BILL
                    Starla here's twelve. Guess I was
                    fourteen. I said, 'Starla, what
                    the hell you doing out there?'
                    She tells me she's running away to
                    Hollywood to become a big star.
                    She said she knew I was in ROTC,
                    and she was gonna need a bodyguard.
                    Invited me along.
          
          Wally LAUGHS. Bill smiles. Starla is embarrassed, but
          grudgingly enjoys the story.
          
                                  BILL
                    I said, 'Starla, if there's anybody
                    can take care of herself, I think
                    it's you. I'm gonna have to
                    decline.'
          
                                  WALLY
                          (to Starla)
                    How far'd you get?
          
                                  STARLA
                    About the bus stop. Ranger Rick
                    here called my dad.
          
                                  WALLY
                    Ha! A cop from the get-go!   You
                    son-of-a-bitch!
          
                                  STARLA
                    You fucked up our fame and fortune,
                    Bill Pardy.
          
                                                               48.
          
                                  BILL
                    Yeah, maybe I did.
          
          
          EXT. STRUTEMYER RANCH - NIGHT
          
          Jack smokes a cigarette as he keeps an eye out for the
          cow killer. The burning ember of the cigarette is blown
          off by the wind. Jack searches for it in the dry grass,
          trying to catch it before it starts a fire. He crawls
          forward, slapping the ground, when he glances up and
          sees...
          
          A large, shadowy shape hulking through the trees on the
          edge of the forest.
          
          
          INT. STRUTEMYER BARN - NIGHT
          
          Bill, Starla, and Wally see Grant Grant emerging from the
          forest. He has transformed into something much more
          monstrous: a giant, gangrenous, slug-like beast, a clump
          of cells and tumor-like protuberances. He has various
          tentacle-like-arms growing out of him, like overgrown
          eyes on a potato. As opposed to just having the disease,
          he now seems to BE the disease itself.
          
                                    STARLA
                    Grant?
          
          
          EXT. STRUTEMYER RANCH - NIGHT
          
          Jack and Trevor watch in amazement as Grant slithers across
          the field, his large, dark, watery eyes searching out
          prey. Jack turns to Trevor, pissed, and whispers:
          
                                  JACK
                    You said 'squid'!
          
                                    TREVOR
                    It got worse.
          
          The Redneck and the Good Ol' Boy watch too, mouths dropped.
          
          The diseased Grant slithers through the grass just a few
          feet beside Margaret and the Older Cop. They duck below
          the grass, looking as if they're going to have heart
          attacks.
          
          Grant approaches a cow. The cow makes a little MOO of
          protest when he gets too close, and steps back.
          
          The Grant-creature stabs one of his tentacle growths into
          the cow's neck, piercing it. The cow stumbles, choking.
          Blood spurts from her neck. And she topples over.
          
                                                                49.
          
          INT. STRUTEMYER BARN - NIGHT
          
          Bill and Wally stare out the window, motionless.
          
                                  WALLY
                    What we gonna do now, Bill?   Cuffs
                    won't even fit on 'im.
          
          Starla musters courage.   She stands, and moves out of the
          barn.
          
                                  BILL
                    Starla, where you...?
          
          
          EXT. STRUTEMYER RANCH - NIGHT
          
          Grant wraps a feeler around the cow's horns, and starts
          dragging it back in the direction of the forest.
          
          
          INT. STRUTEMYER BARN - NIGHT
          
          Bill motions through the barn window to Margaret.
          
          
          EXT. STRUTEMYER RANCH - NIGHT
          
          Margaret motions to Trevor.
          
          Trevor motions to the recruits.
          
          And Starla moves slowly in toward Grant.
          
                                    STARLA
                    Grant?
          
          Grant turns and looks at her with his half-human eyes.
          His breathing is loud, raspy, and sick. He sees, in a
          wide circle around him, the nervous posse standing up,
          their guns at the ready.
          
          Starla moves even closer.   Bill and Wally are coming in
          close behind her.
          
                                   STARLA
                    Grant?   It's okay.
          
          As Starla and the posse get closer, Grant looks almost
          scared. His eyes dart around from cop to cop.
          
                                  STARLA
                    You're just sick is all. But we'll
                    take you to get help right now.
                    I'll stay by your side, Grant,
                    just like I swore I would. For
                    better or worse. Remember?
          
                                                                 50.
          
          Grant's huge milky eyes betray that he does.
          
                                     STARLA
                     Okay?
          
          The posse inch in closer, tightening the circle.
          
          Grant lets out a PIERCING SCREECH of protest.    All of the
          posse stop, terrified.
          
          Everything is quiet and still except for Grant's gross
          breathing. Deep: In, out.
          
                                     STARLA
                     Okay, Grant?    It's gonna be all
                     right.
          
          Grant SCREECHES again: a warning. He looks from Starla
          to Bill, with hurt, jealous eyes, and GROWLS.
          
          Then Grant's eyes close to half-mast, and he turns away.
          His tentacle tightens around the cow's horns, and he again
          drags it toward the forest.
          
          While Bill tries to decide what to do, the Good Ol' Boy
          nervously blocks Grant's path. He aims his pistol at
          him.
          
                                   GOOD OL' BOY
                     You stop right there, you son of a
                     bitch. I don't care what kinda
                     leprosy you got. We need to find
                     that girl. Now you can make this
                     peaceful, or you can make it hard.
          
          Pause.   Grant and the Good Ol' Boy stare at each other.
          
          And then Grant SNAPS out a tentacle-arm, whipping it up
          the front of the man's body, and back.
          
          The front of the Good Ol' Boy's whole body is split neatly
          in half. For a split second, he remains alive: the two
          different sides of his split head look down in disbelief
          as his organs spill out from inside him. And then he
          topples over.
          
                                     BILL
                     Fire!   Fire!
          
          The posse SHOOT at Grant.    Starla covers her head.
          
          Grant is struck; he SCREECHES in pain. He lets go of the
          cow. He slithers with incredible speed off toward the
          forest.
          
          Bill and the other posse members take off after him like
          hounds on the heel of their prey. They SHOOT madly.
          
                                                                 51.
          
          Starla watches as the posse follows Grant into the woods.
          
          Starla stands alone and worried a moment, and then she
          darts off after them.
          
          
          INT. KYLIE'S BATHROOM - NIGHT
          
          Kylie is running a bath.    She hears GUNSHOTS ECHO in the
          distance.
          
          She peers out a little window above the tub, trying to
          see where the shots are coming from.
          
          
          EXT. FOREST - NIGHT
          
          The posse run through this very dark forest after Grant,
          leaping over brush and rocks. They're nervous, but also
          excited, as the primordial hunting urge takes over. Their
          eyes are filled with anger and bloodlust.
          
          They're able to follow Grant only by catching glimpses --
          a flash of flesh between trees, a tentacle disappearing
          around brush.
          
                                     WALLY
                    There he is!     Over there!
          
          They FIRE at the creature, taking chunks out of trees,
          but missing. He's too fast.
          
          
          EXT. CREEK - NIGHT
          
          Grant slips around a boulder and splashes through a creek,
          and into the plentiful trees beyond. He rustles thick
          fronds as he moves up alongside the creek.
          
          The posse run up the creek itself, splashing, trying to
          peer through the leaves to get a shot at Grant.
          
          Jack, carrying his revolver, trips and falls in the creek.
          He cuts his knee on a sharp rock. He stands, and keeps
          going.
          
          They come to --
          
          
          EXT. FOREST CLEARING - NIGHT
          
          The posse come up out of the creek. They've completely
          lost track of the diseased man-beast.
          
          They stop, out-of-breath and looking around.   They whisper:
          
                                                                 52.
          
                                     TREVOR
                    Where'd he go?
          
                                  MARGARET
                    We ain't never gonna find that
                    girl now.
          
          The Redneck is WEEPING with rage.
          
                                  REDNECK
                    I'll kill that asshole what he did
                    to Charlie.
          
          Bill sees Starla run up behind them.    He waves her back.
          
                                  BILL
                    Starla, get the hell out of here!
          
          Starla takes a couple steps back, but doesn't leave. She
          watches there, half in shadows as the posse creep around,
          searching for some trail of Grant.
          
          Margaret looks down into the bubbling creek. She sees
          it's turning red. She looks up the trail of red, which
          is rippling downhill in the water. The red flow starts
          somewhere near a boulder.
          
          Bill and Wally are searching in front of the boulder.
          Margaret SEES, but they don't, Grant pulling himself up
          on a tree branch and RISING behind them. Blood from a
          shotgun wound is dripping into the creek. Grant, pissed,
          lifts a tentacle.
          
                                     MARGARET
                    Bill!!
          
          Bill turns as the tentacle swings down toward him. He
          falls back; the tentacle slashes inches from his face.
          
          Bill BLASTS his shotgun up at Grant, but Grant is already
          slithering swiftly back into the thick brush.
          
          The posse squeeze themselves though the brush, following.
          
          
          EXT. OLD BARN - NIGHT
          
          The posse emerge on the other side of the brush, only to
          be confronted by a terrible odor. They cover their noses
          and mouths as their faces shrivel in disgust.
          
                                  TREVOR
                    What the hell's that smell?
          
                                  WALLY
                    It's something dead.
          
                                                                 53.
          
          The posse gaze up at the old ramshackle barn where Grant
          had brought Brenda.
          
                                  JACK
                    It's coming from in there, ain't
                    it?
          
          Margaret looks at Bill.
          
                                  MARGARET
                    Think he's inside?
          
          Bill takes the lead, carefully approaching the barn.
          
          The posse follows, their weapons drawn. The closer they
          get to the barn, the more unbearable the smell becomes.
          Only Bill, intent on the task in front of him, doesn't
          react to the stench at all.
          
          Bill leans his ear in close to the front door, and listens.
          Through the door he can HEAR a QUIET SOBBING. Bill and
          Wally exchange a look.
          
          Bill steps back. He and Wally aim their shotguns at the
          door. Bill nods to Margaret, and gestures for her to
          open it. Starla watches all this from the rear.
          
          Margaret swings open the door.
          
          
          INT. OLD BARN - NIGHT
          
          Bill and Wally move cautiously but quickly inside.   But
          they stop suddenly, in disgust and horror.
          
                                    BILL
                    Oh...
          
          It's Brenda. And she doesn't look good. Her weepy little
          head is stuck to the front of a huge fleshy orb, which is
          what her body has become. This enormous ball of flesh is
          nine or ten feet tall. Vestigial fingers protrude from
          the sides. She is utterly immobile. Her flesh sloshes,
          slightly and constantly; a thousand snakes seem to be
          slithering beneath her thin, tight, bruised skin. The
          woman is in great pain. She SOBS. Her mouth and chin
          are stained with blood.
          
          The posse and Starla enter behind Bill and Wally and are
          equally astounded.
          
                                    OLDER COP
                    Oh, shit!
          
          They see the source of the awful stench:
          
                                                                 54.
          
          Brenda is encircled by the rotting carcasses of cows and
          horses and forest critters. They are mostly skeletal, as
          they have been largely devoured. They're swarming with
          flies. The stench is so bad the posse cover their faces
          with the bottom of their shirts.
          
          The SOBBING Brenda looks desperately at Bill and Wally.
          
                                  BRENDA
                    Something's wrong with me.
          
                                    WALLY
                    Uh, yeah.
          
          Bill and Wally get in a little closer.
          
                                    BILL
                    Brenda, um...
          
                                  BRENDA
                    I didn't want no one to be seeing
                    me like this.
          
          As the posse inch closer, Brenda's whole body suddenly
          LURCHES FORWARD a bit -- like whatever's inside her is
          trying to get out and to the posse. Brenda SCREAMS in
          agony.
          
          The posse jump back.    They stare as she recomposes herself.
          
                                  BRENDA
                    How are my boys, Bill?    Are they
                    all right?
          
                                  BILL
                    Boys are fine, Brenda. Uh, what's --
                    what's happening here, exactly?
          
                                  BRENDA
                    I'm so fucking hungry, Bill. I'm
                    so hungry. I just never knew
                    anybody could be so hungry.
          
          Brenda tries to smile in a way she might charm her Daddy
          into giving her candy. This is creepy as hell.
          
                                  BRENDA
                    Would you mind handing me a piece
                    of that possum there at your feet?
                    Little bit?
          
          Trevor gags and runs out of the barn.
          
          
          EXT. OLD BARN - NIGHT
          
          Trevor vomits into some bushes.
          
                                                                 55.
          
          INT. OLD BARN - NIGHT
          
          Bill eyes poor Brenda.
          
                                  BILL
                    I think we best get you to a
                    hospital right quick.
          
                                  WALLY
                    What the fuck they gonna do with
                    her in a hospital, Bill?
          
          Again, Brenda SCREAMS.    Her body LURCHES FORWARD.
          
                                  OLDER COP
                    Why's she doing that?!
          
                                  REDNECK
                    Her tumors is moving.
          
                                  JACK
                    Bill, get her to stop that shit!
          
                                     BRENDA
                    It hurts!
          
          Her body lurches forward AGAIN.     She sobs.
          
                                     BRENDA
                    Help me!!     Help!!
          
          And then AGAIN. Starla notices that Brenda's skin is
          starting to SPLIT AND TEAR on her side.
          
                                     STARLA
                    Bill!
          
                                  BRENDA
                    Little fuckers are tearing me
                    aparrrr- !
          
          Brenda SCREAMS like a woman giving a thousand evil births
          at once and her body RIPS OPEN in one part; and then, in
          quick succession, ANOTHER, and ANOTHER. Bill looks out
          one of the windows. Grant is peering in at them, smiling.
          
                                  BILL
                    He led us here.
          
          And then Brenda's body BURSTS OPEN COMPLETELY, like a
          water balloon hitting cement, and thousands of little
          SLITHERING EYELESS PARASITES with slippery black-red skin
          like slugs spill forth. The horrid creatures, eight inches
          long and a few inches thick, swarm over the posse,
          completely covering them before they can react.
          
                                                               56.
          
          EXT. OLD BARN - NIGHT
          
          Trevor sees the things flooding over the posse in the
          barn. The parasites are especially drawn to the posse's
          heads. Because there are so many, the weight of the beasts
          knocks most of them down.
          
          Trevor runs, but the things make it out the doorway,
          covering him like lava in One Million B.C., and he buckles.
          
          
          INT. OLD BARN - NIGHT
          
          A parasite slithers quickly and fluidly into Wally's mouth.
          He gags on it. His eyes flip back up into his head, and
          his body starts to spasm.
          
          Jack tries to pull one away from his face, but it's too
          slippery and it disappears inside his mouth. His body,
          too, convulses, and he spits up blood.
          
          Bill notices the parasites slithering into the mouths of
          the Redneck and the Older Cop as well; whites of their
          eyes, bodies convulsing, spewing blood. Bill sees the
          things oozing up Margaret's neck.
          
                                  BILL
                    Margaret, cover your mouth!
          
          Bill sees Trevor outside the door in the dirt, trying to
          slap the parasites off. Bill yells to everyone:
          
                                  BILL
                    Don't let 'em in your mouths!
          
          One starts to get in Bill's mouth as he speaks, but he
          slaps it aside. Margaret pulls her shirt over her face.
          
          Starla SHRIEKS. She puts her hand over her mouth as the
          parasites rush up her. She's knocked over, and falls
          back onto the floor.
          
          A parasite slithers between Starla's lips -- when,
          suddenly, a KNIFE thrusts down, pinning the creature to
          the dirt, stopping it from oozing further into Starla.
          
          Bill is holding the knife in one hand, his other hand
          firmly over his mouth. Bill swats more incoming parasites
          away from Starla's mouth. He covers her mouth with his
          free hand. He lies on top of her, mushing their bodies
          and faces as closely together as possible so the things
          don't get into them. The parasites swarm all over them,
          flapping their slimy little tails as they try to fight
          their way inside their mouths. But Bill holds tight to
          himself and Starla.
          
                                                                 57.
          
          Eventually, the parasites give up on Bill and Starla, and
          begin to slither away. Bill watches as they crawl off
          the posse and filter out of the barn in a squirmy mound.
          
          Eventually, they're gone. Bill takes his hand from
          Starla's mouth. Starla looks around.
          
          She sees Margaret lift her face from the ground, shivering,
          holding her shirt over her mouth. They gaze out the front
          door of the barn.
          
          
          EXT. OLD BARN - NIGHT
          
          Trevor pulls his face from the dirt and stands. He spits
          violently and wipes the dirt off his tongue with his wrist.
          
                                  TREVOR
                    They wanted us to eat 'em!   Why
                    would they want that!?
          
          
          INT. OLD BARN - NIGHT
          
          Bill is trying to make sense of it all. He gazes down at
          Brenda's body, her bloody skin and misshapen skeleton
          spread out over the floor, split open like an enormous
          bloody tiger rug.
          
          He looks around at the posse lying on the floor in mangled
          positions, their mouths and lips covered in blood, still
          lightly convulsing.
          
          He gazes out INTO THE FOREST to see the parasites rushing
          away like an ugly wormy army, shaking the brush as they
          head off in different directions.
          
                                                               CUT TO:

          Parasites crawl over rocks and out of the forest and onto
          the ranch. The Strutemyer farmhouse looms nearby.
          
          
          INT. KYLIE'S BATHROOM - NIGHT
          
          Kylie is taking a steamy bubble bath. Her head is back,
          her eyes shut; she's enjoying the warm water. The tub
          faucet drips lightly in an uneven rhythm.
          
          
          EXT. STRUTEMYERS' FARMHOUSE - NIGHT
          
          The parasites squirm up the side of the house, sticking
          to the wood siding.
          
                                                                       58.
          
            INT. KYLIE'S BATHROOM - NIGHT
          
            Kylie glances out the window beside the tub, at the starry
            sky and crescent moon, beautiful and still.
          
            There's a KNOCK on the bathroom door. Kylie turns toward
            the door -- as she does, a parasite crawls across the
            window behind her, streaking a moist slimy trail.
          
                                     KYLIE'S MOM

            O.S. Kylie GRUNTS in vague agreement.
          
            Kylie's Mom trots down the hall, to another door.
          
            She KNOCKS once, then opens the door to --

          Numerous parasites slither INTO FRAME, up the side of the

          open a few inches for air.

          Kylie's Mom shuts their door completely. The girls turn
          on their sides and close their eyes to sleep.
          
          And the parasites pour in through the cracked window.
          They slither over the walls. Their slimy black-red bodies
          contrast sharply with the pretty flowered wallpaper.
          
          
          INT. KYLIE'S BATHROOM - NIGHT
          
          The door cracks open, and a parasite enters.   It slithers
          silently over the linoleum tiles.
          
          It arrives at the base of the tub, and crawls up the side.
          
          Kylie continues relaxing, her eyes closed. She doesn't
          see the parasite enter the soapy bath water at her feet.
          
          Kylie hears a SOFT SPLASHING and peers down. She spots
          the creature swimming toward her between her knees.
          
          Kylie SHRIEKS and scrambles up to get out of the tub.    As
          she clamors out, she slips and falls to the floor.
          
          The parasite squirms up Kylie's wet naked back. Kylie
          SHRIEKS again, jumping up as she tries to slap the thing
          off.
          
                                   KYLIE
                    Mom!!
          
          The parasite winds toward her lips. Kylie goes to grab
          it with both hands, but it slips through them. The thing
          slides into Kylie's mouth as she looks down at it.
          
          Kylie snatches the very end of the parasite's tail. Her
          long, teddy-bear-spotted fingernails pinch it there,
          digging into the parasite's flesh, barely stopping it
          from sliding completely into her mouth. It wildly flaps
          its tail like a docked trout, desperate to enter her.
          
                                                                  60.
          
          Kylie falls to her knees. Her eyes roll back in her head,
          and her body spasms while she holds tenuously onto the
          very tip of the parasite's tail.
          
          We TRACK IN to a CLOSEUP of Kylie's face: a slight white
          electrical-telepathic charge can be seen SPARKING inside
          her mouth.
          
                                                           FLASH TO:
          
          
          KYLIE'S VISION
          
          We are RUSHING through some amoebic landscape, PAST
          microbes and cytoplasm and cells, and to:
          
          
          KYLIE'S VISION - SERIES OF IMAGES - CREATURE'S POV
          
          Perhaps the memories of some creature not of earth. Its
          eyesight is not like our own; it's in grainy black and
          white and amber outlines. Various images FLASH in quick
          succession, including the following:
          
          -- We are on top of an alien ANIMAL, pinning it down.    It
          HOWLS beneath us as we tear into its flesh, feasting.
          
          -- All around us, diseased monstrous BEASTS feed on more
          alien animals. They lunge toward them and pin them down,
          ripping them apart, like some National Geographic
          documentary shot in Hell.
          
          -- In FAST MOTION, unfamiliar plant life around us grows
          sick and withers, dying out.
          
          -- A group of diseased monstrous beasts CRY OUT in uniform
          pain. They buckle to their knees; now they're dying.
          
          -- The diseased beasts feed on their own appendages.
          
          
          BACK TO SCENE
          
          Kylie tries to regain control of her mind. Her eyes fight
          against flipping back in her head. Tears pour down her
          face. She pulls the parasite out just a bit.
          
          But then it SLAMS back into her and there are more SPARKS
          inside her mouth --
          
          
          KYLIE'S VISION - SERIES OF IMAGES - MANGLED INSECT POV
          
          -- We are CLIMBING UP through a creamy, gelatinous yellow.
          An opening slit widens in front of us, and we see Grant
          slowly bending to look at us, the forest behind him.
          
                                                                61.
          
          KYLIE'S VISION - SERIES OF IMAGES - GRANT'S POV
          
          -- We watch Starla soaping herself in the shower.
          
          -- We make love to Starla, our hands on her face.
          
          -- We sit over a convulsing Brenda, impregnating her with
          our tubule.
          
          -- We see the posse members coming in toward us.
          
          
          BACK TO SCENE
          
          With a last, desperate effort, Kylie yanks at the exhausted
          worm, pulling it fully from her mouth. It flaps in her
          fingers. Kylie spits up blood.
          
          Kylie tosses the parasite away from her. Though slightly
          crippled, the little bastard writhes back toward her.
          
          Kylie spots her curling iron on the counter; it's plugged
          in, the red light is on. She grabs it, and swings it
          into the wormy thing.
          
          The parasite SQUEAKS and trembles with pain. Smoke rises
          from it as Kylie digs the curling iron in deeper, burning
          it, and, finally, killing it.
          
          Kylie lifts the iron in front of her and looks at it.
          The dead parasite is stuck to it, dangling from the metal.
          
                                      KYLIE
                    Mom!!!
          
          Kylie drops the iron. She quickly steps into her clothes
          lying on the floor. She runs out of the bathroom and
          into --
          
          
          INT. STRUTEMYERS' HALLWAY - NIGHT
          
          Kylie runs to the stairway.
          
                                      KYLIE
                    Mom!!    Mom!!!
          
          Kylie stops. Dozens of the things are slithering up the
          stairs and up the handrail towards her.
          
          O.S. Kylie hears her SISTERS' SCREAMS.   She looks in their
          direction, running toward their room.
          
                                    KYLIE
                    Emily!!    Jenna!!
          
          Kylie tosses open her sisters' door.
          
                                                                  62.
          
          INT. STRUTEMYER GIRLS' BEDROOM - NIGHT
          
          Kylie's youngest sister is on her knees on the bed, a
          parasite sticking out of her mouth. Her eyes are rolled
          back. Her arms flail spastically. The slithering beast
          wags its tail as it disappears down her throat.
          
          Kylie's other sister is backing into a corner, with
          parasites crawling up her body. She's SCREAMING bloody
          hell, trying to slap them off.
          
          Kylie runs toward her to help. Kylie slaps the parasites
          off her sister. But there's too many and they're too
          fast. They slide into her sister's mouth.
          
                                    KYLIE
                    No!!   Nooo!!
          
          Her sister's eyes flip back in her skull as the thing
          disappears completely, and she starts spitting up blood.
          
          Kylie sees the parasites around the room coming at her.
          There's a clear path toward a window. Kylie runs to the
          window, and shoves it open. As the things approach her,
          she crawls out --
          
          
          EXT. STRUTEMYERS' FARMHOUSE AWNING - NIGHT
          
          Kylie steps onto this shingled, angled canopy over the
          front porch. She turns to see the parasites slithering
          out towards her. She looks down. It's probably too far
          to jump, but she has no choice.
          
          So she jumps down onto --
          
          
          EXT. STRUTEMYERS' FRONT LAWN - NIGHT
          
          Kylie lands, hard, tumbling over.
          
          She glances back at the front of the house.
          
          THROUGH THE KITCHEN WINDOW she sees her Mom and Dad, eyes
          rolled back, convulsing, spitting up blood.
          
          More parasites are crawling towards Kylie through the
          grass.
          
          She spots her family's old Luv pickup truck on the driveway
          in front of her. She breaks for it.
          
          She throws open the front door, and jumps inside.
          
          The things approach, crawling in after her. Kylie tries
          to slam the door shut, but it won't; many things are stuck
          in the door jamb.
          
                                                                    63.
          
          They SQUEAK in a chorus of pain, trying to wriggle toward
          her.
          
          So she SLAMS the door AGAIN, and AGAIN, and she slices
          the little bastards in half.
          
          
          INT. PICKUP TRUCK - NIGHT
          
          Kylie makes sure none are inside.
          
          She feels for the keys in the ignition.    There aren't
          any.
          
          The creatures crawl up and over all the pickup's windows,
          trying to get in. Slithery shadows cover over Kylie,
          leaving her in almost complete darkness.
          
          Kylie crouches down in on herself, and WAILS.
          
          
          INT. OLD BARN - NIGHT
          
          Starla, Trevor, and Margaret stand, wide-eyed and shaken.
          All three seem to be in some mild state of shock.
          
          Bill, suppressing his desperation, is trying to make
          contact on his police radio.
          
                                  BILL
                    11-41. We're gonna need paramedics
                    out here right away. We got four
                    men down.
          
          Bill listens for a response, but there's only STATIC.      He
          presses the button again.
          
                                  BILL
                    Shelby, you there?
          
          Still, only STATIC.    Bill tries another frequency.
          
                                  BILL
                    Shelby, this is Bill.     We got an
                    emergency here.
          
          STATIC.
          
                                    BILL
                    Goddammit.
          
          Bill steps outside the doorway, to see if he can get
          reception. Trailing off:
          
                                    BILL
                    Shelby?
          
                                                                 64.
          
          Starla sees Wally's body on the floor. His skin is white
          and corpse-like. His mouth is streaked with blood. Starla
          crouches beside him, and takes his pulse. Her hands are
          visibly shaking.
          
                                     MARGARET
                    Is he alive?
          
          Starla looks at Margaret, and nods.
          
                                     MARGARET
                    Praise Jesus.
          
                                  TREVOR
                    'Praise Jesus?' That's fucking
                    pushing it, Margaret.
          
          Trevor looks about to cry.
          
                                  TREVOR
                    What the hell were those things?!
                    You ever seen anything like that?
                    You ever heard of anything like
                    that?
          
          Margaret shakes her head.    Trevor looks at Starla, who
          also shakes her head.
          
                                  TREVOR
                    Me neither. And I watch 'Animal
                    Planet' all the fuckin' time!
          
          Bill re-enters.
          
                                  BILL
                    No reception out here.
          
                                  STARLA
                    Bill, I'll run out to your car,
                    call for paramedics from there.
          
                                   MARGARET
                    That's a long ways. Them worms
                    are out there.
          
                                  STARLA
                    I'll keep my mouth covered.
          
                                  BILL
                    No. I'll go. The three of you,
                    you wait here. Get these folks,
                    out of the barn. The stench and
                    rot can't be any good for 'em.
          
          Margaret and Trevor nod.    As Bill starts to leave, Starla
          grabs him.
          
                                                               65.
          
                                  STARLA
                    Be careful, Bill.
          
          Bill nods. Makes a feeble attempt at a smile.   He jogs
          off into the forest.
          
          
          EXT. FOREST CLEARING - MOMENTS LATER
          
          Bill runs into the small glade, and looks around, trying
          to remember which way he came from.
          
          He gazes between some greenery, some distance away, and
          spies a long-lashed deer munching on foliage. A couple
          more deer and a fawn are eating as well. Bill looks at
          them a moment, peaceful, perhaps a sign of some hope...
          
          And then a parasite crawls up the deer's neck and slithers
          into its mouth. Parasites crawl up the bodies and necks
          of the deer behind it. The deer buck and flounce and
          scratch trying to get the things off of them.
          
          Bill runs away as fast as he can.
          
          
          EXT. OLD BARN - NIGHT
          
          Trevor and Margaret carry Jack out of the barn. He's
          bloated, corpse-like and covered in varicose veins.
          Margaret is wearing a gag-like swatch of clothing tied
          around her mouths, to protect themselves. Trevor's gag
          is down around his chin so he can chatter.
          
                                  TREVOR
                    It's got to be some Goddamn
                    biological weapons. Government's
                    testin' 'em out on us! 'Cause who
                    gives a shit if Wheelsy disappears,
                    right?!
          
          They set down Jack and head back toward the barn.
          
                                  TREVOR
                    I hope it ain't contagious. I'll
                    be pissed as hell I turn into a
                    big mollusk. I'll fuckin' sue, I
                    swear to God.
          
          Starla, also wearing a gag, is kneeling beside Wally, who
          is similarly sick and bloated. His lips are parched and
          cracking.
          
          Starla squeezes a wet cloth, dripping all the water onto
          Wally's lips. Then she stands, and heads toward the creek.
          
                                                                  66.
          
          She doesn't see Wally open his eyes behind her. He sits
          up, and stares over at Starla with milky eyes as she kneels
          down beside the water.
          
          Starla dips the swatch of clothing into the creek, re-
          wetting it.
          
          She stands, and turns, only to see Wally directly in front
          of her, standing between trees, almost completely covered
          in darkness.
          
                                   WALLY
                     Hey, sugarplum.
          
          Pause.   Starla pulls the gag from her mouth.
          
                                      STARLA
                     What?
          
          Wally speaks with Grant's cadence.
          
                                   WALLY
                     Marriage. It's a sacred bond.
                     Just like you said.
          
          Starla stares at him.   Wally almost looks weepy.
          
                                   WALLY
                     I'm sorry 'bout trying to strangle
                     you and all. I lost -- Lost my
                     head. I didn't want to do none of
                     the things I done. Not kill them
                     pets. Not make Brenda a womb.
                     But it's my nature, ain't it? How
                     can you blame a one for actin'
                     according to his nature?
          
          Starla, too freaked to speak, takes a step back from him.
          
                                   WALLY
                     I wanted to tell you what was going
                     on. But I didn't - didn't think
                     you'd love me no more. I never
                     knew... love, Starla, I --
          
          Trevor and Margaret are setting down the Older Cop.   They
          see Wally standing. Margaret pulls down her gag.
          
                                      MARGARET
                     Wally?
          
          Wally turns and stares at her like some angry animal.
          
                                      MARGARET
                     You all right?
          
          Wally doesn't answer.
          
                                                                  67.
          
                                  MARGARET
                    Maybe you better sit back down.
                    You don't look so good.
          
                                   TREVOR
                    Margaret.
          
          Trevor's staring at something. Margaret follows his eye
          line. Jack and the Older Cop are sitting up, staring at
          her, just like Wally.
          
          The Redneck stumbles into the barn doorway, also staring
          at them.
          
          
          EXT. STRUTEMYERS' FARMHOUSE/INT. PICKUP TRUCK - NIGHT
          
          Kylie is still alone in the Luv truck. The windows are
          clear; the parasites have abandoned their quest, just as
          they did with the posse in the barn. But Kylie stays in
          the car, trembling, afraid to leave.
          
          She HEARS a DOOR OPEN. She sees her parents and her
          sisters come stumbling out the front door of her home.
          They're also bloated and diseased. Their chins and shirts
          are stained with the blood they spit up.
          
                                  KYLIE'S DAD
                    Kylie, honey, you okay? Come on
                    out.
          
          Her family lumbers up to the truck. They peer in with
          their milky eyes. Her youngest sister pushes her face up
          close to the window.
          
                                   KYLIE'S SISTER 2
                    Hi, Kylie.   It's me.
          
          Her family tries the door handles, but they're locked.
          
                                  KYLIE'S MOM
                    Open the door, sweetie. I know we
                    don't look so good, but your mommy
                    and daddy love you.
          
                                   KYLIE
                    Get away!!
          
                                  KYLIE'S MOM
                    Now, Kylie, there's no excuse why
                    not to be with your family. This
                    is family fun day, isn't it?
          
          They continue RATTLING the door handles, over and over.
          They SLAP the windows.
          
          Kylie SOBS.   Her sister speaks in a singsongy voice:
          
                                                                    68.
          
                                  KYLIE'S SISTER 1
                    Kyyy-leee, this is your last cha-
                    ance.
          
          Her Dad leans over and picks up a large rock. He carries
          it toward the truck. He holds it up over the windshield.
          
          Kylie SCREAMS as he SMASHES it down. The windshield
          CRACKS, but doesn't shatter. He holds it up again.
          
          
          EXT. FOREST NEAR STRUTEMYER'S - NIGHT
          
          Bill, out of breath, runs out of the forest --
          
          
          EXT. STRUTEMYERS' RANCH - NIGHT
          
          Bill emerges on the edge of the ranch, stretching five or
          six acres out in front of him. On the other side of the
          field is the gravel road, where his police car is parked.
          Beside the field is the Strutemyer's farmhouse.
          
          Bill HEARS a CRASH. He turns to see the diseased
          Strutemyers in their driveway, all holding rocks now,
          smashing the pickup's windows.
          
                                  BILL
                    Hey!
          
          The Strutemyers stop, mid-swing.   They turn toward him.
          
          Kylie sees Bill through the rear windshield.    She unlocks
          the door, and jumps out of the car.
          
                                  BILL
                    What's -- ?
          
          Kylie runs past her family and up to Bill.    She grabs
          onto him, and hides behind him, WEEPING.
          
                                  BILL
                    What's going on here?
          
          Kylie's Dad's cadence is also like Grant's:
          
                                  KYLIE'S DAD
                    Well, hello there, Pardy.
          
                                  BILL
                    What happened to you, Dwight?
          
          Kylie's Dad looks down at his own bloated arm.
          
                                  KYLIE'S DAD
                    Poison ivy out back, maybe?
          
                                                                   69.
          
                                   KYLIE'S SISTERS
                    We're itchy!
          
          Kylie is obviously in shock.
          
                                  KYLIE
                    They're not my... They killed...
          
                                 BILL
                    Okay. Y'all just wait in this
                    spot. I'm gonna call the paramedics
                    for you. Kylie can come with --
          
                                  RANCHER (O.S.)
                    Hey there, killer.
          
          Bill turns to see the RANCHER with the cleft palate, now
          diseased, holding a shovel. He swings it into Bill,
          knocking him down.
          
          Kylie SCREAMS. Her family runs in toward them. She looks
          around to see a couple more DISEASED RANCHERS rushing
          toward them through the fields.
          
          The Cleft Palate Rancher stands over Bill and raises the
          shovel to bring it down again.
          
          Bill feels for his shotgun, which has fallen into the
          dirt beside him. He yanks the trigger.
          
          The BLAST hits the Rancher in the foot.    He buckles.
          
          Bill stands, pulling Kylie with him as the other diseased
          folks rush toward them through the fields.
          
                                   BILL
                    Come on.
          
          Bill and Kylie dash toward the cluster of cars as the
          diseased chase them.
          
          
          EXT. OLD BARN - NIGHT
          
          The infected posse -- Wally, Jack, the Older Cop, and the
          Redneck recruit -- are all coming in towards Trevor and
          Margaret.
          
                                  MARGARET
                    Now, what'd I say?! Y'all just
                    sit down! You need to get some
                    Goddamn rest! You're sick!
          
          Starla watches this, by herself, next to the creek.      She
          eyes a rifle in the dirt.
          
                                                               70.
          
          Jack grabs a fistful of Trevor's hair and restrains his
          arms. Wally pulls his pistols from their holsters and
          tosses them into the dirt.
          
                                  TREVOR
                    Let go!!
          
          Margaret goes to grab her pistol, when the Redneck opens
          his mouth wide and --
          
          GLEEKS; that is, he sends a yellowish globby-stream
          shooting out of the back of his throat. The glob SPLASHES
          on Margaret's hand. Margaret SCREAMS, drops the pistol.
          
                                  MARGARET
                    It burns!!
          
          Margaret looks at her hand as the gleek-liquid sinks into
          her skin. The hand is swelling monstrously. It's soft.
          Parts of it are nearly dripping off the bone.
          
                                  MARGARET
                    What'd you do to my fuckin' hand?!
          
          Jack opens his mouth and GLEEKS too -- shooting the stream-
          glob forward and onto her neck. Margaret SCREAMS again,
          grabbing onto her neck.
          
          Margaret tries to speak, but she struggles just to breathe,
          as her neck puffs up, impeding her thorax.
          
                                  OLDER COP
                    Meat.
          
          The Older Cop buries his fingers into her neck. The puffy
          flesh comes off easily; it's soft, almost creamy. He
          stuffs the flesh into his mouth, eating it.
          
          As Margaret topples over, dying, the other posse members
          turn to look at a very freaked-out Trevor. The Redneck
          opens his mouth at him, when --
          
                                  STARLA (O.S.)
                    Let him go!
          
          The posse turn and see Starla, who has made her way over
          to where the rifle was on the ground, and is now pointing
          the rifle at the posse, trembling.
          
                                  STARLA
                    Trevor, come on.
          
          Surprised, they release Trevor.
          
                                  STARLA
                    What'd you do to her?!
          
                                                                      71.
          
            Jack stares at Starla.    He too speaks with Grant's cadence.
          
                                    JACK
                      There you go, sugarplum! Why you
                      choosing camps 'fore you hear --
          
                  JACK                            REDNECK
          Both sides of the story!?       Both sides of the story!?
          
                                    STARLA
                      Why are you talking like Grant?!
          
            The posse moves toward her. Starla is CRYING. The posse
            makes a COLLECTIVE SCREECHING sound, then speaks again:
          
                                    WALLY
                      'Cause I am Grant!
          
                  WALLY                           REDNECK
          I'm you husband --              I'm you husband, Goddammit --
          
                                    JACK
                      You swore to honor and obey --
          
                  OLDER COP                       REDNECK
          Obey me --                      Obey me, so put that Goddamn
                                          gun down.
          
                                    STARLA
                      Don't come any closer.    I'll...
                      shoot.
          
                                    WALLY
                      You ain't gonna shoot me! You
                      always needed me to protect you!
                      You for damn sure ain't got the
                      balls to --
          
            Starla BLASTS Wally, blowing open a big crater into his
            face.
          
            Wally falls to his knees.    Starla and Trevor look on in
            shock, as they see...
          
            A slithering parasite squirming out of the crater on his
            face -- out of the Wally's brain.
          
            The little thing squirms down Wally's body and slithers
            off quickly into the woods. Wally falls over, dead.
          
            The sick posse look at Starla, surprised, infuriated.
          
            And then they leap at her.
          
            Starla tries to shoot them.   But she's out of ammo.
          
                                                                  72.
          
          She and Trevor turn and dash away as quickly as their
          legs can take them.
          
          
          EXT. TREE-THICK FOREST - NIGHT
          
          Trevor and Starla run in a zigzag pattern through trees
          rooted closely together, panicked, breathing heavy.
          
                                  TREVOR
                    Oh shit oh shit oh shit oh shit!
          
          
          EXT. STRUTEMYERS' RANCH - NIGHT
          
          Bill and Kylie arrive at his police car. Bill throws the
          door open, and shoves Kylie inside. As he starts to get
          in, he turns to see the two little girls closing in.
          
          One opens her mouth and GLEEKS -- it shoots out and lands
          on the car right beside Bill's hand.
          
          The other little girl opens her mouth to GLEEK as Bill
          jumps into the driver's seat. He slams the door shut
          just as the oozy liquid splashes on the window beside
          him.
          
          Bill is grossed-out by this, but he doesn't have much
          time. He goes to reload his shotgun, when he remembers.
          
                                   BILL
                    Shit.   Ammo's in the trunk.
          
          He grabs the police radio.
          
                                   BILL
                    Trevor!   Margaret!
          
          
          EXT. TREE-THICK FOREST - NIGHT
          
          Trevor turns and sees Jack, the Redneck, and the Older
          Cop leap powerfully over the brush behind them, coming in
          fast. But he's able to grab onto his radio.
          
                                  TREVOR
                    They killed Margaret!
          
          
          EXT. STRUTEMYERS' RANCH - NIGHT
          
          Kylie's two sisters jump onto the hood, SCREECHING.   They
          SLAM rocks on the windshield. Kylie SCREAMS.
          
                                  BILL
                          (into radio)
                    Where are you?!
          
                                                               73.
          
                                  TREVOR (O.S.)
                    We're coming your way, man!
          
          Bill JAMS the car forward, knocking the sisters off the
          hood. Then he slams on the brakes.
          
          He looks back and sees the two little girls running toward
          the car again.
          
          And he sees the mass of diseased ranch families also
          running toward the car. Kylie is SCREAMING and CRYING.
          
                                    KYLIE
                    Go!   Go!   Please!
          
          But, instead, of pulling forward on the gravel road, Bill
          turns up and onto the ranch itself -- back towards the
          running diseased.
          
                                  BILL
                    My friends are still in the forest.
          
          Bill speeds the police car over the dirt field, trying to
          avoid approaching ranchers. Some leap at the car, holding
          on and getting tossed aside. Bill zooms back toward the
          trees.
          
          Just as Bill gets a little headway on the diseased, the
          car gets stuck in some mud. The wheels spin, spraying
          mud, as the infected approach.
          
          
          INT. TREE-THICK FOREST - NIGHT
          
          Starla looks back to see Jack right behind her.
          
          
          EXT. STRUTEMYERS' RANCH - NIGHT
          
          The infected arrive at the car. Bill just lets his foot
          off the gas, and sits there, letting the ranchers leap
          onto the car. Kylie looks at Bill, panicked by his choice
          to do nothing.
          
                                  BILL
                    We need their weight.
          
          Bill slams down the gas again, and the car zooms forward.
          The diseased get knocked off.
          
                                    BILL
                    Dumbshits.
          
          Bill rushes toward the trees of the forest.
          
                                                                74.
          
          INT. FOREST - NIGHT
          
          Starla keeps running, when she trips and falls. She looks
          down to see she stumbled over old barbed wire fencing,
          now long fallen and curling on the forest floor. Starla
          forces herself up, as Jack closes in.
          
          Jack grabs onto her blouse, SCREECHING furiously.   When
          he HEARS something and looks over to see:
          
          Bill's police car, cruising over the forest floor, directly
          toward him. Jack, frightened, lets go of Starla. He's
          about to get hit when --
          
          The police car suddenly stops, jammed between two trees,
          inches from Jack.
          
          Jack smiles, and moves toward Bill -- but Starla rises
          behind him, holding a sharp rusty stake from the barbed-
          wire fence.
          
          She thrusts it forward, hard; and it pops out the front
          of Jack's neck.
          
          Jack turns to look at Starla, and topples over into the
          leaves.
          
          Bill backs the car out from between the trees. He sees
          the Older Cop and Redneck coming in toward them.
          
                                  BILL
                    Come on!
          
          Trevor and Starla get into the car.   The Older Cop watches
          them back away and yells:
          
                                  OLDER COP
                    Starla!!
          
          
          EXT. ROAD AWAY FROM FOREST - MOMENTS LATER
          
          The police car pulls up and out of the forest. The car
          is in bad shape. Steam rises from the smashed grill.
          
          Bill looks to his side; he's down a bit from the
          Strutemyers' ranch. He pulls away, heading back toward
          town.
          
          The foursome sit in a stupefied daze. Starla's beside
          Bill. Trevor and Kylie are in the back. Bill grabs the
          police radio.
          
                                  BILL
                    Shelby?
          
                                                                 75.
          
          Nothing. STATIC.   Everyone notes this, worried.    Bill
          tries again:
          
                                  BILL
                    Shelby, you there?
          
          For a moment, there's nothing.    And then:
          
                                   SHELBY (O.S.)
                    Yo, Chief.   How y'all doin'?
          
          Bill and Starla look at each other, relieved.
          
          
          INT. POLICE STATION - NIGHT
          
          Shelby sits at the police operator's unit, peppy.
          
                                  SHELBY
                    You dig that rat out of the hole?
          
          
          INTERCUT POLICE CAR AND STATION
          
                                  BILL
                    Listen, you got any reports of...
                    I don't know what you call 'em.
                    They look like big slugs, only
                    fast.
          
                                  SHELBY
                    Slugs? No. 'Less you talkin'
                    about that new waitress down at
                    Sloan's! Ha ha!
          
                                   BILL
                    Shelby --
          
                                  SHELBY
                    Oh, shit! I hope she ain't a police
                    radio aficionado. If so, I apolog -
          
                                  BILL
                    Shelby, shut up. Keep an eye out
                    for these things. If you see 'em,
                    keep your mouth covered. Otherwise
                    they'll go straight down it. All
                    right?
          
          Shelby looks confused, and nods.
          
                                  BILL
                    Are you nodding?
          
                                   SHELBY
                    Yeah.
          
                                                                  76.
          
                                  BILL
                    I can't hear when you're nodding.
          
                                    SHELBY
                    Sorry.
          
                                  BILL
                    We'll be there in ten minutes.
          
          Bill hangs up. Kylie is clutching onto herself, hollow-
          eyed, in deep shock. She mutters, almost unintelligibly:
          
                                  KYLIE
                    The worms are in their brains.
          
          Starla, Bill, and Trevor look at her.
          
          
          INSERT - FOREST
          
          The CAMERA TRACKS QUICKLY FORWARD, through the forest,
          and to a CLOSEUP on the Redneck, who is hunched over
          Margaret's body, eating her flesh.
          
          MATCH CUT TO a CAT SCAN of the REDNECK'S HEAD: a parasite
          is imbedded into his brain; its tail hangs down his spine,
          wagging just a bit.
          
                                  KYLIE (O.S.)
                    Drivin' 'em around...
          
          
          BACK TO THE POLICE CAR
          
          Bill stares at Kylie like she's insane.
          
                                  STARLA
                    She's right. We saw one -- one
                    came out of Wally's head.
          
                                 TREVOR
                    Yeah. Sort of his eye, it came
                    out there --
          
                                  STARLA
                    Kylie, how do you --
          
          Kylie is rocking back and forth.
          
                                  STARLA
                    Kylie, how do you know that?
          
          Kylie shakes her head.    She doesn't want to answer.
          
                                    BILL
                    Kylie, honey.    Please.

                                  BILL (CONT'D)
                    A lot of bad things have happened
                    to you today, we know. But we
                    need your help to find out what's
                    going on.
          
          Kylie CRIES.
          
                                  KYLIE
                    I was in the bath. It tried to go
                    inside me and I -- for a minute I
                    became it.
          
                                     BILL
                    The worm?
          
                                     KYLIE
                    I got it out.
          
                                     TREVOR
                    What are they?
          
                                     KYLIE
                    Part of him.
          
                                     BILL
                    Who?
                           (pause)
                    Who?
          
                                  KYLIE
                    Mrs. Grant's husband.
          
          Starla stares at her.
          
                                  KYLIE
                    But not always. I was -- He was...
                    other stuff too.
          
                                  STARLA
                    What other stuff?
          
          Kylie kind of points at the sky.
          
                                  TREVOR
                    He's a fucking Martian?!
          
                                  BILL
                    A Martian is from Mars, Trevor.
          
          Kylie tries to think.
          
                                  KYLIE
                    For real it looks like a needle.
                    Its real face. But it always gots
                    another.

                                  KYLIE (CONT'D)
                    He goes from place to place,
                    worlds... planets... killing 'em.
                    He takes over half of what's alive
                    and eats the other half. Till
                    they're gone.
          
          They stare at her, freaked out.
          
                                     KYLIE
                    Now he's here.     He went in Mr.
                    Grant.
          
                                  STARLA
                    Through a wound on his stomach?
          
          Kylie nods.
          
                                  KYLIE
                    He took him over. His body. His --
                    his brain, everything what he knew.
                    He's only been dumb stuff before -
                    amoeba-things, and rhino-things.
                    He liked being human. Didn't want
                    to change.
          
                                  STARLA
                    And you said the worms are part of
                    him. They're all linked, like one
                    creature?
          
                                  KYLIE
                    When one sees you they all see
                    you.
          
                                  STARLA
                    An animal that doesn't procreate.
                    It spreads, grows. A living
                    disease.
          
                                   BILL
                          (to Kylie)
                    So the way to stop this thing is
                    to stop Grant?
          
          Kylie shrugs.   The police car starts CHUGGING.
          
                                     BILL
                    Shit.
          
          The car slows, and comes to a stop.
          
          
          EXT. ROAD TOWARD WHEELSY - MOMENTS LATER
          
          Bill, Starla, Kylie, and Trevor step slowly out of the
          car. They look around the deserted road.
          
                                                                79.
          
          The wide-open night is shrouded in darkness. Quiet.
          They can see the lights of Wheelsy down the road in front
          of them.
          
          Bill speaks into the radio again, as he gets his leather
          satchel of weaponry out of the trunk. Trevor grabs ammo
          from the satchel to reload his pistol.
          
                                     BILL
                       Shelby, we broke down on 22, a
                       mile outside town. Come pick us
                       up.
          
                                     SHELBY (O.S.)
                       I got to leave my post.
          
                                      BILL
                       Do it.
          
          
          MOMENTS LATER
          
          The foursome walks down the road, toward the city.   Starla
          and Bill are in the lead.
          
                                      BILL
                       Hey, Starla.
          
          She looks at him.
          
                                     BILL
                       Was always curious why you...
                       married Grant in the first place...
                       Just never seemed outta love.
          
                                     STARLA
                       I know what people say, Bill.
                       I... Remember, back in high school
                       I worked at my father's gas station?
          
          Bill nods.
          
                                     STARLA
                       Grant used to get filled up every
                       day. I knew it was just to see
                       me. He was too old -- But he was
                       handsome. And he had that big ol'
                       Lincoln then. I flirted with him.
          
                                     BILL
                       Well, big ol' Lincoln, sure. Guess
                       I would have flirted with him too.
          
          Starla smiles, thinks.
          
                                                             80.
          
                                     STARLA
                       My father, he was -- he was real
                       close to evil. People didn't know.
                       Still don't. From the time I was
                       a toddler he'd beat the hell out
                       of me. I don't mean just like a
                       smack for smart-mouthing... he
                       took a real enjoyment in it. And
                       when I turned eleven or twelve,
                       things... well, they got worse.
          
          Starla looks at Bill, who seems struck.
          
                                     BILL
                       When you wanted to run away, I
                       called your dad.
          
                                     STARLA
                       That wasn't a good night, no.
          
                                     BILL
                       I'm sorry.
          
          Starla shrugs it off.
          
                                     STARLA
                       Anyway, Grant rolls in one day. I
                       fill his tank with like an eighth-
                       a-gallon as usual. And he notices
                       my lip's all swollen up, and starts
                       asking me how it happened. I don't
                       know why I chose then, why Grant --
                       I guess I saw an opportunity. And
                       I told him everything, first time
                       I told anyone. Grant was furious.
                       He picked up a tire iron, walked
                       straightaway into the garage, and
                       beat my father half to death. You
                       say it's not about love, Bill.
                       But that was the closest thing to
                       it I ever knew.
          
          Pause.
          
                                     STARLA
                       Grant asked me to marry him a few
                       weeks later. I felt... safe with
                       him.
          
          Bill nods.    Starla looks at him, smiles.
          
                                     STARLA
                       After all this shit tonight, I
                       know for sure now you regret not
                       running off with me to Hollywood!
          
                                                                 81.
          
                                    BILL
                    Hell, Starla.    I always regretted
                    that.
          
          Starla looks at him, moved.
          
          Trevor looks at Kylie, shivering and terrified.
          
                                  TREVOR
                    Don't worry, kid. Pretty soon,
                    we'll be in town, everything'll be
                    fine.
          
          
          EXT. WHEELSY CITY LIMIT - NIGHT
          
          A slithering parasite squirms over a paint-chipped sign
          that reads "WELCOME TO WHEELSY, SOUTH CAROLINA, THE WHEELS
          OF THE FUTURE," featuring early-'sixties graphics of a
          utopian future.
          
          THE CAMERA MOVES DOWN to the road, where hundreds of
          slithering parasites squirm into the city. They divide
          off in thin lines heading toward the various homes.
          
          We MOVE UP TO a WINDOW on a SMALL HOUSE, through which we
          can see an OVERWEIGHT WOMAN in spasms with a slithering
          thing in her mouth.
          
          We PAN TO the WINDOW of the HOME NEXT DOOR, where we can
          see a FAMILY gathered around a CORPSE, feasting on his
          goopy flesh.
          
          
          EXT. ROAD TOWARD WHEELSY - NIGHT
          
                                    STARLA
                    What's that?
          
          Our foursome look up to see a Buick Century parked at a
          haphazard angle in the middle of the road. The driver's
          side door is open. The headlights are still on.
          
          They look at each other. Bill takes his flashlight off
          his belt and aims it in front of him. They all slowly
          approach the car, in the darkness.
          
          Bill aims his flashlight into the Buick.   The keys are
          still there, but no one's inside.
          
          Trevor looks at the grill of the car.   It's dented.
          
                                  TREVOR
                    They musta hit a deer. Probably
                    got out to see if it's okay.
          
          Bill and the others look around.
          
                                                                  82.
          
          Bill hears a LAPPING sound behind him.   He turns, aiming
          the flashlight downward.
          
          A DISEASED DEER is lapping a thick purple tongue on the
          wound of a dead man. The sick creature is mostly hairless
          and pink and covered in veins. Bulbous black eyes hang
          on the sides of its head like a goldfish's.
          
          The diseased deer glances up at Bill and GROWLS a low
          growl.
          
                                  BILL
                    Fuck me.
          
          The deer springs upward, bringing his hoofs into Bill's
          chest. Bill is knocked violently to the gravel, dropping
          his shotgun and satchel. The deer rears back and brings
          his hoofs down into Bill again. They CRACK Bill's head
          against the hard road.
          
          Kylie, Trevor, and Starla see diseased deer coming in at
          them from different directions. The deer SCREECH like
          dying rabbits.
          
                                  TREVOR
                    Bambi-rats!
          
          Trevor aims his pistol at a DEER jumping toward him. He
          SHOOTS, misses. The deer knocks him down. The deer stomps
          his feet, rearing up and down on Trevor's ribs, almost
          like a little dance. The deer tears at Trevor's sleeve
          with decidedly carnivorous teeth, forcing him into letting
          go of his gun.
          
          Kylie SCREAMS. She dives into a small space beneath a
          rock overhang on the side of the road. She watches what's
          going on from there.
          
          Starla sees the Buick a few yards away. She glances beside
          her to see the largest diseased deer of all, a HORNED
          BUCK, careening toward her.
          
          She dashes toward the Buick as fast as she can.
          
          A TUMOROUS DOE leaps onto Bill, biting into his shoulder
          and tearing at his flesh, so now he has two deer on him.
          Bill is bleeding, dizzy, and disoriented, but he's able
          to turn, just a bit, to see the barrel of his shotgun
          above him. He tries to scoot himself back as he's being
          battered. He reaches up for the shotgun; but the tips of
          his fingers barely graze the muzzle.
          
          Starla arrives at the Buick, and starts to crawl into the
          front seat.
          
          But the horned buck is upon her.   He bites into Starla's
          ankle. She SCREAMS.
          
                                                                 83.
          
          He yanks back on her, half pulling her onto the road.
          But Starla grabs onto the steering wheel with all her
          might, and pulls against the horned buck's massive power.
          
          The deer on Trevor starts pulling him off, dragging him
          down the road as he HOLLERS.
          
          Kylie, underneath the rock overhang, watches Bill try to
          scoot himself back and reach for the shotgun. It's just
          a little too far away. She works up her nerve and slowly
          starts to crawl out toward him.
          
          As Starla is stretched between the horned buck pulling on
          her ankle, and her hand on the steering wheel, she's able
          to flip on her side and turn the keys in the ignition;
          the ENGINE STARTS. She reaches one hand down to the
          floorboard, pressing on the gas.
          
          The Buick lurches forward, wrenching her away from the
          horned buck's mouth.
          
          Bill reaches again for the barrel of his rifle. It's too
          far away. But then he sees Kylie, at the butt of the
          rifle. She reaches out and pushes it just a little, into
          Bill's hand. Bill grips the muzzle like a baseball bat,
          and swings it into the face of the deer jumping on him,
          knocking the beast back.
          
          The deer tries to stumble forward again, but its whole
          head and neck have been knocked askew. It topples over,
          dead.
          
          Bill flips the shotgun forward into his hands. He stuffs
          the muzzle into the tumorous doe biting into his leg.
          The deer looks at him. Blood is running down Bill's face
          and he looks half-crazed. Bill glances down and sees the
          telephone wire wrapped around her ankle.
          
          Bill pulls the trigger, destroying her.
          
          He stands, looking around for the deer with Trevor. It
          has dragged him a fair distance down the street. Bill
          SHOOTS once, missing it, and again, hitting it straight
          on.
          
          Kylie looks around to see more diseased deer running
          through the fields toward them.
          
          Starla pulls herself into the driver's seat and backs up
          alongside her friends. Throws open the passenger door.
          
                                  STARLA
                    Get in!
          
                                                                84.
          
          INT. BUICK CENTURY - MOMENTS LATER
          
          Bill fumbles for the radio controls.
          
                                     BILL
                    Shelby!
          
          Trevor looks out the window, watching the deer fade away
          behind them.
          
                                  TREVOR
                    When I buy my zoo, I'm leaving
                    them things the hell out!
          
                                     BILL
                    Shelby!
          
                                  SHELBY (O.S.)
                    Hey there, Chief.
          
                                  BILL
                    Shelby! We need people out here
                    at Cosgrove and McCammon right
                    away!
          
                                  SHELBY (O.S.)
                    Don't worry, Chief.
          
          
          EXT. MAIN STREET - NIGHT
          
          Shelby, sick and bloated, speaks into his radio, as he
          moves down the street with a hoard of the infected.
          
                                  SHELBY
                    Already on our way.
          
          
          BACK TO BUICK
          
          Kylie turns her head, and glances out the window.   And
          SCREAMS. Starla, Bill, and Trevor turn to see --
          
          An SUV barreling straight towards them.
          
          It SLAMS hard into the side of the Buick.
          
          And SMASHES the car back, across a short lot, and through
          the glass storefront of a flower store.
          
          
          INT. FLOWER STORE - NIGHT
          
          The Buick and SUV are destroyed, amidst the ruins of this
          store. Shattered vases and flowers surround them. Glass
          fragments dangle from the window frame. Some fall and
          CLINK to the floor.
          
                                                                   85.
          
          Starla lifts her battered head from the wheel. She looks
          beside her to see Bill and Trevor, seemingly unconscious.
          
          She looks back at Kylie. The impact has killed her. Her
          neck is bent at an ungodly angle. Bone juts up out of
          her skin.
          
          Starla looks out her rear window and sees the SUV door
          open, and the DISEASED DRIVER stumble out. His body is
          battered and broken, but, still, he lumbers toward her.
          He tries to speak, but his jaw is broken, and only a MUMBLY
          MOAN comes out.
          
          Starla struggles to get out of the car. Eventually, she
          does, and she falls to the floor, amidst the broken glass
          from the shattered window, and the water all over the
          floor from the broken vases.
          
          She sees the moaning driver limping toward her.   He's
          still trying to speak, but he's unintelligible.
          
          The driver gets close, ready to grab her. Starla sees a
          metal bar. She grabs it. And SLAMS it into the diseased
          man's shin.
          
          He topples over.
          
          She crawls onto the fallen driver and brings the metal
          bar down into his head, again and again, SHOUTING and
          CRYING with fury.
          
          Starla looks down at the man, who is very dead.
          
          Starla looks up to see dozens of DISEASED TOWNSFOLK coming
          at her, from down the street, between buildings. They
          see Starla there.
          
                                  DISEASED TOWNSFOLK
                    Starrrrrlaaaaaa!!
          
          Bill and Trevor limp up behind Starla, pulling her toward
          a door on the back wall.
          
                                  BILL
                    Come on.
          
          
          INT. FLOWER STORE STORAGE AREA - MOMENTS LATER
          
          Bill closes and locks the door behind them.
          
          
          EXT. FLOWER STORE - NIGHT
          
          The diseased townsfolk surround the little store on all
          sides. They SCREECH.
          
                                                                 86.
          
          INT. FLOWER STORE STORAGE AREA - NIGHT
          
                                  TREVOR
                    What the hell are we going to do?!
          
                                  BILL
                    Just block the doors, any way you
                    can.
          
          Bill grabs hammers and nails off a hardware bench.
          
          Trevor knocks things off shelves and yanks up the metal
          shelving.
          
          Starla looks doubtful of this whole activity.   But still,
          she helps.
          
          The storeroom has two doors.    They start nailing anything
          over them they can.
          
          Trevor sees some slithering parasites coming in through a
          crack in the upper corner of the room.
          
                                  TREVOR
                    Goddamn snakes!!
          
          Trevor aims his pistol at the things and starts shooting
          wildly at them, BLASTING up the whole room.
          
          Bill and Starla see slithering parasites coming in from
          other cracks in the room as well. They also BLAST at
          them. Dust is all around; they can hardly see.
          
          Bill runs out of ammo. He grabs a hand-held Black and
          Decker electric circular saw and turns it on. He starts
          jamming it into the parasites, cutting them up, and putting
          big slices in the floor. They SQUEAK with pain.
          
          
          EXT. FLOWER STORE - NIGHT
          
          The diseased townsfolk WAIL and SLAP their hands on the
          walls, almost rhythmically, like some tribal ritual.
          Some push on the doors.
          
          
          INT. FLOWER STORE STORAGE AREA - NIGHT
          
          Bill hears something POP behind him. He turns to see a
          little hole in one of the doors. Three diseased fingers
          slip inside, trying to pull away more.
          
          Bill uses the circular saw to cut off the fingers.
          
          An arm pops through the door.    Bill slams the circular
          saw into that. Blood spurts.     Bone grinds.
          
                                                               87.
          
          A man's eye peeks through another crack. Bill jams the
          circular saw through the crack and into the man's face.
          
          
          EXT. FLOWER STORE - NIGHT
          
          The FACE-SAWED MAN backs away from the hole, clutching
          his bleeding eye.
          
          
          INT. FLOWER STORE STORAGE AREA - NIGHT
          
          Bill spots a wide piece of shelving falling off the door
          across from him. He runs over to the space, when the
          circular saw stops turning. Bill turns to see he's
          accidentally unplugged it.
          
          
          EXT. FLOWER STORE - NIGHT
          
          The diseased townsfolk have all gathered on one side of
          the building now, putting all their efforts into tearing
          down one door. Some have even climbed onto the roof above
          it, curling off the gutter and roofing overhead.
          
          
          INT. FLOWER STORE STORAGE AREA - NIGHT
          
          Bill grabs his leather satchel, and starts to reload his
          shotgun. Starla sees that the diseased townsfolk have
          almost torn down one of the doors.
          
                                  STARLA
                    This is stupid.
          
          Starla goes to the other door, and starts tearing away
          the planks they nailed there.
          
                                  BILL
                    What are you doing?!
          
                                  STARLA
                    We can't make it. Just get away,
                    when you get the chance.
          
                                   BILL
                    What?
          
                                  STARLA
                    He wants me, Bill! I'm going to
                    get him to take me to him! See if
                    you can follow me, and kill him!
          
                                   BILL
                    No, Starla!   No!
          
                                                                     88.
          
            Another full metal plate is pushed off the door. A
            DISEASED MAN'S face peeks through. Trevor swirls to see
            it. The Man GLEEKS, hitting Trevor on his chest. Trevor
            looks down, in shock.
          
            And the whole door and part of the wall bursts open. The
            Diseased pour inside and around Trevor, GLEEKING all over
            him, splattering his body with the burning liquid. Trevor
            starts to puff up, swelling, becoming soft. They grab
            him.
          
                                     BILL
                      Nooo!
          
            Bill grabs Trevor by the wrist, and tries to pull him
            away from them. But Trevor SCREAMS in agony; the liquid
            has made his flesh too soft. His entire body splits apart
            like wet tissue, his organs spilling out in front of them.
          
            Bill stares down in shock, still holding Trevor's arm.
          
            Starla has pulled away enough boards of the other door.
            She throws it open. None of the diseased are on this
            side of the building anymore. She moves outside.
          
          
            EXT. FLOWER STORE - NIGHT
          
            Bill follows her. Two DISEASED PEOPLE appear, SCREECHING
            and running toward them. Bill SHOOTS them both. And he
            makes a break for it, running as fast as he can across
            the street.
          
            He turns, expecting to see Starla right behind him. But
            she has stayed behind, staring quietly at the ground.
            Starla has tears in her eyes. She motions with her head
            for Bill to go. Bill is confused.
          
            The diseased townsfolk come up around Starla from the
            sides of the flower store, no one paying attention to
            Bill. They encircle her, slowly. Some SCREECH angrily
            at her. She's too disgusted or fearful to even look in
            their eyes. They BREATHE with SICK, RASPY breath.
          
                  DISEASED WOMAN                 DISEASED KID
          Starlaaaaaaa!                  Starlaaaa!
          
            And they WAIL, in a cacophony of simultaneous voices, all
            the deep angers, fears, frustrations, and jealousies they
            inherited from Grant Grant, such as:
          
                                    SMASHED-FACE MAN
                      You said for better or worse! You
                      lied!
          
                  NO LONGER PRETTY                BRENDA'S HUSBAND
          I gave you everything!         I.   Loved. You!
          
                                                                      89.
          
                  SHELBY                           FAT SICK GUY
          It's not just about lesson       I wanted you by my side,
          plans! Hank Wilcox wants         sugarplum. But I'm too
          your pussy!                      ugly now, huh!!?
          
                  MR. INAPPROPRIATE                WAITRESS
          Your daddy'd still be            You always thought I was a
          fucking your every hole          joke, ain't you?
          weren't it for me!!
          
                                    BRENDA'S HUSBAND
                      You like Pardy better'n me? That's
                      who you want to screw now?!
          
                                    STARLA
                      Grant... Please...
          
            They surround her. They touch her body, her ass, her
            breasts. Pull on her clothes. She trembles.
          
                                    STARLA
                      I'm sorry... I know I haven't
                      behaved how you -- how you want.
                      I know. Don't... hurt... me.
          
            Starla glances down to see a diseased dog licking her
            calf, tasting her.
          
                                    STARLA
                      We need... to... talk.
          
            A DISEASED MAN grabs the side of her neck and face.
          
                  DISEASED MAN                     BRENDA'S HUSBAND
          Then talk.                       Then talk.
          
                                    STARLA
                      Not here, though, okay? Not all
                      of you. I'm not used to -- I want
                      to talk to your face, Grant. Your
                      more real face. Your --
          
            The diseased townsfolk grab Starla, enveloping her, and
            start dragging her away.
          
            A few townsfolk remain behind.    They look around for Bill.
          
                                     SMASHED-FACE MAN
                      Pardy?!!   Where are you, Pardy!!
          
            But he's nowhere to be seen.    They SCREECH angrily.
          
          
            EXT. MAIN STREET - NIGHT
          
            Bill runs as fast as he can across the street here -- the
            same direction the hoard took Starla, but down a block.
          
                                                                 90.
          
            EXT. SIDE OF MOVIE THEATER - NIGHT
          
            Bill falls against the side of this building, hiding in a
            dark crevice. Down the way, he can see numerous dead
            bodies, and a WOMAN chased down and tackled by some
            infected townsfolk.
          
            Some diseased townsfolk wander by Bill, looking for him.
            Bill crouches down so he isn't seen.
          
                   DISEASED WOMAN               SHELBY
          Pardy.   Pardy. Pardy.        Come on out, Pardy.
          
                                     PASTOR
                       We've surrounded the town, you
                       prick! Ain't no way outta here!
          
            Bill waits for them to pass. When they're gone, Bill
            looks up toward the next street -- he can see the hoard
            moving Starla across that street.
          
            He makes sure no one's looking, and follows her.
          
          
            EXT. GRANT STREET - LATER
          
            One of the diseased pushes Starla too hard, and she falls
            to her hands and knees. They keep pushing her. She
            stumbles back to her feet and moves on. She's almost
            hyperventilating.
          
          
            EXT. GRANT HOME - MOMENTS LATER
          
            Here, the Diseased Townsfolk around Starla stop. She
            looks up to see that they've led her onto her own front
            yard. Starla gazes up at her home:
          
            The diseased have done a little remodeling. Part of the
            front wall has been torn away, replaced with some primitive
            thatched woodwork. The front doorway has also been
            partially destroyed. Because of the sloppy reconstruction,
            the roof is caved-in and sloping.
          
            Diseased people sit in meerkat-like poses on all sides of
            the Grants' home, watching out for trouble.
          
          
            EXT. HOUSE ACROSS FROM THE GRANT HOME - NIGHT
          
            Bill, out of breath, arrives across the street. He can
            see Starla standing with the diseased. He hides behind
            some shrubs.
          
                                                                   91.
          
          EXT. GRANT HOME - NIGHT
          
          The diseased push Starla up between them, violently, to
          the front door.
          
          Starla stops at the dark hole on the front of the house.
          It's pitch black inside. She looks back at the rotting
          faces behind her. And then slowly enters.
          
          
          INT. GRANT FOYER - NIGHT
          
          Starla balks at the smell. She looks beside her at the
          garage; the wall has been torn out, and this has become
          Grant's feeding area, with rotten meat, including some
          bodies, in a pile.
          
          Starla steps slowly forward, looking around.
          
                                     STARLA
                    Grant?
          
          Starla can see into the shambles of a kitchen from here.
          
          
          EXT. HOUSE ACROSS FROM THE GRANT HOME - NIGHT
          
          Bill looks at the diseased surrounding the Grant home.
          They seem impossible to get through.
          
          Bill eyes the house next door, maybe twenty-five feet
          from the Grants'. He makes sure no one's paying attention
          for a moment, and he darts across the street to a parked
          car. The diseased don't see him. Bill gazes down the
          street beside him.
          
          The sun is just barely beginning to rise.   They don't
          have much time to move in the darkness.
          
          Bill makes a break for the house next door.
          
          
          INT. GRANT KITCHEN - NIGHT
          
          Starla walks into the kitchen. Cooking supplies and
          condiments are scattered over the floor. She spots a
          meat thermometer on the floor amongst other utensils.
          
          She glances out the rear window. Diseased people are
          guarding the backyard, looking away from the home.
          
          She grabs the meat thermometer. She snaps the thermometer
          part off the top, discards it, and shoves the long metal
          spike into the seam of her skirt.
          
                                                                  92.
          
          Suddenly, Starla hears EVERY WOMAN IN THE WORLD, the song
          she and Grant danced to earlier, starting to play through
          tinny speakers.
          
          Starla looks up through a missing section of ceiling; she
          can see a tiny piece of Grant in the bedroom above her.
          
                                   STARLA
                    Grant?   We should talk.
          
          
          EXT. NEIGHBOR'S BACKYARD - NIGHT
          
          Bill has made his way into the backyard. He looks over
          at the Grant home. Some diseased townsfolk in the backyard
          could conceivably see or hear him. He tries the back
          door, but it's locked.
          
          Bill notices a window slightly open.    He starts to push
          it up. It SQUEAKS LOUDLY.
          
          He peers over at the diseased. They don't hear. He throws
          the window up further, and crawls inside the home.
          
          
          INT. GRANT FOYER - NIGHT
          
          Starla stands at the base of the stairwell.    The SONG is
          louder.
          
                                     STARLA
                    Grant?
          
          She starts to ascend the stairs.     They CREAK beneath her
          feet.
          
          
          INT. NEIGHBOR'S HOUSE - NIGHT
          
          Bill peeks out the window, careful not to be seen by the
          diseased humans around Grant's. Bill can see Starla in
          the home next door, walking up the stairs.
          
          Bill runs toward the stairwell here.
          
          
          INT. GRANT UPSTAIRS HALLWAY - NIGHT
          
          Starla looks down the hall.    Most of the walls have been
          torn away.
          
          Between wooden beams, Starla can see Grant's cumbersome
          mass, his back to her, in what was once the bedroom.
          
          In front of him, the SONG ENDS on the CD player. It starts
          into the NEXT SONG on the album. Grant uses one of his
          crusty tentacles to push the back button.
          
                                                                  93.
          
          EVERY WOMAN IN THE WORLD starts over.
          
          Starla walks toward him.
          
          
          INT. GRANT BEDROOM - NIGHT
          
          Grant keeps his back to her. Starla takes in the room.
          Photographs from their scrapbooks are all over the walls:
          photos from their wedding, and vacations, and family
          parties.
          
                                     STARLA
                    Hey, Grant.
          
          Starla walks around Grant, giving him a decent berth.
          
                                  STARLA
                    You did some real interesting
                    decorating here.
          
          Grant watches her from the corner of his sad, purulent
          eye.
          
                                     STARLA
                    Hey.
          
          Starla walks by a window.
          
                                  STARLA
                    Look, the sun's starting to come
                    up.
          
          Starla starts to open the drapes.
          
          
          INT. NEIGHBOR'S UPSTAIRS HALL - NIGHT
          
          Bill happens to look through the neighbors' kid's bedroom
          and to the home across the way where Starla is pulling
          the drapes away from the window. She sees Bill there.
          
          
          INT. GRANT BEDROOM - NIGHT
          
          Grant SCREECHES angrily at Starla. She quickly closes
          the drapes, not letting on she saw Bill.
          
                                  STARLA
                    Sorry. I didn't -- I didn't know
                    you wanted it dark.
          
          
          INT. KID'S BEDROOM - NIGHT
          
          Bill walks into this young boy's bedroom, filled with
          airplanes and sports memorabilia.
          
                                                                   94.
          
          He peeks around the window frame at the Grant bedroom
          window, now closed to him. He makes sure his shotgun is
          loaded.
          
          
          INT. GRANT BEDROOM - NIGHT
          
          Starla tries to change the subject by walking to a wall
          with the photos.
          
                                  STARLA
                    You like these memories, huh, Grant?
          
          Grant looks away from her.   Starla moves toward him, almost
          seductively.
          
                                  STARLA
                    You like being called Grant, don't
                    you?
          
          Grant is silent.   She gets closer.
          
                                   STARLA
                    I think you do. You really do.
                    You like being Grant. Like when
                    we danced. And when you... made
                    love to me here on the bed.
                    Remember that?
          
          Grant looks embarrassed.   Starla becomes more brazen.
          
                                  STARLA
                    I know you've been alone, Grant.
                    Almost forever. From here to there
                    to there to here, there's never
                    been another one for you.
          
          Starla almost looks as if she's about to cry, out of
          compassion for him.
          
                                  STARLA
                    Grant. Grant, I could help you.
                    Be with you the way you want.
                    See, I want to live. I've never
                    had much use for this world, not
                    really. You and I, together, we --
          
          She touches his tentacle with her fingers.   He moves it
          back, and GROWLS a little.
          
          Starla moves her trembling fingers toward him again. She
          sets them on his tentacle once more. He glares at her
          distrustfully, breathing his deep, sick breath.
          
                                  STARLA
                    You don't trust me, I know. That's
                    why I brought you someone, Grant.
          
                                                                   95.
          
          Starla looks into his eyes.
          
                                 STARLA
                    It's Bill. He's in the house next
                    door. Just look.
          
          
          INT. KID'S BEDROOM - NIGHT
          
          Bill glances down to see a diseased man looking up at
          him. In fact, they're all looking up at him. Bill is
          confused.
          
          
          INT. GRANT BEDROOM - NIGHT
          
          Grant looks at Starla with sad eyes, perhaps touched.
          Starla smiles nervously, expectantly.
          
                                  STARLA
                    See? I brought him here for you!
                    As an offering! To prove I love
                    you more than him!
          
          Grant wraps his tentacle around Starla. Starla, though
          obviously disgusted, touches his face with her hand.
          
          
          INT. NEIGHBOR'S HOUSE - NIGHT
          
          The diseased townsfolk break down the door, moving into
          the downstairs below Bill.
          
          
          INT. KID'S BEDROOM - NIGHT
          
          Bill hears them approaching. He SHATTERS the window, and
          crawls onto a small mock-balcony outside.
          
          
          INT. GRANT BEDROOM - NIGHT
          
          Starla moves slowly in toward Grant, as if to kiss him.
          Grant looks, well, joyful.
          
          And then she yanks the metal spike from her skirt and
          JABS it into Grant's eye.
          
          Grant SCREECHES, blind and bucking.   Starla SLAMS the
          spike into his other eye.
          
          And she STABS him again, shoving the spike into his
          forehead, where it stays.
          
          Starla leaps to the window.   She throws open the drapes.
          
                                                               96.
          
                                   STARLA
                    Now, Bill!!   Kill the motherfucker!!
          
          
          EXT. NEIGHBOR'S MOCK BALCONY - NIGHT
          
          Bill raises his shotgun and BLASTS as Starla jumps away
          from the window.
          
          
          INT. GRANT BEDROOM - NIGHT
          
          The WINDOW SHATTERS and the shot strikes Grant. He
          SCREECHES, swinging his tentacles aimlessly around the
          room in fury.
          
          One tentacle SLAMS Starla against the wall, probably
          breaking a rib or two. Another tentacle SMASHES the CD
          player, squelching the song.
          
          
          EXT. NEIGHBOR'S MOCK BALCONY - NIGHT
          
          The diseased townsfolk enter the kid's bedroom, rushing
          toward Bill on the balcony. But Bill won't stop. He
          BLASTS the shotgun again.
          
          
          INT. GRANT BEDROOM - NIGHT
          
          Grant is struck in the head. He starts slithering out of
          the bedroom, feeling his way out.
          
          
          EXT. NEIGHBOR'S MOCK BALCONY - NIGHT
          
          Bill is out of shells. He drops his shotgun. He grabs
          the grenade out of the pocket on the black leather bag.
          
          
          INT. GRANT BATHROOM - NIGHT
          
          Starla, clutching her ribs and barely able to move, pulls
          herself up on the window.
          
          Bill tosses her the grenade. She tries to catch it, but
          misses it. It lands on the carpet. She see Grant's
          tentacles slipping away. She tries to move but she's
          hurt bad, bleeding.
          
          
          EXT. NEIGHBOR'S MOCK BALCONY - NIGHT
          
          The diseased GLEEK at Bill, but Bill throws himself
          forward, letting himself fall through the flimsy balustrade --
          
                                                                  97.
          
          EXT. GRANT HOME - NIGHT
          
          Bill lands hard on the lawn between the two homes. He
          grabs a .38, and stands beside the window on Grant's house.
          
          Through the window he sees Grant barreling down the stairs.
          
          Bill SHOOTS Grant with the .38, SHATTERING the glass.
          
          He UNLOADS the clip into him.
          
          The diseased townsfolk surround Bill, grabbing him. Grant,
          using the others' eyes to see, snaps his tentacle forward,
          wrapping it around Bill's neck, raising him up. Grant
          SCREECHES.
          
          
          INT. GRANT FOYER - NIGHT
          
          Starla appears at the top of the stairs, clutching her
          bloody side. She has the pin in one hand and the grenade
          in the other.
          
          With all her remaining effort, she lobs the grenade behind
          Grant.
          
                                     GRANT
                    Er...?
          
          It EXPLODES.
          
          
          EXT. GRANT HOME - NIGHT
          
          Grant's exploding flesh sends Bill flying backwards.
          
          
          INT. GRANT HALLWAY - NIGHT
          
          Starla is thrown back.
          
          
          EXT. GRANT HOME - NIGHT
          
          Around the house, the diseased's eyes gaze lifelessly
          upward as they each plummet to the grass.
          
                                                            FADE TO:
          
          
          EXT. GRANT HOME - MORNING
          
          Bill unwraps what's left of the tentacle from his bruised
          neck, and looks around at the dead diseased. Grant's
          splattered flesh is around him.
          
                                                               98.
          
          Bill hears a quiet RATTLING sound. He looks around him.
          And then sees, down at his feet, what is actually a
          distorted piece of Grant's cerebellum. Sticking out of a
          new organic slit in the cerebellum is the quill-like spore.
          It quivers and trembles upward, its little bulbed spurs
          popping out.
          
          
          INT. GRANT HALLWAY - MORNING
          
          Starla crawls forward to look down through the smoke:
          most of the second floor has been blown away. Her mutated
          husband is just a mass of flesh and alien organs.
          
          
          EXT. GRANT HOME - MOMENTS LATER
          
          Starla comes around the side of the house, holding a paper
          towel roll to the slice on her ribs. She sees Bill
          standing there. She smiles.
          
                                   STARLA
                    Hey.
          
          Bill smiles too.
          
                                   BILL
                    Hey.
          
          
          EXT. MAIN STREET - DAY
          
          Bill and Starla hobble down the town center. The leather
          bag is slung over Bill's shoulder. Everything around
          them is dead: the victims who were being feasted on, as
          well as the various diseased. The torture is over, but
          no life remains.
          
          
          EXT. MAIN STREET - MOMENTS LATER
          
          Bill finds an abandoned Nissan Maxima in the middle of
          the street, with the keys still in it.
          
                                  BILL
                    Starla, over here.
          
          
          EXT. WHEELSY EXIT - LATER
          
          In the Maxima now, Bill and Starla pull around a toppled
          ambulance and through a spouting fire hydrant, and out
          onto --
          
                                                                  99.
          
          EXT. ROAD BEYOND WHEELSY - DAY
          
          The sun is bright and beautiful, glistening on the car.
          Bill and Starla breathe more easily and smile a little as
          they head up this long, barren road outside the city.
          
          
          EXT. CLUSTER OF STORES - MOMENTS LATER
          
          Bill and Starla pass through a small block of stores.
          
          Starla gazes out the window to see people -- real, actual,
          HEALTHY HUMAN BEINGS: men and women and children -- going
          about their daily chores. Tears come to her eyes.
          
          Bill grabs Starla's hand.   She clenches his tightly.
          
                                  STARLA
                    We can probably get some first aid
                    and food at this gas station up
                    here.
          
                                    BILL
                    Yeah.   Good.
          
          
          EXT. GAS STATION - MOMENTS LATER
          
          The Maxima pulls into the station, and stops.
          
          
          INT. GAS STATION MART - MOMENTS LATER
          
          Starla and Bill pile stuff up on the cashier's counter --
          Band-Aids, gauze, alcohol; Power Bars and Gatorade. The
          CASHIER rings it up, staring at them because of their
          wounds.
          
                                  CASHIER
                    Comes to 32.87.
          
          Bill pulls money out of his pants pocket. As he does,
          Starla glances down. His arm pulls up his shirt, and
          Starla can see the black and yellow wound there on his
          stomach. She turns away, looking around, confused.
          
          Bill pays, smiles at the cashier.
          
                                    BILL
                    There you go.
          
          
          EXT. GAS STATION - MOMENTS LATER
          
          A stunned Starla steps with Bill out of the station, moving
          toward the car.
          
                                                                100.
          
          Starla stops.
          
                                 STARLA
                    Shit. I- I forgot... I wanted to
                    get aspirin.
          
          She starts to move back inside.     Bill stops her.
          
                                  BILL
                    I'll get it for you.      Ibuprofen or
                    aspirin?
          
                                     STARLA
                    Aspirin.
          
          Bill smiles, and goes back inside. Starla moves quickly
          with the bag of stuff toward the car.
          
          
          INT. GAS STATION MART - MOMENTS LATER
          
          Bill pays for the aspirin, and walks out with it.
          
          
          EXT. GAS STATION - DAY
          
          Bill walks out; the Maxima is still there.
          
          
          INT. MAXIMA - DAY
          
          Bill gets in the driver's seat, puts his keys into the
          engine.
          
                                  BILL
                    We'll just head up here into
                    Bishopville, get checked up in the
                    hospital. Then maybe we'll head
                    off to Hollywood after all, huh?
          
                                     STARLA
                    Okay.
          
          Bill turns to smile at Starla. She's aiming the .38 at
          his face. Tears are streaming down her cheeks.
          
                                  BILL
                    Please, Starla. I'm gonna do my
                    best not to hurt anybody --
          
                                     STARLA
                    You took Bill.
          
                                  BILL
                    It's my nature.
          
                                                                101.
          
                                  STARLA
                    And this is mine.
          
          Starla pulls the trigger, the GUNSHOT CRACKS OUT.
          
          
          EXT. GAS STATION - DAY
          
          As the Maxima sits in the lot, ANOTHER GUNSHOT CRACKS
          OUT. Then we hear the HORN BLARING.
          
          
          INT. MAXIMA - DAY
          
          Bill's dead body is slumped over the steering wheel.
          Starla really can't bring herself to look at it, as she
          reaches across it and toward the door handle.
          
          
          EXT. GAS STATION - DAY
          
          The car door flips open.    The horn stops blaring.
          
          And Bill's body is kicked out of the car, sliding onto
          the pavement.

          Starla WIPES the tears away from her face. She glances
          out the window to see the cashier peeking out of the
          cashier's station.
          
          Starla scoots over into the driver's seat.    She shoves
          the car into drive.
          
          And she takes off down the road, not looking back.
          
          Starla's blanched and numb but the tears still keep coming.
          
                                                       CUT TO BLACK.

First, over BLACK, we hear the sound of a light rain.

Then:

                    A MAN'S VOICE
          I'm not a poet.  I've never moved
          anyone with my words.
              (beat)
          Maybe that's why they chose me.

EXT.  WOODS - DAY

A mural of leafless trees beneath an overcast sky.  Rain
continues to fall.

Maybe now we begin to notice a strange quality to the light
(or is it the sky?).  Something vaguely unsettling.

                                                  CUT TO:

INT.  BEDROOM - MORNING

Still, the sound of rain is heard.

A MAN

40s, lies on his side in bed, staring at us.

He has not been sleeping.  In fact, judging from his distant
expression, he has not slept in ages.

                                                  CUT TO:

EXT.  ROAD - DAY

Less like a road and more like a path that you maneuver a
vehicle through.

The Man, dressed in rain gear, walks down the middle.  He is
accompanied by a medium-sized LABRADOR, and seems in no
particular hurry.

The sound of tires appear and grow in intensity.  The Man,
without saying an actual word, instructs the dog to heal. 
The dog obeys as the Man moves off the road.  The vehicle
hurtles past him -- its engine quiet, its windows darkened --
spraying muddy debris in its wake.

Seconds later, the car brakes abruptly and skids to a stop.

THE MAN

Stops walking and stares at the car, which seems ominously
still.

The car then reverses direction and begins to move toward the
Man, who remains motionless.

When the car is alongside him, a darkened window turns
transparent and we see a WELL-DRESSED BUREAUCRAT in the rear
seat.  His demeanor is pleasant and professional.

                    WELL-DRESSED BUREAUCRAT
          Dr. Kelvin?

The Man he is addressing, who we now understand is CHRIS
KELVIN, stares back at him.

                                                  CUT TO:

INT.  CABIN - DAY

The contrast between the cabin's rustic aesthetic and the
aggressively high-tech equipment contained therein isn't as
jarring as you might imagine.

Kelvin is seated in front of a desk, scrolling through a text
readout on a flat, transparent holographic screen.  Behind
him is the Well-Dressed Bureaucrat from the car, and two
others: A WOMAN in her 50s and a MAN in his 30s.  They are
also well-groomed.  Each of their suits are embroidered with
a small but distinctive LOGO of some sort that composes the
acronym DBA.

Kelvin scrolls through several menus, hits a few keys, and a
digitized VIDEO IMAGE appears on his screen: A MAN, unshaven,
looking into the camera.

The man, GIBARIAN, looks very tired and somewhat apologetic. 
The lower part of the screen has a time of day and date
display that reads: 0221 HRS 11/14/31.

                    GIBARIAN
          We take off into the cosmos, ready
          for anything: solitude, hardship,
          exhaustion, death.  We're proud of
          ourselves, in a way.  But our
          enthusiasm is a sham.  We don't
          want to conquer the cosmos -- we
          want to extend the boundaries of
          Earth to the cosmos.  We are only
          seeking Man.  We don't want Other
          Worlds.  We want mirrors.
              (beat)
          Maybe we don't need to know what it
          is, or why.  Maybe just knowing
          that it is should be enough.

Gibarian stares at the camera for a long moment before
switching it off and ending the transmission.

Kelvin sits back.

The visitors exchange glances.

                                                  CUT TO:

INT.  SPACE CAPSULE

Close on Kelvin.  We hold on him a long time, as a myriad of
readouts scroll and flash across his face.  A slit of
sunlight glides slowly through frame.

                                             DISSOLVE TO:

KELVIN

in the same capsule, a month later.  He is asleep.

                                             DISSOLVE TO:

KELVIN

in the same capsule, two months later.  He is dictating some
coordinates to Earth.  He absently scratches his heavy growth
of beard.

                                             DISSOLVE TO:

KELVIN

two months later still.  He is looking out his small,
rectangular window, and for the fist time we cut around to
see the approaching planet: SOLARIS.

Kelvin stares at it, hypnotized.  It has a translucent
quality, as though it is lit from within, and its undulating,
ocean-like surface slowly changes colors.

Kelvin's attention is diverted as an orbiting ship, the
PROMETHEUS, edges into frame.

                    KELVIN
          Prometheus, this is Athena 7, on
          approach, do you read me?
              (beat)
          Prometheus, this is Athena 7, on
          approach, do you read me?

No response.  He exhales and types on a keyboard.

EXT.  SPACE

The Athena 7, sporting a DBA logo, advances toward the
Prometheus.

                                                  CUT TO:

INT.  PROMETHEUS

Kelvin, in a space suit, climbs with some difficulty out of
the Athena 7, which has come to rest in the DOCKING BAY of
the Prometheus.  Several exploratory PODS fill the remainder
of the area.

Kelvin gets his bearings and looks around, but sees no sign
of life.

                                                  CUT TO:

INT.  CORRIDOR

Empty.

(NOTE: Except for some ROBOTIC, NON-SPEAKING CHARACTERS: the
AUTOMATED TASKMASTERS.  These are small, bug-like repair
units that constantly roam the ship, fixing things.  Their
tiny hum is virtually silent, and we see them all the time on
the Prometheus.  They can adhere to any surface at any
angle.)

Kelvin, now out of his space suit and holding a small
carrying case and a duffle bag, moves on.

                                                  CUT TO:

INT.  GIBARIAN'S ROOM

Ransacked.

Kelvin registers it, then moves to the corner of the room
where the computer terminal rests.  Within moments he has
discovered Gibarian has recorded a video message for him to
replay.

VIDEO

Gibarian addressing the camera.  He appears to be lucid, but
extremely fatigued.

                    GIBARIAN
          Hi, Chris.
              (a light smile)
          I'm so glad you came.
              (beat, the smile fades)
          I still have a little time, and I
          want to tell you something.  To
          warn you.  By now you know about
          me, or if you don't, get Snow or
          Sartorius to tell you; it doesn't
          matter.
              (beat)
          I didn't lose my mind.  You should
          be able to tell from this video. 
          I'm not mad.
              (beat)
          If it happens to you, remember that
          it isn't madness.
              (beat)
          You should know, I'm in favor of
          destroying Solaris.  I know
          that's... illegal.  And unethical. 
          And irresponsible.  But it's the
          only way to make it stop.

A long moment of silence is broken by a noise on the video,
which draws Gibarian's attention offscreen.

                    GIBARIAN
              (addressing whoever made
               the noise)
          Cut that out.  Do you hear me?

Gibarian switches off the video.

The computer screen freezes the last recorded frame and
overlays a readout indicating the file has ended.

                                                  CUT TO:

INT.  CORRIDOR

Empty.  But there is a door at the end of it, slightly open. 
Kelvin moves toward it.

INT.  ROOM

A FIGURE, seated with its back to the door, turns to see
Kelvin enter.  This is SNOW.  He looks Kelvin up and down,
his expression wary and alert.

                    KELVIN
          Snow.  Didn't you hear me radio? 
          I'm Kelvin.

A long beat.  Snow just watches him.

                    SNOW
          Yes.  We heard.

Kelvin takes a step forward, and Snow recoils.

                    KELVIN
          What's wrong?  What happened to
          Gibarian?

                    SNOW
          He's dead.

                    KELVIN
          How?

A beat.

                    SNOW
          Suicide.

Snow exhales, then looks up as though he's remembered
something.

                    SNOW
          You didn't bring any chocolate, did
          you?

                    KELVIN
          What?

                    SNOW
              (musing)
          I love chocolate.  I realized just
          yesterday how much I love it.
              (beat, then he recovers)
          I thought maybe, if they let you
          bring personal effects, you might
          have snuck some through, because...
          well, I've been thinking about it.

A long beat as Kelvin stares at Snow.

                    KELVIN
          What happened here?

Snow lies back in his bunk.

                    SNOW
          I can't talk just now.  I'm too
          tired.

                    KELVIN
          Where's Sartorius?

                    SNOW
          In his lab.  He won't let you in.

                    KELVIN
              (leaving)
          He'll let me in.

                    SNOW
          Kelvin, if you see anything
          unusual...

Kelvin stops, but doesn't turn around.

                    SNOW
          ... try to stay calm.

                                                  CUT TO:

INT.  CORRIDOR

Kelvin stands outside a door.

                    KELVIN
          Let me in.

A beat.

                    SARTORIUS
              (inside, muffled)
          You have to give me your word you
          won't come in.  Then I'll come out.

                    KELVIN
          All right.

Sartorius cracks the door open and slithers through the slit
and into the hallway.  He is of obvious intelligence and not
to be messed with; contentious, intimidating when he wants to
be, and probably brilliant.  Kelvin eyes him suspiciously.

                    KELVIN
          What happened to Gibarian?

                    SARTORIUS
          Didn't you talk to Snow?

                    KELVIN
          I want to hear your version.

                    SARTORIUS
              (incredulous)
          Who, here, could possibly care what
          you want?  At best, you're Employee
          of the Month for the highest bidder
          in the Solaris auction.  They have
          no idea what's going on up here.
          They've never even been in space.
          And I'm supposed to listen to you?

                    KELVIN
          I am here to recover this mission,
          report my findings, and make a
          recommendation.  Now: What happened
          to him?

                    SARTORIUS
          The same thing that could happen to
          any of us.

                    KELVIN
          Where's his body?

                    SARTORIUS
          In the lab.  With her, probably.

                    KELVIN
          Her?  Who are you talking about?

Sartorius is grabbed by something on the other side of his
door.  He struggles to keep his composure.

                    SARTORIUS
          His last wish was to be buried on
          Earth.  In dirt, he said.  "I want
          to buried in dirt."  What a clown.

Sartorius is losing the battle with whomever or whatever is
on the other side of his door.

                    KELVIN
          They shouldn't let people like you
          into space.

                    SARTORIUS
          Just so you know: I'm not going
          back until I understand what it is. 
          I am going to figure out what it
          is, make it stop, and then I will
          go home.

                    KELVIN
          Listen --

                    SARTORIUS
          We're done.  Oh, I should tell you,
          I don't trust Snow.  There's
          something wrong with him.

Sartorius rotates and zips back into his room.  As the door
closes Kelvin sees a flash of ANOTHER FIGURE in Sartorius'
room.  The glimpse was too quick to judge who or what the
other figure could have been.

                                                  CUT TO:

INT.  CORRIDOR - DAY

Kelvin walks, exploring the ship.  He sees something that
stops him:

A NUDE WOMAN

Black, early 20s, slipping across a corridor up ahead.

Kelvin gives chase.  He sees her turn a corner, but by the
time he gets there, she is gone.

                                                  CUT TO:

INT.  SNOW'S ROOM

Snow is lying on his bunk.

                    KELVIN
          Is there anybody else here?

                    SNOW
              (sits up a little)
          Why, who did you see?

                    KELVIN
          Gibarian warned me.  He left me a
          message.

                    SNOW
          Who was it?

                    KELVIN
          She was real.  Where did she come
          from?

Snow looks at him but doesn't respond.

                    KELVIN
          Tell me.  I won't think you're
          insane.

                    SNOW
          Oh, that's a relief.

Snow lies back down.

                    KELVIN
          Where did she come from?

A beat.

                    SNOW
          How much sleep do you need?

                    KELVIN
          How much sleep?

                    SNOW
          How long can you go without sleep?

                    KELVIN
          That depends.

                    SNOW
          Well, when you do go to sleep:
          barricade your door.

Snow rolls over, away from Kelvin.

                                                  CUT TO:

EXT.  SPACE

Solaris.  Quiet, but still active somehow.

                    KELVIN (V.O.)
          The Prometheus, as far as I can
          tell, is functionally intact.  Crew
          status: One dead, Gibarian.  Cause
          of death appears to be suicide.

                                                  CUT TO:

INT.  KELVIN'S ROOM

Kelvin speaks into a video communication device.  As he does,
we see images of the things and people he describes.

                    KELVIN
          Interviews with the surviving
          members and a perusal of the
          deceased's personal effects
          indicate he was suffering from
          severe depression with psychotic
          features, along with bouts of
          hypomania, dementia, delirium, and
          primary insomnia.  All of these
          symptoms, combined with a profound
          sense of isolation, are commonly
          found in studies of low stimulation
          environments, particularly long
          range space travel.  Snow and
          Sartorius show indications of
          depression, including dysthymic and
          bipolar I; a variety of stress
          disorders, including acute and
          posttraumatic; and suggestions of
          agoraphobia, obsessive/compulsive
          disorder, and hypersomnia.  I
          emphasize these are preliminary
          opinions on my part.  I will
          attempt to convince Snow and
          Sartorius to return to Earth, but
          as they currently view me as an
          intruder of sorts, this may take
          some time.

                                                  CUT TO:

INT.  KELVIN'S ROOM

Later.  Kelvin is lying down.  The lights are out, and he is
trying to sleep.

After a moment, he gets up, checks the lock on his door, and
lies back down.

Then he gets up and moves a chair in front of the door, and
lies back down.

Then he gets up and puts two heavy cases on top of the chair,
and lies back down.

Laughing to himself, he drifts off to sleep.

Silence.

ANOTHER ANGLE

On Kelvin, asleep.

ANOTHER ANGLE

On Kelvin, still asleep.  Then:

EXTREME CLOSE-UP:

A WOMAN'S LIPS, slightly parted.

BACK TO KELVIN

Asleep.  Then:

INT.  TRAIN - DAY

Continued silence, AND:

RHEYA, 30s, staring at us, practically daring us to look
away.  Her obvious intelligence and confidence make her
extremely compelling, along with the fact that it was her
parted lips we were looking at a moment ago.  Her expression
indicates she's in a very raw emotional state.

REVERSE ANGLE

Kelvin is the person she has locked eyes with on the TRAIN.

He is younger here; not just in age, but in spirit.  The
contrast with his older self is striking.

BACK TO KELVIN

Asleep on the ship.  After a beat:

EXTREME CLOSE-UP:

Rheya's LIPS.

Except the circumstance is clearly different: it's darker and
there isn't the side-to-side shimmy of the train car.

A WIDER VIEW

Reveals that Rheya is not sitting on the train -- she is
sitting in Kelvin's room on the Prometheus, right now.

She is staring at Kelvin and she is ethereal in her
stillness.

KELVIN

Awakens, blinks, and slowly recognizes her.

If he is not entirely surprised it is because he has
obviously dreamed of Rheya before.  He looks at her, simply.

RHEYA

Stands and makes her way to Kelvin.

Without hesitation she kisses him and they begin to explore
each other and we see all of it happen and two things are
obvious: first, they have done this before, and two: they
haven't done it in some time.

                                                  CUT TO:

INT.  KELVIN'S ROOM

Kelvin is asleep, Rheya in his arms.

He wakes up and looks at her, perplexed.  After a beat he
rises to sit on the edge of the bed.

A wave of terror is barely suppressed as he puts his hand to
his forehead.  Rheya opens her eyes.

                    KELVIN
          Oh, God.  I'm awake.

                    RHEYA
          Yes.

He looks at her.

                    KELVIN
          Where did you come from?

She moves to him and kisses him as if that's all she wants to
do, forever.

Between kisses.

                    KELVIN
          How are you here?

She stops.

                    RHEYA
          How do you mean?
              (beat)
          Chris, what's wrong?

Hearing his name spoken by her (and those particular words,
perhaps) nearly causes Kelvin to scream.

He stands and moves to the chair.  Rheya watches him.

                    RHEYA
          I love you.

He looks up at her for as long as he can.  Then he looks
down.

                    RHEYA
          Do you love me?

He doesn't look up.

                    KELVIN
          Yes.

A beat.

                    KELVIN
          I need to see Snow.

                    RHEYA
          I'll go with you.

                    KELVIN
              (rising)
          I'll just be a minute.

She bolts out of bed.

                    RHEYA
          Don't.

                    KELVIN
          Why?

                    RHEYA
          I don't know.  I can't be alone.

                    KELVIN
          I'll be right back.

She is trying to accommodate him but her fear of being left
alone is palpable, even excessive.  He sees this and puts his
arms on her shoulders to comfort her.

                    KELVIN
          All right.  All right.  Here.

He hands her a few pills and retrieves a glass of water.

                    RHEYA
          What are they?

                    KELVIN
          To calm your anxiety.

                    RHEYA
          To calm my anxiety.

She takes the pills and smiles.

                                                  CUT TO:

INT.  DOCKING BAY

Kelvin leads Rheya to one of the exploratory pods.  They are
in space suits.

                    RHEYA
          We're taking a flight?

                    KELVIN
          Yes.

He opens the door of a pod and indicates for her to enter. 
She is unsure.

                    KELVIN
          Go ahead.  I'll close the door
          behind me.

She stares up and into the pod.  Kelvin watches her go with
difficulty and then CLOSES THE DOOR behind Rheya.

He walks across the docking bay to the control room and
begins preparations for the pod to be jettisoned.

KELVIN

In agony as he watches a real-time, beat-by-beat brand of
technological murder take place: Rheya's pod is pushed off
into space.

RHEYA

Her face contorted in confusion, watches through the pod
window as the docking bay doors close in front of her with a
brutal finality.

KELVIN

collapses to the ground, shattered.

INSERT:

A woman's HAND, resting on the floor of an apartment.  The
fingers are being licked by a LABRADOR PUPPY.

ANOTHER INSERT:

A pot of coffee, on the boil.  Except that it has been left
unattended for too long...

ANOTHER INSERT:

A rain-streaked window.

                                                  CUT TO:

INT.  KELVIN'S ROOM

Kelvin, on the edge of his bed.  He wants to tear himself
inside out.

A voice calls over the intercom: Snow's.

                    SNOW
          Was her breakfast conversation that
          bad?

                    KELVIN
          Shut up.

                    SNOW
          I told you, try to stay calm. 
          You're supposed to be the
          psychologist of the bunch.

                    KELVIN
          What was it?

Kelvin rises and goes to wash his face.

                    SNOW
          Personally, I think it's God.  At
          least, it fits my definition.

                    KELVIN
          And professionally?

                    SNOW
          I'm not sure.
              (beat)
          It started with Gibarian.  He
          locked himself in his room and
          refused to talk except through a
          crack in the door.  He covered the
          video lens.  Obviously we thought
          he was having a nervous breakdown.
          I don't know why he didn't tell us
          he had somebody in there.  By this
          time, we were getting visitors,
          too.  He was desperately trying to
          figure it out.  Day and night.
              (beat)
          Who was she?

                    KELVIN
          My wife.

                    SNOW
          Dead?

Kelvin nods.

                    SNOW
          She has materialized from your
          memory of her.  What was her name?

                    KELVIN
          Rheya.

                    SNOW
          It started about three months ago. 
          Right after the government sold the
          expedition.  We were ready to go
          home.

                    KELVIN
          Will she come back?

                    SNOW
          Probably.

                    KELVIN
          I wish you'd told me.

                    SNOW
          Told you what?

A beat.

                    SNOW
          What will you say?

                    KELVIN
          To who?

                    SNOW
          What are you going to report back
          to Earth?

                    KELVIN
          I don't know.

                    SNOW
          An enormous amount of money changed
          hands to get control of this
          project.  We are in little danger
          of being left alone for long.
              (beat)
          You'll need to do something. 
          Otherwise they'll be sending
          someone out to recover you.

                    KELVIN
          Gibarian said he thinks Solaris
          should be destroyed.

                    SNOW
          That's ludicrous.  This is contact. 
          We have found God.  The only issue
          is figuring out how to prove this
          in a way that will make sense back
          on Earth.  So how will we describe
          it, if we choose to describe it at
          all?

                                                  CUT TO:

INT.  CONFERENCE ROOM

Before Kelvin's arrival.

Gibarian is talking to Snow and Sartorius.

                    GIBARIAN
          A pre-biological colloidal
          envelope, possibly exceeding
          terrestrial structures in
          complexity; a plasmic mechanism. 
          Probably without life as we
          conceive it, but capable of
          performing functional activities on
          an astronomic scale.  My view is
          that Solaris has reached, in a
          single bound, the "homeostatic
          ocean" stage without passing
          through stages of terrestrial
          evolution.  I think it bypassed
          cellular development altogether. 
          It hasn't taken endless eons to
          adapt itself to its environment,
          but in fact dominated its
          environment immediately.  From the
          moment it existed, it was the most
          superior element in the Universe.
          And now it passes the time doing
          extravagant theoretical thinking
          about the Universe, with us as the
          cast.

We now show this scene being played out on a video monitor,
watched by Kelvin.

                    GIBARIAN
          It's engaged in a never-ending
          process of transformation; an
          ontological autometamorphosis,
          begging the question: Can thought
          exist separately from
          consciousness?

                    SNOW
          It's God.

                    SARTORIUS
          I don't care what it is, we need to
          figure out how to make it stop.

                    GIBARIAN
          Nelson, we have the opportunity --

                    SARTORIUS
          What if this thing follows us back
          to Earth?  What if what's happening
          here started happening on Earth, on
          a mass scale?  Don't you see that
          as a problem?  I think it's a
          serious mistake to assume it's
          benign.  For all we know it's
          driving us crazy so it can watch us
          kill each other.

Gibarian considers this.

                    SNOW
          We're not even sure it will let us
          leave.

This time, Gibarian alone.  Near the end.

                    GIBARIAN
          Maybe it's stuck.  Maybe its power
          isn't that God-like.  I mean, we
          have God-like power relative to an
          insect, but that doesn't mean we
          can move the Earth around at will.
          Maybe it's like a spider web,
          waiting for something to show up.
              (beat)
          We intercepted some brief fragments
          of what must be an everlasting
          monologue with itself.  Of course
          it was beyond our understanding.
              (beat)
          I've come to hate it here.  There's
          only one way out of its reach, for
          us.  Humans.

Kelvin stares at Gibarian's body, which is lying under a
sheet in the ship's operating room.  Also under the sheet,
next to Gibarian: The Young Girl.

                    GIBARIAN
              (from a video)
          I thought I'd been behaving
          normally, rationally.  But a sign
          of insanity is the inability to
          think about more than one thing. 
          So if I am consumed by the idea
          that I am insane and can't think of
          anything else, then I am insane.
              (beat, smiles)
          You ask questions at the end of
          your life, the sort of questions
          people who are content don't ask.
              (beat)
          Maybe life just can't be solved.

After a beat, he turns out the lights and rolls over.

Time has passed.  Kelvin is asleep.

RHEYA leans into frame and kisses him.

Without even waking, he kisses her back, hungrily.

                    KELVIN
          Rheya...

                    RHEYA
          I want you inside me right now.

They make love.  It's even better than before.

INT.  TRAIN - DAY

Kelvin, staring intently.  What he is staring at is Rheya,
who is seated across from him.  She doesn't see him, yet. 
When she does, she locks eyes with his and doesn't look away.

This continues until she gets off the train.  Kelvin watches
her go, and she looks back at him through the window as the
train pulls away.

INT.  PARTY - NIGHT

Rheya enters, looks around.  She spots Kelvin, who has
already spotted her.  Their expressions indicate they are
pleased to see each other again.  He approaches her, and they
stare at each other a long time, until:

                    KELVIN
          "And Death Shall Have No Dominion".

                    RHEYA
          Book?

                    KELVIN
          Poem.  Dylan Thomas.  I thought of
          it when I saw you on the train.

                    RHEYA
          My Thomas is a little rusty.

He leans over and whispers into her ear.  She listens, and
when he finishes, she leans back and looks at him, intrigued. 
Genuinely intrigued.  He smiles.

                    RHEYA
          Not a very happy poem.

                    KELVIN
          You didn't look very happy.

                    RHEYA
          I wasn't.

                    KELVIN
          And tonight?

                    RHEYA
          Better.

He nods, and they smile.  They seem to be rooting for each
other.  After an extended pleasurable moment, Rheya leans
over and whispers in his ear.  He listens, then leans back
and looks at her.

                    KELVIN
          That's good to know.

INT.  FRIEND'S APARTMENT - NIGHT

Another night.

Rheya is wound up.  Not drunk, something else.  She has an
odd look in her eyes.

We are at a dinner party, and there are people trying -- but
failing -- not to watch.

                    RHEYA
          You want to fuck her?

                    KELVIN
          Stop it.

                    RHEYA
          You behave as though you want to
          fuck her.

                    KELVIN
          Rheya.  Not here.

                    RHEYA
          And I just want to know if I'm
          crazy or not -- if what I think is
          happening is actually happening. 
          Or am I one of those people, those
          women, who are blind to what's
          going on?  Who pretend not to see
          their husband's attention toward
          another woman?

                    KELVIN
          Let's go home.

                    RHEYA
          You go home.

                    KELVIN
          I am.  Please come with me.  I
          don't want to do this here.

                    RHEYA
          You talk like an actor.

now.

Rheya crying as she embraces Kelvin.

He is unmoved, but she labors to change his mind.

Rheya, in a chair, remorseful, Kelvin is dressing.

                    KELVIN
          You're better when you take them.

                    RHEYA
          I know, I know.  But still, somehow
          I don't feel better.

                    KELVIN
          All right.  How about I feel better
          when you take them?

A beat.

                    RHEYA
          Right.

They look at each other and understand; she will take the
pills.

of an image we saw earlier.

Rain streaks the kitchen window.

INT.  PROMETHEUS

Rheya is taking her pills.  Kelvin watches.

                    KELVIN
          What do you remember?

                    RHEYA
          What do you mean?

                    KELVIN
          Do you remember Beethoven?  The
          Beatles?  Movies, books,
          restaurants, friends?

                    RHEYA
              (thinking)
          Yes.  But not until you mentioned
          them.  As soon as you said those
          things, I remembered them.  And
          they have associations that make me
          think of other things I remember. 
          It's like filling up.

She looks out the portal at Solaris.

                    RHEYA
          Is it a planet?

                    KELVIN
          Not exactly.  It exists in a
          continuum that wasn't proven until
          ten years ago, a higher
          mathematical dimension superimposed
          on top of the Universe.  An
          infinite number of them, in fact. 
          It was a violation of all of our
          various laws regarding the
          Universe, Space, or Space-Time.  It
          was completely counter-intuitive. 
          We had to unlearn everything.

                    RHEYA
          Is it intelligent?

                    KELVIN
          Intelligent beyond our
          comprehension.

                    RHEYA
          Then it's God, right?

                    KELVIN
          It's something.

                    RHEYA
          You still don't believe in God?

                    KELVIN
          The whole idea of God was dreamed
          up by a silly animal with a small
          brain called Man.  Even the limits
          we put on it are human limits.  It
          can do this, it can do that!  It
          designs, it creates!

                    RHEYA
          Even a God that wasn't active, that
          just created something and stood
          back and watched?

                    KELVIN
          You're talking about a man in a
          white beard again.  You're
          ascribing human characteristics to
          something that isn't human.  Human
          beings look for causes and
          patterns.  How could we know what
          Solaris is up to, if anything?

A beat.

                    RHEYA
          But what if Solaris is what there
          was before The Big Bang?

                    KELVIN
          As I said, it is beyond our
          comprehension.

                    RHEYA
          As I said, then it's God, right?

She looks at him and can't keep from smiling, eventually.

                    RHEYA
          Why are we talking about this shit
          when we could be fucking?

Kelvin smiles.

The intercom comes to life.

          Kelvin, you awake?

                    KELVIN

          Can you meet me and Sartorius on B

                    KELVIN
          Why?

                    SNOW
          Just a little strategy session. 
          But in person this time.

Kelvin is getting ready to leave.  Rheya sits on the edge of
the bed, nervous.

                    KELVIN
          All right?

She nods and Kelvin exits, locking the door behind him.

We sit with her for a moment as she tries to remain calm.

IN THE CORRIDOR

Kelvin listens.  A long time.

Satisfied, he begins to walk away but is stopped by the
sounding of a CRASHING GLASS from within.  He hears footsteps
approach the door, and then a fierce POUNDING.

He takes a step back.  An INHUMAN AMOUNT OF NOISE begins
emanating from the other side of the door, which is now
threatening to break apart.  It sounds like a plane is
crashing in Kelvin's room -- no human could create this kind
of cacophony.

Finally, he steps forward and presses the button to open the
door.

RHEYA

Is revealed, covered in blood.  She has completely torn the
inside of the cabin door apart and has badly injured herself
in the process.

                    KELVIN
          Rheya...

Confused, she looks up at him as he takes her in his arms and
carries her to the bed.

                    RHEYA
          What happened?

                    KELVIN
          You were trying to break down the
          door.  Do you know why?

                    RHEYA
          When I saw you were gone I got
          scared.

He puts her down on the bed and runs to the bathroom, where
he gathers all the first aid materials he can find.

Returning, he blanches.

Rheya's wounds have HEALED; in fact, they are HEALING in
front of us.

She looks up at him and doesn't like the look on his face.

                    RHEYA
          Chris, what's wrong with me?

                    KELVIN
          Yes.

INT.  B DECK CONFERENCE ROOM

Snow and Sartorius wait for Kelvin.

                    SNOW
          He won't do it.

                    SARTORIUS
          Why do you say that?

                    SNOW
          He won't.

Kelvin enters, with Rheya.  Snow and Sartorius exchange
glances.

                    KELVIN
          This is my wife, Rheya.

She looks at Snow and nods.  Sartorius she hates instantly,
and the feeling seems to be mutual.

                    SARTORIUS
          We thought you'd be alone.  We want
          to talk about...

                    SNOW
          We want to talk freely.

                    KELVIN
          Go ahead.

Sartorius begins.

                    SARTORIUS
          I suggest we pool our knowledge
          regarding the... visitors.  We can
          express whatever questions or
          conclusions we might have... share
          information about our various...
          experiments.  Agreed?

Kelvin and Snow nod.

                    SARTORIUS
          I would like to start with
          motivation.  Why are they here?

Sartorius looks at Rheya.  She looks away.

                    SARTORIUS
          They are not autonomous individuals
          and they're not actual persons. 
          They are projections materializing
          from our minds, based on a given
          individual.

                    SNOW
          It's an experiment.

                    KELVIN
          No.  There's no behavior
          modification.

                    SARTORIUS
          She reappeared exactly as she had
          before?

Kelvin looks at Rheya and nods.  She is struck by the word
"before".

                    SNOW
          The same vulnerabilities?

He nods again.

                    SARTORIUS
          A recoil, with no compensating
          mechanism.

                    SNOW
          And when a given situation no
          longer corresponds to the normal
          faculties of the... original, the
          visitor suffers some sort of
          disconnected consciousness.

                    SARTORIUS
          Followed by non-human
          manifestations.

                    SNOW
          Are the actions of Solaris
          premeditated?

                    KELVIN
          Is it being deliberately cruel, you
          mean?  I don't think so.

                    SNOW
          I'm just trying to find an
          explanation for the continual
          reappearances.

                    KELVIN
              (to Rheya)
          When you cut yourself pounding the
          door, did it hurt?

                    RHEYA
          Yes.
              (looks around)
          Of course.

                    SARTORIUS
          If they're not learning anything
          and they're not modifying their
          behavior, why do they come back?

                    SNOW
          It's like they're plugged into a
          game, which goes around and around,
          endlessly repeating itself.

INT.  APARTMENT - NIGHT

This is ten years ago.  Rheya enters, alone.

She crosses to the kitchen and makes a drink.  Almost
immediately, the labrador puppy enters from the bedroom and
stands beside her, tail wagging.  She ignores it and
continues mixing her drink.

Halfway through this activity, the bedroom light comes on.  A
moment later, Kelvin is in the doorway.  Eventually, but not
angrily, because he's still not really awake:

                    KELVIN
          Where've you been?

                    RHEYA
          I been thinking about how much I
          hate you.

She finishes making her drink, drinks it, and walks out the
door.

Kelvin stands in the doorway for a beat, then pivots and
returns to bed.  The light goes out.

                    RHEYA (V.O.)
          Yes, I remember that.  I went back
          to Lois' house and spent the night. 
          Those were dark days.

                                                  CUT TO:

INT.  PARTY - NIGHT

Kelvin and Rheya, later in the evening when they spoke for
the first time.  They are absolutely infatuated with each
other; they know something is happening between them, will
happen between them.

                    RHEYA
          I would have these -- I don't know
          how to describe them -- visions,
          when I was younger.  Maybe not
          visions, but like these waking
          dream states.  Time would just
          collapse, I would be inside time. 
          I would stare at a second hand on a
          clock until it stopped.  Freaky
          stuff.

                    KELVIN
          How old were you?

                    RHEYA
          Seven, eight.  So one day my mother
          catches me sort of staring off into
          space, and she asks me what I'm
          doing, and I start trying to
          explain to her, about this state
          that I can put myself in, and this
          look comes over her face.

                    KELVIN
          What kind of look?

INT.  KELVIN'S ROOM

Kelvin and Rheya sit together in the Prometheus.  Rheya
continues her story without a beat.

                    RHEYA
          Scared.  No, not scared.  Wary. 
          Like I was something to be... her
          guard went up.  I was a threat. 
          Now I know why.  She was afraid
          she'd be seen.  That I would see
          her for the self-obsessed neurotic
          that she was.  I think she thought
          she had a few more years of being
          on a pedestal.  But that's the
          cycle, right?  I knew a little more
          than she did, she knew a little
          more than her mother, and on and
          on.
              (beat)
          I guess that's part of the reason
          why --

                    KELVIN
          I know.  I know.  We don't have to
          talk about that.

Another beat.

                    RHEYA
          I remember days of just thinking
          about you.

INT.  OFFICES - DAY

Intercut Kelvin and Rheya at their respective jobs, going
through a normal day.  There is no sound.  As we see these
images, it's clear that Kelvin and Rheya are slightly not
present in their respective encounters with other people;
they are distracted by the idea of each other.

And they like it.

                    RHEYA
          Thinking what you were doing and
          saying, just being consumed by
          thinking of you.  I loved it so
          much, that feeling.

                    KELVIN
          I did too.

INT.  APARTMENT - NIGHT

Rheya on the edge of the bed, facing away.

                    KELVIN
          I used to watch you undress.

As she does:

                    KELVIN
          I never tired of watching you
          undress.  Every time, it was
          exciting.  Right until... to the
          end.

A beat.  Then a shot of Kelvin that we've seen before: Him
leaving their apartment, angry.

ON THE PROMETHEUS

A beat.

                    RHEYA
          What happened to us, exactly?

                    KELVIN
          You don't know?

Rheya shakes her head.

Kelvin just watches her.

                    RHEYA
          I remember... something burning. 
          Coffee burning.

INT.  APARTMENT - DAY

The rain-streaked window.

An automated coffee maker has been left on, and the
solidified coffee at the bottom of the pot is smoking.

Rheya's body is on the floor of the kitchen.

RHEYA (ON PROMETHEUS)

She is looking at Kelvin.  He is dreading this.

                    RHEYA
          You found me?

He nods.  It's coming back to her.

INT.  APARTMENT - DAY

Kelvin is yelling at Rheya.  We don't hear what he's saying,
but judging from her reaction, it's not pleasant.  She is
crying.

RHEYA (ON PROMETHEUS)

Experiencing this all over again.  Kelvin comes and sits in
front of her.

INT.  APARTMENT - DAY

Kelvin, still yelling, is packing some things into a
suitcase.  Rheya, between sobs, pleads with him.

RHEYA (ON PROMETHEUS)

Her eyes fill with tears.  Kelvin embraces her.

                    KELVIN
          I'm sorry.  I'm sorry.

Rheya is devastated, inconsolable.

                    RHEYA
          Why did you say those things?

                    KELVIN
          I don't know.  I couldn't
          understand why you didn't tell me.

INT.  APARTMENT - DAY

Rheya lies on the kitchen floor, dead.  There is a NOTE in
her hand.

Kelvin kneels next to her.

KELVIN (ON PROMETHEUS)

With Rheya still in his arms.

                    KELVIN
          When you said you wouldn't make
          it... I didn't believe you.  Or I
          didn't take you seriously, which is
          worse.

INT.  APARTMENT - DAY

Kelvin holds the dead Rheya.

KELVIN (ON PROMETHEUS)

Squeezing her.

                    KELVIN
          I should have believed you.

                                                  CUT TO:

INT.  KELVIN'S ROOM

Kelvin lies in bed, his eyes open.  Rheya is in his arms.

                                                  CUT TO:

INT.  APARTMENT - DAY

Rheya, talking to Chris.  Obviously during a period when they
were getting along.  Or at least: not fighting.

                    RHEYA
          I can't help feeling that I'm
          cheating when I take them.

                    KELVIN
          It's genetics.  You know this.  You
          know where it comes from.  There is
          nothing wrong with uncrossing a few
          crossed wires.

She knows, intellectually, that he is right.  But it doesn't
matter.

                                                  CUT TO:

INT.  KELVIN'S ROOM

Kelvin is out of bed and speaking into a videophone to Snow. 
Rheya is asleep in the background.  The room is dark except
for the glow of the screen.

                    SNOW
          You're unnerved because you've
          spent your whole life thinking
          nobody is looking over you, and
          suddenly your subconscious is an
          open book.  We are, for the first
          time, experiencing changes in
          natural reality by a force not our
          own.  That proves that --

                    KELVIN
          -- we are not sure of that.  We are
          not sure we aren't all
          hallucinating.

                    SNOW
          If God is beyond our comprehension,
          and she --
              (meaning Rheya)
          -- is here for reasons that can't
          be understood, isn't God here?

                    KELVIN
          Not necessarily.

                    SNOW
          Stop equivocating!  Unbelievable,
          how you equivocate!  You, the
          atheist, you're more dogmatic than
          any holy person I've ever seen! 
          This is happening, Kevin.  Wake up.

                    KELVIN
          Consciousness is enough, that's all
          I've saying.  Consciousness should
          be enough for anybody.

                    SNOW
          Who are you trying to convince?

Kelvin just looks back at Rheya.

                    SNOW
          It will end badly.  As inevitably
          as the rising of a bubble.

Kelvin doesn't respond.

                    SNOW
          Let's all meet tomorrow.  Sartorius
          has some new ideas, about making it
          stop.

Kelvin just keeps staring at Rheya, asleep.

                                                  CUT TO:

INT.  KELVIN'S ROOM

Kelvin is eating with Rheya.  Looking at her.  Desiring her.

                    RHEYA
          Do you have any idea how much I
          like fucking you?

                    KELVIN
          I think so.

                    RHEYA
          Good.  Because I want you to know. 
          I really like fucking you.

He leans over and whispers in her ear.  She smiles and leans
back.

                    RHEYA
          I like that too.

                    KELVIN (V.O.)
          How could she not be real?  I can
          smell her, taste her.  She does
          exactly what she did... it's not
          possible.

                    RHEYA
              (smiles, teasing)
          You know, I've decided: I'm just
          gonna believe what you believe
          about this whole Solaris thing,
          it'll make life so much easier; the
          little wife agreeing with her big,
          strong husband.  You must get such
          a headache thinking about those
          Great Big Problems all day.

He just stares at her -- he really likes this.  It's
familiar, this type of teasing, and it reminds him of when
things were good.

                    KELVIN (V.O.)
          Like I said, it's not possible.

A beat.

                    RHEYA
          So, Chris, seriously, aren't you
          afraid you're going to get fired?

They laugh.

                                                  CUT TO:

INT.  KELVIN'S ROOM

Kelvin and Rheya, post-coital.  Relaxed.  On the verge of
sleep.

                    RHEYA
          You sure say "God" a lot when we're
          doing it.

                    KELVIN
          I know.  I'm putting that in my
          next report.

She smiles.

                    RHEYA
          Right.  The report.  Report and
          recommend.

They consider that.

                    RHEYA
          What does Snow think you should do?

                    KELVIN
          Snow thinks we shouldn't leave
          until we figure out a way to
          document it, to prove its existence
          to the planet Earth.  This is
          hilarious: He thinks it's God, but
          he wants it to sit still for a
          photograph so he can show the folks
          back home.

They smile at this.  Rheya's smile fades before Kelvin's.

                    RHEYA
          Sartorius wants to destroy it.

                    KELVIN
          Well.  He doesn't think it's God,
          but for different reasons than me. 
          He's thinking: If I can figure out
          how to make it stop, than I am
          smarter than it is, and therefore
          it cannot be God.

                    RHEYA
          He has a point.

                    KELVIN
          He does have a point.  That's just
          not the way I'd like to see it
          proven.

                    RHEYA
          You feel sorry for Solaris, or for
          me?

                    KELVIN
          It's a violent response to
          something we haven't figured out. 
          Don't let the cowardly demeanor
          fool you: He is ruthless. 
          Unblinking in his prejudice.

                    RHEYA
          It was obvious from the way he
          first looked at me.

A beat.  He holds her.

                    RHEYA
          Do I really feel like... I am...?

                    KELVIN
          Yes.  Yes.

                    RHEYA
          I'm glad.

A beat.

                                                  CUT TO:

EXT.  SOLARIS

Turning, slowly.

INT.  APARTMENT - NIGHT

Then years ago.  Kelvin, naked, sitting in a chair, in the
dark.  Rheya, also naked, is smoking a cigarette in bed.

                    KELVIN
          Everything you pursue, you end up
          becoming disinterested in.  The
          fact that you're good at everything
          you try makes it worse.  You have a
          degree in animal science, you could
          be a terrific vet. 
          You drifted into writing and turned
          out to be a perceptive journalist. 
          Then it was politics, which seemed
          best of all, you had an actual gift
          for understanding the best pattern
          for a group of people to be
          arranged for you to achieve your
          goal.  And they didn't even know
          they were being arranged.  But you
          got bored with it, like you do with
          everything.

She just smokes, not really looking at him.  Maybe it's a
common observation and she's past being defensive about it.

                    KELVIN
          I don't know what it's really like,
          to not know what you want to do. 
          To not have anything that you love
          to do more than anything else.

A beat.  He looks at her.  She seems more interested in her
cigarette at the moment.

                    RHEYA
              (sarcastic)
          Imagine my frustration.

                                                  CUT TO:

INT.  KELVIN'S ROOM

On the Prometheus.  Rheya is awake, Kelvin asleep.

She rises and goes to sit in a chair; she is anxious,
something we haven't seen before.

Kelvin wakes up, looks at her.  Noting her expression:

                    KELVIN
          What's wrong.

                    RHEYA
          You don't love me.

                    KELVIN
          Stop.

A beat.  She looks down.

                    RHEYA
          I have to talk to you... I... I
          don't know where I came from.
              (up at him)
          Do you know?

He doesn't respond.

                    RHEYA
          If you know but can't tell me
          now... will you ever be able to?

Calmly:

                    KELVIN
          What are you talking about?

                    RHEYA
          That I am not Rheya.  That Rheya
          died.  Killed herself.  I'm
          different.

He's looking at her, and knows this is dangerous territory.

                    KELVIN
          Who have you been talking to?

                    RHEYA
              (no reason to lie)
          Sartorius.

                    KELVIN
          When?  When I'm asleep?

She nods.  He can only imagine what form Sartorius' anecdotes
must have taken.

                    KELVIN
          I'm sure there are worse people to
          talk to, but I don't know who they
          are.

                    RHEYA
          I'm just trying to understand
          what's going on.

A beat.

                    RHEYA
          How have you lived the last ten
          years?  Did you love anyone?

A long beat.  Kelvin shakes his head.

                    RHEYA
          Did you think about me?

Another beat.  He nods.  Then:

                    RHEYA
          But we fought.

                    KELVIN
          Yes.  Especially toward the end.

                    RHEYA
          Why did she do it?

                    KELVIN
          You... she said I didn't love her.

                    RHEYA
          Was she right?

                    KELVIN
          No.  I love you.

                    RHEYA
              (reflexive, but genuine)
          I love you, too.

If she seems satisfied for the moment, Kelvin knows the
feeling won't last.

                    KELVIN
          Can you sleep?

                    RHEYA
          I don't think do.  It's not sleep;
          it's something else.  It's all
          around me.

                    KELVIN
          Those are dreams.

She falls asleep.

                                                FADE OUT.

FADE IN:

INT.  CONFERENCE ROOM

Kelvin, Rheya, Sartorius, and Snow.  They are in the middle
of a heated discussion.

                    SNOW
          Gibarian was under enormous --

                    SARTORIUS
          Gibarian was helpless.  It's very
          simple: Man created the science
          that resulted in the discovery of
          Solaris, and the ship that brought
          us here.

                    KELVIN
          Meaning Man can do whatever the
          fuck it wants?

                    SARTORIUS
          Yes.

                    KELVIN
          That's fantastic.

                    SARTORIUS
          Why did you agree to come here?

A beat.

                    SARTORIUS
          Too tired to answer?

Looks at Rheya, then back to Kelvin.

                    SARTORIUS
          I'll bet.  Is this what they sent
          you here to do?  You've lost it,
          you've gone native.

Kelvin moves toward him.  Sartorius just lets him come.

                    RHEYA
              (to Sartorius)
          You're the coward.

                    KELVIN
          Don't debate him; he'll say
          anything.

                    RHEYA
              (still, to Sartorius)
          I'm just as human as you.  I see, I
          hear, I touch, and I feel just like
          you do.

                    SARTORIUS
          Prove it.

                    RHEYA
          These "guests" are a part of you,
          of your subconscious.  Chris loves
          me.

                    SARTORIUS
          YOU ARE NOT HUMAN!  Try to
          understand that if you can
          understand anything!

Kelvin is within an inch of his face.

                    KELVIN
          Get out of here.

Slowly, carefully, Sartorius grasps Kelvin by the shoulders. 
Then he leans in and whispers in Kelvin's ear:

                    SARTORIUS
          Rheya is dead.  She's a copy.  A
          facsimile.  And she's seducing you
          all over again.  You're sick.  You
          think of fucking her as research
          for humanity.  It's just fucking.

Kelvin backs away.

                    SARTORIUS
          There's nothing grandiose about it. 
          You've jumped out of a plane and
          you're trying to sew a parachute
          together while you fall.

Sartorius turns...

                    SARTORIUS
          It'd be hilarious if it weren't so
          damn sad.

And leaves.

A beat.

                    SNOW
          We didn't even get to hear his new
          ideas.

Snow wanders toward the door.

                    SNOW
          I'm not feeling well.

He passes Kelvin and leaves.

Kelvin watches him, then looks at Rheya.  She seems dazed.

                                                  CUT TO:

EXT.  SOLARIS

The fog-shrouded surface, shifting and turning like an ocean.

                                                  CUT TO:

INT.  KELVIN'S ROOM

Rheya is asleep.  Kelvin is talking to Snow on the
videophone.

                    SNOW
          We can liquidate the station.  Take
          the Athena back.

                    KELVIN
          No.

                    SNOW
          Of course, when we return, we'll be
          regarded as lunatics if we tell the
          truth.
              (shrugs)
          We'll chalk it up to isolation,
          collective derangement.

                    KELVIN
          I've never heard you express any
          desire to leave before now.  Why
          now?

                    SNOW
          Well, I think we're reaching the
          point of diminishing returns here,
          right?  Certainly it's learning
          more about us than we'll ever learn
          about it.

                    KELVIN
          But why is it doing what it's
          doing?  Given it's resources, it
          could have done anything. 
          Presented me with your double, and
          you with mine.

                    SNOW
          Perhaps it did.

                    KELVIN
          Human beings can die.

                    SNOW
          But they are human.  They certainly
          become human with incredible speed. 
          First they're like they were in our
          memory, but then they fill in on
          their own.  DNA doesn't determine
          the hundreds of trillions of
          connections that occur in the
          brain, it's not dense enough.  They
          build up with experience.

INT.  KELVIN'S ROOM - EARLIER

Quick glimpses of Rheya.  In several of them she is in
repose, thinking, as if to illustrate Snow's point.

INT.  KELVIN'S ROOM

Back to Kelvin, thinking.

                    KELVIN
          They come when you sleep.

                    SNOW
          That's right.  And we all have to
          sleep, eventually.

                                                  CUT TO:

INT.  KELVIN'S ROOM

Kelvin on the bed with Rheya.  Their eyes are closed.

We think they are asleep until:

                    RHEYA
          You don't want me.

                    KELVIN
          Rheya.

                    RHEYA
          That's what you were saying.  I
          heard what you were saying.

                    KELVIN
          For a reason that neither of us
          understand, you are forced to stay
          near me.  That's all I know right
          now.

She realizes she doesn't want to argue.  Not right now,
anyway.

                    RHEYA
          I have these strange thoughts, I
          don't know where they come from.
              (beat)
          I can't explain it.

                    KELVIN
          Neither can I.  Not any of it. 
          There's no reference point for
          what's going on; it's never
          happened before.  It's a clean
          break in the fabric of the
          Universe; a gap.  There is nothing
          to do but experience it, moment-to-
          moment, and not let it destroy us.

                    RHEYA
          But that's what happened before.

                    KELVIN
          Not this time.

He kisses her.  She wants to believe him, so she says
nothing.  Then:

                    RHEYA
          Do you want to stay here?

                    KELVIN
          Do you?

                    RHEYA
          If you're here.

They kiss again...

                                             DISSOLVE TO:

INT.  KELVIN'S ROOM

Kelvin is asleep.  Rheya is next to him.

Offscreen, we hear the door open.

Someone walks quietly (though not surreptitiously) through
the frame and sits.

After a long beat, Kelvin bolts upright, his mind struggling
to clear.  When it does:

                    KELVIN
          Gibarian.

                    GIBARIAN
          Leave the light off.

A beat.  Kelvin tries to get his bearings.

                    GIBARIAN
          I wish you'd come a little sooner. 
          I might not have had to kill
          myself.

He smiles, looking at Kelvin.

                    GIBARIAN
          You think you're dreaming me, like
          you dream her.  Understand
          something: I am the real Gibarian. 
          Just a new incarnation.

                    KELVIN
          What do you want?

                    GIBARIAN
          You're being tricked.  Sartorius
          picked a fight with you to avoid
          telling you about his idea for
          getting rid of the visitors.  He's
          figured out they're made of
          subatomic particles called
          neutrinos, and he's going to create
          a negative neutrino field.  Twenty
          four hours a day, until they're
          back on Earth.

                    KELVIN
          Can it work?

                    GIBARIAN
          It can.  Ordinary matter, like
          ours?  Not affected.  Everything
          else, disintegrates.

Kelvin registers this.

                    GIBARIAN
          What I'm saying is: Don't trust
          anyone.  Find yourself a weapon of
          some sort.

                    KELVIN
          I can trust Rheya.

                    GIBARIAN
          You'll end up like me.

                    KELVIN
          You're not Gibarian...

                    GIBARIAN
          No?  Who am I, then?

                    KELVIN
          A puppet.

                    GIBARIAN
          And you're not?  Maybe you're my
          puppet.  But like all puppets, you
          think you're actually human.  It's
          The Puppet's Dream.  Wondering if
          they're human!

Gibarian smiles.

KELVIN

wakes up, gulping air.  Rheya, startled:

                    RHEYA
          What's wrong?

                    KELVIN
          Gibarian.  He was here.

                    RHEYA
          You said he was dead.

                    KELVIN
          He is.  But he was here...

He moves to the chair, looking for some residue of Gibarian,
some proof.  Finding none:

                    KELVIN
          He spoke to me.

Kelvin leaves the room.  After a few beats, Rheya follows.

INT.  LAB

Rheya lingers behind Kelvin, who is looking at Gibarian's
body.

It is there, alone on its slab; even the Young Girl is not
with him.  

                                                  CUT TO:

INT.  KELVIN'S ROOM

Kelvin, thinking.  He gives Rheya some pills to take.  She
just looks at them.

                    KELVIN
          Are you going to take them?

She nods and takes them.

                    RHEYA
          What's happening to us?

                    KELVIN
          It's all right.

                    RHEYA
          Please don't lie.  I told you
          before, I don't know how I came to
          be here.  Whatever you think you
          can't say to me, I need to hear you
          say it.

                    KELVIN
          I love you.

                    RHEYA
          Don't.  I'm the one at risk here. 
          If we're playing out what happened
          before, I won't survive.

He goes to her.

                    KELVIN
          That won't happen again.  We're
          different.

                    RHEYA
          How can I tell?  You've seen both
          of me.  I only know what you're
          like here.  You're all I know. 
          There is no "You" from before.

She sits, frustrated.  Sad.

                    RHEYA
          How could it be so cruel?  How
          could it torture us like this?

                    KELVIN
          I don't think it knows it's
          torturing us.  It's just watching.

                                                  CUT TO:

INT.  KELVIN'S ROOM

Kelvin and Rheya, in bed.  She looks despondent.

                                                  CUT TO:

INT.  KELVIN'S ROOM

Kelvin is asleep.  Alone.

After a long period of silence, we hear the faint sound of an
instrument of some sort hitting the ground.  After another
beat, Kelvin awakens.  He notices that he is alone, and
something tells him that's not a good sign.

                                                  CUT TO:

INT.  LAB

Rheya is on the ground, convulsing.  Beside her is a SMALL
STEEL DRUM, which is spilling a strange-looking LIQUID that
solidifies and vaporizes with a smoky hiss.

Kelvin moves to Rheya and is startled to see that half of her
face and throat are burned away -- not melted as in a fire,
but merely eaten cleanly away.  He picks her up.

INT.  CORRIDOR

Kelvin is carrying Rheya.  Snow sticks his head out of a
passing room.

                    SNOW
          What happened?

                    KELVIN
          She drank liquid oxygen.

INT.  KELVIN'S ROOM

Kelvin puts Rheya on the bed.  Her face and throat have
returned to normal, but she is not breathing.  Kelvin goes
and puts his head to her chest, but doesn't hear what he
hoped to hear.  He stands, still looking at her.  Snow seems
very detached.

An uncomfortably long moment as we realize she is actually
not going to wake up.

                    KELVIN
          She's dead.

Snow says nothing.

Then:

Her finger twitches.

Barely noticeable at first, but growing in intensity.  Kelvin
sees it, and goes to her.  She is starting to shake a little,
as though cold.

                    SNOW
          She'll come back, don't worry.  But
          then what?  My theory is she can
          only live here, that she will die
          if she leaves this ship.

Kelvin is still looking at Rheya, who is shaking a little
harder; it's feeling like a seizure now.

                    SNOW
          Why do you think she hasn't
          suggested that?  It's the most
          obvious solution: Escape.  She
          knows she can't leave here --

                    KELVIN
          Get out --

                    SNOW
          Oh, this one you love?  What about
          the first one, the one you fucked
          and then put into a rocket and
          blasted into space?  You didn't
          love her?

Rheya is shaking much harder now, Kelvin tries to hold her
still, but she's too strong.  He stands, reluctantly, and
watches her.

                    SNOW
          What happens if she comes back?  Is
          that polygamy?  And even if you
          could take her home, how would you
          get her through?  You think they're
          not going to notice her?

Rheya is shaking violently now, as if a rippling rhythmic
force were coursing through her.  Snow, as he looks
dispassionately on the two of them:

                    SNOW
          I never get used to them, these...
          "Resurrections".

He leaves.

Rheya continues her process of "waking up" -- it's violent,
even sexual.  She spasms to a peak of some sort, and then
slowly returns to normal.

Kelvin puts his hand on her forehead.

She gradually begins to open her eyes.  She looks at Kelvin.

It takes her a moment to realize she shouldn't be seeing him;
she shouldn't be seeing anything.  She should be dead.

She begins to cry.

                    RHEYA
          What am I?  Why can't I die?

She turns away.

                    RHEYA
          I'm not Rheya.  You're always known
          that.

                    KELVIN
          Rheya --

                    RHEYA
          Don't call me that.

He turns her over.

                    KELVIN
          Listen: I don't care about anything
          but the fact that you are here. 
          You are her, you are Rheya.

                    RHEYA
          I'm disgusting.

                    KELVIN
          No.

                    RHEYA
          You're lying.  I'm not human.

                    KELVIN
          Rheya, I am not going back.  I'm
          staying here with you.

                    RHEYA
          Then you'll die.

                    KELVIN
          I want every second I can get with
          you.

A beat.

                    RHEYA
          What will I do, if you die?

He doesn't know.

                                                  CUT TO:

EXT.  SOLARIS

Turning slowly.

                                                  CUT TO:

INT.  KELVIN'S ROOM

Kelvin and Rheya, in bed.

                    RHEYA
          Do you think I can get pregnant
          here?

A long beat.

                    KELVIN
          We'll know soon enough.

INSERT:

The first time Kelvin and Rheya spoke, at the party ten years
ago.  Again we see her whisper in Kelvin's ear, but this time
we hear what she is saying:

                    RHEYA
          I can't be a mother.

She pulls back.

                    KELVIN
          That's good to know.

Kelvin, as he packs to leave Rheya.

                    RHEYA
          Don't do this.  I am literally
          begging you not to do this.  Chris.

                    KELVIN
          You should have told me.

                    RHEYA
          It wouldn't have made any
          difference.

                    KELVIN
          Thank you.

                    RHEYA
          Chris, I had to.  I had to.  I
          didn't think you'd react like this.

                    KELVIN
          Neither did I.

                    RHEYA
          You never said you wanted one.

                    KELVIN
          I never said I didn't.

                    RHEYA
          Chris --

                    KELVIN
          I can't stay here.

                    RHEYA
          Chris, please.  Chris, I'm serious. 
          I won't make it.

                    KELVIN
          Then you won't make it.

He leaves, brushing past her.

A long, held shot of Rheya, crying.  She is curled up,
retreating into herself.  Kelvin is trying to console her.

          I came back.  You have to know
          that.  I came back that night.

          You're afraid of me.  I can't do
          this anymore.  I still don't
          understand.  It's not possible.

He tries to console her, but she recoils.

                    RHEYA
          Don't --

INT.  APARTMENT - DAY

Rheya, as Kelvin brushes past her on his way out.  She looks
desperate.

INT.  KELVIN'S ROOM

Rheya and Kelvin.

                    RHEYA
          What do I have to do to stop it?

                    KELVIN
          I want you here.

                    RHEYA
          You're lying.

                    KELVIN
          You exist here.  I keep telling
          you.

                    RHEYA
          That's impossible.  I'm not Rheya.

                    KELVIN
          Who are you, then?

                    RHEYA
          I... I am Rheya.  But I am not the
          woman you loved ten years ago.

                    KELVIN
          Yes, you are --

                    RHEYA
          Did you hear what Gibarian said? 
          I'm not a human being.  I'm an
          instrument.  I came from your
          memory and your imagination and I
          will torture you no matter what.
          Even if I remain passive.  That's
          when I drank the...
              (beat)
          I was going mad.  It felt like
          there was no body underneath my
          skin.  There was something else. 
          An illusion.  But I could feel my
          heart beating, and I remembered you
          tested my blood.  Is it like yours?

                    KELVIN
          Yes.  I told you.  It was exactly
          like mine.

                    RHEYA
          But then I would be dead now.

A beat.

                    KELVIN
          Is that really what you want?

                    RHEYA
          I want to stop taking those pills.

                    KELVIN
          I wish you wouldn't.

                    RHEYA
          They do something to me.  It's hard
          to think straight.

                    KELVIN
          I think they help.

                    RHEYA
          I have consciousness, but I am not
          mortal.  Don't you see why I'm
          going crazy?

                    KELVIN
          You have to remember that I love
          you, that's all that matters --

                    RHEYA
          I can't --

                    KELVIN
          It put you here.  I'll admit it, it
          acted like a God and put you here,
          put you into my consciousness. 
          I was asleep, and it put you into
          my dream.  I saw your mouth.  And
          there you were.
              (beat)
          Whether you've been sent here to
          make me happy or punish me, it
          doesn't matter.  The decision we
          make now is all that matters.  Stay
          with me.

                    RHEYA
          Am I really her?

                    KELVIN
          I don't know anymore.  All I see is
          you.

They kiss.

                    KELVIN
          Stay with me.
              (beat)
          Stay with me.

Kelvin is on the videophone to Snow.

                    KELVIN

          who she is.

                    SNOW
          She knows everything?  Does she
          know she came once before and you
          put her in --

                    KELVIN
          No.

A beat.

                    SNOW
          What do you want?

                    KELVIN
          I want you to get Sartorius to
          abandon his plan.

                    SNOW
              (feigning innocence)
          What plan?

                    KELVIN
          Just get him to stop.

                    SNOW
          What do you want to do, leave the
          station with her?

                    KELVIN
          Yes.

                    SNOW
          Kelvin, she'll disintegrate.  You
          don't believe me?  Let's radio that
          shuttle pod you launched -- better
          yet, let's go get it.  I've charted
          it's trajectory, only take a few
          hours...

                    KELVIN
          Her oxygen would have run out.

                    SNOW
          Maybe she doesn't need any.  Should
          we check?

Kelvin just stares at him.

                    SNOW
          Who are you trying to please? 
          Yourself?  Her?  Which her, this
          one or that one.  Can you face
          both?  We are in a situation that
          is beyond morality.  So: Leave with
          her.  You'll see the
          transformation.

                    KELVIN
          Into what?

                    SNOW
          You'll see her die, that's all. 
          They're mortal, despite what she
          told you.  She will die.  Then what
          will you do?

                    KELVIN
          I love her.

                    SNOW
          You do, you don't.  She's willing
          to give her life, you're willing to
          give yours, it's touching and
          magnificent, anything you want but

          Kelvin.
              (beat)
          It is a mistake to become
          emotionally engaged with one of
          them.  You are being manipulated. 
          You are going around in circles to
          satisfy the curiosity of a power we
          don't understand and can't control,
          and she is the living proof that
          power exists.  If she were ugly,
          you wouldn't want her around;
          that's why she's not ugly.  She is
          a mirror that reflects part of your
          mind.  You provide the formula. 
          You can only finish where you
          started, remember that.

          They sold us out to the highest

Kelvin wakes up.  Rheya is beside him.  He rises and heads

He swallows two pills and a small cup of water.

When he returns to the bed, Rheya is looking at him.

          What are you taking?

Rheya, on the kitchen floor.  The bottle of sleeping pills
just beyond her hand.

BACK ON THE PROMETHEUS

Kelvin looks at Rheya.  She shakes her head; she doesn't want
the pills.  Kelvin comes and sits beside her.

                    KELVIN
          What does it want?

                    RHEYA
          I don't know.  Something. 
          Anything.

She goes to a portal and stares out at Solaris.

                    RHEYA
          It created me and yet I can't
          communicate with it.  It must hear
          me, though.  It must know what's

          I don't think it dislikes us.  I
          think it just noticed us.  It
          lives, thinks, and acts.  We are
          dealing with a living creature
          here, no question.  And it's done
          something we've never been able to

          Perfect except for the subatomic

          If Solaris is inside our brain, and

          consciously aware of what 2% of our

          I've decided that if it is God,
          it's a sick God.  Its ambitions
          exceed its powers, but it doesn't
          realize it.
              (beat)
          It's created a situation without a
          goal, and I hate that.  A God whose

          saves nothing, fulfills no purpose.
              (beat)
          And us?  We would have to have "an
          arrangement".  An unspoken
          understanding that I am not human. 
          How can I not hate something that

Sitting in the same position as it was on the Prometheus.

Breathes a sigh of relief at being home.  Everything seems
slowed down, somehow.

                    KELVIN (V.O.)
          I though I was home.

          Where did you go before?

                    RHEYA
          When?

                    KELVIN
          Last night.  You were talking to
          someone in the corridor.

                    RHEYA
          You must have been dreaming.

She begins to cry.

                    KELVIN
          What's the matter?

She just shakes her head.

                    KELVIN
          Rheya?

From Kelvin's point of view: Rheya, in the chair, crying.

Then he looks right to see: Rheya, in the doorway, talking to
someone we cannot see.

Then he looks further to the right, and there she is again,
staring at him from the bathroom doorway.  She moves to the
edge of the bed in order to be near.

KELVIN

Sweating.  Struggling.  Beyond fear.

          Am I in the moment of my own death?
              (beat)
          Is this the last thought I will
          ever have?

This idea forces him to rise, and he does, slowly.

INT.  CORRIDOR

Behind Kelvin as he somehow keeps moving.

We hold a long time, and then:

                                                  CUT TO:

EXT.  STREET

Kelvin moving down a crowded sidewalk, in slow motion.

                    KELVIN (V.O.)
          I am home now.
              (beat)
          I try to find the rhythm of the
          world where I used to live... but I
          feel completely and continually out
          of-sync.  I am separate.  Why did I
          return to Earth and lie about what
          happened?  Lie about having contact
          with something like Solaris?  I
          knew something else was out there,
          and didn't tell a soul.  I left
          them in the dark.  We all did.

EXT.  KELVIN'S CABIN - DAY

Kelvin returns.  He stops and looks around before entering
his front door.

                    KELVIN (V.O.)
          So why come back at all?  To see if
          she comes here?

KEVIN'S POV

Of the woods.

But there are strange incongruities in the image -- pieces of
the Prometheus breaking through; for instance, a few of the
AUTOMATED TASKMASTERS are crawling along the ground.

KELVIN

Looking from the doorway, notes this.  He doesn't seem
surprised, though.

                    KELVIN (V.O.)
          I don't believe it will happen.

INT.  KELVIN'S CABIN - NIGHT

Kelvin, in his bed, awake.

                    KELVIN (V.O.)
          But I will wait, anyway.

                                                  CUT TO:

INT.  KELVIN'S ROOM (PROMETHEUS)

Kelvin is in his bed, still feverish.

                    KELVIN (V.O.)
          I thought it was over.

He looks around the room.  He is alone.

A flashing light on his computer demands attention.

ON THE COMPUTER

A video message from Rheya.

                    RHEYA
          Don't blame them.  I begged them to
          do it.  It's better this way.
              (beat)
          I'm sorry.
              (beat)
          I'm sorry I tried to make you think
          I was human.
              (beat)
          I read my own suicide note.  I
          found it in your things.  I
          realized I was not her.

She looks away.

                    RHEYA
          I know that you loved me, Chris.  I
          know that.
              (beat)
          I love you.

Kelvin breaks down.

                                                  CUT TO:

INT.  APARTMENT - DAY

Kelvin, with the dead Rheya in his arms, crying.  Beyond him
is the rain-streaked window.  On the floor, by her hand, is
the note.  On it is scrawled the end of a Dylan Thomas poem,
the one Kelvin quoted to her the first time they spoke.

INT.  PARTY - NIGHT

The first night.  Again, Kelvin leans into Rheya's ear and
whispers.  This time we hear what he says:

                    KELVIN
          "Though they go mad they shall be
          sane.  Though they sink through the
          sea they shall rise again."

INT.  APARTMENT - DAY

Kevin holding Rheya.

The note on the floor.

The rain-streaked window.

                    RHEYA (V.O.)
          "Though lovers be lost love shall
          not.  And death shall have no
          dominion."

Kelvin wipes the hair from her face.

                    KELVIN (V.O.)
          You killed her!

                    SARTORIUS (V.O.)
          Not her.  It.

                                                  CUT TO:

INT.  PROMETHEUS

Kelvin, furious, is talking through a slit in Sartorius'
door.

                    KELVIN
          You murdered her!

                    SARTORIUS
          Kelvin, she begged me.  I had a
          short-range version of the
          destabilizer prototype, a miniature
          with a range of a few meters.  She
          walked into it and disappeared. 
          She was gone.

Kelvin looks around.

                    KELVIN
          She'll come back.

                    SARTORIUS
          No, she won't.

                    KELVIN
          Why would you let her to do that?

                    SARTORIUS
          It's not human, Kelvin.  Whatever
          it is, it's not human, and I am
          threatened by that.  Evolution-of-
          the-species-at-stake threatened. 
          And I want to win.  I want humans
          to win.  So I am killing it before
          it kills me.

                    KELVIN
          You fucking bastard...

                    SARTORIUS
          Whose side are you on?

Kelvin moves away.

                                                  CUT TO:

EXT.  SOLARIS

Still turning, slowly.

But something about its appearance is different.

INT.  PROMETHEUS

Complete chaos.

Kelvin is chasing Sartorius to the flight deck.

                    SARTORIUS
              (yelling as he runs)
          It's changing characteristics. 
          It's solidifying taking on weight.

                    KELVIN
          How quickly?

                    SARTORIUS
          If it continues, it will implode
          from its own weight and turn into a
          black hole in about four hours and
          pulls us in with it.

INT.  FLIGHT DECK

Kelvin and Sartorius get the ship ready for take off.

                    KELVIN
          Where's Snow?  Did you call him?

                    SARTORIUS
          Yes.

Kelvin turns and sees one of the video monitors that Snow is
sitting in his room.

                    KELVIN
              (via intercom)
          Snow!  We need you up here.

Snow doesn't reply.

                    KELVIN
          Snow!

Snow looks up.  There's a strange look on his face.

                    KELVIN
          What's wrong with you?  We need
          your help.

                    SNOW
          I won't be making the trip.

                    SARTORIUS
          Snow, get up here, now.

                    SNOW
          I'm not Snow.

This stops Kelvin and Sartorius.  They look at each other and
then at the monitor.

                    SNOW
          I got rid of him.  I wanted to see
          if... I wanted to be the only one. 
          I wanted to be Snow.

                    SARTORIUS
          Fuck me.  I knew it.

                    KELVIN
          When did this happen?

                    SNOW
          Oh, right away.  That's why you
          never saw me with anyone.  You
          should've noticed that.  I miss
          him, though.  I think I made a
          mistake.

                    KELVIN
          Jesus...

                    SNOW
          But I can't leave with you.  I
          won't make it.

                    KELVIN
          Maybe you can.

                    SARTORIUS
          You want it coming back with us?

                    SNOW
          You go ahead.  Of what I remember
          about Earth... it's all one thing
          now.  Everything's a blur.  I like
          distinctions.

Snow lies down on his bed.  Kelvin looks at Sartorius.

                    SARTORIUS
          We do not have time to deal with
          this.  Get the diode sail into
          position and let me know when the
          bias drive and the induction ring
          are at zero point.

Kelvin nods and obeys.  He then takes one last look at the
monitor to see Snow lying in bed.  Kelvin reaches over and
shuts the monitor off.

                                                  CUT TO:

EXT.  SPACE

Silence.

The Prometheus moves away from Solaris.

CLOSER ON SOLARIS

After the ship has gone.

A soft black spot begins to form in the center of the planet.

Slowly, inexorably, this black spot begins to expand.

Within a minute Solaris has disappeared.

                                                  CUT TO:

EXT.  STREET CORNER - DAY

Kelvin, back on Earth.  Silent and still.  And the rain
continues.

He watches the activity; the cars, buses, and people moving
to and fro.

                    KELVIN (V.O.)
          Earth.
              (beat)
          What did that word mean to me?
              (beat)
          I have returned.  Finally.

Kelvin begins to walk.

                    KELVIN (V.O.)
          I work in the city now.  After work
          I wander and lose myself.  I am
          silent and attentive.  I follow the
          current.  I make a conscious effort
          to smile, nod, stand, and perform
          the millions of gestures that
          constitute life on Earth.

INT.  TRAIN - DAY

Kelvin taking the train to the suburbs.

                    KELVIN (V.O.)
          I will study these gestures until
          they become reflexes again.  I will
          find new interests and occupations,
          but --

EXT.  ROAD - DAY

Kelvin makes his way toward his cabin.  As he nears, his
LABRODOR recognizes him and approaches.

Kelvin pats the dog's coat.

                    KELVIN (V.O.)
          I will not... give myself.  I will
          not give myself to anything or
          anyone, because I am haunted by the
          idea that I remembered her wrong. 
          That I shaded my memory of her to
          suit myself.  That I was unfair to
          her and caused her destruction. 
          What if I was wrong about
          everything?
              (beat)
          I've come to believe that memory is
          a curse.

EXT.  CABIN - DAY

Kelvin is near the front door, dog at his heel.  He looks in
as he brings his key to the lock and his face FREEZES.

RHEYA

Is in the living room, waiting for him.

She is sitting on the sofa, looking toward the other side of
the room.  Sensing someone, she turns to see Kelvin, and her
face melts into a smile.

KELVIN

Opens the door.  He cannot speak.

RHEYA

Rises and moves toward him.

They embrace.

He breathes her in.  She squeezes him.

After a long beat:

                    KELVIN
          How can you be here...

                    RHEYA
              (whispering)
          Shhhh.  Just stay with me.
              (beat)
          Stay with me.  Everything is
          forgiven.  Everything.

She sways with him, gently.  His body relaxes.

                    KELVIN
          I love you.

EXT.  CABIN - DAY

A tableau of the cabin.  The dog is on the front step,
seemingly content despite the light rain.

As fog drifts in, we RISE, and soon the mist has nearly
obscured the house.  The fog turns into clouds and we get
fleeting glimpses of the cabin, as we move farther and
farther away.

We stay in a translucent white stage for a few moments, until
gradually the edges of a circle become apparent in the
corners of the frame.  Still there is a light rain sound.

These dark, rounded edges penetrate further until they are
forming the shape of a circle.

The misty consistency begins to gain some color and body.

And we realize we are now looking at the surface of Solaris.

                                                FADE OUT.

First, over BLACK, we hear the sound of a light rain.

Then:

                    A MAN'S VOICE
          I'm not a poet.  I've never moved
          anyone with my words.
              (beat)
          Maybe that's why they chose me.

EXT.  WOODS - DAY

A mural of leafless trees beneath an overcast sky.  Rain
continues to fall.

Maybe now we begin to notice a strange quality to the light
(or is it the sky?).  Something vaguely unsettling.

                                                  CUT TO:

INT.  BEDROOM - MORNING

Still, the sound of rain is heard.

A MAN

40s, lies on his side in bed, staring at us.

He has not been sleeping.  In fact, judging from his distant
expression, he has not slept in ages.

                                                  CUT TO:

EXT.  ROAD - DAY

Less like a road and more like a path that you maneuver a
vehicle through.

The Man, dressed in rain gear, walks down the middle.  He is
accompanied by a medium-sized LABRADOR, and seems in no
particular hurry.

The sound of tires appear and grow in intensity.  The Man,
without saying an actual word, instructs the dog to heal. 
The dog obeys as the Man moves off the road.  The vehicle
hurtles past him -- its engine quiet, its windows darkened --
spraying muddy debris in its wake.

Seconds later, the car brakes abruptly and skids to a stop.

THE MAN

Stops walking and stares at the car, which seems ominously
still.

The car then reverses direction and begins to move toward the
Man, who remains motionless.

When the car is alongside him, a darkened window turns
transparent and we see a WELL-DRESSED BUREAUCRAT in the rear
seat.  His demeanor is pleasant and professional.

                    WELL-DRESSED BUREAUCRAT
          Dr. Kelvin?

The Man he is addressing, who we now understand is CHRIS
KELVIN, stares back at him.

                                                  CUT TO:

INT.  CABIN - DAY

The contrast between the cabin's rustic aesthetic and the
aggressively high-tech equipment contained therein isn't as
jarring as you might imagine.

Kelvin is seated in front of a desk, scrolling through a text
readout on a flat, transparent holographic screen.  Behind
him is the Well-Dressed Bureaucrat from the car, and two
others: A WOMAN in her 50s and a MAN in his 30s.  They are
also well-groomed.  Each of their suits are embroidered with
a small but distinctive LOGO of some sort that composes the
acronym DBA.

Kelvin scrolls through several menus, hits a few keys, and a
digitized VIDEO IMAGE appears on his screen: A MAN, unshaven,
looking into the camera.

The man, GIBARIAN, looks very tired and somewhat apologetic. 
The lower part of the screen has a time of day and date
display that reads: 0221 HRS 11/14/31.

                    GIBARIAN
          We take off into the cosmos, ready
          for anything: solitude, hardship,
          exhaustion, death.  We're proud of
          ourselves, in a way.  But our
          enthusiasm is a sham.  We don't
          want to conquer the cosmos -- we
          want to extend the boundaries of
          Earth to the cosmos.  We are only
          seeking Man.  We don't want Other
          Worlds.  We want mirrors.
              (beat)
          Maybe we don't need to know what it
          is, or why.  Maybe just knowing
          that it is should be enough.

Gibarian stares at the camera for a long moment before
switching it off and ending the transmission.

Kelvin sits back.

The visitors exchange glances.

                                                  CUT TO:

INT.  SPACE CAPSULE

Close on Kelvin.  We hold on him a long time, as a myriad of
readouts scroll and flash across his face.  A slit of
sunlight glides slowly through frame.

                                             DISSOLVE TO:

KELVIN

in the same capsule, a month later.  He is asleep.

                                             DISSOLVE TO:

KELVIN

in the same capsule, two months later.  He is dictating some
coordinates to Earth.  He absently scratches his heavy growth
of beard.

                                             DISSOLVE TO:

KELVIN

two months later still.  He is looking out his small,
rectangular window, and for the fist time we cut around to
see the approaching planet: SOLARIS.

Kelvin stares at it, hypnotized.  It has a translucent
quality, as though it is lit from within, and its undulating,
ocean-like surface slowly changes colors.

Kelvin's attention is diverted as an orbiting ship, the
PROMETHEUS, edges into frame.

                    KELVIN
          Prometheus, this is Athena 7, on
          approach, do you read me?
              (beat)
          Prometheus, this is Athena 7, on
          approach, do you read me?

No response.  He exhales and types on a keyboard.

EXT.  SPACE

The Athena 7, sporting a DBA logo, advances toward the
Prometheus.

                                                  CUT TO:

INT.  PROMETHEUS

Kelvin, in a space suit, climbs with some difficulty out of
the Athena 7, which has come to rest in the DOCKING BAY of
the Prometheus.  Several exploratory PODS fill the remainder
of the area.

Kelvin gets his bearings and looks around, but sees no sign
of life.

                                                  CUT TO:

INT.  CORRIDOR

Empty.

(NOTE: Except for some ROBOTIC, NON-SPEAKING CHARACTERS: the
AUTOMATED TASKMASTERS.  These are small, bug-like repair
units that constantly roam the ship, fixing things.  Their
tiny hum is virtually silent, and we see them all the time on
the Prometheus.  They can adhere to any surface at any
angle.)

Kelvin, now out of his space suit and holding a small
carrying case and a duffle bag, moves on.

                                                  CUT TO:

INT.  GIBARIAN'S ROOM

Ransacked.

Kelvin registers it, then moves to the corner of the room
where the computer terminal rests.  Within moments he has
discovered Gibarian has recorded a video message for him to
replay.

VIDEO

Gibarian addressing the camera.  He appears to be lucid, but
extremely fatigued.

                    GIBARIAN
          Hi, Chris.
              (a light smile)
          I'm so glad you came.
              (beat, the smile fades)
          I still have a little time, and I
          want to tell you something.  To
          warn you.  By now you know about
          me, or if you don't, get Snow or
          Sartorius to tell you; it doesn't
          matter.
              (beat)
          I didn't lose my mind.  You should
          be able to tell from this video. 
          I'm not mad.
              (beat)
          If it happens to you, remember that
          it isn't madness.
              (beat)
          You should know, I'm in favor of
          destroying Solaris.  I know
          that's... illegal.  And unethical. 
          And irresponsible.  But it's the
          only way to make it stop.

A long moment of silence is broken by a noise on the video,
which draws Gibarian's attention offscreen.

                    GIBARIAN
              (addressing whoever made
               the noise)
          Cut that out.  Do you hear me?

Gibarian switches off the video.

The computer screen freezes the last recorded frame and
overlays a readout indicating the file has ended.

                                                  CUT TO:

INT.  CORRIDOR

Empty.  But there is a door at the end of it, slightly open. 
Kelvin moves toward it.

INT.  ROOM

A FIGURE, seated with its back to the door, turns to see
Kelvin enter.  This is SNOW.  He looks Kelvin up and down,
his expression wary and alert.

                    KELVIN
          Snow.  Didn't you hear me radio? 
          I'm Kelvin.

A long beat.  Snow just watches him.

                    SNOW
          Yes.  We heard.

Kelvin takes a step forward, and Snow recoils.

                    KELVIN
          What's wrong?  What happened to
          Gibarian?

                    SNOW
          He's dead.

                    KELVIN
          How?

A beat.

                    SNOW
          Suicide.

Snow exhales, then looks up as though he's remembered
something.

                    SNOW
          You didn't bring any chocolate, did
          you?

                    KELVIN
          What?

                    SNOW
              (musing)
          I love chocolate.  I realized just
          yesterday how much I love it.
              (beat, then he recovers)
          I thought maybe, if they let you
          bring personal effects, you might
          have snuck some through, because...
          well, I've been thinking about it.

A long beat as Kelvin stares at Snow.

                    KELVIN
          What happened here?

Snow lies back in his bunk.

                    SNOW
          I can't talk just now.  I'm too
          tired.

                    KELVIN
          Where's Sartorius?

                    SNOW
          In his lab.  He won't let you in.

                    KELVIN
              (leaving)
          He'll let me in.

                    SNOW
          Kelvin, if you see anything
          unusual...

Kelvin stops, but doesn't turn around.

                    SNOW
          ... try to stay calm.

                                                  CUT TO:

INT.  CORRIDOR

Kelvin stands outside a door.

                    KELVIN
          Let me in.

A beat.

                    SARTORIUS
              (inside, muffled)
          You have to give me your word you
          won't come in.  Then I'll come out.

                    KELVIN
          All right.

Sartorius cracks the door open and slithers through the slit
and into the hallway.  He is of obvious intelligence and not
to be messed with; contentious, intimidating when he wants to
be, and probably brilliant.  Kelvin eyes him suspiciously.

                    KELVIN
          What happened to Gibarian?

                    SARTORIUS
          Didn't you talk to Snow?

                    KELVIN
          I want to hear your version.

                    SARTORIUS
              (incredulous)
          Who, here, could possibly care what
          you want?  At best, you're Employee
          of the Month for the highest bidder
          in the Solaris auction.  They have
          no idea what's going on up here.
          They've never even been in space.
          And I'm supposed to listen to you?

                    KELVIN
          I am here to recover this mission,
          report my findings, and make a
          recommendation.  Now: What happened
          to him?

                    SARTORIUS
          The same thing that could happen to
          any of us.

                    KELVIN
          Where's his body?

                    SARTORIUS
          In the lab.  With her, probably.

                    KELVIN
          Her?  Who are you talking about?

Sartorius is grabbed by something on the other side of his
door.  He struggles to keep his composure.

                    SARTORIUS
          His last wish was to be buried on
          Earth.  In dirt, he said.  "I want
          to buried in dirt."  What a clown.

Sartorius is losing the battle with whomever or whatever is
on the other side of his door.

                    KELVIN
          They shouldn't let people like you
          into space.

                    SARTORIUS
          Just so you know: I'm not going
          back until I understand what it is. 
          I am going to figure out what it
          is, make it stop, and then I will
          go home.

                    KELVIN
          Listen --

                    SARTORIUS
          We're done.  Oh, I should tell you,
          I don't trust Snow.  There's
          something wrong with him.

Sartorius rotates and zips back into his room.  As the door
closes Kelvin sees a flash of ANOTHER FIGURE in Sartorius'
room.  The glimpse was too quick to judge who or what the
other figure could have been.

                                                  CUT TO:

INT.  CORRIDOR - DAY

Kelvin walks, exploring the ship.  He sees something that
stops him:

A NUDE WOMAN

Black, early 20s, slipping across a corridor up ahead.

Kelvin gives chase.  He sees her turn a corner, but by the
time he gets there, she is gone.

                                                  CUT TO:

INT.  SNOW'S ROOM

Snow is lying on his bunk.

                    KELVIN
          Is there anybody else here?

                    SNOW
              (sits up a little)
          Why, who did you see?

                    KELVIN
          Gibarian warned me.  He left me a
          message.

                    SNOW
          Who was it?

                    KELVIN
          She was real.  Where did she come
          from?

Snow looks at him but doesn't respond.

                    KELVIN
          Tell me.  I won't think you're
          insane.

                    SNOW
          Oh, that's a relief.

Snow lies back down.

                    KELVIN
          Where did she come from?

A beat.

                    SNOW
          How much sleep do you need?

                    KELVIN
          How much sleep?

                    SNOW
          How long can you go without sleep?

                    KELVIN
          That depends.

                    SNOW
          Well, when you do go to sleep:
          barricade your door.

Snow rolls over, away from Kelvin.

                                                  CUT TO:

EXT.  SPACE

Solaris.  Quiet, but still active somehow.

                    KELVIN (V.O.)
          The Prometheus, as far as I can
          tell, is functionally intact.  Crew
          status: One dead, Gibarian.  Cause
          of death appears to be suicide.

                                                  CUT TO:

INT.  KELVIN'S ROOM

Kelvin speaks into a video communication device.  As he does,
we see images of the things and people he describes.

                    KELVIN
          Interviews with the surviving
          members and a perusal of the
          deceased's personal effects
          indicate he was suffering from
          severe depression with psychotic
          features, along with bouts of
          hypomania, dementia, delirium, and
          primary insomnia.  All of these
          symptoms, combined with a profound
          sense of isolation, are commonly
          found in studies of low stimulation
          environments, particularly long
          range space travel.  Snow and
          Sartorius show indications of
          depression, including dysthymic and
          bipolar I; a variety of stress
          disorders, including acute and
          posttraumatic; and suggestions of
          agoraphobia, obsessive/compulsive
          disorder, and hypersomnia.  I
          emphasize these are preliminary
          opinions on my part.  I will
          attempt to convince Snow and
          Sartorius to return to Earth, but
          as they currently view me as an
          intruder of sorts, this may take
          some time.

                                                  CUT TO:

INT.  KELVIN'S ROOM

Later.  Kelvin is lying down.  The lights are out, and he is
trying to sleep.

After a moment, he gets up, checks the lock on his door, and
lies back down.

Then he gets up and moves a chair in front of the door, and
lies back down.

Then he gets up and puts two heavy cases on top of the chair,
and lies back down.

Laughing to himself, he drifts off to sleep.

Silence.

ANOTHER ANGLE

On Kelvin, asleep.

ANOTHER ANGLE

On Kelvin, still asleep.  Then:

EXTREME CLOSE-UP:

A WOMAN'S LIPS, slightly parted.

BACK TO KELVIN

Asleep.  Then:

INT.  TRAIN - DAY

Continued silence, AND:

RHEYA, 30s, staring at us, practically daring us to look
away.  Her obvious intelligence and confidence make her
extremely compelling, along with the fact that it was her
parted lips we were looking at a moment ago.  Her expression
indicates she's in a very raw emotional state.

REVERSE ANGLE

Kelvin is the person she has locked eyes with on the TRAIN.

He is younger here; not just in age, but in spirit.  The
contrast with his older self is striking.

BACK TO KELVIN

Asleep on the ship.  After a beat:

EXTREME CLOSE-UP:

Rheya's LIPS.

Except the circumstance is clearly different: it's darker and
there isn't the side-to-side shimmy of the train car.

A WIDER VIEW

Reveals that Rheya is not sitting on the train -- she is
sitting in Kelvin's room on the Prometheus, right now.

She is staring at Kelvin and she is ethereal in her
stillness.

KELVIN

Awakens, blinks, and slowly recognizes her.

If he is not entirely surprised it is because he has
obviously dreamed of Rheya before.  He looks at her, simply.

RHEYA

Stands and makes her way to Kelvin.

Without hesitation she kisses him and they begin to explore
each other and we see all of it happen and two things are
obvious: first, they have done this before, and two: they
haven't done it in some time.

                                                  CUT TO:

INT.  KELVIN'S ROOM

Kelvin is asleep, Rheya in his arms.

He wakes up and looks at her, perplexed.  After a beat he
rises to sit on the edge of the bed.

A wave of terror is barely suppressed as he puts his hand to
his forehead.  Rheya opens her eyes.

                    KELVIN
          Oh, God.  I'm awake.

                    RHEYA
          Yes.

He looks at her.

                    KELVIN
          Where did you come from?

She moves to him and kisses him as if that's all she wants to
do, forever.

Between kisses.

                    KELVIN
          How are you here?

She stops.

                    RHEYA
          How do you mean?
              (beat)
          Chris, what's wrong?

Hearing his name spoken by her (and those particular words,
perhaps) nearly causes Kelvin to scream.

He stands and moves to the chair.  Rheya watches him.

                    RHEYA
          I love you.

He looks up at her for as long as he can.  Then he looks
down.

                    RHEYA
          Do you love me?

He doesn't look up.

                    KELVIN
          Yes.

A beat.

                    KELVIN
          I need to see Snow.

                    RHEYA
          I'll go with you.

                    KELVIN
              (rising)
          I'll just be a minute.

She bolts out of bed.

                    RHEYA
          Don't.

                    KELVIN
          Why?

                    RHEYA
          I don't know.  I can't be alone.

                    KELVIN
          I'll be right back.

She is trying to accommodate him but her fear of being left
alone is palpable, even excessive.  He sees this and puts his
arms on her shoulders to comfort her.

                    KELVIN
          All right.  All right.  Here.

He hands her a few pills and retrieves a glass of water.

                    RHEYA
          What are they?

                    KELVIN
          To calm your anxiety.

                    RHEYA
          To calm my anxiety.

She takes the pills and smiles.

                                                  CUT TO:

INT.  DOCKING BAY

Kelvin leads Rheya to one of the exploratory pods.  They are
in space suits.

                    RHEYA
          We're taking a flight?

                    KELVIN
          Yes.

He opens the door of a pod and indicates for her to enter. 
She is unsure.

                    KELVIN
          Go ahead.  I'll close the door
          behind me.

She stares up and into the pod.  Kelvin watches her go with
difficulty and then CLOSES THE DOOR behind Rheya.

He walks across the docking bay to the control room and
begins preparations for the pod to be jettisoned.

KELVIN

In agony as he watches a real-time, beat-by-beat brand of
technological murder take place: Rheya's pod is pushed off
into space.

RHEYA

Her face contorted in confusion, watches through the pod
window as the docking bay doors close in front of her with a
brutal finality.

KELVIN

collapses to the ground, shattered.

INSERT:

A woman's HAND, resting on the floor of an apartment.  The
fingers are being licked by a LABRADOR PUPPY.

ANOTHER INSERT:

A pot of coffee, on the boil.  Except that it has been left
unattended for too long...

ANOTHER INSERT:

A rain-streaked window.

                                                  CUT TO:

INT.  KELVIN'S ROOM

Kelvin, on the edge of his bed.  He wants to tear himself
inside out.

A voice calls over the intercom: Snow's.

                    SNOW
          Was her breakfast conversation that
          bad?

                    KELVIN
          Shut up.

                    SNOW
          I told you, try to stay calm. 
          You're supposed to be the
          psychologist of the bunch.

                    KELVIN
          What was it?

Kelvin rises and goes to wash his face.

                    SNOW
          Personally, I think it's God.  At
          least, it fits my definition.

                    KELVIN
          And professionally?

                    SNOW
          I'm not sure.
              (beat)
          It started with Gibarian.  He
          locked himself in his room and
          refused to talk except through a
          crack in the door.  He covered the
          video lens.  Obviously we thought
          he was having a nervous breakdown.
          I don't know why he didn't tell us
          he had somebody in there.  By this
          time, we were getting visitors,
          too.  He was desperately trying to
          figure it out.  Day and night.
              (beat)
          Who was she?

                    KELVIN
          My wife.

                    SNOW
          Dead?

Kelvin nods.

                    SNOW
          She has materialized from your
          memory of her.  What was her name?

                    KELVIN
          Rheya.

                    SNOW
          It started about three months ago. 
          Right after the government sold the
          expedition.  We were ready to go
          home.

                    KELVIN
          Will she come back?

                    SNOW
          Probably.

                    KELVIN
          I wish you'd told me.

                    SNOW
          Told you what?

A beat.

                    SNOW
          What will you say?

                    KELVIN
          To who?

                    SNOW
          What are you going to report back
          to Earth?

                    KELVIN
          I don't know.

                    SNOW
          An enormous amount of money changed
          hands to get control of this
          project.  We are in little danger
          of being left alone for long.

          You'll need to do something. 
          Otherwise they'll be sending

          Gibarian said he thinks Solaris
          should be destroyed.

                    SNOW
          That's ludicrous.  This is contact. 
          We have found God.  The only issue
          is figuring out how to prove this
          in a way that will make sense back
          on Earth.  So how will we describe
          it, if we choose to describe it at
          all?

INT.  CONFERENCE ROOM

Before Kelvin's arrival.

Gibarian is talking to Snow and Sartorius.

                    GIBARIAN
          A pre-biological colloidal
          envelope, possibly exceeding
          terrestrial structures in
          complexity; a plasmic mechanism. 
          Probably without life as we
          conceive it, but capable of
          performing functional activities on
          an astronomic scale.  My view is
          that Solaris has reached, in a
          single bound, the "homeostatic
          ocean" stage without passing
          through stages of terrestrial
          evolution.  I think it bypassed
          cellular development altogether. 
          It hasn't taken endless eons to
          adapt itself to its environment,
          but in fact dominated its
          environment immediately.  From the
          moment it existed, it was the most
          superior element in the Universe.
          And now it passes the time doing
          extravagant theoretical thinking
          about the Universe, with us as the
          cast.

We now show this scene being played out on a video monitor,
watched by Kelvin.

                    GIBARIAN
          It's engaged in a never-ending
          process of transformation; an
          ontological autometamorphosis,
          begging the question: Can thought
          exist separately from
          consciousness?

                    SNOW
          It's God.

                    SARTORIUS
          I don't care what it is, we need to
          figure out how to make it stop.

                    GIBARIAN
          Nelson, we have the opportunity --

                    SARTORIUS
          What if this thing follows us back
          to Earth?  What if what's happening
          here started happening on Earth, on
          a mass scale?  Don't you see that
          as a problem?  I think it's a
          serious mistake to assume it's
          benign.  For all we know it's
          driving us crazy so it can watch us
          kill each other.

Gibarian considers this.

                    SNOW
          We're not even sure it will let us
          leave.

This time, Gibarian alone.  Near the end.

                    GIBARIAN
          Maybe it's stuck.  Maybe its power
          isn't that God-like.  I mean, we
          have God-like power relative to an
          insect, but that doesn't mean we
          can move the Earth around at will.
          Maybe it's like a spider web,
          waiting for something to show up.
              (beat)
          We intercepted some brief fragments
          of what must be an everlasting
          monologue with itself.  Of course
          it was beyond our understanding.
              (beat)
          I've come to hate it here.  There's
          only one way out of its reach, for
          us.  Humans.

Kelvin stares at Gibarian's body, which is lying under a
sheet in the ship's operating room.  Also under the sheet,
next to Gibarian: The Young Girl.

                    GIBARIAN
              (from a video)
          I thought I'd been behaving
          normally, rationally.  But a sign
          of insanity is the inability to
          think about more than one thing. 
          So if I am consumed by the idea
          that I am insane and can't think of
          anything else, then I am insane.
              (beat, smiles)
          You ask questions at the end of
          your life, the sort of questions
          people who are content don't ask.
              (beat)
          Maybe life just can't be solved.

RHEYA leans into frame and kisses him.

Without even waking, he kisses her back, hungrily.

          Rheya...

                    RHEYA
          I want you inside me right now.

They make love.  It's even better than before.

INT.  TRAIN - DAY

Kelvin, staring intently.  What he is staring at is Rheya,
who is seated across from him.  She doesn't see him, yet. 
When she does, she locks eyes with his and doesn't look away.

This continues until she gets off the train.  Kelvin watches
her go, and she looks back at him through the window as the
train pulls away.

INT.  PARTY - NIGHT

Rheya enters, looks around.  She spots Kelvin, who has
already spotted her.  Their expressions indicate they are
pleased to see each other again.  He approaches her, and they
stare at each other a long time, until:

                    KELVIN
          "And Death Shall Have No Dominion".

                    RHEYA
          Book?

                    KELVIN
          Poem.  Dylan Thomas.  I thought of
          it when I saw you on the train.

                    RHEYA
          My Thomas is a little rusty.

He leans over and whispers into her ear.  She listens, and
when he finishes, she leans back and looks at him, intrigued. 
Genuinely intrigued.  He smiles.

                    RHEYA
          Not a very happy poem.

                    KELVIN
          You didn't look very happy.

                    RHEYA
          I wasn't.

                    KELVIN
          And tonight?

                    RHEYA
          Better.

He nods, and they smile.  They seem to be rooting for each
other.  After an extended pleasurable moment, Rheya leans
over and whispers in his ear.  He listens, then leans back
and looks at her.

                    KELVIN
          That's good to know.

Another night.

Rheya is wound up.  Not drunk, something else.  She has an
odd look in her eyes.

We are at a dinner party, and there are people trying -- but
failing -- not to watch.

                    RHEYA
          You want to fuck her?

                    KELVIN
          Stop it.

                    RHEYA
          You behave as though you want to
          fuck her.

                    KELVIN
          Rheya.  Not here.

                    RHEYA
          And I just want to know if I'm
          crazy or not -- if what I think is
          happening is actually happening. 
          Or am I one of those people, those
          women, who are blind to what's
          going on?  Who pretend not to see
          their husband's attention toward
          another woman?

          Let's go home.

                    RHEYA
          You go home.

                    KELVIN
          I am.  Please come with me.  I
          don't want to do this here.

He is unmoved, but she labors to change his mind.

          You're better when you take them.

                    RHEYA
          I know, I know.  But still, somehow
          I don't feel better.

          All right.  How about I feel better
          when you take them?

          Right.

They look at each other and understand; she will take the

Rheya is taking her pills.  Kelvin watches.

                    KELVIN

          What do you mean?

                    KELVIN
          Do you remember Beethoven?  The
          Beatles?  Movies, books,
          restaurants, friends?

                    RHEYA
              (thinking)
          Yes.  But not until you mentioned
          them.  As soon as you said those
          things, I remembered them.  And
          they have associations that make me
          think of other things I remember. 
          It's like filling up.

She looks out the portal at Solaris.

                    RHEYA
          Is it a planet?

                    KELVIN
          Not exactly.  It exists in a
          continuum that wasn't proven until
          ten years ago, a higher
          mathematical dimension superimposed
          on top of the Universe.  An
          infinite number of them, in fact. 
          It was a violation of all of our
          various laws regarding the
          Universe, Space, or Space-Time.  It
          was completely counter-intuitive. 
          We had to unlearn everything.

                    RHEYA
          Is it intelligent?

                    KELVIN
          Intelligent beyond our
          comprehension.

                    RHEYA
          Then it's God, right?

                    KELVIN
          It's something.

                    RHEYA
          You still don't believe in God?

                    KELVIN
          The whole idea of God was dreamed
          up by a silly animal with a small
          brain called Man.  Even the limits
          we put on it are human limits.  It
          can do this, it can do that!  It
          designs, it creates!

                    RHEYA
          Even a God that wasn't active, that
          just created something and stood
          back and watched?

                    KELVIN
          You're talking about a man in a
          white beard again.  You're
          ascribing human characteristics to
          something that isn't human.  Human
          beings look for causes and
          patterns.  How could we know what
          Solaris is up to, if anything?

A beat.

                    RHEYA
          But what if Solaris is what there
          was before The Big Bang?

                    KELVIN
          As I said, it is beyond our
          comprehension.

                    RHEYA
          As I said, then it's God, right?

She looks at him and can't keep from smiling, eventually.

                    RHEYA
          Why are we talking about this shit
          when we could be fucking?

Kelvin smiles.

The intercom comes to life.

Kelvin is getting ready to leave.  Rheya sits on the edge of
the bed, nervous.

                    KELVIN
          All right?

She nods and Kelvin exits, locking the door behind him.

We sit with her for a moment as she tries to remain calm.

IN THE CORRIDOR

Kelvin listens.  A long time.

Satisfied, he begins to walk away but is stopped by the
sounding of a CRASHING GLASS from within.  He hears footsteps
approach the door, and then a fierce POUNDING.

He takes a step back.  An INHUMAN AMOUNT OF NOISE begins
emanating from the other side of the door, which is now
threatening to break apart.  It sounds like a plane is
crashing in Kelvin's room -- no human could create this kind
of cacophony.

Finally, he steps forward and presses the button to open the
door.

RHEYA

Is revealed, covered in blood.  She has completely torn the
inside of the cabin door apart and has badly injured herself
in the process.

                    KELVIN
          Rheya...

Confused, she looks up at him as he takes her in his arms and
carries her to the bed.

                    RHEYA
          What happened?

                    KELVIN
          You were trying to break down the
          door.  Do you know why?

                    RHEYA
          When I saw you were gone I got
          scared.

He puts her down on the bed and runs to the bathroom, where
he gathers all the first aid materials he can find.

Returning, he blanches.

Rheya's wounds have HEALED; in fact, they are HEALING in
front of us.

She looks up at him and doesn't like the look on his face.

                    RHEYA
          Chris, what's wrong with me?

Snow and Sartorius wait for Kelvin.

                    SNOW
          He won't do it.

          Why do you say that?

                    SNOW
          He won't.

Kelvin enters, with Rheya.  Snow and Sartorius exchange
glances.

                    KELVIN
          This is my wife, Rheya.

She looks at Snow and nods.  Sartorius she hates instantly,
and the feeling seems to be mutual.

                    SARTORIUS
          We thought you'd be alone.  We want
          to talk about...

                    SNOW
          We want to talk freely.

                    KELVIN
          Go ahead.

Sartorius begins.

                    SARTORIUS
          I suggest we pool our knowledge
          regarding the... visitors.  We can
          express whatever questions or
          conclusions we might have... share
          information about our various...
          experiments.  Agreed?

Kelvin and Snow nod.

                    SARTORIUS
          I would like to start with
          motivation.  Why are they here?

Sartorius looks at Rheya.  She looks away.

                    SARTORIUS
          They are not autonomous individuals
          and they're not actual persons. 
          They are projections materializing
          from our minds, based on a given
          individual.

                    SNOW
          It's an experiment.

                    KELVIN
          No.  There's no behavior
          modification.

                    SARTORIUS
          She reappeared exactly as she had
          before?

Kelvin looks at Rheya and nods.  She is struck by the word
"before".

                    SNOW
          The same vulnerabilities?

He nods again.

                    SARTORIUS
          A recoil, with no compensating
          mechanism.

                    SNOW
          And when a given situation no
          longer corresponds to the normal
          faculties of the... original, the
          visitor suffers some sort of
          disconnected consciousness.

          Followed by non-human
          manifestations.

                    SNOW
          Are the actions of Solaris
          premeditated?

                    KELVIN
          Is it being deliberately cruel, you
          mean?  I don't think so.

                    SNOW
          I'm just trying to find an
          explanation for the continual
          reappearances.

                    KELVIN
              (to Rheya)
          When you cut yourself pounding the
          door, did it hurt?

                    RHEYA
          Yes.
              (looks around)
          Of course.

                    SARTORIUS
          If they're not learning anything
          and they're not modifying their
          behavior, why do they come back?

                    SNOW
          It's like they're plugged into a
          game, which goes around and around,
          endlessly repeating itself.

INT.  APARTMENT - NIGHT

This is ten years ago.  Rheya enters, alone.

She crosses to the kitchen and makes a drink.  Almost
immediately, the labrador puppy enters from the bedroom and
stands beside her, tail wagging.  She ignores it and
continues mixing her drink.

Halfway through this activity, the bedroom light comes on.  A
moment later, Kelvin is in the doorway.  Eventually, but not
angrily, because he's still not really awake:

                    KELVIN
          Where've you been?

                    RHEYA
          I been thinking about how much I
          hate you.

She finishes making her drink, drinks it, and walks out the
door.

Kelvin stands in the doorway for a beat, then pivots and
returns to bed.  The light goes out.

                    RHEYA (V.O.)
          Yes, I remember that.  I went back
          to Lois' house and spent the night. 
          Those were dark days.

                                                  CUT TO:

INT.  PARTY - NIGHT

Kelvin and Rheya, later in the evening when they spoke for
the first time.  They are absolutely infatuated with each
other; they know something is happening between them, will
happen between them.

                    RHEYA
          I would have these -- I don't know
          how to describe them -- visions,
          when I was younger.  Maybe not
          visions, but like these waking
          dream states.  Time would just
          collapse, I would be inside time. 
          I would stare at a second hand on a
          clock until it stopped.  Freaky
          stuff.

                    KELVIN
          How old were you?

                    RHEYA
          Seven, eight.  So one day my mother
          catches me sort of staring off into
          space, and she asks me what I'm
          doing, and I start trying to
          explain to her, about this state
          that I can put myself in, and this
          look comes over her face.

                    KELVIN
          What kind of look?

INT.  KELVIN'S ROOM

Kelvin and Rheya sit together in the Prometheus.  Rheya
continues her story without a beat.

                    RHEYA
          Scared.  No, not scared.  Wary. 
          Like I was something to be... her
          guard went up.  I was a threat. 
          Now I know why.  She was afraid
          she'd be seen.  That I would see
          her for the self-obsessed neurotic
          that she was.  I think she thought
          she had a few more years of being
          on a pedestal.  But that's the
          cycle, right?  I knew a little more
          than she did, she knew a little
          more than her mother, and on and
          on.
              (beat)
          I guess that's part of the reason
          why --

                    KELVIN
          I know.  I know.  We don't have to
          talk about that.

Another beat.

                    RHEYA
          I remember days of just thinking
          about you.

INT.  OFFICES - DAY

Intercut Kelvin and Rheya at their respective jobs, going
through a normal day.  There is no sound.  As we see these
images, it's clear that Kelvin and Rheya are slightly not
present in their respective encounters with other people;
they are distracted by the idea of each other.

And they like it.

                    RHEYA
          Thinking what you were doing and
          saying, just being consumed by
          thinking of you.  I loved it so
          much, that feeling.

                    KELVIN
          I did too.

INT.  APARTMENT - NIGHT

Rheya on the edge of the bed, facing away.

                    KELVIN
          I used to watch you undress.

As she does:

                    KELVIN
          I never tired of watching you
          undress.  Every time, it was
          exciting.  Right until... to the
          end.

A beat.  Then a shot of Kelvin that we've seen before: Him
leaving their apartment, angry.

ON THE PROMETHEUS

A beat.

                    RHEYA
          What happened to us, exactly?

                    KELVIN
          You don't know?

Rheya shakes her head.

Kelvin just watches her.

                    RHEYA
          I remember... something burning. 
          Coffee burning.

INT.  APARTMENT - DAY

The rain-streaked window.

An automated coffee maker has been left on, and the
solidified coffee at the bottom of the pot is smoking.

Rheya's body is on the floor of the kitchen.

RHEYA (ON PROMETHEUS)

She is looking at Kelvin.  He is dreading this.

                    RHEYA
          You found me?

He nods.  It's coming back to her.

INT.  APARTMENT - DAY

Kelvin is yelling at Rheya.  We don't hear what he's saying,
but judging from her reaction, it's not pleasant.  She is
crying.

RHEYA (ON PROMETHEUS)

Experiencing this all over again.  Kelvin comes and sits in
front of her.

INT.  APARTMENT - DAY

Kelvin, still yelling, is packing some things into a
suitcase.  Rheya, between sobs, pleads with him.

RHEYA (ON PROMETHEUS)

Her eyes fill with tears.  Kelvin embraces her.

                    KELVIN
          I'm sorry.  I'm sorry.

Rheya is devastated, inconsolable.

                    RHEYA
          Why did you say those things?

                    KELVIN
          I don't know.  I couldn't
          understand why you didn't tell me.

INT.  APARTMENT - DAY

Rheya lies on the kitchen floor, dead.  There is a NOTE in
her hand.

Kelvin kneels next to her.

KELVIN (ON PROMETHEUS)

With Rheya still in his arms.

                    KELVIN
          When you said you wouldn't make
          it... I didn't believe you.  Or I
          didn't take you seriously, which is
          worse.

INT.  APARTMENT - DAY

Kelvin holds the dead Rheya.

KELVIN (ON PROMETHEUS)

Squeezing her.

                    KELVIN
          I should have believed you.

                                                  CUT TO:

INT.  KELVIN'S ROOM

Kelvin lies in bed, his eyes open.  Rheya is in his arms.

                                                  CUT TO:

INT.  APARTMENT - DAY

Rheya, talking to Chris.  Obviously during a period when they
were getting along.  Or at least: not fighting.

                    RHEYA
          I can't help feeling that I'm
          cheating when I take them.

                    KELVIN
          It's genetics.  You know this.  You
          know where it comes from.  There is
          nothing wrong with uncrossing a few
          crossed wires.

She knows, intellectually, that he is right.  But it doesn't
matter.

                                                  CUT TO:

INT.  KELVIN'S ROOM

Kelvin is out of bed and speaking into a videophone to Snow. 
Rheya is asleep in the background.  The room is dark except
for the glow of the screen.

                    SNOW
          You're unnerved because you've
          spent your whole life thinking
          nobody is looking over you, and
          suddenly your subconscious is an
          open book.  We are, for the first
          time, experiencing changes in
          natural reality by a force not our
          own.  That proves that --

                    KELVIN
          -- we are not sure of that.  We are
          not sure we aren't all
          hallucinating.

                    SNOW
          If God is beyond our comprehension,
          and she --
              (meaning Rheya)
          -- is here for reasons that can't
          be understood, isn't God here?

                    KELVIN
          Not necessarily.

                    SNOW
          Stop equivocating!  Unbelievable,
          how you equivocate!  You, the
          atheist, you're more dogmatic than
          any holy person I've ever seen! 
          This is happening, Kevin.  Wake up.

                    KELVIN
          Consciousness is enough, that's all
          I've saying.  Consciousness should
          be enough for anybody.

                    SNOW
          Who are you trying to convince?

Kelvin just looks back at Rheya.

                    SNOW
          It will end badly.  As inevitably
          as the rising of a bubble.

Kelvin doesn't respond.

                    SNOW
          Let's all meet tomorrow.  Sartorius
          has some new ideas, about making it
          stop.

Kelvin just keeps staring at Rheya, asleep.

                                                  CUT TO:

INT.  KELVIN'S ROOM

Kelvin is eating with Rheya.  Looking at her.  Desiring her.

                    RHEYA
          Do you have any idea how much I
          like fucking you?

                    KELVIN
          I think so.

                    RHEYA
          Good.  Because I want you to know. 
          I really like fucking you.

He leans over and whispers in her ear.  She smiles and leans
back.

                    RHEYA
          I like that too.

                    KELVIN (V.O.)
          How could she not be real?  I can
          smell her, taste her.  She does
          exactly what she did... it's not
          possible.

                    RHEYA
              (smiles, teasing)
          You know, I've decided: I'm just
          gonna believe what you believe
          about this whole Solaris thing,
          it'll make life so much easier; the
          little wife agreeing with her big,
          strong husband.  You must get such
          a headache thinking about those
          Great Big Problems all day.

He just stares at her -- he really likes this.  It's
familiar, this type of teasing, and it reminds him of when
things were good.

                    KELVIN (V.O.)
          Like I said, it's not possible.

A beat.

                    RHEYA
          So, Chris, seriously, aren't you
          afraid you're going to get fired?

They laugh.

                                                  CUT TO:

INT.  KELVIN'S ROOM

Kelvin and Rheya, post-coital.  Relaxed.  On the verge of
sleep.

                    RHEYA
          You sure say "God" a lot when we're
          doing it.

                    KELVIN
          I know.  I'm putting that in my
          next report.

She smiles.

                    RHEYA
          Right.  The report.  Report and
          recommend.

They consider that.

                    RHEYA
          What does Snow think you should do?

                    KELVIN
          Snow thinks we shouldn't leave
          until we figure out a way to
          document it, to prove its existence
          to the planet Earth.  This is
          hilarious: He thinks it's God, but
          he wants it to sit still for a
          photograph so he can show the folks
          back home.

They smile at this.  Rheya's smile fades before Kelvin's.

                    RHEYA
          Sartorius wants to destroy it.

                    KELVIN
          Well.  He doesn't think it's God,
          but for different reasons than me. 
          He's thinking: If I can figure out
          how to make it stop, than I am
          smarter than it is, and therefore
          it cannot be God.

                    RHEYA
          He has a point.

                    KELVIN
          He does have a point.  That's just
          not the way I'd like to see it
          proven.

                    RHEYA
          You feel sorry for Solaris, or for
          me?

                    KELVIN
          It's a violent response to
          something we haven't figured out. 
          Don't let the cowardly demeanor
          fool you: He is ruthless. 
          Unblinking in his prejudice.

                    RHEYA
          It was obvious from the way he
          first looked at me.

A beat.  He holds her.

                    RHEYA
          Do I really feel like... I am...?

                    KELVIN
          Yes.  Yes.

                    RHEYA
          I'm glad.

A beat.

INT.  APARTMENT - NIGHT

Then years ago.  Kelvin, naked, sitting in a chair, in the
dark.  Rheya, also naked, is smoking a cigarette in bed.

                    KELVIN
          Everything you pursue, you end up
          becoming disinterested in.  The
          fact that you're good at everything
          you try makes it worse.  You have a
          degree in animal science, you could
          be a terrific vet. 
          You drifted into writing and turned
          out to be a perceptive journalist. 
          Then it was politics, which seemed
          best of all, you had an actual gift
          for understanding the best pattern
          for a group of people to be
          arranged for you to achieve your
          goal.  And they didn't even know
          they were being arranged.  But you
          got bored with it, like you do with
          everything.

She just smokes, not really looking at him.  Maybe it's a
common observation and she's past being defensive about it.

                    KELVIN
          I don't know what it's really like,
          to not know what you want to do. 
          To not have anything that you love
          to do more than anything else.

A beat.  He looks at her.  She seems more interested in her
cigarette at the moment.

                    RHEYA
              (sarcastic)
          Imagine my frustration.

                                                  CUT TO:

INT.  KELVIN'S ROOM

On the Prometheus.  Rheya is awake, Kelvin asleep.

She rises and goes to sit in a chair; she is anxious,
something we haven't seen before.

Kelvin wakes up, looks at her.  Noting her expression:

                    KELVIN
          What's wrong.

                    RHEYA
          You don't love me.

                    KELVIN
          Stop.

A beat.  She looks down.

                    RHEYA
          I have to talk to you... I... I
          don't know where I came from.
              (up at him)
          Do you know?

He doesn't respond.

                    RHEYA
          If you know but can't tell me
          now... will you ever be able to?

Calmly:

                    KELVIN
          What are you talking about?

                    RHEYA
          That I am not Rheya.  That Rheya
          died.  Killed herself.  I'm
          different.

He's looking at her, and knows this is dangerous territory.

                    KELVIN
          Who have you been talking to?

                    RHEYA
              (no reason to lie)
          Sartorius.

                    KELVIN
          When?  When I'm asleep?

She nods.  He can only imagine what form Sartorius' anecdotes
must have taken.

                    KELVIN
          I'm sure there are worse people to
          talk to, but I don't know who they
          are.

                    RHEYA
          I'm just trying to understand
          what's going on.

A beat.

                    RHEYA
          How have you lived the last ten
          years?  Did you love anyone?

A long beat.  Kelvin shakes his head.

                    RHEYA
          Did you think about me?

Another beat.  He nods.  Then:

                    RHEYA
          But we fought.

                    KELVIN
          Yes.  Especially toward the end.

                    RHEYA
          Why did she do it?

                    KELVIN
          You... she said I didn't love her.

                    RHEYA
          Was she right?

                    KELVIN
          No.  I love you.

                    RHEYA
              (reflexive, but genuine)
          I love you, too.

If she seems satisfied for the moment, Kelvin knows the
feeling won't last.

                    KELVIN
          Can you sleep?

                    RHEYA
          I don't think do.  It's not sleep;
          it's something else.  It's all
          around me.

                    KELVIN
          Those are dreams.

She falls asleep.

                                                FADE OUT.

FADE IN:

INT.  CONFERENCE ROOM

Kelvin, Rheya, Sartorius, and Snow.  They are in the middle
of a heated discussion.

                    SNOW
          Gibarian was under enormous --

                    SARTORIUS
          Gibarian was helpless.  It's very
          simple: Man created the science
          that resulted in the discovery of
          Solaris, and the ship that brought
          us here.

                    KELVIN
          Meaning Man can do whatever the
          fuck it wants?

                    SARTORIUS
          Yes.

                    KELVIN
          That's fantastic.

                    SARTORIUS
          Why did you agree to come here?

A beat.

                    SARTORIUS
          Too tired to answer?

Looks at Rheya, then back to Kelvin.

                    SARTORIUS
          I'll bet.  Is this what they sent
          you here to do?  You've lost it,
          you've gone native.

Kelvin moves toward him.  Sartorius just lets him come.

                    RHEYA
              (to Sartorius)
          You're the coward.

                    KELVIN
          Don't debate him; he'll say
          anything.

                    RHEYA
              (still, to Sartorius)
          I'm just as human as you.  I see, I
          hear, I touch, and I feel just like
          you do.

                    SARTORIUS
          Prove it.

                    RHEYA
          These "guests" are a part of you,
          of your subconscious.  Chris loves
          me.

                    SARTORIUS
          YOU ARE NOT HUMAN!  Try to
          understand that if you can
          understand anything!

Kelvin is within an inch of his face.

                    KELVIN
          Get out of here.

Slowly, carefully, Sartorius grasps Kelvin by the shoulders. 
Then he leans in and whispers in Kelvin's ear:

                    SARTORIUS
          Rheya is dead.  She's a copy.  A
          facsimile.  And she's seducing you
          all over again.  You're sick.  You
          think of fucking her as research
          for humanity.  It's just fucking.

Kelvin backs away.

                    SARTORIUS
          There's nothing grandiose about it. 
          You've jumped out of a plane and
          you're trying to sew a parachute
          together while you fall.

Sartorius turns...

                    SARTORIUS
          It'd be hilarious if it weren't so
          damn sad.

And leaves.

A beat.

                    SNOW
          We didn't even get to hear his new
          ideas.

Snow wanders toward the door.

                    SNOW
          I'm not feeling well.

He passes Kelvin and leaves.

Kelvin watches him, then looks at Rheya.  She seems dazed.

                                                  CUT TO:

EXT.  SOLARIS

The fog-shrouded surface, shifting and turning like an ocean.

                                                  CUT TO:

INT.  KELVIN'S ROOM

Rheya is asleep.  Kelvin is talking to Snow on the
videophone.

                    SNOW
          We can liquidate the station.  Take
          the Athena back.

                    KELVIN
          No.

                    SNOW
          Of course, when we return, we'll be
          regarded as lunatics if we tell the
          truth.
              (shrugs)
          We'll chalk it up to isolation,
          collective derangement.

                    KELVIN
          I've never heard you express any
          desire to leave before now.  Why
          now?

                    SNOW
          Well, I think we're reaching the
          point of diminishing returns here,
          right?  Certainly it's learning
          more about us than we'll ever learn
          about it.

                    KELVIN
          But why is it doing what it's
          doing?  Given it's resources, it
          could have done anything. 
          Presented me with your double, and
          you with mine.

                    SNOW
          Perhaps it did.

                    KELVIN
          Human beings can die.

                    SNOW
          But they are human.  They certainly
          become human with incredible speed. 
          First they're like they were in our
          memory, but then they fill in on
          their own.  DNA doesn't determine
          the hundreds of trillions of
          connections that occur in the
          brain, it's not dense enough.  They
          build up with experience.

INT.  KELVIN'S ROOM - EARLIER

Quick glimpses of Rheya.  In several of them she is in
repose, thinking, as if to illustrate Snow's point.

INT.  KELVIN'S ROOM

Back to Kelvin, thinking.

                    KELVIN
          They come when you sleep.

                    SNOW
          That's right.  And we all have to
          sleep, eventually.

                                                  CUT TO:

INT.  KELVIN'S ROOM

Kelvin on the bed with Rheya.  Their eyes are closed.

We think they are asleep until:

                    RHEYA
          You don't want me.

                    KELVIN
          Rheya.

                    RHEYA
          That's what you were saying.  I
          heard what you were saying.

                    KELVIN
          For a reason that neither of us
          understand, you are forced to stay
          near me.  That's all I know right
          now.

She realizes she doesn't want to argue.  Not right now,
anyway.

                    RHEYA
          I have these strange thoughts, I
          don't know where they come from.
              (beat)
          I can't explain it.

                    KELVIN
          Neither can I.  Not any of it. 
          There's no reference point for
          what's going on; it's never
          happened before.  It's a clean
          break in the fabric of the
          Universe; a gap.  There is nothing
          to do but experience it, moment-to-
          moment, and not let it destroy us.

                    RHEYA
          But that's what happened before.

                    KELVIN
          Not this time.

He kisses her.  She wants to believe him, so she says
nothing.  Then:

                    RHEYA
          Do you want to stay here?

                    KELVIN
          Do you?

                    RHEYA
          If you're here.

They kiss again...

                                             DISSOLVE TO:

INT.  KELVIN'S ROOM

Kelvin is asleep.  Rheya is next to him.

Offscreen, we hear the door open.

Someone walks quietly (though not surreptitiously) through
the frame and sits.

After a long beat, Kelvin bolts upright, his mind struggling
to clear.  When it does:

                    KELVIN
          Gibarian.

                    GIBARIAN
          Leave the light off.

A beat.  Kelvin tries to get his bearings.

                    GIBARIAN
          I wish you'd come a little sooner. 
          I might not have had to kill
          myself.

He smiles, looking at Kelvin.

                    GIBARIAN
          You think you're dreaming me, like
          you dream her.  Understand
          something: I am the real Gibarian. 
          Just a new incarnation.

                    KELVIN
          What do you want?

                    GIBARIAN
          You're being tricked.  Sartorius
          picked a fight with you to avoid
          telling you about his idea for
          getting rid of the visitors.  He's
          figured out they're made of
          subatomic particles called
          neutrinos, and he's going to create
          a negative neutrino field.  Twenty
          four hours a day, until they're
          back on Earth.

                    KELVIN
          Can it work?

                    GIBARIAN
          It can.  Ordinary matter, like
          ours?  Not affected.  Everything
          else, disintegrates.

Kelvin registers this.

                    GIBARIAN
          What I'm saying is: Don't trust
          anyone.  Find yourself a weapon of
          some sort.

                    KELVIN
          I can trust Rheya.

                    GIBARIAN
          You'll end up like me.

                    KELVIN
          You're not Gibarian...

                    GIBARIAN
          No?  Who am I, then?

                    KELVIN
          A puppet.

                    GIBARIAN
          And you're not?  Maybe you're my
          puppet.  But like all puppets, you
          think you're actually human.  It's
          The Puppet's Dream.  Wondering if
          they're human!

Gibarian smiles.

KELVIN

wakes up, gulping air.  Rheya, startled:

                    RHEYA
          What's wrong?

                    KELVIN
          Gibarian.  He was here.

                    RHEYA
          You said he was dead.

                    KELVIN
          He is.  But he was here...

He moves to the chair, looking for some residue of Gibarian,
some proof.  Finding none:

                    KELVIN
          He spoke to me.

Kelvin leaves the room.  After a few beats, Rheya follows.

INT.  LAB

Rheya lingers behind Kelvin, who is looking at Gibarian's
body.

It is there, alone on its slab; even the Young Girl is not
with him.  

                                                  CUT TO:

INT.  KELVIN'S ROOM

Kelvin, thinking.  He gives Rheya some pills to take.  She
just looks at them.

                    KELVIN
          Are you going to take them?

She nods and takes them.

                    RHEYA
          What's happening to us?

                    KELVIN
          It's all right.

                    RHEYA
          Please don't lie.  I told you
          before, I don't know how I came to
          be here.  Whatever you think you
          can't say to me, I need to hear you
          say it.

                    KELVIN
          I love you.

                    RHEYA
          Don't.  I'm the one at risk here. 
          If we're playing out what happened
          before, I won't survive.

He goes to her.

                    KELVIN
          That won't happen again.  We're
          different.

                    RHEYA
          How can I tell?  You've seen both
          of me.  I only know what you're
          like here.  You're all I know. 
          There is no "You" from before.

She sits, frustrated.  Sad.

                    RHEYA
          How could it be so cruel?  How
          could it torture us like this?

                    KELVIN
          I don't think it knows it's
          torturing us.  It's just watching.

                                                  CUT TO:

INT.  KELVIN'S ROOM

Kelvin and Rheya, in bed.  She looks despondent.

                                                  CUT TO:

INT.  KELVIN'S ROOM

Kelvin is asleep.  Alone.

After a long period of silence, we hear the faint sound of an
instrument of some sort hitting the ground.  After another
beat, Kelvin awakens.  He notices that he is alone, and
something tells him that's not a good sign.

                                                  CUT TO:

INT.  LAB

Rheya is on the ground, convulsing.  Beside her is a SMALL
STEEL DRUM, which is spilling a strange-looking LIQUID that
solidifies and vaporizes with a smoky hiss.

Kelvin moves to Rheya and is startled to see that half of her
face and throat are burned away -- not melted as in a fire,
but merely eaten cleanly away.  He picks her up.

INT.  CORRIDOR

Kelvin is carrying Rheya.  Snow sticks his head out of a
passing room.

                    SNOW
          What happened?

                    KELVIN
          She drank liquid oxygen.

INT.  KELVIN'S ROOM

Kelvin puts Rheya on the bed.  Her face and throat have
returned to normal, but she is not breathing.  Kelvin goes
and puts his head to her chest, but doesn't hear what he
hoped to hear.  He stands, still looking at her.  Snow seems
very detached.

An uncomfortably long moment as we realize she is actually
not going to wake up.

                    KELVIN
          She's dead.

Snow says nothing.

Then:

Her finger twitches.

Barely noticeable at first, but growing in intensity.  Kelvin
sees it, and goes to her.  She is starting to shake a little,
as though cold.

                    SNOW
          She'll come back, don't worry.  But
          then what?  My theory is she can
          only live here, that she will die
          if she leaves this ship.

Kelvin is still looking at Rheya, who is shaking a little
harder; it's feeling like a seizure now.

                    SNOW
          Why do you think she hasn't
          suggested that?  It's the most
          obvious solution: Escape.  She
          knows she can't leave here --

                    KELVIN
          Get out --

                    SNOW
          Oh, this one you love?  What about
          the first one, the one you fucked
          and then put into a rocket and
          blasted into space?  You didn't
          love her?

Rheya is shaking much harder now, Kelvin tries to hold her
still, but she's too strong.  He stands, reluctantly, and
watches her.

                    SNOW
          What happens if she comes back?  Is
          that polygamy?  And even if you
          could take her home, how would you
          get her through?  You think they're
          not going to notice her?

Rheya is shaking violently now, as if a rippling rhythmic
force were coursing through her.  Snow, as he looks
dispassionately on the two of them:

                    SNOW
          I never get used to them, these...
          "Resurrections".

He leaves.

Rheya continues her process of "waking up" -- it's violent,
even sexual.  She spasms to a peak of some sort, and then
slowly returns to normal.

Kelvin puts his hand on her forehead.

She gradually begins to open her eyes.  She looks at Kelvin.

It takes her a moment to realize she shouldn't be seeing him;
she shouldn't be seeing anything.  She should be dead.

She begins to cry.

                    RHEYA
          What am I?  Why can't I die?

She turns away.

                    RHEYA
          I'm not Rheya.  You're always known
          that.

                    KELVIN
          Rheya --

                    RHEYA
          Don't call me that.

He turns her over.

                    KELVIN
          Listen: I don't care about anything
          but the fact that you are here. 
          You are her, you are Rheya.

                    RHEYA
          I'm disgusting.

                    KELVIN
          No.

                    RHEYA
          You're lying.  I'm not human.

                    KELVIN
          Rheya, I am not going back.  I'm
          staying here with you.

                    RHEYA
          Then you'll die.

                    KELVIN
          I want every second I can get with
          you.

A beat.

                    RHEYA
          What will I do, if you die?

He doesn't know.

Kelvin and Rheya, in bed.

                    RHEYA
          Do you think I can get pregnant
          here?

A long beat.

                    KELVIN
          We'll know soon enough.

INSERT:

The first time Kelvin and Rheya spoke, at the party ten years
ago.  Again we see her whisper in Kelvin's ear, but this time
we hear what she is saying:

                    RHEYA
          I can't be a mother.

She pulls back.

                    KELVIN
          That's good to know.

Kelvin, as he packs to leave Rheya.

                    RHEYA
          Don't do this.  I am literally
          begging you not to do this.  Chris.

                    KELVIN
          You should have told me.

                    RHEYA
          It wouldn't have made any
          difference.

                    KELVIN
          Thank you.

                    RHEYA
          Chris, I had to.  I had to.  I
          didn't think you'd react like this.

                    KELVIN
          Neither did I.

                    RHEYA
          You never said you wanted one.

                    KELVIN
          I never said I didn't.

                    RHEYA
          Chris --

                    KELVIN
          I can't stay here.

                    RHEYA
          Chris, please.  Chris, I'm serious. 
          I won't make it.

                    KELVIN
          Then you won't make it.

He leaves, brushing past her.

A long, held shot of Rheya, crying.  She is curled up,
retreating into herself.  Kelvin is trying to console her.

                    KELVIN
          I came back.  You have to know
          that.  I came back that night.

Kelvin and Rheya.  She is sobbing, but somewhat calmer.

          I couldn't make it, either.
              (beat)
          I'm so sorry.

As we saw him before, sitting in the chair.  But we didn't
hear him say this before:

          If they succeed, you'll never see
          her again.

In the immediate aftermath of her suicide attempt with the
liquid oxygen:

                    RHEYA
          You're afraid of me.  I can't do
          this anymore.  I still don't
          understand.  It's not possible.

He tries to console her, but she recoils.

                    RHEYA
          Don't --

INT.  APARTMENT - DAY

Rheya, as Kelvin brushes past her on his way out.  She looks
desperate.

INT.  KELVIN'S ROOM

Rheya and Kelvin.

                    RHEYA
          What do I have to do to stop it?

                    KELVIN
          I want you here.

                    RHEYA
          You're lying.

                    KELVIN
          You exist here.  I keep telling
          you.

                    RHEYA
          That's impossible.  I'm not Rheya.

                    KELVIN
          Who are you, then?

                    RHEYA
          I... I am Rheya.  But I am not the
          woman you loved ten years ago.

                    KELVIN
          Yes, you are --

                    RHEYA
          Did you hear what Gibarian said? 
          I'm not a human being.  I'm an
          instrument.  I came from your
          memory and your imagination and I
          will torture you no matter what.
          Even if I remain passive.  That's
          when I drank the...
              (beat)
          I was going mad.  It felt like
          there was no body underneath my
          skin.  There was something else. 
          An illusion.  But I could feel my
          heart beating, and I remembered you
          tested my blood.  Is it like yours?

                    KELVIN
          Yes.  I told you.  It was exactly
          like mine.

                    RHEYA
          But then I would be dead now.

A beat.

                    KELVIN
          Is that really what you want?

                    RHEYA
          I want to stop taking those pills.

                    KELVIN
          I wish you wouldn't.

                    RHEYA
          They do something to me.  It's hard
          to think straight.

                    KELVIN
          I think they help.

                    RHEYA
          I have consciousness, but I am not
          mortal.  Don't you see why I'm
          going crazy?

                    KELVIN
          You have to remember that I love
          you, that's all that matters --

                    RHEYA
          I can't --

                    KELVIN
          It put you here.  I'll admit it, it
          acted like a God and put you here,
          put you into my consciousness. 
          I was asleep, and it put you into
          my dream.  I saw your mouth.  And
          there you were.
              (beat)
          Whether you've been sent here to
          make me happy or punish me, it
          doesn't matter.  The decision we
          make now is all that matters.  Stay
          with me.

                    RHEYA
          Am I really her?

                    KELVIN
          I don't know anymore.  All I see is
          you.

They kiss.

                    KELVIN
          Stay with me.
              (beat)
          Stay with me.

Kelvin is on the videophone to Snow.

                    KELVIN
          She knows everything.  She knows
          who she is.

                    SNOW
          She knows everything?  Does she
          know she came once before and you
          put her in --

                    KELVIN
          No.

A beat.

                    SNOW
          What do you want?

                    KELVIN
          I want you to get Sartorius to
          abandon his plan.

                    SNOW
              (feigning innocence)
          What plan?

                    KELVIN
          Just get him to stop.

                    SNOW
          What do you want to do, leave the
          station with her?

                    KELVIN
          Yes.

                    SNOW
          Kelvin, she'll disintegrate.  You
          don't believe me?  Let's radio that
          shuttle pod you launched -- better
          yet, let's go get it.  I've charted
          it's trajectory, only take a few
          hours...

                    KELVIN
          Her oxygen would have run out.

                    SNOW
          Maybe she doesn't need any.  Should
          we check?

Kelvin just stares at him.

                    SNOW
          Who are you trying to please? 
          Yourself?  Her?  Which her, this
          one or that one.  Can you face
          both?  We are in a situation that
          is beyond morality.  So: Leave with
          her.  You'll see the
          transformation.

                    KELVIN
          Into what?

                    SNOW
          You'll see her die, that's all. 
          They're mortal, despite what she
          told you.  She will die.  Then what
          will you do?

                    KELVIN
          I love her.

                    SNOW
          You do, you don't.  She's willing
          to give her life, you're willing to
          give yours, it's touching and
          magnificent, anything you want but 
          -- this isn't the place for it. 
          Don't you see?  No, you don't.

          I'm sending you a message because I
          feel sorry for you.  I really do,
          Kelvin.
              (beat)
          It is a mistake to become
          emotionally engaged with one of
          them.  You are being manipulated. 
          You are going around in circles to
          satisfy the curiosity of a power we
          don't understand and can't control,
          and she is the living proof that
          power exists.  If she were ugly,
          you wouldn't want her around;
          that's why she's not ugly.  She is
          a mirror that reflects part of your
          mind.  You provide the formula. 
          You can only finish where you
          started, remember that.
              (beat)
          They sold us out to the highest

          What are you taking?

Rheya, on the kitchen floor.  The bottle of sleeping pills
just beyond her hand.

BACK ON THE PROMETHEUS

Kelvin looks at Rheya.  She shakes her head; she doesn't want
the pills.  Kelvin comes and sits beside her.

                    KELVIN
          What does it want?

                    RHEYA
          I don't know.  Something. 
          Anything.

She goes to a portal and stares out at Solaris.

                    RHEYA
          It created me and yet I can't
          communicate with it.  It must hear
          me, though.  It must know what's
          happening to me.  Don't you think?

          I don't think it dislikes us.  I
          think it just noticed us.  It
          lives, thinks, and acts.  We are
          dealing with a living creature
          here, no question.  And it's done
          something we've never been able to

          Perfect except for the subatomic
          alterations, but...

          If Solaris is inside our brain, and
          it knows everything, and we're only
          consciously aware of what 2% of our
          brain is up to at any given moment,
          it knows us better than we know
          ourselves.  It's not even close.

          I've decided that if it is God,
          it's a sick God.  Its ambitions
          exceed its powers, but it doesn't
          realize it.
              (beat)
          It's created a situation without a
          goal, and I hate that.  A God whose
          passion is not a redemption, who
          saves nothing, fulfills no purpose.
              (beat)
          And us?  We would have to have "an
          arrangement".  An unspoken
          understanding that I am not human. 
          How can I not hate something that
          does that?

                    RHEYA
          When?

                    KELVIN
          Last night.  You were talking to
          someone in the corridor.

                    RHEYA
          You must have been dreaming.

She begins to cry.

                    KELVIN
          What's the matter?

She just shakes her head.

                    KELVIN
          Rheya?

From Kelvin's point of view: Rheya, in the chair, crying.

Then he looks right to see: Rheya, in the doorway, talking to
someone we cannot see.

Then he looks further to the right, and there she is again,
staring at him from the bathroom doorway.  She moves to the
edge of the bed in order to be near.

KELVIN

Sweating.  Struggling.  Beyond fear.

                    KELVIN (V.O.)
          I'm losing my mind.
              (beat)
          I'm breaking apart.

INT.  CABIN - DAY

Kelvin sits in his chair, as he did at the beginning, with
the three officials from DBA behind him.

Only now the three officials are Snow, Sartorius, and
Gibarian.

INT.  KELVIN'S ROOM (PROMETHEUS)

Kelvin, transfixed.

                    KELVIN (V.O.)
          Is this what it means to die?
              (beat)
          Am I in the moment of my own death?
              (beat)
          Is this the last thought I will
          ever have?

This idea forces him to rise, and he does, slowly.

INT.  CORRIDOR

Behind Kelvin as he somehow keeps moving.

We hold a long time, and then:

                                                  CUT TO:

BLACK.

Count to ten.  Then:

                                                  CUT TO:

EXT.  STREET

Kelvin moving down a crowded sidewalk, in slow motion.

                    KELVIN (V.O.)
          I am home now.
              (beat)
          I try to find the rhythm of the
          world where I used to live... but I
          feel completely and continually out
          of-sync.  I am separate.  Why did I
          return to Earth and lie about what
          happened?  Lie about having contact
          with something like Solaris?  I
          knew something else was out there,
          and didn't tell a soul.  I left
          them in the dark.  We all did.

                                                  CUT TO:

INT.  TRAIN - DAY

Kelvin, traveling home from the city.

                                                  CUT TO:

EXT.  KELVIN'S CABIN - DAY

Kelvin returns.  He stops and looks around before entering
his front door.

                    KELVIN (V.O.)
          So why come back at all?  To see if
          she comes here?

KEVIN'S POV

Of the woods.

But there are strange incongruities in the image -- pieces of
the Prometheus breaking through; for instance, a few of the
AUTOMATED TASKMASTERS are crawling along the ground.

KELVIN

Looking from the doorway, notes this.  He doesn't seem
surprised, though.

                    KELVIN (V.O.)
          I don't believe it will happen.

INT.  KELVIN'S CABIN - NIGHT

Kelvin, in his bed, awake.

                    KELVIN (V.O.)
          But I will wait, anyway.

                                                  CUT TO:

BLACK.

Count to five.  Then:

                                                  CUT TO:

INT.  KELVIN'S ROOM (PROMETHEUS)

Kelvin is in his bed, still feverish.

                    KELVIN (V.O.)
          I thought it was over.

He looks around the room.  He is alone.

A flashing light on his computer demands attention.

ON THE COMPUTER

A video message from Rheya.

                    RHEYA
          Don't blame them.  I begged them to
          do it.  It's better this way.
              (beat)
          I'm sorry.
              (beat)
          I'm sorry I tried to make you think
          I was human.
              (beat)
          I read my own suicide note.  I
          found it in your things.  I
          realized I was not her.

She looks away.

                    RHEYA
          I know that you loved me, Chris.  I
          know that.
              (beat)
          I love you.

Kelvin breaks down.

                                                  CUT TO:

INT.  APARTMENT - DAY

Kelvin, with the dead Rheya in his arms, crying.  Beyond him
is the rain-streaked window.  On the floor, by her hand, is
the note.  On it is scrawled the end of a Dylan Thomas poem,
the one Kelvin quoted to her the first time they spoke.

INT.  PARTY - NIGHT

The first night.  Again, Kelvin leans into Rheya's ear and
whispers.  This time we hear what he says:

                    KELVIN
          "Though they go mad they shall be
          sane.  Though they sink through the
          sea they shall rise again."

INT.  APARTMENT - DAY

Kevin holding Rheya.

The note on the floor.

The rain-streaked window.

                    RHEYA (V.O.)
          "Though lovers be lost love shall
          not.  And death shall have no
          dominion."

Kelvin wipes the hair from her face.

                    KELVIN (V.O.)
          You killed her!

                    SARTORIUS (V.O.)
          Not her.  It.

                                                  CUT TO:

INT.  PROMETHEUS

Kelvin, furious, is talking through a slit in Sartorius'
door.

                    KELVIN
          You murdered her!

                    SARTORIUS
          Kelvin, she begged me.  I had a
          short-range version of the
          destabilizer prototype, a miniature
          with a range of a few meters.  She
          walked into it and disappeared. 
          She was gone.

Kelvin looks around.

                    KELVIN
          She'll come back.

                    SARTORIUS
          No, she won't.

                    KELVIN
          Why would you let her to do that?

                    SARTORIUS
          It's not human, Kelvin.  Whatever
          it is, it's not human, and I am
          threatened by that.  Evolution-of-
          the-species-at-stake threatened. 
          And I want to win.  I want humans
          to win.  So I am killing it before
          it kills me.

                    KELVIN
          You fucking bastard...

                    SARTORIUS
          Whose side are you on?

Kelvin moves away.

                                                  CUT TO:

EXT.  SOLARIS

Still turning, slowly.

But something about its appearance is different.

INT.  PROMETHEUS

Complete chaos.

Kelvin is chasing Sartorius to the flight deck.

                    SARTORIUS
              (yelling as he runs)
          It's changing characteristics. 
          It's solidifying taking on weight.

                    KELVIN
          How quickly?

                    SARTORIUS
          If it continues, it will implode
          from its own weight and turn into a
          black hole in about four hours and
          pulls us in with it.

INT.  FLIGHT DECK

Kelvin and Sartorius get the ship ready for take off.

                    KELVIN
          Where's Snow?  Did you call him?

                    SARTORIUS
          Yes.

Kelvin turns and sees one of the video monitors that Snow is
sitting in his room.

                    KELVIN
              (via intercom)
          Snow!  We need you up here.

Snow doesn't reply.

                    KELVIN
          Snow!

Snow looks up.  There's a strange look on his face.

                    KELVIN
          What's wrong with you?  We need
          your help.

                    SNOW
          I won't be making the trip.

                    SARTORIUS
          Snow, get up here, now.

                    SNOW
          I'm not Snow.

This stops Kelvin and Sartorius.  They look at each other and
then at the monitor.

                    SNOW
          I got rid of him.  I wanted to see
          if... I wanted to be the only one. 
          I wanted to be Snow.

                    SARTORIUS
          Fuck me.  I knew it.

                    KELVIN
          When did this happen?

                    SNOW
          Oh, right away.  That's why you
          never saw me with anyone.  You
          should've noticed that.  I miss
          him, though.  I think I made a
          mistake.

                    KELVIN
          Jesus...

                    SNOW
          But I can't leave with you.  I
          won't make it.

                    KELVIN
          Maybe you can.

                    SARTORIUS
          You want it coming back with us?

                    SNOW
          You go ahead.  Of what I remember
          about Earth... it's all one thing
          now.  Everything's a blur.  I like
          distinctions.

Snow lies down on his bed.  Kelvin looks at Sartorius.

                    SARTORIUS
          We do not have time to deal with
          this.  Get the diode sail into
          position and let me know when the
          bias drive and the induction ring
          are at zero point.

Kelvin nods and obeys.  He then takes one last look at the
monitor to see Snow lying in bed.  Kelvin reaches over and
shuts the monitor off.

                                                  CUT TO:

EXT.  SPACE

Silence.

The Prometheus moves away from Solaris.

CLOSER ON SOLARIS

After the ship has gone.

A soft black spot begins to form in the center of the planet.

Slowly, inexorably, this black spot begins to expand.

Within a minute Solaris has disappeared.

                                                  CUT TO:

EXT.  STREET CORNER - DAY

Kelvin, back on Earth.  Silent and still.  And the rain
continues.

He watches the activity; the cars, buses, and people moving
to and fro.

                    KELVIN (V.O.)
          Earth.
              (beat)
          What did that word mean to me?
              (beat)
          I have returned.  Finally.

Kelvin begins to walk.

                    KELVIN (V.O.)
          I work in the city now.  After work
          I wander and lose myself.  I am
          silent and attentive.  I follow the
          current.  I make a conscious effort
          to smile, nod, stand, and perform
          the millions of gestures that
          constitute life on Earth.

INT.  TRAIN - DAY

Kelvin taking the train to the suburbs.

                    KELVIN (V.O.)
          I will study these gestures until
          they become reflexes again.  I will
          find new interests and occupations,
          but --

EXT.  ROAD - DAY

Kelvin makes his way toward his cabin.  As he nears, his
LABRODOR recognizes him and approaches.

Kelvin pats the dog's coat.

                    KELVIN (V.O.)
          I will not... give myself.  I will
          not give myself to anything or
          anyone, because I am haunted by the
          idea that I remembered her wrong. 
          That I shaded my memory of her to
          suit myself.  That I was unfair to
          her and caused her destruction. 
          What if I was wrong about
          everything?
              (beat)
          I've come to believe that memory is
          a curse.

EXT.  CABIN - DAY

Kelvin is near the front door, dog at his heel.  He looks in
as he brings his key to the lock and his face FREEZES.

RHEYA

Is in the living room, waiting for him.

She is sitting on the sofa, looking toward the other side of
the room.  Sensing someone, she turns to see Kelvin, and her
face melts into a smile.

KELVIN

Opens the door.  He cannot speak.

RHEYA

Rises and moves toward him.

They embrace.

He breathes her in.  She squeezes him.

After a long beat:

                    KELVIN
          How can you be here...

                    RHEYA
              (whispering)
          Shhhh.  Just stay with me.
              (beat)
          Stay with me.  Everything is
          forgiven.  Everything.

She sways with him, gently.  His body relaxes.

                    KELVIN
          I love you.

EXT.  CABIN - DAY

A tableau of the cabin.  The dog is on the front step,
seemingly content despite the light rain.

As fog drifts in, we RISE, and soon the mist has nearly
obscured the house.  The fog turns into clouds and we get
fleeting glimpses of the cabin, as we move farther and
farther away.

We stay in a translucent white stage for a few moments, until
gradually the edges of a circle become apparent in the
corners of the frame.  Still there is a light rain sound.

These dark, rounded edges penetrate further until they are
forming the shape of a circle.

The misty consistency begins to gain some color and body.

And we realize we are now looking at the surface of Solaris.

                                                FADE OUT.
