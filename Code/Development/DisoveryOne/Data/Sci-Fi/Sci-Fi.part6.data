               FADE IN:

               EXT. LATE AFTERNOON SKY

               Blue sky, a few puffs of cloud, pierced by slanting rays of 
               sunlight. Late afternoon on a perfect day.

               SUPER TITLE: "HOUSTON, TEXAS. JULY 4, 2020."

               As we hear, after a few more beats, an ASTRONAUT'S VOICE.

                                     PHIL
                         T minus ten, nine, eight, start 
                         ignition sequence, five, four, three, 
                         two, one, ignition... Liftoff!

               A tiny red streak zips into the sky, then bursts with a faint, 
               ludicrous POP. A bottle rocket. We hear CHILDREN'S LAUGHTER, 
               excited SHOUTS.

               EXT. LAWN PARTY. LUKE GRAHAM'S HOUSE. LATE AFTERNOON

               DESCENDING, we see PHIL OHLMYER, late 20's, kneeling, with a 
               gaggle of eager CHILDREN around him. Phil, an astronaut, has 
               got an impressive array of fireworks lined up, and is using 
               an empty longneck as his launching tube.

                                     CHILDREN
                              (all at once)
                         My turn! My turn! No, I was next! 
                         No, me! Uncle Phil, Uncle Phil, can 
                         I do one? I want to do one!

                                     PHIL
                         Guys, guys, please! This is risky 
                         stuff here. And I'm a highly trained 
                         professional.

               Derisive GROANS from the kids, more SHOUTS. Phil grins. 
               There's little danger NASA will ever use him on a recruiting 
               poster: he's messy, very hyper. Phil waves his hands for 
               silence.

                                     PHIL
                         Okay, okay! Uncle Phil will launch 
                         another booster...

               Another astronaut, RENEE COTE, a tall, very fit French woman, 
               is walking by with a fresh six-pack. She tosses a beer and 
               Phil catches it.

                                     PHIL
                         ...just as soon as he completes his 
                         fuel intake.

               ANGLE FOLLOWS COTE

               Who grins, walking away from Phil and the kids, as we begin 
               to get a better sense of the scope of this party. We are in 
               the big back yard of a middle-class home in a Houston suburb. 
               DOZENS OF PEOPLE - astronauts, NASA personnel, and their 
               families -- are gathered around picnic tables or spread-out 
               blankets. Lots of red, white and blue bunting, lots of 
               balloons. We hear snatches of MUSIC, mostly country-flavored, 
               from dueling boomboxes. Futuristic Frisbees are being tossed 
               about. A banner, strung between trees, reads "BON VOYAGE, 
               MARS ONE!!!"

                                     WILLIS
                         It'll take us six months just to get 
                         to Mars. Another year on the surface, 
                         then six months back. That's two 
                         years...

               Passing the banner, Cote lobs a beer to another astronaut, 
               NICHOLAS WILLIS, who snags it neatly. He's got his other arm 
               around the waist of a PRETTY GIRL. As Cote moves OUT OF FRAME, 
               ANGLE LINGERS on these two. Willis, a very young astronaut, 
               early 20s, is recruiting poster material, and knows it all 
               too well.

                                     WILLIS
                         I guess what I'm trying to say is, 
                         since this is my last night on Earth, 
                         it's gonna be a very precious memory 
                         to me. Y'know?

                                     PRETTY GIRL
                         Nice try, Nick.

               As the Pretty Girl slips out of his grasp, laughing, and 
               walks away, Willis shrugs philosophically. He pops open his 
               beer, swigs it.

               ANGLE FOLLOWS THE PRETTY GIRL As she swerves around an open-
               pit barbecue, where other ASTRONAUTS are gathered. Cote has 
               paused here, too, distributing the last of her beers. SERGEI 
               KIROV, a Russian cosmonaut, is watching some kids nearby as 
               they play a game of wiffle ball. He turns, grinning beerily 
               at the chef.

                                     KIROV
                         Hey, Woody, our Mars One crew won't 
                         be heading back to Earth till ten 
                         days after you guys land at our base 
                         camp with Mars Two. That's a pretty 
                         good long rendezvous.

               WOODY BLAKE, late 30s, is a big, rangy guy in a cowboy hat 
               over a Hawaiian shirt and a "KISS THE CHEF" apron. An entire 
               pig is turning on a spit over the flames, and Woody is basting 
               this as he smiles at Malik.

                                     WOODY
                         What are you suggesting, Sergei?

                                     KIROV
                         Maybe you should bring a baseball 
                         bat. Yes? American baseball? Our two 
                         crews could have ourselves a little 
                         Solar System Series.

                                     WOODY
                         Please. Half you guys are foreigners. 
                         We'd crush you.

                                     KIROV
                         No, no, we have equal crews. Three 
                         men, one woman. Same handicap.

               He grins teasingly at Cote, who makes a face at him.

                                     WOODY
                         Easy now, you're talking about my 
                         wife.
                              (seeing her approach)
                         And Terri just happens to be one 
                         helluva shortstop.

               DR. TERRI FISHER, early 30s, passes by with a platter of 
               corn-on-the-cob. Short, sturdy body, a face made attractive 
               by its alert, questing intelligence. She pauses to kiss 
               Woody's cheek; there's a wonderful, sexy spark between them. 
               Then she glances at Kirov, all business now.

                                     TERRI
                         Fast pitch, no steals, batter calls 
                         his own strikes. Thousand bucks make 
                         it interesting?

               He's a bit rattled by her cockiness, and looks at Cote, who 
               smiles, nods her cool agreement.

                                     COTE
                         Eh bien. Winner take all.

                                     TERRI
                         Good.
                              (smiles sweetly at 
                              Kirov)
                         Bring some balls.

               The other men ooooh at this, busting on Kirov and Cote, as 
               Terri moves on. Woody, watching her go, has a thousand-watt 
               grin.

                                     WOODY
                         You wanna know the sad part? 
                         Technically I outrank her. But if we 
                         want any peace at all on Mars Two, 
                         I'm gonna be saying a lot of "Yes, 
                         dears."

               The others laugh.

               ANGLE FOLLOWS TERRI as she dodges a PACK OF KIDS -- they run 
               by her, shrieking happily - before she finally reaches a 
               picnic table, where ASTRONAUTS' WIVES are opening containers 
               of baked beans, coleslaw, and potato salad.

                                     1ST WIFE
                         ...just not sure how I feel about 
                         NASA allowing couples to go on this 
                         type of mission together.

               One of the other women raises a warning eyebrow, and the 1st 
               Wife turns, sees Terri setting down her platter.

                                     1ST WIFE
                              (embarrassed)
                         Nothing personal, Terri. It's just 
                         that, well, it's kind of a funny 
                         feeling for those of us staying 
                         behind.

                                     TERRI
                              (carefully neutral)
                         All the research shows that marriage 
                         will provide stability on these long 
                         duration trips.

                                     2ND WIFE
                         Then they haven't studied some of 
                         the couples I've known.

               Laughter at this. Terri smiles politely -- she doesn't really 
               have much in common with these women -- before moving on. 
               ANGLE LINGERS on the wives, who watch her go with a slight 
               tinge of jealousy. One of them is looking around.

                                     3RD WIFE
                         Anybody seen Jim McConnell?

                                     4TH WIFE
                         I don't think he's coming.

                                     1ST WIFE
                         God, that poor man. How's he doing?

                                     2ND WIFE
                         Totally losing it, from what I hear. 
                         Can't sleep, can't eat. Visits her 
                         grave almost every day.
                              (lowers her voice)
                         They say he could lose mission status.

                                     3RD WIFE
                         Oh, that's so sad. That is just so 
                         tragic. You go to a routine physical 
                         one day, and wham.

                                     4TH WIFE
                         After all those years of training, 
                         too. It was their whole dream.

                                     1ST WIFE
                         Must be a pretty funny feeling for 
                         Luke Graham. Y'know? Now he's gonna 
                         be in the history books. First man 
                         on Mars...

               She shakes her head, awed by the thought. The others nod in 
               agreement, following her glance...

               In the distance, a lone MALE FIGURE stands by the garage, 
               his back to them, facing the parked cars, vans, and SUVs 
               which stretch down the driveway and along the street. Another 
               figure, a WOMAN, can be seen approaching him.

               CLOSER ANGLE FOLLOWS the moving woman -- DEBRA GRAHAM, early 
               30s, very attractive -- until she reaches her husband. LUKE 
               GRAHAM, mid 30s, has the lean, fit body of an astronaut, the 
               restless intellect of a scientist. He's unaware of her 
               approach until she touches his shoulder. He looks at her 
               with an apologetic smile.

                                     DEBRA
                         He's not coming, Luke.

                                     LUKE
                         Jim deserves this, too. All his 
                         friends are here. And it's my last 
                         night.

                                     DEBRA
                              (gently)
                         Your last night with us, too.

               He looks at her, moved. She summons a smile. He slides his 
               arms around her waist, kisses her forehead.

                                     LUKE
                         I love you, Deb.

                                     DEBRA
                         I love you too, baby. But maybe you 
                         should spend some time with Bobby.

                                     LUKE
                         Yeah. I will. Where is he?

                                     DEBRA
                         Up in his fort.

               He kisses her again, then goes. Debra's eyes follow him, 
               with a mixture of pride and sadness.

               ANGLE FOLLOWS Luke away from the garage, into

               EXT. THE BACK YARD. LATE AFTERNOON

               Luke moves through the crowd. Phil and the kids are still 
               shooting off rockets. Red streaks arc high overhead.

               In the back corner of the yard, where it's quieter, he passes 
               Willis, who's sitting on a blanket, murmuring soulfully to 
               PRETTY GIRL #2.

                                     WILLIS
                         Deep space is so lonesome. So cold. 
                         But I guess I'll have my memories to 
                         keep me warm...

               Luke shakes his head. Willis is incorrigible. Finally he 
               reaches a tall redwood playset. He looks up the ladder.

               A SMALL BOY sits on the platform of the tower, arms around 
               his knees, staring up at the stars. A telescope rests nearby 
               on a tripod. He looks lonely.

               Luke climbs up, sits down on the wooden deck next to him. 
               BOBBY, 7, glances over at his dad, his idol, then back at 
               the sky.

                                     BOBBY
                         Who's gonna read to me now, at 
                         bedtime?

               Luke is surprised by the question. A pause.

                                     LUKE
                         Mommy will.

                                     BOBBY
                         I like when you do it. Now we're 
                         never gonna finish our book.

               His voice is unexpectedly fierce. He's fighting back tears. 
               Luke is moved. Another brief silence.

                                     LUKE
                         Well, I'll tell you what. I've been 
                         thinking about that. And what I 
                         thought was -- how 'bout if I bring 
                         along my own copy?
                              (Bobby looks at him)
                         Then every night, wherever I am, 
                         I'll read a little bit more of it. 
                         And I'll know that you and Mommy, 
                         wherever you are, you're reading it 
                         too. That way, it'll feel like we're 
                         still reading it together. 'Cause I 
                         don't know about you, but I'm pretty 
                         anxious to find out how 'ol Ben Gunn 
                         got marooned on that island. What 
                         d'you say?

               Bobby manages a smile. He nods, feeling a little better. 
               Luke is proud of his son's courage.

                                     LUKE
                         Good deal. Can I have a hug?

               Bobby's arms go around his father's neck. He hugs Luke 
               fiercely, and Luke hugs him back. His eyes, over the thin 
               young shoulders, are brimming with love and impending absence. 
               Then, from the distance, the sound of an APPROACHING CAR. 
               They both turn.

               An open Jeep is coming down the street. Its DRIVER is alone.

               Luke's expression changes. Recognition, then happiness.

               EXT. LUKE'S STREET. LATE AFTERNOON

               The Jeep stops, its electric engine WHIRRING down. The Driver 
               climbs out wearily, reaching into the back seat, and comes 
               out with a champagne bottle, hastily decorated with ribbon. 
               The PARTY SOUNDS are drifting this way, and he hesitates a 
               moment, seeming to gather himself. He starts gamely towards 
               the party, then pauses again.

               Debra Graham stands nearby on the front lawn, waiting. She 
               smiles tentatively.

               JIM MCCONNELL, early 40s, manages a smile in return. He has 
               dark circles under his eyes, and his clothes look slept in.

               Yet we sense, even through his sadness, a kind of quiet 
               competence in this man, an unforced authority; he's a natural 
               leader.

               Debra hurries forward, into his arms, and he hugs her. They 
               separate, looking at each other. Her eyes are shining.

                                     DEBRA
                         We were afraid you wouldn't come.

                                     MCCONNELL
                         I caught a whiff of your barbecue. 
                         After that I was helpless.

                                     DEBRA
                         All the way out in Galveston?

                                     MCCONNELL
                         Something like that.
                              (she smiles)
                         It's his night, Deb. I didn't want 
                         to spoil it.

                                     DEBRA
                         Spoil it? He's been going crazy 
                         looking for you.

               Over her shoulder he sees Luke approaching, his arm around 
               Bobby. The two men look at each other, the bond between them 
               so strong it needs no words. Finally Luke smiles.

                                     LUKE
                         C'mon. A whole lot of folks here are 
                         gonna be mighty glad to see you.

               McConnell comes towards him, accompanied by Debra, and 
               together the four of them move OUT OF FRAME, heading towards 
               the party. ANGLE HOLDS on the parking area, as we...

                                                               DISSOLVE TO:

               EXT. SAME VIEW. NIGHT (HOURS LATER)

               All the parked cars and vans are gone now, except for two: 
               McConnell's Jeep and Woody's classic 'Vette. Willis, one of 
               the last to go, is just departing on his motorcycle. Perched 
               behind him, arms around his waist, is PRETTY GIRL #3. They 
               zoom away, through the darkened neighborhood.

               EXT. BACK YARD. NIGHT

               The yard is nearly deserted. The "Bon Voyage" banner has 
               torn loose at one end and flutters limply. Here and there a 
               napkin blows across the ground.

               In the distance, THREE FIGURES sit on the ground, by the 
               waning fire of the barbecue pit, sipping beers.

               CLOSER ON THIS TRIO

               As Woody shoves another piece of wood into the flames. For a 
               moment he, McConnell, and Luke are silent, staring at the 
               sparks as they rise towards the stars -- red and gold dots 
               mingling with the silver ones.

                                     WOODY
                              (abruptly)
                         I wish we were all going. Together.

               The intensity in his voice surprises the others, and even 
               Woody himself. Luke glances at McConnell. An awkward beat.

                                     LUKE
                         Then you've got a short memory. Think 
                         back to how we were by the second 
                         week of lunar training.

                                     WOODY
                         Oh, you're not gonna bring that up 
                         again --

                                     LUKE
                              (laughing)
                         I'm trying to remember, let's see, 
                         which one of us scored the lowest 
                         ranking up there?

                                     WOODY
                         You just can't let that go --

                                     LUKE
                         Oh, man, three commanders, on the 
                         same ship? If they sent us off to 
                         Mars together, there wouldn't be 
                         enough fuel to lift all those egos.

                                     WOODY
                              (laughs)
                         Bullshit, we would've made a great 
                         crew.

                                     MCCONNELL
                         That was never gonna happen. I was 
                         always teamed with Maggie, and we 
                         were mostly chalkboard jockies. You 
                         know? Systems. Payloads...

                                     LUKE
                         Listen to him. Mr. Cover-of-Time 
                         Magazine!

                                     WOODY
                         Yeah, who landed the crippled Block 
                         II Shuttle?

                                     LUKE
                         Yeah, and who scored highest on the 
                         lunar rankings?

                                     WOODY
                         Let it go, Luke.

                                     MCCONNELL
                              (smiles)
                         Sure, I made a little noise. But 
                         putting the first footprints on Mars? 
                         Nah. That's for guys who...
                              (looks at Luke)
                         ...wrote their Ph.D. thesis on how 
                         to colonize the place. And guys who...
                              (looks at Woody)
                         ...read too much science fiction as 
                         a kid and still wear little Flash 
                         Gordon rocketships around their necks.

               He grabs playfully at Woody's neck. Woody smacks his hand 
               away, laughing.

                                     WOODY
                         You read the same damn science fiction 
                         books that I did! You're just not 
                         man enough to wear jewelry!

               He pulls from his shirt a little Flash Gordon rocketship 
               emblem hanging on a chain, and waggles this tauntingly at 
               McConnell, as Luke and McConnell laugh.

                                     WOODY
                         You want Flash. You know you want 
                         him. Well you'll have to come through 
                         me!

               Luke grabs Woody's arm to give McConnell a better shot at 
               the emblem, but Woody cuffs his hands away, laughing. 
               McConnell, watching their horseplay, shakes his head.

                                     MCCONNELL
                         God, she would've loved to see you 
                         two clowns. Just one more time.

               He tries to smile, but his face reddens. Then all at once 
               his chest is heaving as he struggles to control his emotions. 
               Woody sees this, reaches out a reassuring hand, but McConnell 
               shakes him off, rises abruptly. He turns his back on them, 
               walking away a few steps.

               Woody and Luke exchange a worried glance.

               EXT. LUKE'S STREET. LATER THAT NIGHT

               McConnell and Luke watch as Woody starts up his Corvette. 
               McConnell has regained his composure.

                                     LUKE
                         Hey, Woodrow, isn't it about time 
                         you donated this thing to a museum?

               Woody revs the engine, which ROARS lustily. He grins.

                                     WOODY
                         Internal combustion, boys. Accept no 
                         substitutes.

               Luke laughs. Woody looks at McConnell.

                                     WOODY
                         Jim, if there's ever... if there's 
                         anything Terri and I can do --

                                     MCCONNELL
                         I'm okay. Really. Thanks.

               Woody reaches out to shake Luke's hand.

                                     WOODY
                         See you when I get to Mars, Luke. 
                         Don't solve all the mysteries of the 
                         universe, okay? Leave a little 
                         something for the next guys.

                                     LUKE
                         I'll see what I can do. Just make 
                         sure you bring some fresh beer.

                                     WOODY
                         You got it.

               With a final glance at McConnell, Woody slips the car into 
               gear. McConnell and Luke watch as he drives away. A silence. 
               Luke glances at his old friend, growing more serious. We 
               sense he's been waiting all night for a chance to say this.

                                     LUKE
                         Should've been your mission, Jim. 
                         Yours and Maggie's.

               McConnell, looking after Woody's car, becomes very still.

                                     LUKE
                         None of us ever wanted Mars the way 
                         you two did. Not even Woody. Twelve 
                         years of hoping for this assignment, 
                         training for it --

                                     MCCONNELL
                         That's all over now.

                                     LUKE
                         If Maggie hadn't gotten sick -- if 
                         you hadn't pulled yourself out of 
                         the rotation to take care of her --

               McConnell turns to him, his eyes flashing danger. He will 
               not tolerate pity. Luke sees this but presses on.

                                     LUKE
                         No, I'm gonna say this. I have to 
                         say it...
                              (pause)
                         I wanted Mars One. Hell, I battled 
                         you for it every step of the way. 
                         Never wanted to beat anybody so bad 
                         in my life. But not like this... 
                         Jim, I'd give this all up in a second, 
                         if it would bring Maggie back to us.

               McConnell is deeply moved, and for a moment doesn't trust 
               his own voice.

                                     MCCONNELL
                         I know that, Luke. You don't have to 
                         say it... Mars is yours now. Go get 
                         it.

                                     LUKE

                         Take care of yourself.

                                     MCCONNELL
                         Yeah. You too.

               Luke nods. They grab hands for a second, then let go. Luke 
               walks back towards his house. McConnell watches him for a 
               moment, then turns, walks over to his Jeep. He opens his 
               door, then pauses. He turns. Looks up at --

               EXT. NIGHT SKY

               A tiny reddish dot hovers there, glowing steadily. Mars 
               itself, a tantalizing prize. But for him now, more distant 
               than ever. For him, perhaps, never to be attained.

               CLOSE ON MCCONNELL'S FACE

               As we see these thoughts going through him. After a moment 
               he looks down at

               HIS SHOES

               And the sandy verge of the front yard.

               MCCONNELL'S EYES

               Are a map of complex emotions: regret, injured pride, infinite 
               yearning. Gently, a bit self-consciously, HE LIFTS ONE SHOE

               And sets it down again, making a careful, deliberate footprint 
               in the sandy soil...

               EXT. MARS. CHRYSE PLANITIA. DAY

               Instantly we're hurled into an immense, stunning LANDSCAPE, 
               mysterious and vivid as a fever dream. Dazzling sunlight. A 
               vast plain of rust-orange soil. Countless craters. Boulders 
               the size of houses, tossed about by the hands of gods. Twin 
               moons hanging in a salmon-pink sky. On the horizon, towering, 
               craggy peaks. And, at center -- the only sign of life -- a 
               small, mysterious, moving puff of dust.

               CLOSER ANGLE as a small, Sojourner-like, multi-wheeled robotic 
               vehicle ambles INTO FRAME, jouncing along the orange Martian 
               soil, pausing to snuffle its sensors towards the occasionally 
               interesting rock. Lettering on its side reads "ARES-8."

               SUPER TITLE: "MARS. PLAINS OF CYDONIA. EIGHT MONTHS LATER."

               Suddenly Ares-8 pauses. Its video lens WHIRRS out, fine-tuning 
               focus, as it becomes intrigued by something OFFSCREEN -- a 
               higher, more distant target. The little fellow almost quivers 
               with excitement.

               EXT. MARS. TIU VALLIS. DAY

               A one-man ATV ROVER waits in the background, in a dry 
               streambed, as Luke, in an EVA spacesuit, swings a clawed 
               rock hammer against a multi-layered, sedimentary rock face. 
               Reddish dust coats his bulky white suit. Despite that bulk, 
               he moves easily in the light Martian gravity (1/3 Earth's). 
               A hunk of rock breaks off, and Luke examines it more closely, 
               holding it up to his clear faceplate. He's very happy, 
               absorbed in this work, when his RADIO CRACKLES.

                                     COTE
                         Luke, you read me?

                                     LUKE
                         Yeah, Renee.

                                     COTE
                         Luke, I just got ARES-8 on line and... 
                         Well, we think you're gonna wanna 
                         see this for yourself.

               Luke, though reluctant to break off work, is intrigued.

                                     LUKE
                         Copy that.

               As Luke turns away, headed for the rover

               To REVEAL a STAGGERING PROSPECT, seen for the first time: 
               Valles Marineris, that planet-creasing slash. So wide, so 
               deep, it boggles the mind: on earth it would reach from New 
               York to L.A.

               INT. MARS ONE HAB. DAY

               The crew of Mars One - Kirov, Willis, and Cote -- have joined 
               Luke, gathered around some display monitors. They're in NASA 
               jumpsuits; the Hab has artificial atmosphere, enhanced 
               gravity, and heat. All are captivated by what they see. ON A 
               VIDEO SCREEN

               We see a low-angle image of an elongated, rubble and dirt-
               covered MOUNTAIN. Hard to tell scale, but it looks huge. 
               What's most striking, however, is a WHITE PEAK barely 
               protruding through the rubble two-thirds of the way along 
               the mountain's ridgeline. Its whiteness is in clear contrast 
               to the typical rust-orange of the surrounding rubble; what's 
               more, this strange little peak also displays an oddly-smooth, 
               multi-planed symmetry.

                                     LUKE
                         What the hell is that?

                                     COTE
                         No idea, boss.

                                     LUKE
                         Where is it?

               Cote glances at the others. They're all smirking, as if they 
               share some secret joke Luke's not yet in on.

                                     WILLIS
                         You don't wanna know.

                                     LUKE
                         C'mon, what's so funny? Gimme the 
                         coordinates.

               He leans over to read a digital gauge, but Cote covers it 
               with her hand, enjoying the tease.

                                     COTE
                         Latitude 41 degrees north, longitude 
                         9 degrees west.

                                     LUKE
                         The Plains of Cydonia. So?
                              (pause)
                         Oh no. You're not telling me --

               They all laugh as the other shoe drops. Luke's expression is 
               incredulous, exasperated.

                                     COTE
                         Oui. Exactement! It's Kirov's fault, 
                         he picked today's sector.

                                     KIROV
                         Hey, c'mon! We've got a scientific 
                         duty to check that thing out.

               Luke sits, taking over the Ares remote control from Cote. 
               They all watch as he fine tunes the image, trying without 
               success to coax more resolution.

                                     LUKE
                         Great. That's great. The first anomaly 
                         we hit, and it's gotta be in the one 
                         place guaranteed to make NASA look 
                         ridiculous... You know how many books 
                         have been written about that damned

                         impact craters happen to look like 
                         eye sockets. If this gets out, we'll

                         Nah, too smooth. Too angular. Volcanic 
                         upwelling?

                         It's an upwelling, for sure. But 
                         maybe not volcanic...

               The others look at him, puzzled. Luke leans in closer, with 
               growing excitement. He points to the screen.

                                     LUKE
                         Look at the color. And see how shiny 
                         it is? I could swear that's ice...

                         Impossible. You can't have ice at 
                         this latitude. Not unless...

               They look at each other, Luke's excitement now leaping from 
               one to another of them. They're almost trembling.

                                     WILLIS

               They walk over to...

               THE FOUR-MAN ROVER

               The astronauts climb in through the hatch. The last one in 
               pulls it shut behind him and locks the latches. We see Cote 
               and Luke check their screens and press some buttons. Luke 
               puts the rover in drive.

               WIDER ANGLE, PULLING UP AND AWAY

               As the rover moves off across the rocky surface, dust kicking 
               up from the wheels, we get our first exterior glimpse of the 
               Mars One Base Camp. The main HAB UNIT looks like a huge tuna 
               can with a conical top section; it connects to a separate, 
               inflated-bubble GREENHOUSE. There's also an OXYGEN STILL, 
               PROPELLANT PLANT, and, on the other side, a couple hundred 
               meters distant, the massive ERV (Earth Return Vehicle), which 
               arrived as a separate, unmanned flight.

               Rows of SOLAR PANELS, arrayed on the ground, and an AMERICAN 
               FLAG on a thin pole, about man-height, complete the scene.

                                                               DISSOLVE TO:

               EXT. INTERNATIONAL SPACE STATION (ISP). EARTH ORBIT. DAY

               A vast, impressive, MULTI-SECTIONED SPACECRAFT is drifting 
               majestically above Earth. The main hull displays both NASA

               SUPER TITLE: "INTERNATIONAL SPACE STATION. MARS MISSION 
               CONTROL ROOM (MMCR). 20 MINUTE TIME LAG."

               We MOVE IN towards another of the station's segments, which 
               is dedicated entirely (as we see from more labels and 
               insignias) to the Mars Program: Control Room, Training and 
               Living Quarters, and a Vehicle Docking and Launch Area, where 
               Mars Two is already positioned for its eventual flight. We 
               hear LUKE'S EXCITED VOICE, over speakers.

                         This is a truly anomalous formation. 
                         Looks like nothing we've seen so 
                         far. The structure appears to be 
                         crystalline, at least from the angle 
                         displayed by ARES-8 ...

               On a large CENTER DISPLAY SCREEN, we see Luke and the Mars 
               One crew, sitting around their kitchen table in the Hab, 
               finishing lunch while taping this VIDEO MESSAGE.

                         up here, but -- we think there's a 
                         good chance this could be an extrusion 
                         from some subsurface, geothermal 
                         column of water. And if we're right...

               He looks at his crew. They beam like cats who ate canaries.

                         ...then we've found the key to 
                         permanent human colonization.

               IN THE MMCR

               There's an EXCITED BUZZ among the assembled TECHNICIANS, 
               FLIGHT ENGINEERS, and SCIENTISTS. This would be a fantastic, 
               epochal discovery.

               MCCONNELL

               Sits at the center console, wearing a headset. He's now the 
               Mars One CAPCOM (Capsule Communicator), and his manner is 
               brisk, efficient, all-business. A TECHNICIAN leans in for

               The technician nods, hurries away. McConnell, sharing the 
               intense excitement of those around him, stares up at

               THE SCREEN

               Where Luke and his crew are still smiling, well knowing the 
               excitement their bombshell will create.

                         Anyway, we'are going out to take a 
                         closer look at it, try to get an 
                         idea of its composition.

               The rover is a hundred meters away and moving fast TOWARDS

               holding its point, like an Irish Setter, with its video snout 
               WHIRRING OUT.

               The rover drives up and slows to a stop nearby. The hatch 
               door cracks open and some dust vents out. The door opens all 
               the way and the astronauts climb out. They all look up in 
               awe. We hear their voices ON RADIOS.

               Gleams in the sun, dazzling white, its facets as planed and 
               smooth as if an architect had drawn them. It pierces through 
               the topmost rubble at the near end of the big mountain -- an 
               isolated, butte-like giant, stretching two miles from left 
               to right in front of them.

               THE ASTRONAUTS

               Walk towards the mountain. There's a very deep, very low, 
               staccato tone intruding over their headsets.

                                     LUKE
                         Anyone else hear that?

                                     COTE
                         Yeah. What is it?

                                     WILLIS
                         Sounds like our antenna's out of 
                         phase.

                                     LUKE
                         Can you fix it?

                                     WILLIS
                         Hey, skip, I can fix anything.

                                     LUKE
                         Big talker. Renee, Sergei, let's 
                         break out the radar, see what this 
                         thing's made of.

               As they go to their jobs, the deep, barely audible rumbling 
               tone continues.

               INT. SPACE STATION. CORRIDOR OUTSIDE MMCR. DAY

               MULTINATIONAL CREWMEMBERS walk by, in the artificial gravity 
               of the busy station, as RAY BECK, mid-50s, approaches from 
               the opposite direction. Beck is the tough, crewcut, PR-savvy 
               head of the NASA Mars Program (ID'd by his name tag), and 
               just now he's leading a covey of U.N. AMBASSADORS on a tour. 
               The ambassadors, of both sexes, many nations, and all races, 
               look as excited as schoolkids.

                                     BECK
                         ...and this is the Mars Mission 
                         Control Room, nicknamed "Micker." I 
                         understand a comm packet is incoming 
                         from Mars One Base Camp, so you may 
                         find this interesting.

               He opens the doors, ushering his flock inside.

               INT. MMCR. DAY

               The ambassadors enter, oohing and ahhing over the impressive 
               array of gadgetry and personnel, and especially over the big 
               screen. Some of them start taking souvenir snaphots. The 
               NIGERIAN AMBASSADOR turns to Beck, whispering curiously.

                                     AMBASSADOR
                         That man over there. He's in charge?

               BECK FOLLOWS HIS GLANCE TO

               MCCONNELL

               Who is surrounded by a KNOT OF TECHNICIANS, to whom he is 
               giving quiet, precise instructions. They hover, then depart, 
               like so many eager bees.

               BECK

               Smiles indulgently at the ambassador's misunderstanding.

                                     BECK
                         No, actually, that's Jim McConnell, 
                         the CAPCOM. Our voice link to the 
                         astronauts? Jim's been with the manned 
                         Mars program since its inception. 
                         One of our real pioneers.

                                     AMBASSADOR
                         Will he be going to Mars, too?

                                     BECK
                         Ah, no. This is as close as he gets.

               ON THE SCREEN

               Luke and his crew have finished eating, and are clearing 
               away their dishes and leftovers.

                                     LUKE
                         ...anyway, that's about it. We'll 
                         send another packet when we get back.

               Cote clears her throat, gives Luke a look. The others can 
               barely conceal their grins.

                                     LUKE
                         Oh, right. One more thing. Today is 
                         a very special day for a good friend 
                         of ours, and I know he's there right 
                         now.

               McConnell looks at the screen, worried. What's Luke up to?

                                     LUKE
                         Now, he hates it when any fuss is 
                         made, so I won't mention his name...

               A look of relief comes over McConnell.

                                     LUKE
                         ...because the last thing in the 
                         world I'd ever want to do is embarrass 
                         someone like Jim McConnell.

               McConnell winces -- Dear God, no -- as, on the screen, Kirov 
               appears from OFF CAMERA holding a cupcake with a burning 
               candle stuck in it, and the Mars One crew starts SINGING 
               "Happy Birthday" to him. Loudly. And very off-key.

                                     LUKE
                         C'mon, you Micker weasels, sing!

               Soon most everyone in MMCR is singing along -- even some of 
               the jolly ambassadors -- with the noticeable exception of 
               Beck, who stiffens unhappily. McConnell is mortified.

                                     LUKE
                              (sings a line, then, 
                              to CAMERA:)
                         Hey, Ray! Take a look at him! Is he 
                         all red with one of those fake "I'm-
                         a-good-sport" grins?

               Beck looks over at McConnell, who indeed is red in the face 
               with a fake "I'm-a-good-sport" grin.

                                     LUKE
                         And hey, you guys, check out Ray! 
                         Does he have on one of his "This-
                         wasn't-in-my-mission-plan" faces?

               Indeed, Beck's smile is thin, sour, disapproving.

                                     LUKE
                         Nothing you can do about it, Ray! 
                         We're a hundred million miles away!

               Luke and the crew finish singing the song. Luke raises the 
               cupcake in a toast.

                                     LUKE
                         Happy Birthday, Jimbo! Make a wish!

               He and his crew lean in, blow out the candle. They laugh and 
               applaud, then wave goodbye.

                                     LUKE
                         Catch you again soon. Take care, 
                         buddy. End of transmission.

               Luke reaches out, turns OFF the CAMERA, and the display screen 
               GOES BLACK.

               Beck turns, his gaze locking with McConnell's. He's annoyed, 
               as if this violation of protocol were somehow McConnell's 
               fault. McConnell returns his stare coolly.

               EXT. MARS. THE FACE. PLAINS OF CYDONIA. DAY

               Cote stands by a display screen mounted on the rover. Kirov 
               has a big radar gun on a tripod, pointing at the mountain. 
               Luke turns to Cote.

                                     LUKE
                         Well? What's under there?

                                     COTE
                              (puzzled)
                         Je ne sais pas. I... I think there's 
                         something wrong with the equipment.

                                     LUKE
                         What?

                                     COTE
                         I mean, it can't be right. It says... 
                         it says there's metal under there.

               Luke doesn't understand. He walks up to look at the display 
               screen.

                                     COTE
                              (points)
                         There's ten, twelve meters of rubble 
                         and sand, and then... solid metal.

                                     LUKE
                         That doesn't make any sense. You're 
                         reading a vein of ore.

                                     COTE
                              (shakes her head)
                         No. It's under the whole mountain.

               The deep pulsing tone continues. Luke frowns.

                                     LUKE
                         Nick, could the problem with the 
                         antenna be interfering?

                                     WILLIS
                         Could be.

                                     LUKE
                              (to Cote and Kirov)
                         Try it closer and up the power. I'll 
                         watch the screen.

               INT. MMCR. DAY

               McConnell is taping an audio message to be sent to Mars as 
               the rest of MMCR looks on. Beck is gone. So are the U. N. 
               ambassadors.

                                     MCCONNELL
                         Ah, we're all pretty stoked about 
                         that formation you spotted, Mars 
                         One. The folks in the geology and 
                         hydrology back rooms are going over 
                         your images and comparing them to 
                         every photomap they've got.

               EXT. MARS. THE FACE. PLAINS OF CYDONIA. DAY

               Cote and Kirov are close to the foot of the mountain, 
               resetting the radar gun on its tripod. The deep vibrating 
               tone continues.

               Luke is some distance away, by the rover. He looks at Willis, 
               who's still working on the rover's antenna.

                                     LUKE
                         Nick, how we coming on that antenna?

                                     WILLIS
                         Goin' as fast as I can, boss.

               Cote and Kirov are having some trouble with the switches on 
               the radar gun. They turn towards Luke and Willis.

                                     KIROV
                         Hey, Nick. Come show me how stupid I 
                         am. I can't get this to work.

               Willis looks at Luke. Luke nods -- Go help them. Willis starts 
               towards the radar gun.

               INT. MMCR. DAY

               McConnell is handed a slip of paper, glances at it.

                                     MCCONNELL
                         Medical wants me to remind you that 
                         you're three days late on your blood 
                         tests. I know they're a bore, but 
                         you've got to get them done, or 
                         else... or else I don't know what. 
                         Just do them, okay?

               EXT. MARS. THE FACE. PLAINS OF CYDONIA. DAY

               Willis, Cote, and Kirov get the radar gun up and running.

                                     KIROV
                         All set here, chief.

               Luke sidles over to the display screen on the rover.

                                     LUKE
                         Okay. Crank up the juice and let's 
                         see what's in this sucker.

               INT. MMCR. DAY

               McConnell checks over his clipboard list of updates.

                                     MCCONNELL
                         I think that's about it for business. 
                         But on a personal note, be advised 
                         that, ah, none of you can sing worth 
                         a damn.

               LAUGHTER in the MMCR.

               EXT. MARS. THE FACE. PLAINS OF CYDONIA. DAY

               Luke watches the screen on the rover, as, by the mound...

               KIROV

               Flips a switch on the radar gun, then swivels its muzzle 
               slowly across the near slope of the mountain. We hear and 
               feel the radar signal. The immediate result is that the 
               pulsing tone we've been hearing suddenly stops.

               LUKE

               Looks up from the display screen. A puzzled expression.

                                     LUKE
                         Why did that stop?

               A split-second later, he gets his answer. We hear a WHOOSH, 
               a mighty rushing of wind, as

               A GIGANTIC, TRANSLUCENT CYLINDER

               Starts to swirl and rise, straight up from the top or the 
               mountain, at its center. As it swirls, the cylinder picks up 
               debris -- pebbles, sand -- from the sediment-encrusted surface 
               of the slopes.

               THE FOUR ASTRONAUTS

               Stare up at this spectacle, awed. A cyclone? Some kind of 
               energy wave? They have no idea. At the moment they're too 
               fascinated to even be scared.

               TILTING UP - FROM THEIR POV

               We see the whirling cylinder rise, higher and higher, 
               perfectly straight, until in just moments it's as tall as a 
               skyscraper. As it rises, it gains speed and power, narrowing 
               at its top into a conical vortex. It's sucking up so much 
               dirt, so many rocks -- even small boulders now -- that the 
               accumulating debris begins to darken its swirling, translucent 
               outer "skin".

               THE ASTRONAUTS

               Exchange amazed glances. Can't believe their eyes...

               INT. MMCR. DAY

               McConnell still hovers by the microphone.

                                     MCCONNELL
                         Honestly, Luke, if you guys don't 
                         have anything better to do with your 
                         time, I can make some suggestions to 
                         mission medical. There are worse 
                         things than blood tests.

               LAUGHTER and GROANS from the staff in MMCR.

               EXT. MARS. THE FACE. PLAINS OF CYDONIA. DAY

               Luke, still staring in fascination, becomes aware of sand 
               and pebbles flashing past his helmet. From behind. He turns.

               SAND PATTERS AGAINST HIS FACEPLATE

               As the nearby landscape BLURS. The vacuuming effect is 
               becoming more general across the area. More violent.

               LUKE IS ALARMED

               And the spell is broken. He keys his throat mike, his lips 
               moving, but no sound can be heard over the ROARING WIND. He 
               waves his arms, motioning for the others to back away, towards 
               the rover. Wind whips at their EVA suits as they obey him, 
               retreating.

               Luke, backing away himself, is afraid to take his eyes off 
               the cylinder.

               Then he sees that one man -- Willis -- hasn't moved. In fact 
               he's busily snapping photographs of the cylinder. Luke hurries 
               over to him, tugs his sleeve.

               WILLIS LOWERS HIS CAMERA

               But still stares up, transfixed, like a man face to face 
               with a cobra. Luke follows the young astronaut's frightened 
               gaze, and his own eyes widen as he sees

               THE TOP OF THE VORTEX

               Beginning to tilt down, then coil sideways. Suddenly they're 
               looking into the huge open "mouth" of it, as sand and rocks 
               fly into the swirling darkness...

               The monstrous, gaping maw slithers down over the rim of the 
               mountain, turning this way, then that. Seeking them. And 
               then, with horrifying precision, it locks in on the little 
               group of astronauts. And lunges towards them...

               EXT. MARS. THE FACE. PLAINS OF CYDONIA. DAY

               Luke and Willis turn, running as hard as they can towards 
               the rover. But the suction is so great, it's as if they're 
               held back by wires.

               The ground itself is SHAKING, RUMBLING, as earthquakes begin 
               to open fissures across the plain. The ROAR of the vortex, 
               the GROANING of the earth, are like an onrushing freight 
               train...

               AHEAD OF THEM

               In the maelstrom of flying debris, they can barely make out 
               Cote and Kirov, still retreating, leaning back with all their 
               strength against the suction, while staring up, aghast.

               Suddenly a hurtling rock, the size of a basketball, smashes 
               into Cote's helmet from behind, crushing it and killing her 
               instantly. Blood sprays into the wind, immediately 
               crystallizing, in the sub-zero atmosphere, into red pellets...

               LUKE, HORRIFIED, FLINGS HIS ARM UP

               As bloody hail patters against his faceplate and forearm. An 
               instant later he sees

               KIROV

               Snatched up by the wind, then swept past him, in a terrifying 
               blur, arms and legs flailing, mouth open in a silent scream 
               as he vanishes...

               THE GROUND AT LUKE'S FEET

               Abruptly opens, and he slides into a fissure. Scrabbling 
               frantically with his gloved hands, he manages to momentarily 
               arrest his fall, gripping the edge of the fault line, with 
               his helmet and one elbow thrust over its lip. The air is 
               almost solidly choked with debris, deadly boulders bound 
               over him, and torrents of cascading sand are burying him 
               alive...

               CLOSE ON LUKE

               Barely conscious, as he watches, for a horrifying final 
               instant, as...

               HIS LAST CREWMAN, WILLIS

               Is sucked bodily into the black maw of the vortex, spinning 
               and tumbling like a rag doll...

               CLOSE ON WILLIS'S FACE

               His features grotesquely distorted by the forces tearing at 
               him, before suddenly his faceplate is sprayed with blood, 
               and...

               DISTANT ANGLE - LUKE'S POV

               Willis's spacesuit explodes, his entire body disintegrating 
               into a million bits, which instantly disappear into the 
               hellish maelstrom. And then that maelstrom itself, just as 
               abruptly...

               STOPS. Vanishes.

               There is an instant, ringing SILENCE, as awesome in its own 
               way as the roaring storm itself had been...

               WIDE ANGLE

               On the plain, as the last pebbles, released from suction, 
               pitter down, bouncing. Swirls of dust and sand drift away, 
               settling gently. The harsh orange landscape is once again 
               calm, peaceful.

               And then, from the direction of the nearby mountain, we hear 
               another sound: the deep bass pulsing rumble returns.

               INT. MMCR. DAY

               As McConnell finishes his message to Luke.

                                     MCCONNELL
                         Oh, and I talked to Debra. She and 
                         Bobby are doing fine. Said to tell 
                         you, they're, ah, they're on their 
                         "third time through the book, page --
                              (glances at a note)
                         -- page 125." They send their love 
                         and say take care of yourself. Same 
                         from us here, buddy. Till next time, 
                         then. End of transmission.

               EXT. MARS. THE FACE. PLAINS OF CYDONIA. DAY

               MOVING ANGLE, the CAMERA EXPLORING ground zero, as the bass, 
               pulsing rumble continues...

               WE PASS the Rover, canted sideways into a little crater, 
               with its canopy missing, one axle fractured, but miraculously 
               still with all four wheels...

               WE PASS faithful little ARES-8, lying on its side, partially 
               crushed under a boulder. It gives a final, pitiful WHINE, 
               its video snout slowly extending, then dies. And finally we 
               come to the area where the fissure had been, and see

               THE FISSURE HAS BEEN FILLED IN

               Leaving only a slender crease of umber sand. No sign of Luke. 
               The pulsing rumble continues, over, as we see

               EXT. AERIAL VIEW. DAY

               An extraordinary sight, seen from high in the air, looking 
               back down. Staring up at us from the bottom of a shallow 
               crater, scoured clean of its aeons of accumulated silt and 
               rubble, is a structure resembling a vast humanoid Face.

               The surface is gleaming white, apparently metallic. The 
               features are suggested by intricately interlocking planes, 
               slopes, ramps. The "eyes" -- hatches of some kind? -- are 
               closed, and the overall expression is eerily calm, but 
               terrible in its power, like some ancient tribal mask.

               We see the Face clearly for only a few beats before thick, 
               scudding clouds OBSCURE it, but the deep, pulsing rumble 
               continues, low and insistent...

                                                               DISSOLVE TO:

               INT. MARS TWO (DOCKED). COCKPIT. DAY

               We're inside the Mars Two spacecraft, which is still in its 
               docked position alongside the Space Station.

               Woody Blake, wearing a NASA jumpsuit, floats up into the 
               cockpit in Zero-G, studying a thick manual.

                                     WOODY
                              (reads)
                         "Problem: Hatch door malfunction, 
                         backup power fail, manual override 
                         fail. Solution: Replace circuit 
                         breaker 907B."

               He straps into the pilot's seat, staring at an electrical 
               junction box at one end of the console.

                                     WOODY
                         Okay... Piece of cake.

               He swings open the housing, revealing a bewildering tangle 
               of fuses and wires. He sighs heavily, as Terri drifts up 
               beside him, also in a jumpsuit, and straps into the co-pilot's 
               seat.

                                     WOODY
                         God, who dreams up these nightmares?

                                     TERRI
                         Don't try to change the subject.

                                     WOODY
                         I'm not! We're talking about your 
                         sister's wedding, right?

                                     TERRI
                         Very funny. We're talking about 
                         dancing lessons. Before my sister's 
                         wedding.

                                     WOODY
                         Honey, do you mind? I've got a 
                         catastrophic power failure here.

               He peers into the housing with exaggerated concern. But 
               Terri's not so easily sidetracked.

                                     TERRI
                         Woody, we're a married couple. Would 
                         it kill you to invite me out on the 
                         floor once in awhile?

                                     WOODY
                         I danced with you at our wedding.

                                     TERRI
                         I'm not talking about shuffling your 
                         feet around while you grab my butt. 
                         I mean real dancing. Cha-cha, rhumba, 
                         jitterbug --

                                     WOODY
                         Face it, honey, some couples dance, 
                         some go to Mars. That's life.

                                     TERRI
                         I'm serious. We've got two more months 
                         in this training rotation, but just 
                         as soon as we get home, we're starting 
                         lessons. If we never dance, people 
                         will think there's something wrong.

                                     WOODY
                         If they see me dance, they'll know 
                         there's something wrong.

               Reaching past him, she pulls out the required breaker. As he 
               reacts, surprised, she smiles, despite her exasperation.

                                     TERRI
                         You are such a lug.

               Overhead, an intercom CRACKLES. We hear PHIL.

                                     PHIL'S VOICE
                         Cockpit, this is Control.

                                     TERRI
                         Control, this is Cockpit.

                                     PHIL'S VOICE
                         Uh, Terri, they want us all back in 
                         the Station. Report to Micker.

                                     TERRI
                         Who says report to Micker?

                                     PHIL'S VOICE
                         The little men who live in my head.

                                     WOODY
                         Phil, c'mon! We just started this 
                         drill.

                                     PHIL
                         Woody, it was Ray Beck. He told me 
                         to round up the team. Now.

               Woody and Terri exchange a worried look. What's wrong?

               OMITTED

               Sequence omitted from original script.

               INT. SPACE STATION. MMCR. DAY

               A crisis atmosphere prevails. The big room is more crowded 
               than we've ever seen it, with ENGINEERS and MANAGERS hurrying 
               by, huddling in tense, conferring knots, or muttering 
               feverishly into microphones.

               On the center screen, a giant image of Mars. A frantic flow 
               of green numbers crawls above and below this, and the site 
               of the Mars One Base Camp is marked in blinking red.

               WOODY AND HIS CREW

               Are staring up at this screen, appalled. McConnell and Beck 
               stand nearby, briefing them.

                                     BECK
                         Then, at 1417, the X-band continuous 
                         data stream from Mars went silent. 
                         All data -- med, environmental, 
                         everything -- suddenly stopped. While 
                         we were trying to figure out what 
                         the hell went wrong, we got a signal 
                         from the folks at the Large Array at 
                         Soccoro.

                                     MCCONNELL
                         At the same moment we lost the data 
                         stream, they picked up an intense 
                         burst of energy from Mars.

                                     WOODY
                         What do you mean, "intense"?

                                     MCCONNELL
                              (hesitates)
                         Catastrophic.

               Looks are exchanged among the Mars Two crew.

                                     TERRI
                         What about the crew?

                                     BECK
                         The level of energy in the pulse... 
                         didn't seem survivable.

                                     WOODY
                         What about the REMO? It went into 
                         Mars orbit last week. Maybe that 
                         could give us some clue.

                                     MCCONNELL
                         Good thinking, Woody. That's just 
                         what we tried next.

               He leans over, punches buttons on a keyboard.

               ON THE CENTER SCREEN

               An orange dot can be seen in its orbital ellipse around Mars, 
               leaving a glowing electronic trail. This dot gets isolated 
               in a viewing box, then enlarged and rotated into the computer-
               animated image of a small, ugly, industrial-looking unmanned 
               cargo craft, labelled "REMO."

                                     MCCONNELL

                         there was something else. The REMO'S 
                         computer contained an uplink message -- 
                         a very faint, highly distorted 
                         transmission from Mars One Base Camp.

                         words, but we've got a long way to 
                         go.

               Black for a moment, then static. Out of this static comes a 
               faint image of Luke, sitting alone at the Hab kitchen table. 
               He looks awful -- dried blood on his face, bloodshot eyes. 
               The image is blurry, heavily streaked, and most of what he 
               says is lost in waves of static.

               At her desk. TWO CO-WORKERS are trying to comfort her. One

                         Luke must be in pretty bad shape if 
                         he hasn't blasted out of there in 
                         the Earth Return Vehicle. That thing's 
                         designed so even one crew member 
                         could fly it back to Earth.

                         couldn't get home. That energy pulse 
                         would've fried the ERV'S computers.

                         Well, so far our modelling says it 
                         should be in pretty good shape.

                         software to Mars. As fast as we can.

               McConnell looks at him, nods. They're on the same wavelength. 
               But Beck is more cautious.

                         Right, but meanwhile, we've gotta be 
                         working up a mission plan.

                         Luke may already be dead. And even 
                         if he's not, it's doubtful he's going 
                         to be able to transmit again. So we

                         land until you were almost there.

                         through the solar system. It could

                         Good idea Phil. If SIMA tells us 
                         Luke hasn't survived and it's not 
                         safe to land, we swing around Mars 
                         and come right back home.

                                     MCCONNELL
                         Yes. We can design the mission to 
                         have a free return capability. It's 
                         a long trip, but if you don't land 
                         it's the best option.

                         We're getting ahead of ourselves. 
                         You're forgetting the bigger problem.

                         The orbits are all wrong. Our first 
                         decent launch window is almost eight 
                         months from now.

                         But we can go earlier and get there 
                         faster if we reconfigure the payload 
                         for extra fuel. We've modelled that, 
                         Ray. I've modelled it.

                         On paper, yeah. But those stresses 
                         have never been tested in space.

               A tense beat. Again we sense the test of wills between these 
               two tough-minded men, once good friends.

                         I know the protocols for a Mars 
                         Recovery Mission better than anybody, 
                         because I helped design them. And 
                         I'm saying these guys can do it.

               A pause with beck weighing the odds. He looks at Woody.

                         0800 tomorrow. Then I'll put it in 
                         the works.

               He looks at Woody, Phil and Terri, who are just as eager.

                         Let's get to work.

               McConnell exits followed by Terri and Phil, but as Beck starts 
               out, too, Woody stops him.

                         I couldn't trust him!

               Beck and Woody stare at each other. A long tense beat.

                                     BECK
                              (his voice softer)
                         Not in a crisis... I'm sorry Woody, 
                         but Jim lost his edge. Are you gonna 
                         stand there and tell me Jim McConnell 
                         is the same man he was two years 
                         ago? You want me to bet four more 
                         lives on that?

               This stops Woody, just for a beat. Then makes him press on 
               harder, with even greater intensity.

                                     WOODY
                         When Maggie died, yeah, it knocked 
                         the shit out of him. It knocked the 
                         hell out of all of us. But you know 
                         and I know that he's still the best 
                         we've got. He and Maggie wrote the 
                         book on Mars. He's got more hours in 
                         the sims than the rest of us put 
                         together. Ray, we can do this. Give 
                         me McConnell as co-pilot, and we 
                         will bring Luke home. And that's a 
                         promise.

               Beck looks back at him, his features taunt.

               INT. SPACE STATION. MMCR. DAY

               Woody, Terri, and Phil stand at the edge of the big control 
               room, waiting and watching, in a tense silence, as

               IN THE DISTANCE, FROM THEIR POV

               Beck and McConnell are huddled together at the CAPCOM's 
               console. Other personnel have moved away, giving them room. 
               Both men are seated, leaning forward, with McConnell listening 
               intently, while Beck does most of the talking, very quietly. 
               After a moment McConnell looks up in surprise. His eyes search 
               the room till they find

               WOODY'S FACE

               Woody looks back at him, nods: C'mon, man. Take it.

               MCCONNELL'S OWN FACE

               Is a study in conflicting emotions. But after a moment he 
               masters his feelings, turns back toward Beck. A few more 
               quiet words are exchanged, then Beck offers his hand. 
               McConnell hesitates, then shakes it. Both men rise, and 
               McConnell turns again to look towards

               WOODY, TERRI, AND PHIL

               Who react with relief, glad that he's now a part of their 
               crew. Woody grins, giving him a thumb's up.

               CLOSE ON MCCONNELL'S FACE

               As he smiles. Then he starts towards them, with a new energy 
               in his step, a new sense of confidence and purpose. And as 
               he WALKS TOWARDS US, PASSING OUT OF FRAME...

               EXT. DEEP SPACE. MARS RECOVERY. DAY

               An infinite canopy of stars. After a moment, some of them 
               begin to be BLOTTED OUT as

               A SPACESHIP

               Glides INTO VIEW. "MARS RECOVERY" (formerly Mars Two) looks 
               much like its sister craft on Mars: a conical cockpit mounted 
               above a "tuna can" crew Hab module.

               SUPER TITLE: "MARS RECOVERY. MISSION DAY 172."

               The entire lower deck forms a segmented section of the hull 
               that rotates on bearings to provide artificial gravity; we 
               see window ports spinning past, then an American flag emblem.

               Behind this lower deck, in an extending network of struts, 
               like the abdomen of a dragonfly, are the three huge round 
               PROPELLANT TANKS. Then vast, delicate-looking rectangular 
               SOLAR PANELS, which sweep out to either side of the ship; 
               these also bear the dish of the earth-pointing HI-GAIN 
               ANTENNA. And finally comes the great mass of the ENGINE BELLS, 
               housed within a curving AEROSHELL; three hatches in the 
               aeroshell can open to allow the main thrusters to fire through 
               for a mid-course burn.

               CAMERA DRIFTS CLOSER

               To the forward section of the ship, APPROACHING a viewport 
               in the EVA airlock chamber. Inside, we can see Phil leaning 
               forward, concentrating on some task...

               OMITTED

               Sequence omitted from original script.

               INT. EVA AIRLOCK. DAY. A BUNCH OF M&MS

               Are floating in mid-air, forming an intricate 3D pattern. In 
               the EVA airlock, it's zero G.

               Phil, strapped into a chair by a galley counter, is just 
               completing this weightless puzzle by placing a final blue 
               M&M. He looks bored, sluggish. In the b.g., Terri is hunched 
               over a microscope.

               McConnell emerges from the core tunnel, behind them, coming 
               up from the lower Hab, then pushes off from the ladder, 
               floating towards Phil. He grins, admiring Phil's obsessive 
               handiwork.

                                     MCCONNELL
                         What's that?

                                     PHIL
                         That... is the exact chemical 
                         composition of my ideal woman.

                                     MCCONNELL
                         Used to be.

               He plucks out a couple of the M&Ms as he drifts by.

                                     PHIL
                         Hey!

               McConnell grins, snacking on the M&Ms.

                                     MCCONNELL
                         Now what is it?

               Phil looks sadly at his floating model.

                                     PHIL
                         A frog.

               McConnell and Terri laugh as Phil starts scarfing down the 
               rest of the M&Ms. Swooping at them with both hands.

                                     TERRI
                         I guess now we have our answer to 
                         the effects of long-term 
                         interplanetary travel on the human 
                         mind. The answer is Phil.

                                     MCCONNELL
                              (smiles)
                         I'm gonna get an update on SIMA. It 
                         should be just about close enough to 
                         start capturing some surface images.

               He's drifted to another short ladder, and now grabs it, starts 
               up to the cockpit, atop the Hab.

               INT. COCKPIT. DAY

               As McConnell appears in the cockpit, he sees Woody by the 
               forward instrumentation panel, looking at a monitor. The 
               cockpit is also zero G.

                                     MCCONNELL
                         Hey, Skip.

                                     WOODY
                         Take a look.

               McConnell pulls himself forward.

               ANGLE ON MONITOR

               MARS completely fills the screen. Surface details are clearly 
               visible. Something is moving down there, an amorphous brown 
               swirl.

               INT. COCKPIT. DAY

                                     WOODY
                         What do you make of that?

                                     MCCONNELL
                         Dust storm. Southern hemisphere, 
                         coming from the east... Big fella, 
                         too.

                                     WOODY
                         Headed for Chryse Planitia.

                                     MCCONNELL
                         Yup. Could get a little hairy just 
                         about landing time...

               McConnell pulls back from the screen, looks at Woody.

                                     WOODY
                         We'll have to be ready to move fast. 
                         Maybe even advance our ETA. Those 
                         things can cover the whole planet, 
                         and last up to a year.

               A beat. They both hope he's wrong.

                                     MCCONNELL
                         When does SIMA do her fly-by?

                                     WOODY
                         Tomorrow morning, about 0600. That's 
                         when we find out whether we came all 
                         this way for nothing.

               They exchange a glance. Woody's right, but the thought is 
               too terrible to dwell on. McConnell looks back at Mars.

                                     MCCONNELL
                              (softly)
                         My money's on Luke.

               INT. MARS RECOVERY. EVA AIRLOCK. NEXT MORNING

               CLOSE ON A DIGITAL CLOCK

               Just turning over to read "0545."

               TERRI

               Pulls her gaze away from these numbers. Judging from her 
               redrimmed eyes, it's been a long, anxious night. Restlessly, 
               looking to distract herself, she reaches for a test tube of 
               blood, straps it into a centrifuge, sets it spinning. Nearby 
               is her electron microscope.

               MCCONNELL (LOWER HAB)

               Lies on his cot in his own cubicle, with the door closed. 
               The lower hab has artificial gravity (AG) and McConnell can 
               move normally. Hands behind his head, he stares at his bureau.

               PHOTO OF A WOMAN

               Rests there, in its leather travel frame. Beautiful, smiling, 
               dark-haired: MAGGIE MCCONNELL. Her face glows with 
               intelligence and energy.

               MCCONNELL

               Shifts his eyes. The clock on his bulkhead reads "0546."

               PHIL (LOWER HAB)

               Stands in the communal bathroom, still in his pajamas, a 
               towel around his shoulders, brushing his teeth. He glances 
               at another digital clock, which reads "0547." Shakes his 
               head impatiently. He looks back into the mirror, then is 
               surprised to hear MUSIC lilting incongruously over the 
               loudspeakers: Elvis Presley's "Blue Moon."

               INT. EVA AIRLOCK. DAY

               Phil floats in through the connecting tunnel, then stops 
               himself at a handhold. He grins, charmed by the sight of

               WOODY AND TERRI DANCING

               Like a weightless Fred and Ginger. Woody is surprisingly 
               good at this. Enthusiastic, unselfconscious.

               He sweeps Terri gallantly about the little cabin, pushing 
               off from every handy surface, even guiding her into some 
               passable twirls and dips. She laughs, shaking her head.

                                     PHIL
                         What brought this on?

                         Zero-G. My last chance to be graceful. 
                         Once we're in Mars gravity, it's 
                         back to shuffling my feet and grabbing 
                         her butt.

                                     TERRI
                         I'll take what I can get.

               She grins, kisses his ear, as Phil turns, sees

               MCCONNELL

               Who has now arrived, is also watching the dancing couple. A 
               twinge of sadness crosses his features. But when his eyes 
               meet Phil's, he shakes off the feeling and manages a smile: 
               Aren't they something?

               Over the music, they hear a CHIRP from the SHIP'S COMPUTER, 
               then an announcement.

                                     COMPUTER
                         Attention. Incoming packet.

               They all look at each other. This is it! Woody spins over to 
               a console, shuts off the music.

                                     MCCONNELL
                         It's SIMA.

               INT. COCKPIT. DAY. MINUTES LATER

               The crew is gathered around a display screen. The lights are 
               dim, reflecting up off their faces. By their expressions, we 
               can tell the news is not good.

               CLOSE ON THE SCREEN

               It's a color, high-resolution satellite image of the Mars 
               One Base Camp. Ghostly, dust-covered. No signs of life.

                         Looks deserted.

                         It's still standing, though. So is 
                         the ERV. And look, there's the 
                         greenhouse.

                         We know Luke survived for at least a 
                         few hours. Question is, are there 
                         any signs of recent activity?

               They all scan the screen. Phil spots something.

                                     PHIL
                         There.

               He grabs a stylus and touches the screen. They all look. 
               CLOSE ON THE SCREEN

               Using where the stylus touches the screen as the focal point, 
               the image enlarges. THREE LONGISH DIRT PILES appear, some 
               fifty meters from the hab.

                                     PHIL
                         What the hell are those?

               McConnell gets it first.

                         Graves.

               They all realize he's right. They sit back, stunned. But 
               then Phil has another thought.

                                     PHIL
                         Hold on. There's only three. That 
                         means --

                                     TERRI
                         Phil --

                                     PHIL
                         It means Luke must still be --

                         No. It just means there was nobody 
                         left to bury him.

               This quiets everyone for a long moment.

                         Go to the disaster site.

               Phil uses the stylus to bring MORE IMAGES into view. The 
               frame moves over the terrain in the direction of the Face, 
               first in SWIFT BLURS, then slowing. Scattered rock debris 
               come into view. The IMAGE ARRIVES where the mountain was, 
               and they see...

               Debris in every direction, NEAT SPIRALS of it now, dropped 
               uncannily into place, like some massive earth sculpture. As 
               if - but this makes no sense -- it had been swirled towards 
               a LARGE CRATER. The crater itself is a perfect circle. They 
               FOCUS on the CENTER OF THE CRATER, but the image gets 
               distorted by STATIC.

               Phil tweaks the stylus, but the image won't clear up.

                         see how an earthquake, six months 
                         ago, could give us this kind of 
                         distortion.

                         That was no quake.

               He leans closer, staring intently.

                         Then what the hell was it?

               McConnell shakes his head. But his every sense is engaged; 
               he's like a predator just sighting his prey for the first 
               time. We see in his eyes an utter determination to unlock 
               this secret.

               Mars Recovery is speeding ever closer to Mars, which now 
               looms large, a dusty red mysterious sphere.

               more, have crowded in behind him, and we sense their great 
               hopefulness and high spirits; the whole team's triumph is 
               tantalizingly close now.

                         We're going to continue analyzing

                         the problem is with those images. 
                         Frankly, we're just as stumped as 
                         you guys, but we'll keep on it.
                              (glancing around)
                         We agree that the evidence of the

                         ground search is advisable. Be aware 
                         there are little sand storms kicking 
                         up near Mars One Base, but the big 
                         one you spotted is turning south. It 
                         shouldn't be a factor.

               Beck takes a breath, smiles.

               hesitating, then feeds it into his computer. Immediately his

               HOME VIDEO OF A PARTY

               An impromptu celebration, a bunch of friends gathered in a 
               semi-darkened living room. The footage is HANDHELD, a bit 
               jerky. People have paper plates of food, beers in hand, 
               everyone is a little tipsy. Debra is there, Terri, Phil, 
               Cote, Kirov, others. They're watching a STILL PHOTO SEQUENCE, 
               shown on a large screen TV, with commentary by Luke and Woody.

               THE FIRST PHOTO

               Is of a small boy (YOUNG MCCONNELL) in his pajamas, kneeling 
               in front of a Christmas tree. He's grinning ecstatically as 
               he holds up a brand new model rocket.

                         Jim's first ship was seriously 
                         underpowered...

               LAUGHTER at this. Some AD LIB CRACKS about the painfully bad 
               haircut and the pajamas.

               THE SECOND PHOTO

               Is of a gawky-looking teenage girl (YOUNG MAGGIE), standing 
               on a porch at night, posing a bit self-consciously by a 
               telescope on its tripod.

                         Maggie was always starstruck...

               More LAUGHTER, plus some digs about the nerdy eyeglasses and 
               braces. VIDEOCAMERA swings around the room, REVEALING the 
               adult JIM and MAGGIE. They sit side by side on the hearth, 
               leaning into each other, looking very happy.

                                     MAGGIE
                         I'll get you guys for this.

               More LAUGHTER. Everyone's having a great time. The VIDEOCAMERA 
               swings back towards the TV screen as

               THIRD PHOTO APPEARS

               Jim and Maggie, young adults, standing on the wing of a 
               fighter jet. Both in Air Force flight suits, helmets in hand. 
               Suntanned, cocky, flashing radiant smiles.

                         flight."

               GROANS and LAUGHTER from the offscreen watchers.

                         After that, NASA training was tough. 
                         All Jim could think about was 
                         exploring a heavenly body. More ribald 
                         LAUGHTER, as

               FOURTH PHOTO APPEARS

               Maggie and Jim, tethered together, floating weightlessly in 
               space suits.

                         on a short leash. Until...

               A FIFTH PHOTO

               Maggie, who wears a white bridal gown.

               ANGLE ON MCCONNELL, IN THE PRESENT

               As he smiles at this, hearing the renewed LAUGHTER and CHEERS, 
               the AD-LIBBED DIGS from the video. He becomes aware he's not 
               alone. He looks up.

               WOODY

               Stands in the doorway of his cubicle. Their eyes meet. They 
               both smile, turning back to the video. Remembering.

               IN THE VIDEO

               Luke and Woody have stepped forward, INTO SHOT, standing at 
               the sides of the TV, where the last photo lingers. Luke waves 
               his hands, hushing everybody.

                                     LUKE
                         Today we celebrate a new chapter in

                         historic one.

               Both men raise champagne flutes.

                                     WOODY
                         Let's hear it for the newly-announced 
                         Captain and Co-Captain of Mars One. 
                         To Jim and Maggie!

               CHEERS at this, repeats of "Jim and Maggie!" Luke grins, 
               giving a little signal, and we see

               A FINAL PHOTO

               Of Maggie in Jim's arms, both of them in goofy tropical 
               vacation wear, smiling. Evidently a photo taken in the surf 
               somewhere, but here it's been crudely superimposed onto a 
               Martian landscape. Laughter greets this unlikely image.

                                     LUKE
                         When you guys land, it'll prove once 
                         and for all there's no intelligent 
                         life on Mars.

               More hoots of LAUGHTER, CATCALLS, but Maggie jumps in to 
               protest, as the VIDEOCAMERA SWINGS TO HER AND JIM. Terri 
               sits nearby.

                                     MAGGIE
                         Hey, c'mon, what if I'm right?

                         started! Somebody put on some music!

                                     MAGGIE
                         It's our sister planet!

                         Oh brother!

               LAUGHTER at this, and Maggie joins in. She's a good sport.

                                     TERRI
                         Maggie, why does this have to be 
                         about us? Mars is a great opportunity 
                         for pure science.

                                     MAGGIE
                         We'll do the science. And we'll do 
                         it very well. That's what we've 
                         trained for. But what if there's 
                         more...? In all our myths, in every 
                         human culture, Mars has always held 
                         a special attraction. What if that 
                         means something? Only we don't 
                         understand it yet...

               The mood of the party is changing, as everyone is caught up 
               in Maggie's spell. She has a radiant simplicity. The VIDEO 
               CAMERA DRIFTS IN ON HER; we are caught up, too.

                                     MAGGIE
                         The universe is not chaos. It's 
                         connection. Life reaches out for 
                         life...

               She looks at McConnell, smiles. He takes her hand.

                                     MAGGIE
                         This is what we were born for, isn't 
                         it? To stand on a new world, and 
                         look beyond it to the next one. It's 
                         who we are.

               A silence; the guests are enchanted by the purity of her 
               passion. She smiles, suddenly self-conscious. She hadn't 
               meant to get so carried away.

               IN THE PRESENT - MCCONNELL

               Reaches out, gently taps the keyboard, FREEZING the screen. 
               He and Woody, their eyes shining, stare at her image. A beat.

                                     WOODY
                         You okay?

                                     MCCONNELL
                         Yeah. I'm good to go.

               Woody glances at him. It's true. Rather than being saddened, 
               McConnell seems to have taken on new strength. A renewed 
               sense of wonder.

                                     MCCONNELL
                         After all these years... Can you 
                         believe it? Tomorrow we'll be standing 
                         on Mars.

               Woody nods, smiles.

                                     WOODY
                         You know what? She may have been 
                         right.

               McConnell looks at him.

                                     WOODY
                         If that wasn't a quake down there, 
                         then something else caused it. Or 
                         planned it... You're thinking the 
                         same thing.

                                     MCCONNELL
                         It's never been out of my mind.

                                     WOODY
                         Jesus. You realize what this means?

               McConnell nods. Looks again at Maggie's face on the screen.

                                     MCCONNELL
                         She knew, Woody. She was the only 
                         one of us that ever thought there 
                         might be something down there.

                                     WOODY
                         Yeah, and we're not leaving until we 
                         find out... Deal?

               McConnell nods. They clasp hands briefly. Deal. Then Woody 
               turns. Before leaving, he hesitates just a moment, turning 
               back. One last thought, and he doesn't know he's going to 
               say it until it comes out.

                                     WOODY
                         Maggie was the best of us.

               McConnell looks at him, silent but grateful. Woody goes. 
               McConnell turns back, looking at her smiling face, frozen on 
               the screen.

               INT. COCKPIT. NIGHT

               MARS LOOMS AHEAD OF US.

               As seen through the cockpit windows. Huge, beautiful, MUCH 
               CLOSER now. We can make out swirling pink clouds, large 
               surface features. It's just before Martian dawn, the next 
               morning.

               There's a sudden LOUD, BRITTLE POP from somewhere overhead, 
               and Phil's gloved hand, hovering over a computer screen, is 
               punctured through and through. The screen itself is holed 
               and spiderwebbed with a loud CRACK!

                                     PHIL
                         Uhhh!

               PHIL HOLDS UP HIS HAND

               As he and Terri stare at it, dumbfounded. Thick droplets of 
               blood leak out and begin to swirl away, sucked up towards 
               the venting puncture in the hull over head. The astronauts' 
               helmets dangle up there, awaiting use.

                         What in God's --

               Suddenly we hear HIGH PITCHED ALARMS SOUNDING, then the 
               PINGING OF MORE TINY MISSILES, slashing across the ship's 
               outer skin.

               WOODY AND MCCONNELL

               Are staring back from the cockpit, reacting in astonishment 
               to Phil's drifting blood and to the alarms. Then Woody 
               suddenly understands.

               ANGLES ON TERRI AND PHIL

               As she seizes his wounded hand, tries to stop the bleeding. 
               He's staring at a gauge.

                                     PHIL

                         Woody, seal the breech!

               ANGLE ON WOODY

               As he unbuckles, dives from the cockpit back down into the 
               EVA, and floats quickly over to a storage hatch. He yanks 
               this open pulling out a

               PATCH GUN

               Then spins around in zero-G, as his eyes track

               THE RISING DROPLETS OF BLOOD

               Which give a telltale hint of the puncture's location, 
               somewhere up among the dangling helmets on the "ceiling."

               WOODY PUSHES OFF

               Rising to this area, and shoves aside a helmet with a 
               shattered faceplate -- its label reads "MCCONNELL" -- to 
               REVEAL A BREECH IN THE HULL. Jagged metal edges, dangling 
               insulation. The blood droplets are whirling out through here, 
               going into the vacuum of space.

               Quickly Woody stuffs the muzzle of the patch gun into the 
               puncture, firing a thick grey sealant. We hear MORE PINGS, 
               ECHOING LOUDLY, but after a few seconds they DIMINISH, then 
               abruptly STOP. The KLAXONS continue to wail.

                                     WOODY
                         Kill those alarms!

               McConnell punches buttons, MUTING THE ALARMS, and they all 
               strain to listen, faces tense and sweating. A long beat. But 
               the meteor shower has passed by, as abruptly as it appeared. 
               The astronauts turn, becoming aware of a strange phenomenon.

               PHIL'S BLOOD DROPLETS

               Have stopped in place, wobbling eerily as perfect spheres in 
               the zero-G. Then suddenly they start moving again, faster 
               and faster, in a new direction. Down through the open core 
               tunnel that leads to the lower Hab.

               MCCONNELL

               Stares at a gauge that confirms what's happening.

                                     MCCONNELL
                         Still outgassing in the lower Hab! 
                         There must be another hole down there, 
                         even bigger.

                                     PHIL

                         Positive! A vacuum inside the ship 
                         would cause a total electrical 
                         failure. The nav computers will fry!

                                     MCCONNELL
                              (to Woody)
                         We'll lose all control. We won't be 
                         able to fire the engines to capture 
                         Mars orbit.

               Just then a computer screen flickers, freezes. Phil punches 
               keys with his good hand. What he sees shocks him.

                                     PHIL
                         It's already starting. The primary L-
                         1 hub has been smashed. The systems 
                         are crashing.

               Woody looks back at his crew, struggling to project more 
               calm than he really feels.

                         I'm going EVA.

               They stare at him, stunned by their immense task.

                                     WOODY

               INT. EVA AIRLOCK. MOMENTS LATER

               Terri, now helmeted, is putting Woody's helmet on him, but 
               something's in the way, chafing his neck. He reaches into 
               his suit, pulls out...

               THE CHAIN

               From around his neck, with his little Flash Gordon rocketship 
               dangling.

               WOODY HANDS THIS TO TERRI

               As they share a brief, loving glance, but there's no time 
               for words. She tightens his helmet ring, and he brushes his 
               gloved fingertips on her faceplate. Then he hurries towards 
               the inner hatch door, where McConnell is throwing airlock 
               switches. Woody and McConnell exchange a look.

               At the EVA computer panel, Phil is shutting down non-essential 
               power drains, trying to get the main computer system back on 
               line. His wounded hand makes this difficult and painful.

                                     PHIL
                         Jesus, it's still bleeding.

               The outer airlock door is now open, revealing stars, as Woody 
               drifts through it into space. He's now wearing the MMU, an 
               oversized jet pack like the ones used by the shuttle 
               astronauts.

               INT. EVA ROOM. NIGHT

               With its shattered faceplate -- now useless -- drifts past 
               Terri as she is wrapping med tape around gauze pads on Phil's 
               glove.

               MCCONNELL

               Floats up to them, checking on Phil's work at the computer.

                                     TERRI
                         Jim, you've gotta get your spare 
                         helmet from storage.

                         computers on-line?

                         Jim, I've got an idea. If you guys 
                         can save enough atmosphere, I'll 
                         disconnect the power in the main 
                         computer bay, then jump start the 
                         systems. I'll do a hard boot.

               This is a radical, incredibly risky notion. McConnell stares 
               hard at Phil. So does Terri.

                                     MCCONNELL
                         Has that ever been tested?

                         Are you kidding? These machines are 
                         much too valuable.

               McConnell looks from Terri to Phil. It's life and death.

               Then he turns, and the CAMERA FOLLOWS MCCONNELL as he pushes 
               away from the console and dives down into the core tunnel, 
               heading towards the

               and pushes himself down a ladder toward the floor. He 
               accelerates as he gets closer to the floor, then rights 
               himself with a twist and lands on his feet -- now in gravity.

               Woody, in the MMU, is hovering over the lower segment of the 
               Hab hull, and right away we see his problem. He can't reach 
               the damaged spot because it's spinning past him, spewing 
               vapor.

               Attitude control thrusters on the hull begin firing in pulses. 
               The rotation of the lower Hab deck immediately starts to

               She catches the drifting can, confused. When McConnell speaks

               Terri shakes out soda from the open can. She and McConnell 
               watch the brown stream of fluid swirl up into the air, caught 
               by escaping oxygen. It rises towards the "ceiling" of the

               Swirling ever tighter, has formed a whirlpool that's now 
               being sucked out through the breach hole in the hull. She 
               can now see the ugly puncture for the first time.

               time to see him collapse to the floor below her, as he starts 
               to lose consciousness. He's deathly pale.

               Woody spots a tiny geyser of brownish ice crystals spouting 
               out of the hull of the lower Hab. It's some distance away

               to McConnell. She opens the valve of the oxygen cannister, 
               pushing the plastic mask over McConnell's face. He sucks in

               As he moves his hands and forearms deep inside the computer 
               bay. Around him, several of the smaller screens and gauges 
               are starting to malfunction, the data streams breaking apart,

               by, a meter beneath him. Woody punches his arm controls. 
               Nothing.

               Then just as the outer edge of the hab starts to pass him, 
               the thrusters kick back in. Woody grabs the edge, starts to 
               move to the hole. Woody lets out a breath.

               to her, and together they push off from the floor, leaping 
               weightlessly up to the other side of the Hab, the "ceiling." 
               They reach the gaping puncture, which they now see has been

                         Jim, there's a lot of scarring... 
                         I'd better check for other punctures 
                         while I'm out here.

                         inside. We've gotta start the 
                         checklist for orbital insertion.

                         Copy, I'm heading there now.

               Woody jets back towards the open EVA hatch. But as he reaches 
               this, about to re-enter the ship, he's captured momentarily 
               by a breathtakingly beautiful sight below him.

               SUNRISE OVER MARS

               As the huge planet is REVEALED in all its red, unearthly 
               glory. It's so close now that individual features can be 
               seen with the naked eye -- the vast chasm of Valles Marineris, 
               and then Olympus Mons, poking all the way up through the 
               Martian atmosphere. A stunning, alluring spectacle.

               WOODY

               Stares down at Mars, enthralled, as sunlight floods the side 
               of the spaceship, sparkles off his visor. Dawn, after a very 
               long night indeed. He whispers lovingly, under his breath.

                         Hey, Beautiful...

               Then he stirs himself out of his reverie and hurries through 
               the EVA hatch.

               CAMERA DRIFTS QUICKLY BACK and down along the hull as stark 
               sunlight flares off the big propellant tanks, three in a 
               row, and the thick silver tubes that join them. There's a 
               good deal of scarring and denting from the meteor shower. 
               Then, as the ship begins to MOVE OUT OF FRAME...

               WE MOVE IN CLOSER

               On one of these tubes, a feeder line to the engine bells, we 
               see a scatter of tiny, undetected holes, about the size of 
               the eraser at the end of a pencil. So small, so apparently 
               harmless...

               As Woody enters, stripped from the MMU, dripping with sweat, 
               McConnell is waiting for him. For a moment the two men just 
               look at each other, then they surge forward into a fierce 
               hug.

               Terri sits nearby, where she has just finished stitching up 
               Phil's hand. As Woody goes to her, she rises from her seat 
               and looks at him tears of relief and pride in her eyes.

               Phil is blinking; something seems to be getting into his own 
               eyes. His voice catches for a moment.

                         Try to close your fingers, Phil, 
                         nice and slowly.

               Phil starts curling up his fingers. The middle digit remains 
               extended in the universal gesture. They all consider this 
               for a moment. Then Phil looks up cheerfully.

               After a split-second they get it, and the whole crew roars

               meterorite. This freezes into eerie streamers and chunks, 
               which slowly drift away from the ship. They're quite

               it down hard.

               EXT. MARS RECOVERY. DAY

               Too late! IN SLOW MOTION, we see a terrifyingly violent chain 
               reaction. The fuel tanks themselves explode, one after 
               another. The supporting metal struts are vaporized. The solar 
               panels are snapped off. Two of the huge engine bells are 
               smashed sideways, out of alignment, while the third, trailing 
               pieces of the cowling, goes hurtling off, PAST CAMERA, like 
               a flaming cannon ball. The entire aft section of the ship, 
               including much of the lower Hab, instantly becomes a shredded, 
               charred tangle of metal, and even worse, the explosion causes 
               what's left of the ship -- mainly the EVA chamber and cockpit -- 
               to tumble end over end, cartwheeling down towards Mars.

               below. Four tiny figures, all alone in space.

               ANGLE ON MCCONNELL AND THE OTHERS

               As Phil looks back, his eyes searching the stars.

                                     TERRI
                         What're you looking for?

                                     PHIL
                              (softly, sadly)
                         Earth.

                                     TERRI
                              (beat)
                         Hey. When we get back? We really 
                         will have to try this in the sim.

               He tries to smile. So does she.

                                     MCCONNELL
                         How we doin' on fuel, Woody?

               Woody eyes a small display screen on his forearm.

                                     WOODY
                         I'm at fifty percent.
                              (looking down)
                         But I don't see the REMO.

               THEIR POV

               Everyone is looking back at the curve of Mars against black 
               space, expecting to see the REMO coming up behind them.

               TERRI

               Happens to glance directly below.

                                     TERRI
                         There she is!

               THEIR POV

               The black outline of the little cargo craft drifts against 
               the red of Mars.

                                     WOODY
                         Jesus. She's not where I thought 
                         she'd be.

                                     PHIL
                         We're going to miss her.

               WOODY

               Looks again at his display screen, frustrated.

                                     MCCONNELL
                         What do you think?

                                     WOODY
                         We can't catch it. Not like this.

                                     MCCONNELL
                              (thinking quickly)
                         Use the tether.

               From a compartment on the side of the MMU, Woody pulls out...

               THE TETHER GUN

               About the size of a large flare gun. There's a carabiner-
               like hook five inches in diameter on the front of the gun.

                                     MCCONNELL
                         We'll only have one, maybe two shots 
                         before she's out of reach.

                                     WOODY
                         It'll be better if I leave you the 
                         gun while I run out to the REMO. 
                         I've got enough fuel left for that.

                                     MCCONNELL
                         You'll be going too fast.

                                     WOODY
                         I'll aim to overshoot, then brake 
                         like hell; arc it in.

               McConnell looks at him. They both know how risky this is, 
               and they also know it's their only chance. Woody flips a 
               switch on the gun and pulls on the hook. Off it comes, 
               trailing wire. Woody clips the hook to the MMU, then hands 
               McConnell the gun.

                                     WOODY
                         Seeya in a few.

               McConnell nods. Woody and Terri exchange a look -- tender, 
               loving -- then Woody turns around and fires the MMU jets at 
               full throttle. As Woody pulls away, line unspools from the 
               tether gun.

               WOODY AND THE REMO

               Woody is chasing the REMO from above. It's as if he were in 
               an airplane, trying to land on a car racing along a freeway. 
               Woody is picking up speed quickly. Maybe too quickly. He 
               checks his armpad display screen.

                                     WOODY
                         Okay. I'm on path to overshoot. I'm 
                         gonna take the edge off.

               Woody starts braking with the MMU thrusters as hard as he 
               can.

               CLOSE ON THE THRUSTERS

               Glowing with orange flame. They suddenly cut off.

               WOODY'S EYES

               Show alarm. He checks his display.

                                     WOODY
                         I'm out. Coming in hot. Still long.
                              (beat)
                         Abandoning the unit. I'll brake with 
                         suit jets.

               Woody hits some buttons and the MMU's latches snap open. He 
               grabs the hook connected to the tether line, then pushes 
               himself free of the MMU, starts firing his small suit jets.

               WOODY'S POV

               He's still going very quickly.

               WITH MCCONNELL, TERRI AND PHIL

               Floating close together. The tether line is still unspooling 
               from the gun. They watch Woody, below and ahead of them, as 
               he races towards the REMO. Terri's heart is in her throat.

                                     TERRI
                         Oh Jesus. Jesus...

               McConnell reaches a glove out, touching her arm.

               BACK ON WOODY

               Still speeding towards the REMO. His suit jets cut out.

                                     WOODY
                         Suit jets gone. But I'm gonna make 
                         contact...

               MCCONNELL, TERRI AND PHIL

               Stare at Woody's distant figure.

               INTERCUT --

                                     MCCONNELL
                         At what velocity?

                                     WOODY
                         Impact's gonna be a little rough.

                                     MCCONNELL
                         At what velocity?

                                     WOODY
                              (beat)
                         Thirty-two.

               A look between McConnell and Terri; her face is stricken.

                                     MCCONNELL
                         I'm gonna use the gun to slow you.

                                     WOODY
                         No! You slow me and I'll fall short.

                                     MCCONNELL
                         It's too fast, Woody.

                                     WOODY
                         No choice. I'll be okay. Here we 
                         go...

               WOODY AND THE REMO

               Woody's coming down on the module at over thirty kilometers 
               an hour. He holds the hook out in front of him with one hand 
               while grabbing the tether line with the other, and WHAM! -- 
               he crashes into the REMO.

               WOODY'S HAND

               Slams the hook against a receiver on the hull of the REMO.

               IT CONNECTS --

               WOODY

               Tries to hold onto the tether line but his momentum is too 
               much.

               HIS GLOVED HANDS

               Are ripped from the line.

               WOODY

               Slides over the hull of the REMO.

               HIS HANDS

               Grasp in vain for something to grab onto. They drag and bump 
               and then finally his fingers close on... empty space.

               WOODY

               Is past the REMO, freefalling toward Mars.

               BACK ON MCCONNELL, TERRI AND PHIL

               As Terri screams.

                                     TERRI
                         Woody!!

               McConnell hits a button on the tether gun and starts to reel 
               them quickly in towards the REMO.

               WOODY

               Tries his suit jets again -- they're empty.

               HIS POV

               Falling away from the REMO.

               MCCONNELL AND THE OTHERS

               Are being reeled towards the REMO by the tether line. Another 
               couple hundred meters to go.

                                     MCCONNELL
                         Woody, what's your status?

               INTERCUTTING --

                                     WOODY
                              (after a beat)
                         Uh, well, no suit jets and I'm still 
                         carrying a good deal of velocity.

                                     MCCONNELL
                         As soon as we get hooked up, I'll 
                         come get you.

                                     WOODY
                              (after a beat)
                         Uh, I'd have to say negative on that, 
                         Jim.

                                     MCCONNELL
                         Negative on the transmission?

                                     WOODY
                         No, I heard you. Negative on the 
                         maneuver. I am not retrievable.

               McConnell and Terri share a quick, anguished look.

                                     TERRI
                         Woody, that's not possible. You're 
                         not going that fast.

                                     WOODY
                         It comes down to the amount of fuel, 
                         honey. The suit jets were designed 
                         for attitude control, not travel. 
                         Retrieval just won't work.

                                     PHIL
                         It has to work!

                                     WOODY
                         Hey, believe me, I don't like it any 
                         more than you do.

                                     TERRI
                         Woody --

                                     WOODY
                         Run the numbers, Jim.

                                     MCCONNELL
                         I am.

               McConnell finishes looking over the numbers on his display 
               pad. Terri is staring at him. When McConnell's eyes meet 
               hers, they are red-rimmed. Haunted.

                                     MCCONNELL
                         Woody, you hang tight. We'll get 
                         into the REMO, fire her up, drop her 
                         into a lower orbit and come scoop 
                         you up.

                                     WOODY
                         Sounds good, Jim.

                                     TERRI
                         It's gonna take half an hour to get 
                         the REMO reoriented! Woody'll be... 
                         He'll be in the atmosphere by then!

                                     MCCONNELL
                         Then we'll have to get her moving 
                         faster.

                                     TERRI
                         We don't have time!

                                     WOODY
                         You listen to Jim, honey. It's a 
                         good plan.

                                     TERRI
                         No! We are going to --

                                     PHIL
                         Oh Jesus, look! The ship!

               Phil points. McConnell and Terri look.

               THE MARS RECOVERY COCKPIT

               Is now several kilometers below and behind them. It's glowing 
               red... then orange... then white. Then it erupts into a giant 
               fireball, devoured by friction with Mars' atmosphere.

               MCCONNELL, TERRI AND PHIL IN DEEP SPACE

               Are all staring at this, awed, when McConnell happens to 
               look up again. He sees something alarming.

                                     MCCONNELL
                         Look out!

               THEIR POV

               They are drifting quickly into the REMO.

                                     MCCONNELL
                         Brakes!

               ALL THREE

               Fire their suit jets, slowing themselves down. They bang 
               into the REMO at about one-tenth the speed Woody did. They 
               find handholds and grab on. McConnell hits a button on the 
               tether gun.

               THE HOOK

               Releases from the REMO's hull. McConnell hits another button 
               and it is reeled all the way into the gun. Phil is already 
               scrabbling at a latch on the REMO's outer airlock door.

                                     MCCONNELL
                         Okay, let's get inside! Phil, start 
                         dumping the cargo, or there won't be 
                         room for us.

                                     PHIL
                         But we need those supplies for --

                                     MCCONNELL
                         Dump the cargo. Hang on, Woody!

               WOODY

               Is looking back at the REMO. Smiles with relief to see that 
               Terri has reached it safely.

                                     WOODY
                         Will do, Jim.

               He turns to look at...

               MARS

               Right below him, filling his field of view. A long beat.

                                     WOODY
                              (softly)
                         Hey, Beautiful...

               BACK AT THE REMO

               Terri makes a snap decision. She grabs the tether gun from 
               McConnell's surprised hands, then pushes off from the REMO. 
               McConnell lunges after her, his gloved hand straining.

                                     MCCONNELL
                         Terri, no!

               But it's too late. She's already out of reach, and now fires 
               her suit jets, pulling quickly away from the REMO.

               MCCONNELL

               Is reaching to activate his own jets, when

               PHIL'S HAND

               Grabs at his wrist, restraining this suicidal courage. They 
               stare at each other. McConnell wrenches his hand free, half-
               maddened, agonized, staring after Terri.

                                     MCCONNELL
                         Goddammit, Terri, it won't work!

               But Terri keeps on going.

               WOODY

               Looks back at the REMO, as he continues to fall towards Mars. 
               Sees the small figure of his wife heading towards him.

                                     WOODY
                         Terri, what are you doing?

               INTERCUT --

                                     TERRI
                         I'll tell you what I'm not doing, 
                         Woody. I'm not going to watch you 
                         die.

                                     WOODY
                         Terri --

                                     TERRI
                         You'd do the same for me.

               AT THE REMO

               Phil is watching as Terri drops towards the distant twinkle 
               of Woody's suit lights. The airlock door hangs open. Phil 
               looks at McConnell, anguished.

                                     MCCONNELL
                         Get inside. Dump the cargo, then 
                         start the systems.
                              (Phil hesitates)
                         Now.

               INTERCUTTING BETWEEN WOODY AND TERRI

               As Woody keys his mike. Tries to steady his voice.

                                     WOODY
                         No. I wouldn't come for you. Not if 
                         it just wasn't possible.

                                     TERRI
                         I can do it!

                                     WOODY
                         No, Terri, you can't! You don't have 
                         enough fuel to get me, stop us both, 
                         and get us back. Hell, you come any 
                         farther and you won't have enough to 
                         get back yourself.

               No response from Terri.

                                     WOODY
                         Listen to me, goddammit! You have to 
                         stop! You have to stop now!

                                     MCCONNELL
                         He's right, Terri... It's no use.

               Terri looks at her armpad display.

               CLOSE ON DISPLAY SCREEN

               As her fuel indicator drops from 50 percent to 49 to...

               TERRI

               Releases her thumb from the toggle control.

               HER SUIT JETS

               Stop firing.

               TERRI

               Drifts, staring towards Woody.

               TERRI AND WOODY

               Are on the same trajectory, going the same speed, and only 
               about a hundred meters apart. But it might as well be 
               infinity.

                                     WOODY
                         Okay, honey...? You gotta go back 
                         now.

                                     TERRI
                         The hell I do.

               Terri raises up the tether gun and pulls the trigger.

               THE HOOK

               Comes shooting out of the gun, wire spooling out behind it.

               WOODY

               Watches as it comes shooting down toward him.

               PLATE POV -- MOVING -- AS

               Woody gets larger and larger, the hook gets closer and closer, 
               and then SNAP! -- the hook stops. ANGLE ON THE TETHER GUN

               The wire has run all the way out.

               WOODY

               Looks at the drifting hook, ten agonizing meters away from 
               him. His only life preserver.

               TERRI

               Hits the button and the wire starts winching fast back into 
               the gun.

                                     WOODY
                         What are you doing?

                                     TERRI
                         I'm gonna jet a little closer and 
                         try again.

                                     WOODY
                         Terri, you spend any fuel getting 
                         closer, you won't get back, and if 
                         anyone tries to get you, they'll die 
                         too.

               No response from Terri.

               THE HOOK

               Is whipping back toward Terri and the gun. Woody's voice 
               cracks; he's very close to tears. Pleading now.

                                     WOODY
                         Honey, please go back. Go back and 
                         help everyone get down to the surface.

               The hook slams back against the muzzle of the gun. Terri 
               resets the gun quickly, in an anguished fury.

                                     TERRI
                         I am not losing you.

                                     WOODY
                         I can't let you do it. I can't. I'm 
                         sorry.

               TERRI

               Looks at Woody, two hundred meters away, sensing something 
               different in his voice now, a terrible resolve...

                                     TERRI
                         Woody...?

               WOODY

               Raises his hands to his helmet ring. His eyes shining.

                                     WOODY
                         I love you, Terri. God how I love 
                         you.

               He unscrews the ring, pops the seal. The outrush of air pushes 
               his helmet all the way off. Woody shuts his eyes and opens 
               his mouth.

                                     TERRI
                         Woody, nooooooo...!!!

               Ice crystals bloom with Woody's last breath. There's nothing 
               to suck in. He doesn't fight it. He lets death come.

               ANGLE ON TERRI

               Tears streaming, chest heaving, frantic.

                                     TERRI
                         Woody, oh Woody, please God, no!

               HER THUMB

               Hovers over her suit jet toggle control. McConnell's voice, 
               from the distance, sounds very tired. Like he's aged fifty 
               years in the blink of an eye.

                                     MCCONNELL
                         Come back, Terri.

               Terri's thumb is still poised. Death would be better.

               ANGLE ON MCCONNELL

               Outside the REMO. The hatch is still open. We see Phil inside, 
               staring out anxiously towards Terri.

                                     MCCONNELL
                              (quietly, simply)
                         He's gone.

               He sees no movement from the distant, small figure of Terri.

                                     MCCONNELL
                         Please, Terri...
                              (long beat)
                         We need you.

               TERRI'S THUMB

               Pushes the toggle control... to one side, not forward.

               TERRI'S FACE

               Inside her helmet, is streaming with tears. She turns herself 
               around, reluctantly. Heads slowly back towards the REMO.

               INT. INTERNATIONAL SPACE STATION. MMCR. DAY

               On the big screen at MMCR, a glowing green icon labelled 
               "MARS RECOVERY" is shown in orbit, as a stream of computer 
               figures crawls beside it.

               SUPER TITLE: "SPACE STATION. MMCR. 20 MINUTE TIME LAG"

               Beck stands by the NEW CAPCOM, as the latter repeats headset 
               data.

                                     NEW CAPCOM
                         Okay, they're Go for the burn and 
                         MOI. Should be initiating the burn 
                         just about... now.

               Suddenly the data stream goes crazy. It shivers, streaks, 
               breaks up... then stops. The blinking green icon representing 
               Mars Recovery glows brighter... then vanishes.

               A moment of stunned silence in the big room. Then a rising 
               babble of scared, confused voices.

               RAY BECK

               Takes a step forward, staring helplessly at the screen. His 
               face goes pale, stricken. His worst nightmare is taking place, 
               right before his eyes -- and for the second mission in a 
               row...

                                                               DISSOLVE TO:

               EXT. REMO. MARS ORBIT. NIGHT

               The REMO is now on the night side of Mars. Cargo boxes, 
               packing cases and assorted equipment containers float outside. 
               The hatch is sealed.

               INT. REMO. MARS ORBIT. NIGHT

               McConnell hovers by a bulkhead. He's anguished, haunted by 
               the image of Woody's death. We see him struggling to overcome 
               his grief and shock, trying to force himself to concentrate 
               on the critical tasks at hand. In front of him, a panel has 
               been opened; he's facing

               SMALL UTILITY MONITOR

               Already glowing, surrounded by coded switches, indicator 
               lights, com ports.

               MCCONNELL

               Stares at these, thinking hard, remembering. He's holding a 
               palm-sized computer, already wired into this panel. He begins 
               tapping the keys, but then stops himself. Reconsiders. He 
               turns, looking back at

               TERRI AND PHIL

               Hunched on what would be the floor if the REMO were on land. 
               They grip stowage straps to keep from drifting. Clearly this 
               tiny, rude cargo craft was never designed for manned 
               operation. It's claustrophobic, bitterly cold.

               PHIL'S FACE

               Is a map of torment. He is shivering, both from cold and 
               fear, barely holding himself together. He hugs his computer 
               supply case like a scared child would hug a teddy bear.

               TERRI

               Is worse. A thousand-yard stare. She's in shock.

               MCCONNELL

               Knows he has to occupy them. Speaks softly.

                                     MCCONNELL
                         Phil?
                              (no response)
                         Hey, Phil...?

               Phil looks up at him dully.

                                     MCCONNELL
                         We're going in blind. We'll deploy 
                         the chutes by laptop. I need to get 
                         on the data bus, put in a software 
                         patch, and try to soften this tin 
                         can's landing. I could use your help 
                         with the patch.

               After a moment Phil releases his strap, pushes towards 
               McConnell. He stares numbly at the monitor for a few beats, 
               then takes the little computer from McConnell. He begins to 
               tap the keys, slowly at first, but then with more confidence.

                                     MCCONNELL
                         That's great. Good job.
                              (turning to Terri)
                         Hey, Terri, I was wondering. Think 
                         maybe we could rig some kind of 
                         seatbelts out of those cargo straps?

               Terri hesitates a moment, then looks at the strap in her 
               hand, as if she's never seen it before. Dully she reaches 
               for another one, begins looping them together.

               MCCONNELL

               Studies both of their faces intently. Knows that he can't 
               push them too hard, too fast. They're moving like robots, 
               but at least they're moving.

               EXT. REMO. MARS ORBIT. NIGHT. (MINUTES LATER)

               Small thrusters are firing, getting the REMO into position 
               for entry into the atmosphere.

               Then all the jets fire in unison, braking the REMO, as it 
               falls away from us, towards Mars at night.

               INT. REMO. HIGH ATMOSPHERE. NIGHT

               The astronauts, restrained on the floor by Terri's jury-rigged 
               strap system, hold on for dear life. The buffeting through 
               the atmosphere is shaking them violently.

               BEHIND THEIR FACEPLATES

               We see the effect of the incredible g-forces: faces distorted, 
               unable to focus their eyes. Each of them thinking, once again: 
               Now I'm going to die...

               OMITTED

               Sequence omitted from original script.

               EXT. MARS ONE BASE CAMP. NIGHT

               The Mars One Base Camp looms in the foreground, like some 
               desolate, otherwordly ghost town. And then, in the night sky 
               beyond it, we see an eerie and beautiful sight: a bright 
               streak of red as the REMO slashes down into the Martian 
               atmosphere, like a shooting star, finally disappearing behind 
               distant mountains. Then all is stillness again, deathly 
               stillness and silence...

               INT. INTERNATIONAL SPACE STATION. VIEWPORT. DAY

               Beck stands by a viewport, staring out into space. He's just 
               lost four good friends, and also knows he is seeing, in this 
               disaster, the probable end of the Mars Program, and the 
               certain end of his own career. He doesn't, at first, even 
               hear the nearby VOICE.

                         just coming in.

               Beck looks up, his eyes red-rimmed. The CapCom shifts 
               uneasily. He's holding a computer printout.

                                     NEW CAPCOM
                         We just -- it doesn't make any sense. 
                         We're not sure how to read this.

                                     BECK
                         Data?

                         Yes sir. Telemetry reports the REMO 
                         has left its orbit and reached the 
                         Martian surface.

                                     BECK
                              (pause)
                         Crashed?

                         No sir. Under power.

               Beck snatches the paper, staring at it. For the first time 
               we see some life coming back into him.

                                     BECK
                         When?

                         graph reads like a controlled descent. 
                         But that doesn't make any --

               Beck suddenly understands. And it's a joy to see his face, 
               the tears of happiness that spring into his eyes.

                                     BECK
                         They used the REMO as a lander.

               The CapCom stares back at him, feeling the same surge of 
               hope.

                                     BECK
                         It's McConnell, it's got to be! Nobody 
                         else could have pulled this off. Son 
                         of a bitch! They're alive.

               EXT. MARTIAN SURFACE. MARS ONE BASE CAMP. DAY

               POV ANGLE - WIDE

               As we see the Mars One Base Camp: silent, very still. In the 
               distance, the massive ERV still looms, perched for takeoff, 
               the bottom rungs of its ladder buried.

               PANNING

               We see that sand has drifted high against the Hab, as well 
               as the sides of the partially-deflated tunnel and greenhouse, 
               and the four-man rover. The oxygen still and propellant plant 
               are almost buried. Solar panels, some of them punctured by 
               micrometeors, FLAP and CREAK eerily in the slight breeze. 
               And finally,

               CLOSER TO CAMERA

               We see the camp's American flag, still on its toppled pole, 
               but nearly obliterated by sand.

               ANGLE ON MCCONNELL, TERRI, AND PHIL

               Who are spooked by this desolation. They've paused at the 
               edge of the camp.

               They have dragged along with them from their landing site a 
               crude sledge, improvised from the REMO's hatch cover and 
               some cargo straps. On this, their meager supplies.

               McConnell, glancing at the others, knows he's got to keep 
               their spirits up. He kneels, digs out the flag pole. Brushing 
               off the sand, he rights this and re-plants it firmly in the 
               ground, packing the sand down with his boot. He stands for a 
               moment looking at the flag, his eyes moist. Despite the cost, 
               they have made it to Mars.

               When he turns, Terri and Phil are looking at him, moved.

                                     MCCONNELL
                         Better?

                                     PHIL
                              (pause)
                         Damn right.

                                     MCCONNELL
                         Terri, let's see if that oxygen still 
                         is operational. Phil, you better 
                         check out the ERV. I'll take the 
                         Hab. If you find Luke's --

               He catches himself. Phil and Terri look at him.

                                     MCCONNELL
                         Just keep in touch.

               EXT. ERV. DAY

               Phil steps from the umber sand onto the ERV's ladder, begins 
               to climb. The four-man rover is nearby, sand drifted high 
               against its tires.

               EXT. OXYGEN STILL. DAY

               Terri kneels by the oxygen still, begins to scoop away sand 
               with her gloved hands. She still looks numb.

               EXT. HAB. DAY

                                     MCCONNELL
                              (on radio)
                         I'm at the main airlock door.

               He unlatches a panel, grips the emergency lever inside, tugs 
               it. After a seeming eternity, the door groans and creaks 
               open. Little puffs of dust and sand swirl about, settle.

                                     MCCONNELL
                         Entering Hab.

               EXT. ERV. DAY

               Perched atop the ERV's ladder, Phil, using a battery-powered 
               drill, is just removing the final screw from the hatch cover. 
               He lifts off the heavy cover, lets it tumble to the sand.

                                     PHIL
                         I've got ERV access. I'm going in. 
                         Terri, you okay?

               EXT. OXYGEN STILL. DAY

               Terri is still scooping sand. She's just cleared the first 
               row of gauges.

                                     TERRI
                         Yeah. This is gonna take awhile to 
                         get back to 100% capacity.

               INT. MARS ONE HAB. DAY

               McConnell walks through the kitchen, which we recognize. He 
               pauses to look at the table from which Luke and his crew 
               taped their final, fateful message.

               HIS BIRTHDAY CUPCAKE

               Still sits there, eerily, with its stub of burned-out candle. 
               Half-finished, frozen cups of coffee. Suddenly, out of the 
               corner of his eye, he catches a flash of white. He spins, 
               startled, and sees

               HIS OWN REFLECTION.

               In his white pressure suit, staring back at him from the 
               screen of a video monitor. Above this is perched the camera 
               the Mars One astronauts used for their comm packets.

               MCCONNELL SHIVERS

               This place is filled with ghosts.

               INT. ERV COCKPIT. DAY

               Phil, in the pilot's seat of the ERV, pushes a computer's 
               power button. The screen flickers weakly to life, startling 
               him a bit, but all he sees on it are white streaks, crazy 
               static.

                                     PHIL
                         ERV appears structurally intact. 
                         Computers are fried, just as we 
                         thought.

               EXT. OXYGEN STILL. DAY

               Terri has cleared more gauges, valves. She sits back on her 
               heels, studying the tangle of pipes.

                                     TERRI
                         Copy that. I've got busted filters 
                         here, clogged intakes. Helluva cleanup 
                         job, but so far no major damage.

               INT. GREENHOUSE. DAY

               AN INNER AIRLOCK DOOR WHOOSHES OPEN, AND MCCONNELL ENTERS. 
               THEN STOPS, ASTONISHED. HIS POV

               On a fantastic, almost jungle-like atmosphere. The plants 
               have been allowed -- encouraged? -- to grow wildly. Some are 
               even pushing against the inflated roof. Water condenses on 
               the leaves and the roof, then is captured and routed through 
               pipes of every shape and size, dripping into a clever 
               assortment of collection jars. Liquid water.

               MCCONNELL

               Reaches into a bucket, touches the water. His glove comes up 
               before his wondering eyes, dripping. Grasping the implication, 
               he looks down at his forearm instrument pad.

               Blinking red letters read "25 deg. C." And something else -- 
               the puffy white material of his suit is starting to slightly 
               deflate, revealing his arm's shape. There's air pressure in 
               here!

               MCCONNELL

               Punches in more numbers, and gets the readout:

               "Nitr. 78%/ 02 20%/ C02 1%/ Trace gasses 1%."

               MCCONNELL

               Slowly reaches up, unsealing the neck ring of his helmet. He 
               hesitates, then lifts it off. Takes a deep, quenching lungful 
               of pure air. Holds it in. Lets it slowly out. For a moment 
               he doesn't trust his own voice. Then speaks softly towards 
               his helmet.

                                     MCCONNELL
                         I'm in the greenhouse. You better... 
                         you better come see this for 
                         yourselves.

               INT. ERV. DAY

               Phil, still sitting at the cockpit controls, turns. Through 
               a side viewport he can just make out the greenhouse.

                                     PHIL
                         What is it?

               There's no answer. He rises.

               EXT. OXYGEN STILL. DAY

               Terri rises, concerned, and turns. Through the distant, 
               translucent wall of the greenhouse, McConnell's shadowy figure 
               can be seen, moving slowly.

                                     TERRI
                         Jim...?

               INT. GREENHOUSE. DAY

               McConnell sets down his helmet, starts exploring, pushing 
               through fronds as he makes his way down an aisle. The dripping 
               foliage is so dense it almost chokes his path. Everywhere he 
               looks, he has the sense of a scrounged-together, recycled, 
               jury-rigged environment, where a great deal of ingenuity has 
               come into play. He pauses, looking up...

               Overhead, a bellows, stitched together from pieces of plastic 
               tarp, slowly inhales and exhales, pumping air into a vent in 
               the upper deck of the Hab. Its power comes from a crude water 
               wheel, a buckets-and-strut assemblage, tidily sutured with 
               duct tape, like some giant Erector set.

               As McConnell turns away from this, still marvelling, a ragged 
               figure leaps through the foliage! It smashes into him, with 
               a HARSH SCREECH, knocking him to the ground.

               McConnell, on his back, straddled by his attacker, fights 
               back as best he can. A blur of flailing arms and fists, as 
               he tries to push the creature away. Staring up, he catches a 
               glimpse of the almost unrecognizable

               LUKE GRAHAM

               Whose frightened eyes glare back at him through a swaying 
               curtain of dreadlocks. His skin is creased, weathered, above 
               a scraggly beard. His clothes are tattered, patched together. 
               In one fist he grips a rock hammer, which he swings high 
               overhead, about to drive the claw through McConnell's skull. 
               McConnell grabs his arm desperately, trying to fend him off.

                                     MCCONNELL
                         Luke, it's me! Jim McConnell!

               We see a flash of uncertainty in Luke's eyes. Then he yanks 
               his arm free, and his hammer arcs up even higher, trembles 
               in the air.

                                     LUKE
                         You're not here!

                                     MCCONNELL
                         Luke, it's Jim!

                                     LUKE
                         No, no, you're not... you can't be 
                         here.

                                     MCCONNELL
                         Your wife is Debra! Your son is Bobby! 
                         You were reading Treasure Island 
                         with him...!

               As he stares down at McConnell, Luke's eyes finally light up 
               with recognition. but before he can move, he is seized from 
               behind and flung backwards to the ground, the hammer ripped 
               from his grasp, as Terri and Phil pinion his arms. McConnell 
               scrambles to his feet.

                                     MCCONNELL
                         Don't hurt him!

               McConnell kneels beside Luke, signalling to Terri and Phil 
               that it's okay to let him go. They stand back, pulling off 
               their helmets. Everyone is panting, out of breath.

               Luke sits up, slowly studying their features, one after 
               another, as if still not quite certain whether they might 
               vanish. His voice is hoarse, rusty from disuse.

                                     LUKE
                         Phil... Terri...

               Luke looks with incomprehension at McConnell.

                                     LUKE
                         Jim... I don't understand. You're 
                         not supposed to be here... Why are 
                         you here? Where's Woody?

                                     MCCONNELL
                         He didn't make it Luke.

               Luke stares at McConnell, trying to absorb everything. He 
               looks to Terri, who looks down.

                                     LUKE
                         Oh no.

               Luke shakes his head in dismay. He seems to shrink in on 
               himself. It's all too much for him to take in. McConnell 
               kneels and puts his arm around Luke, comforting him.

               Luke sits on the side of his cot, in the little tented 
               sleeping area he's created in one corner of the greenhouse. 
               Nearby, his hotplate, pots, and some freshly harvested 
               vegetables and greens. The others crouch around him.

                                     MCCONNELL
                         Luke, what happened here?

               A flash of fear in Luke's eyes.

                                     LUKE
                              (whispers)
                         We fired the radar. It came. They 
                         all died.

                                     MCCONNELL
                         What came?

                                     LUKE
                         They all died, but I was spared. 
                         Why? Had to be for a reason. Then, 
                         all of a sudden, I knew why I was 
                         spared.

               His voice drops to a conspiratorial whisper.

                                     LUKE
                         So somebody would be left to figure 
                         out the secret.

               He taps his forehead, significantly, then nods once or twice. 
               The others exchange an uneasy glance.

                                     MCCONNELL
                         Luke, we still don't understand.

                                     LUKE
                         Come. Comecomecome.

               He rises quickly and scuttles off, waving an impatient hand, 
               without waiting to see if they'll follow. McConnell, Terri 
               and Phil stare after him for a long moment. Phil breaks the 
               silence.

                                     PHIL
                         Is it just me? Or is he about two 
                         mealpacks short of a picnic?

                                     TERRI
                         Long term exposure to low gravity 
                         can have an adverse impact on the 
                         brain. He could be suffering from a 
                         form of asphyxia.

                                     MCCONNELL
                         Or maybe his whole crew died and 
                         he's been marooned alone on Mars. 
                         Let's give him time to adjust.

               McConnell and Terri follow in the direction Luke went. Phil, 
               trailing, mutters to himself.

                                     PHIL
                         Greatgreatgreat.

               EXT. MARS ONE BASE CAMP. DAY

               Luke, now in a patched-up pressure suit and grubby-looking 
               helmet, stands peering down unhappily at the improvised 
               sledge, with its meager supplies. McConnell, Terri, and Phil 
               walk up behind him, wearing their helmets again. They hear 
               Luke over his RADIO.

                                     LUKE
                         So... let me be sure I understand 
                         this. Your ship blew up, with all 
                         its supplies. Then you emptied the 
                         cargo out of the REMO, and it was 
                         totalled on landing. You've got no 
                         food, no water, no spare oxygen, 
                         nothing but what I see here...?

               McConnell and the others are silent, embarrassed. Then 
               McConnell nods. Luke looks at him, a cracked grin.

                                     LUKE
                         What kinda rescue mission is this?

                                     MCCONNELL
                         That kind.

               He points to the computer repair case, as Phil lifts it off 
               a sledge. Luke turns, looks at the case, then Phil.

                                     PHIL
                         Check it out. New nav boards for the 
                         ERV. I got four round-trip tickets, 
                         baby, right in here.

                                     LUKE
                              (softly)
                         Four.

               In some mysterious way, this reminder of Woody's death seems 
               to bring him fully back into himself. He takes Terri by the 
               shoulders, deeply saddened. She meets his gaze.

                                     LUKE
                         Terri... I'm so sorry. He was a good 
                         man.

                                     TERRI
                         Thanks, Luke.

                                     LUKE
                         When there's time, we'll talk.

               She nods, grateful. A beat. He looks at the others.

                                     LUKE
                         This way.

               He starts off across the sand, and they follow.

               EXT. GRAVE SITE. DAY

               They stand looking down at the three long mounds of dirt, as 
               Luke completes his account of the disaster.

                                     LUKE
                         ...When I came to and dug myself out 
                         of the sand, my faceplate was cracked. 
                         Leaking badly. I barely made it back 
                         to Base. It was weeks before I could 
                         work up the nerve to go back out 
                         there and look for their...

               He has to pause, collect himself.

                                     LUKE
                         Renee was the only one I could find. 
                         But it didn't seem right, somehow, 
                         to dig just one grave.

               There is an emotional silence. Luke turns, takes a few steps. 
               He stares into the distance, observing the swirling dust 
               around them. McConnell hesitates, notices Luke's gaze.

                                     MCCONNELL
                         Has it been blowing like this for a 
                         while?
                              (Luke nods)
                         We saw a big storm from space. But 
                         Micker said it was turning south.

               Luke looks off into the distance, studies something only he 
               seems to see.

                                     LUKE
                         If it holds course.

               McConnell pulls his gaze away from the horizon, looks at 
               Luke.

                                     MCCONNELL
                         This -- whatever it was -- this force. 
                         You say it came directly out of the 
                         top of the mountain?

                                     LUKE
                         You don't believe me. That's okay. 
                         But I'm not crazy, Jim.

               McConnell isn't quite sure how to reply to this.

                                     MCCONNELL
                         What did you mean by its "secret?" 
                         What secret?

                                     LUKE
                              (pause)
                         You better see for yourselves.

               INT. MARS ONE HAB. DAY

               McConnell, Terri, and Phil follow Luke into the Science Lab 
               area of the Hab, then stop in their tracks. Their helmets 
               are off. It's very cold in here; their breath is frosty.

               THEIR POV --

               The Lab is crammed with rock and sand samples from many 
               locations, all tagged and labelled. There are drawings and 
               diagrams covering the walls: Martian landscapes, annotated 
               maps, and over and over, obsessively repeated, drawings of 
               the vortex that destroyed the Mars One crew.

                                     LUKE
                         See, where they made their mistake 
                         was, they must've planned for it to 
                         be visible from Earth...

               The others turn, looking at him. Luke is aiming an electric 
               space heater at his computer. As the coils glow red, he rubs 
               his hands together, poised over the keyboard.

                                     MCCONNELL
                         Who's "they"?

               Luke reacts to their blank stares. He has a kind of jittery 
               feverish intensity, a secret excitement.

                                     LUKE
                         Don't you understand? Hundreds of 
                         millions of years have gone by. You've 
                         got erosion, sand storms, lava flows, 
                         meteor impacts -- hell, in that much 
                         time, the whole surface would've 
                         changed. So no wonder we never saw 
                         it before. Well, I mean, we saw it, 
                         but not like they meant us too. Too 
                         much dirt on it.

               The others exchange worried glances. Is he totally nuts?

                                     TERRI
                         Saw what?

                                     LUKE
                         This.

               On the computer screen they're looking at...

               CLOSE ON THE MONITOR

               Pictures of the Face after the disaster, seen from ground-
               level, in telephoto views. Rising out of a ring of rock and 
               dirt rubble is the shiny-white profile of a gigantic face. 
               The white is smooth, impenetrable. It has the scale of a 
               mountain, but the planes and angles are clearly unnatural.

               MCCONNELL, PHIL AND TERRI (INT. MARS ONE HAB.)

               They are stunned. Can hardly believe their eyes.

                                     PHIL
                         Jesus...

                                     TERRI
                         What is that...?

                                     LUKE
                         I don't know. But whatever it is, 
                         somebody built it. And not us.

               A few moments of silence while they try to absorb this.

                                     MCCONNELL
                         What about the sound? That signal 
                         you heard before the explosion?

                                     LUKE
                         Good, Jim, good. That's the key.

               A click of the mouse and they all HEAR, over speakers, the 
               DEEP PULSING BASS TONE.

                                     LUKE
                         Hear the pauses? That's what made me 
                         realize it's a pattern -- a repeating 
                         pattern.

                                     MCCONNELL
                         Mathematical?

               Luke is trembling with excitement. His words tumble out very 
               quickly. He's been waiting so long to share this.

                                     LUKE
                         That's what I thought. There are 
                         distinct blocks in the pattern, and 
                         within each block the tones come in 
                         groups of three. Threethreethree. 
                         For months I struggled to analyze 
                         it, trying different constructs... 
                         Then I thought about dimensions.

                                     MCCONNELL
                         X-Y-Z coordinates...

                                     LUKE
                         Right! Three groups equals three 
                         dimensions... So I tried assigning 
                         different graphic values to each 
                         block, group and tone. And finally I 
                         got... this.

               He types another command. They all look at the monitor, the 
               glow reflecting on their faces. They are amazed again.

               CLOSE ON THE MONITOR

               Where we see the beautiful interlocking chain, the universally 
               familiar double helix, of a DNA molecule -- the elegant 
               blueprint of life.

                                     PHIL
                         My God... Is that what I think it 
                         is?

                                     TERRI
                         DNA... that's a model of DNA!

                         You see it, too. Thank God. I was 
                         afraid I was just suffering from a 
                         form of asphyxia.

               She glances at him, surprised that he overheard her earlier 
               diagnosis. But he smiles, not offended.

                                     PHIL
                         So, okay, so -- somebody left this 
                         thing here, somebody -- other than 
                         human. But what the hell is it?

                                     LUKE
                         My guess is, it's a signature. A 
                         self-portrait of whatever species 
                         created the Face.

                         But that DNA looks human.

                                     TERRI
                         No way. It's missing the last pair 
                         of chromosomes. See?

                                     MCCONNELL
                         Yeah, but it's close. Damn close.

                                     TERRI
                         The difference between a man and an 
                         ape is less than three percent of 
                         genetic material. But that three 
                         percent gives you Mozart. Einstein.

                                     PHIL
                         Or Jack the Ripper.

               They look at him. Then all four turn, stare again at the 
               slowly rotating DNA, pondering its awesome mystery.

               MCCONNELL

               When he finally speaks, never takes his eyes off the screen. 
               We can read in them the almost overwhelming grip this mystery 
               has on his imagination.

                                     MCCONNELL
                         It's been a long day. Let's get a 
                         couple hours sleep, then tackle this 
                         thing when we're fresher. Phil, your 
                         first priority will be to get the 
                         motherboards over to the ERV. 
                         Concentrate on getting communications 
                         up first.
                              (Phil nods)
                         Soon as we've got the juice, we'll 
                         send a packet to Micker, tell them 
                         Luke's OK, and that... everything 
                         else that's happened. The rest of us 
                         will take an inventory of supplies, 
                         see where we stand. Okay?

               The others nod in weary agreement. As they start out, towards 
               the relative warmth of the greenhouse, Terri looks at Luke, 
               at his scraggly beard and his long, lank hair. She smiles, 
               brushing some locks off his forehead.

                                     TERRI
                         C'mon. There's a pair of scissors in 
                         my medkit.

               INT. MARS ONE HAB. ANOTHER SECTION. NEXT MORNING

               As in the Science Area, this space has enough thin oxygen 
               for the astronauts to remain unhelmeted. McConnell and Luke 
               are still going through what few supplies were salvaged from 
               the REMO.

               Luke pauses, rubbing the unfamiliar smoothness of his cheek. 
               His beard is gone, his hair neatly trimmed. McConnell enjoys 
               Luke's own wonder at his transformation.

                                     MCCONNELL
                         How do you feel?

                                     LUKE
                         Like I just got back my other three 
                         percent.

               McConnell smiles. Terri enters through the hatch, removing 
               her helmet.

                                     TERRI
                         The backup generator is salvageable, 
                         and two of the solar panels. I'm 
                         pretty sure I can get the oxygen 
                         still back into production, too. So 
                         we're not in such bad shape, 
                         considering.

                                     LUKE
                         Good work, Terri.

               McConnell, rummaging through Phil's backpack, drops an already-
               opened bag of M&Ms. The CANDIES scatter and bounce all over 
               the floor.

                                     MCCONNELL
                         Look at that. Phil's idea of absolute 
                         essentials.

               Luke and Terri smile. McConnell scoops up the fallen M&Ms. 
               He slows down as he does it, looking at the scatter of little 
               round CANDIES. Something tugging at the back of his mind...

                                                              FLASHBACK TO:

               Phil's intricately designed M&M model of his "ideal woman", 
               floating weightlessly, as McConnell drifts past it, plucking 
               away a couple pieces of the candy. Phil reacting, in good-
               natured annoyance. The gap in the design left by McConnell's 
               theft...

               INT. MARS ONE HAB. ANOTHER SECTION. DAY

               CLOSE ON MCCONNELL

               As he trembles with excitement. With sudden comprehension.

                                     MCCONNELL
                         It's not a signature.

                                     LUKE
                              (puzzled)
                         What?

                                     MCCONNELL
                         That noise from the Face... It's not 
                         a signature. It's a test.

               Luke and Terri stare at him.

               INT. MARS ONE HAB. MOMENTS LATER

               McConnell sits in front of the computer back in the science 
               lab area, staring once again at the mysterious DNA model. 
               Luke and Terri stand behind him. McConnell's energy, his new 
               certainty, is almost electrifying.

                                     MCCONNELL
                         It's asking us for the right answer. 
                         It wants us to put in the missing 
                         pair of chromosomes.

                                     LUKE

                                     MCCONNELL
                         To prove that we're human.

               Terri and Luke look at each other, starting to understand.

                                     LUKE
                         We fired radar into that thing. 
                         Concentrated sound waves...

                                     MCCONNELL
                         Which it interpreted as a wrong 
                         answer... Yes! It's like a, a security 
                         alarm. When it gets an incorrect 
                         response, it defends itself.

               INT. ERV COCKPIT. DAY

               Phil is listening in on radio. He's got panels open, wires 
               dangling, as he works his ongoing repair. He keys his mike, 
               uneasily.

                                     PHIL
                         So what happens when it gets the

               INT. MARS ONE HAB. DAY

               As McConnell looks at Luke and Terri.

                                     MCCONNELL
                              (hesitates)
                         I don't know. But we've got to find 
                         out.
                              (to Luke, pointing)
                         Can you work this the other way? 
                         Figure out which tones would be 
                         equivalent to the missing chromosomes? 
                         Then dub them into your recording of 
                         the signal?

                                     LUKE
                         I think so, yes.

                                     MCCONNELL
                         What about the radar gun? Will it 
                         accept that input? Can we transmit a 
                         completed signal back to the Face?

               Luke stares at him, startled by what he's implying.

               INT. ERV COCKPIT. DAY

               Phil is also growing increasingly nervous.

                                     PHIL
                         Whoa, whoa, hold on, Jim. What if 
                         you're wrong? Whoever goes out 
                         there... I mean, what if you're wrong? 
                         Three people have already died over 
                         that thing.

               INT. MARS ONE HAB. DAY

               As Luke and Terri look tensely at McConnell.

                                     TERRI
                         Four.

               McConnell looks at her.

                                     MCCONNELL
                         Terri, if we leave here without 
                         getting some answers, they all died 
                         in vain.

               Terri shakes her head.

                                     TERRI
                         We just don't know enough about that -- 
                         that thing out there to take any 
                         more chances.

                                     MCCONNELL
                         What are we here for, if not to take 
                         chances...?

               His passion startles them; they've never seen him so 
               emotional. He points at the computer screen.

                                     MCCONNELL
                         This means we're not alone. It means 
                         we're on the brink of the greatest 
                         discovery in mankind's history. But 
                         we've still got to prove it. Who 
                         knows when someone else will get 
                         back here? Or if they ever will? You 
                         know what Congress is like. They'll 
                         say it's too dangerous, too much 
                         loss of life, let's go back to 
                         unmanned flights. We could be the 
                         last explorers to come here for 
                         decades. We're it, guys.
                              (pause)
                         We're it.

                                     LUKE
                              (quietly)
                         We don't have to go out there. There's 
                         a better way.

               They look at him, surprised.

               The familiar, plucky little figure of ARES-8 wheels across 
               ocher sand, with the radar gun jury-rigged onto its back. 
               Ares' video snout WHIRRS out, extending. The familiar bass 
               rumble of the Face is very loud from here.

               McConnell, Terri, and Phil have gathered around Luke as he 
               pushes buttons, and a monitor CRACKLES to life. White streaks, 
               then a blurry image, which he tries to enhance. Finally the

               ON THE MONITOR

               They see the familiar stark white profile of the FACE, shot 
               from ground level, in a SLOWLY APPROACHING ANGLE...

               THE FOUR ASTRONAUTS

               Stare at the ominous sight. They're all more nervous than 
               they want to show. Luke's fingers delicately work a joystick 
               as he maneuvers the remote surveyor.

                                     MCCONNELL

                         I'm not sure. Maybe we better stop 
                         by that boulder.

               EXT. MARS. THE FACE. LATE DAY

               Ares-8 whines to a stop by a large boulder, which partially 
               shields it from the Face, looming beyond. The radar gun 
               swivels, locating its target. Then stops, ready to fire.

               INT. MARS ONE HAB. LATE DAY

               Luke looks at Terri, Phil, and McConnell. Phil shuts the lid 
               of the box holding the new nav boards, snaps it protectively 
               down. He nods. Terri takes a deep breath, then she nods.

               Luke's hand hovers over the red firing button; a moment of 
               awesome uncertainty and danger. He looks at McConnell, who 
               finally gives a nod of command. Then Luke hits the button.

               EXT. MARS. THE FACE. LATE DAY

               From the radar gun on Ares-8's back, a sharp, high-pitched 
               electronic burst is emitted, pulsating like a tuning fork as 
               it's fired towards the Face. After a few seconds it stops.

               For a moment nothing happens.

               Then the deep bass rumbling stops as well. The only remaining 
               sound is of WIND, stirring up dust on the Martian plains.

               ANGLE ON THE FACE

               As suddenly a huge, curved segment of the white surface begins 
               to rise from the earth, like a gigantic hangar door, sliding 
               out of sight into an upper sheath of some kind. The movement 
               is measured, stately, utterly silent. As the segment rises, 
               it reveals a blinding white light: the interior of the Face. 
               No inside details can be seen.

               INT. MARS ONE HAB. DAY

               McConnell, Luke, Terri and Phil stare at this phenomenon, 
               awed. They're barely breathing.

                                     PHIL

                         Check for radiation.

               Luke punches buttons, waits anxiously for a readout.

                                     LUKE
                         Normal. Seismic... normal. Anemometer 
                         steady. No sign of the vortex.

                                     PHIL
                         I don't know what we did, but guys -- 
                         does that look to you like a hostile 
                         gesture?

                                     TERRI
                         No. More like an invitation.

                                     LUKE
                         Or another test...

               McConnell is staring at the mysterious opening. On his face, 
               a growing look of determination.

                                     MCCONNELL
                         Luke, the four-man rover. Does it 
                         still work?

               The others look at him, their expressions changing as they 
               realize what he's implying.

               EXT. MARS ONE BASE CAMP. LATE DAY

               McConnell, once again helmeted, emerges from the Hab airlock. 
               Luke, Terri and Phil are coming out behind him. The wind has 
               picked up, and fine dust is blowing. They stop, staring off 
               in astonishment towards

               A FRIGHTENING SIGHT

               The entire sky has darkened from its customary salmon into 
               purplish-black at the horizon, with bloody streaks above. 
               The DUST STORM has turned their way; it's now sixty kilometers 
               away and closing. The main body of it reaches two thousand 
               meters above the surface and stretches out along a thousand-
               kilometer front.

               THE ASTRONAUTS

               Stare at this unholy juggernaut, alarmed. McConnell turns to 
               Luke, whose expression is grim.

                                     MCCONNELL
                         How long before it hits?

                                     LUKE
                         An hour? Maybe less.

                                     MCCONNELL
                         How bad?

                                     LUKE
                         A storm like that? It could go 
                         planetary. And last a year.

               McConnell stares at him.

                                     LUKE
                         It'll sock us in, Jim. We won't be 
                         able to take off. If that happens, 
                         with what few supplies we've got 
                         left...? We'll starve to death.

               McConnell turns, staring off towards the killer storm. The 
               others look at him with questioning gazes. He turns again. 
               There's the four-man rover, ready to go. Waiting.

                                     MCCONNELL
                         Phil, how much longer to prep the 
                         ERV?

                                     PHIL
                         Maybe forty-five minutes. It'll be 
                         tight, but we can make it.

                                     MCCONNELL
                         Then there's still time for us to 
                         get out there and back.

               He looks a question at Luke and Terri, one after the other. 
               Their eyes, tense but excited, signal agreement.

                                     MCCONNELL
                         Stay here. Continue the repair. If 
                         something goes wrong, you get out of 
                         here before that storm hits.

                                     PHIL
                         Go back... alone?

                                     MCCONNELL
                         If we're not back in forty-five 
                         minutes, I want you to prep and 
                         launch.
                              (looks at his armpad 
                              display)
                         That's 1950 hours.

                                     PHIL
                         Jim --

                                     MCCONNELL
                         It's not a suggestion, it's an order. 
                         You understand?

                                     PHIL
                              (reluctantly)
                         I understand. But --

                                     MCCONNELL
                         You understand what?

                                     PHIL
                         If you're not back by 1950, I prep 
                         and launch.

               McConnell nods, satisfied. Looks at Terri and Luke.

                                     MCCONNELL
                         Let's go.

               They start towards the four-man rover. Dust is swirling more 
               thickly through the air, and the WIND IS LOUDER NOW. Phil 
               stands watching them go, a lone, rather forlorn figure.

               EXT. PLAINS OF CYDONIA. DUSK

               In a WIDE SHOT, we see the rover approaching the Face, across 
               the plains. The sky beyond the Face is almost black, as the 
               storm approaches from that direction. It's marching 
               relentlessly across the planet, with flashes of lightning 
               now rippling up and down its face, and even small tornadoes 
               spinning off near its purple-black base...

               INT. ERV COCKPIT. DUSK

               Phil has panels off. He's reaching into the guts of the main 
               computer, working feverishly. His repair kit is beside him.

               EXT. MARS. THE FACE. DUSK

               In a HIGH SHOT, we look down across the side of the Face and 
               its vast, open doorway, out of which the bright white light 
               is streaming. Into this corridor of light, we see the rover 
               arrive, slewing to a stop, throwing sand from its wheels.

               GROUND LEVEL SHOT

               Looking at the cavernous vertical gap in the side of the 
               Face. The opening towers to a dizzying height above us; the 
               white light strains our eyes. The three astronauts ENTER 
               FRAME as we see them, from behind, staring up.

               ON THE ASTRONAUTS' AWED FACES

               As they are stunned by the immensity of the scene, the cosmic 
               mystery before them. Luke and Terri look at McConnell. Another 
               moment of critical decision. He keys his mike.

                                     MCCONNELL
                         Phil, do you read me?

               INT. ERV COCKPIT. DUSK

               Phil keys his own mike.

                                     PHIL
                         Yeah, Jim. Your signal's breaking up 
                         a little in the storm, but I read 
                         you.

               EXT. THE FACE. DUSK

               McConnell stares into the bright opening. Bathed in its light.

                                     MCCONNELL
                         We're at the Face. We're gonna need 
                         a few minutes here. Same deadline, 
                         launch at 1950. With or without us. 
                         Do you copy?

                                     PHIL
                              (pause)
                         Copy that.

               Terri and Luke exchange a tense glance.

                                     TERRI
                         Jim, are you sure you want to do 
                         this?

                                     MCCONNELL
                         I'm not sure of anything anymore. 
                         But I didn't come a hundred million 
                         miles just to turn back in the last 
                         ten feet.

               Luke smiles. The three of them stare into the portal. 
               McConnell, between the others, reaches out and grips each of 
               them by a gloved hand. They take a sort of collective breath. 
               Then they walk forward together, into the light.

               INT. THE FACE. DUSK

               The astronauts continue forward, each of them extending a 
               free hand.

               The light is too dazzling for them to gauge distances, 
               textures, colors -- anything at all. They can't see walls, 
               ceiling, even a floor.

                                     MCCONNELL
                         Surface seems firm and level.

                                     LUKE
                         Roger that. Texture is smooth.

                                     TERRI
                         I've got good footing and no 
                         obstructions. Let's check our --

               Behind them, there is an abrupt WHOOOSH, like a giant airlock 
               sealing shut. They turn, startled and nervous. Letting go of 
               each other's hands, Luke and Terri run back the way they 
               came, but almost immediately are stopped by a wall of some 
               sort. The vast hangar-type door has closed behind them.

                                     TERRI
                         It's solid again! We're trapped.

                                     MCCONNELL
                         Don't move! Keep this orientation.

               The three scared, helmeted faces seem to float in the 
               brightness, some twenty feet apart.

                                     MCCONNELL
                              (keys his mike)
                         Phil? Phil, can you still hear me?

               INT. ERV COCKPIT. DUSK

               Phil, saying a silent prayer, reaches over and turns on the 
               main computer. It works! He's immensely relieved.

                                     PHIL
                         Computers are online! Ready to load 
                         software. But guys -- we're losing 
                         visibility here.

               He glances out the cockpit window at the blowing dust. Then 
               realizes that he's hearing only silence over his radio.

                                     PHIL
                         Guys...? Jim? Luke? Terri? Is anyone 
                         there...?

               No answer. Phil stares at his radio in dread.

                                     PHIL
                         Don't leave me.

               INT. FACE. DUSK

               McConnell is staring at his spacesuit's sleeve. He can see 
               that the suit material is starting to deflate, revealing the 
               shape of his arm, just as it did in Luke's greenhouse. He 
               hesitates, then begins to unscrew the sealing ring on his 
               right glove.

               Terri and Luke see this.

                                     TERRI
                              (alarmed)
                         Jim, what're you doing? You'll 
                         depressurize!

                                     MCCONNELL
                         I don't think so.

               McConnell makes the final twist on his glove and there's the 
               hiss of rushing air.

                                     LUKE
                         Jim, seal it!

                                     MCCONNELL
                         No. That was air going into my suit, 
                         not out. Look at your own suits -- 
                         they're not rigid anymore. We've got 
                         pressure in here.

               Luke looks at his sleeve. McConnell's right.

                                     TERRI
                         Above Mars atmospheric? That's 
                         impossible.

                                     MCCONNELL
                         We're millions of miles from Earth 
                         and we're inside a gigantic white 
                         face. What's impossible?

               Terri types on her arm keypad. She's amazed.

                                     TERRI
                         There's six psi in here...
                              (taps more keys)
                         Nitrogen and oxygen.

                                     LUKE
                         Otherwise known as air?

               Terri nods. McConnell starts unscrewing his helmet ring. 
               Luke follows suit.

                                     TERRI
                         Hey, there may be some lethal trace 
                         gasses I haven't picked up yet, or... 
                         or... oh, the hell with it.

               Terri starts taking off her helmet. In a few moments, all 
               three helmets are off. They hold them, glowing softly, against 
               their chests, as they breathe deeply and gratefully. Air. 
               And then, at this very moment, as if they have just passed 
               another kind of test...

               HIGH, STRIATED WALL

               Appears through the glare, soaring up before their startled 
               eyes. White, metallic, composed of complexly-linked bands, 
               plates, ramps. It's part of a STRUCTURE whose overall height 
               and breadth keep us from understanding its purpose. But the 
               hatch opening slowly in its side, at the top of an approach 
               ramp, is unmistakable. Radiant white light streams out from 
               within, forming a glowing tunnel, down towards the astronauts.

               THE ASTRONAUTS BLINK

               Raising their gloves against the dazzling glow. At the end 
               of this tunnel of light, inside the hatch frame

               A SHAPE MATERIALIZES

               And slowly resolves itself into a glowing humanoid form, 
               which we somehow sense is female. She appears benign, 
               wondrous. This glowing MARTIAN -- a holograph -- regards the 
               astronauts for a few moments, then beckons to them, as if to 
               say "Enter." All her motions are both calm and calming -- 
               precise, unhurried, gracious.

               MCCONNELL, LUKE AND TERRI

               Look at each other. They're awed into silence, and still 
               tense, but now more out of excitement and anticipation than 
               fear. Their eyes agree: Let's go.

               They walk forward slowly, carrying their helmets, up the 
               ramp and into the tunnel of light, following the Martian, 
               who retreats before them. They go through the hatch and 
               disappear inside.

               INT. MARTIAN STRUCTURE. DUSK

               Following the Martian, they find themselves in a round, open 
               space, defined by light, with a smooth matte-metallic floor, 
               but without apparent walls.

               The Martian stops, turns, facing them. The astronauts stop, 
               too, uncertain what they're meant to do. Then the Martian 
               gestures again.

               A cylindrical holographic column appears, rising from the 
               floor in front of the astronauts. Inside it, a swirl of eerie 
               lights, millions of them, like cosmic fireflies...

               MCCONNELL, LUKE, AND TERRI

               Set down their helmets, then cautiously converge around this 
               column, forming a loose triangle. As they stare into it, the 
               myriad lights are reflected off their own eyes and their 
               spacesuits.

               IN THE HOLOGRAPHIC COLUMN

               The whirling lights resolve into images, which relate to 
               them the story of ancient Mars:

               A BLUE PLANET

               we do not recognize. All is peaceful, beautiful.

               INTERCUT

                                     MCCONNELL
                              (softly)
                         Is that what I think it is?

                                     LUKE
                         Yeah. It's Mars.

               SUDDENLY A HUGE ASTEROID

               Tumbles through space towards the planet...

                                     TERRI
                         Oh my God.

               ON THE PLANET - CLOSER VIEW

               As thousands of small rocketships lift away from the surface, 
               heading in a stream out of the solar system...

               THE ASTEROID IMPACTS

               And a wall of fire and debris scours the planet. Oceans boil 
               and vaporize. Two gigantic hunks are blasted out of the 
               planet, spinning in flames...

               MCCONNELL, LUKE, AND TERRI

               Involuntarily flinch, bathed in the fiery images...

               THE PLANET IS NOW DEAD

               As dust storms roil across its cold, lifeless surface. The 
               flaming hunks of molten rock cool into twin moons.

               THE ASTRONAUTS

               Stare at this devastation, deeply moved.

               IN DEEP SPACE

               The stream of Martian ships grows smaller and smaller as it 
               continues on its epic voyage towards a new solar system. 
               Then we zero in on

               ONE PARTICULAR ROCKETSHIP

               As it peels off and goes in another direction. Graphics show 
               a model of what the ship contains: the familiar double helix 
               of DNA. The ship heads towards another blue planet in our 
               solar system...

               EARTH

               As it was then. More clouds than now, more ocean, and the 
               landforms all wedged together.

               TERRI

               Her voice is soft.

                                     TERRI
                         Earth, when it was still Pangaea. 
                         Before the continents separated.

               THE LONE MARTIAN SHIP

               Makes a fiery streak through Earth's atmosphere and plunges 
               into the ocean.

               Instantly the image of the DNA double helix grows, filling 
               the entire holographic column, then it begins to spin and 
               pulse, disintegrating into a phantasmagoric whirl of new 
               images...

               MCCONNELL, LUKE, AND TERRI

               Cry out, stunned by the strobelike power of the display as

               LIVING FORMS

               Flash into the holographic column, swimming, growing, 
               crawling, leaping, flying: one-celled microscopic organisms, 
               plankton, plants of all kinds, insects, then fish, dinosaurs, 
               birds, small mammals, larger mammals -- the entire stunning 
               panorama of evolution, distilled into a single explosive 
               sequence, as the images wash over the dazzled, awestruck

               FACES OF THE ASTRONAUTS

               Until finally the images whirl away, the holographic column 
               dissolves, leaving only a circle of glowing, concentric, 
               colored rings on the floor. The astronauts are left staring 
               at each other across the open space where the column had 
               been.

               THE MARTIAN

               Now comes forward with outstretched arms and completes their 
               circle, taking the fourth position. McConnell is opposite 
               her glowing form, and Terri and Luke are at either side. The 
               Martian reaches her arms out, inviting them to link hands. 
               As they do so, the Martian seems to be staring directly into 
               McConnell's eyes.

               MCCONNELL

               Is in wondrous awe, his whole face radiant with joy. It's 
               the first time we've ever seen him utterly without sadness 
               or reserve. Staring at the Martian, he understands.

                                     MCCONNELL
                         They're us. We're them...

                                     LUKE
                         We're Martians...?

                                     MCCONNELL
                         That's what she means.

                                     TERRI
                         Oh my God. The Cambrian explosion.

               McConnell and Luke look at her.

                                     TERRI
                         Almost six hundred million years 
                         ago, there was a sudden expansion of 
                         life on Earth. The first multi-celled 
                         plants and animals appeared. No one 
                         has ever understood why...

                                     LUKE
                         They seeded Earth.

               We hear a BELL-LIKE TONE, a single lingering high note, and 
               simultaneously the outermost ring of the circle on the floor 
               begins to glow brightly. It is an intense chromium yellow.

               THE ASTRONAUTS

               Step back, startled, unlinking their hands, and look at the 
               circle of colored rings. These shade from yellow, on the 
               outer rim, to a deeper yellow, then orange, then finally 
               reds. Inside the final, deep red ring is a circle of indigo 
               blue, about a meter across. Small points of light glitter 
               here, like stars against a midnight sky.

               THE MARTIAN

               Steps closer to McConnell. She has picked him out in 
               particular. Now she beckons for him to move inside the circle 
               of colored rings, to stand on the indigo core.

               MCCONNELL

               Looks back at her, nods his understanding. For the first 
               time she seems to smile. Benevolence, reassurance. Then as 
               abruptly as she first appeared, she fades away. Vanishes.

               Luke and Terri look at McConnell, confused. There is a sudden, 
               static-filled CRACKLE from their helmets, nearby on the floor.

                                     PHIL
                              (over radio)
                         ...in, please. Can you... me?

               Terri picks up her helmet, leans into its mike.

                                     TERRI
                         Phil, we're here! We read you.

               Even through the scratchy interference, they can hear the 
               relief in Phil's voice. And then the desperation.

                                     PHIL
                         Thank God! Listen, this storm is 
                         really --
                              (loud static)
                         -- few more minutes, I can't --
                              (more static)
                         You've gotta get back to the ship!

               And then they hear only STATIC. His signal is lost.

                                     TERRI
                         Phil? Phil...?

               Suddenly the BELL-LIKE TONE REPEATS, at a lower register, 
               with a more sustained note, and simultaneously, the last of 
               the yellow circles of light begins to fade, as

               THE FIRST ORANGE BAND

               Begins to glow brighter. McConnell turns, looking at this 
               new color, then looks back at Luke and Terri.

                                     MCCONNELL
                         We are in a ship. This is a ship. 
                         And the countdown has already started.

               Terri looks at Luke, alarmed.

                                     LUKE
                         He's right.

                                     TERRI
                         Then let's get the hell out of here!

               She scoops up Luke's helmet, tosses it to him. As he catches 
               it, she's already starting back out, in the direction they 
               came from, and Luke follows her. Until they both become aware 
               that McConnell isn't with them. They turn back. He's still 
               rooted to the spot, his gaze locked on the indigo core of 
               the colored rings.

                                     LUKE
                         Jim...

               McConnell doesn't turn.

                                     LUKE
                         Jim, we gotta go.

                                     MCCONNELL
                         I'm not coming with you.

                                     TERRI
                              (stunned)
                         What?

               Coming back, she sees how calm he is. How certain.

                                     TERRI
                         What are you talking about? We've 
                         got to get home.

                                     MCCONNELL
                         That's where I'm going. Don't you 
                         see? That's what all this is for.
                              (McConnell gestures 
                              at the ship around 
                              them)
                         You were right Terri. This is an 
                         invitation. To follow them. To follow 
                         them home.

               He looks into their faces. Terri is trying to grasp this 
               idea, still incredulous. Luke has the beginning of a half 
               smile.

                                     MCCONNELL
                         I have to go. This is the mission 
                         now. To find out who we are. Isn't 
                         that why we came here? Like Maggie 
                         said, "To stand on a new world and 
                         look beyond it to the next one."

               Luke nods at the memory of Maggie's words. Terri remembers 
               too. McConnell's passionate conviction is affecting them 
               both.

                                     MCCONNELL
                         You know, when you think about it -- 
                         I wasn't even supposed to be here -- 
                         all the accidents, everything that 
                         got us to this point, it's just... 
                         it's just... I just know it's right.

               Terri looks at Luke. Luke is smiling. He understands.

                                     MCCONNELL
                         I'm okay. I know what I'm doing. But 
                         you're running out of time. You've 
                         gotta get back to the ERV and get 
                         off this planet. Now please go.

               Luke steps closer, looking at his old friend.

                                     LUKE
                         I once felt like I was taking your 
                         turn. But now I think maybe you're 
                         taking mine. Guess I'm a little 
                         jealous.

               They clasp hands for a moment. But in this moment is a 
               lifetime of camaraderie, an eternity of farewell.

                                     LUKE
                         Thanks for saving my life.

                                     MCCONNELL
                         My pleasure.

               Luke nods, deeply moved. He turns away, picking up his helmet, 
               as Terri comes closer, looking at McConnell, a long unspoken 
               beat. Her eyes are glistening.

                                     TERRI
                         I wish Woody were here to see this. 
                         He would've wanted to go too, Jim.

               Terri smiles. She is starting on the road to recovery. She's 
               going to be okay.

                                     MCCONNELL
                         He's here, Terri. We wouldn't have 
                         made it without him.

               Terri nods. She digs into one of her suit's pockets, pulls 
               something out. She hands it to McConnell, and his fist closes 
               around it.

                                     TERRI
                         Take care, Jim.

               McConnell smiles. Terri smiles back at him. Then she turns, 
               picks up her helmet, and crosses to where Luke has paused, 
               looking back.

                                     LUKE
                         Hey, Jim...?

                                     MCCONNELL
                         Yeah?

                                     LUKE
                         Have a great ride.

               Luke and Terri exchange a final silent farewell with him, 
               then hurry away, into the darkness.

               MCCONNELL

               Looks down at what Terri gave him.

               IT'S WOODY'S NECK CHAIN

               With the little Flash Gordon rocketship.

               MCCONNELL

               Grips this tightly as he looks up.

               The hanger-like hatch has reopened, and Luke and Terri, 
               helmeted again, emerge from the Face. The leading edge of 
               the dust storm is upon them. They can't see much more than a 
               few meters.

               As they reach the rover, they hear, even in this chaos, that 
               the deep pulsing tone of the Face has started again. They 
               look at each other, uncertain what this means. But McConnell 
               is now beyond their help. Luke keys his mike.

                         I can barely read you. Let's get the

                         Is anyone there? Can anyone read me?

               Phil gets no response. He is shaking, almost crying. He 
               hesitates, then starts hitting some keys.

               INT. MARTIAN SPACESHIP. NIGHT

               McConnell has shed his backpack, with its unneeded oxygen 
               tank. He steps cautiously onto the colored rings. Nothing 
               seems to happen. Moving further, he takes his place on the 
               indigo circle at their core. He looks at

               THE GLOWING TAKE-OFF COUNTDOWN INDICATOR

               As it dips from orange into red; the BELL TONES are continuous 
               now, very deep and rapid.

               EXT. PLAINS OF CYDONIA. NIGHT

               The rover, with Luke and Terri inside, races away towards 
               the safety of the ERV, as the maelstrom boils over the Face 
               behind them. The sky is purplish black, thick with flying 
               debris and eerie lightning flashes. Towering billows of dust 
               chase them over the plain, nearly enveloping them as they 
               speed towards us, passing OUT OF FRAME.

               INT. MARTIAN SPACESHIP. NIGHT

               McConnell reacts, surprised, as suddenly

               A TRANSPARENT, GLASS-LIKE CYLINDER

               Begins to rise around him, swiftly and smoothly, coming up 
               from the circumference of the indigo circle.

               Then a second, identical cylinder -- the top half -- drops 
               down from somewhere overhead. The two sections meet and fuse 
               in a flash of light, containing McConnell inside them, as 
               neatly as if he were in a giant, transparent mailing tube.

               MCCONNELL

               Fights against a stab of claustrophobia. Is he being 
               imprisoned? Or somehow protected? Either way, he's virtually 
               immobilized. In this tight space in his bulky suit, he can't 
               even move his arms. Only his head and neck can still shift.

               INT. ERV COCKPIT. NIGHT

               Phil is going over his final pre-launch checklist, flipping 
               switches and pressing buttons. He looks at his

               DIGITAL CLOCK

               Which reads "1350."

               PHIL IS STRICKEN, TORMENTED

               His finger hovers over a "Fire" button. He licks his lips 
               nervously, squeezes his eyes shut, and hits the button.

               And the words: "IGNITION SEQUENCE INITIATED"

               INT. MARTIAN SPACESHIP. NIGHT

               McConnell is straining inside the cylinder that surrounds 
               him, when something catches his attention. He arches his 
               neck, looking down.

               A COBALT-BLUE TRANSPARENT LIQUID

               Is beginning to fill the cylinder! It swirls in, from some 
               unknown source, rising rapidly; already his lower boots are 
               covered.

               MCCONNELL'S EYES

               Widen in alarm. He strains against the sides of the cylinder 
               but

               HIS GLOVED HANDS

               Slide helplessly across the smooth surface.

               MCCONNELL

               Looks down again.

               THE COBALT LIQUID

               Is up to his knees. Now his thighs...

               MCCONNELL

               Cranes his neck, staring up. Can he wedge himself higher, 
               can he somehow climb to safety?

               ABOVE HIM

               The entire "ceiling" of the Face is becoming translucent. He 
               can see the dust storm, boiling overhead. And now, rising 
               into this, are fiery coils of energy from the Face itself. 
               These swirl and twist in every direction, like angry water 
               snakes; battered by the fierce winds. Two vast forces on a 
               collision course.

               INT. ROVER. NIGHT

               Luke drives the rover through the blinding storm, as Terri 
               stares at a dashboard computer screen. They have to shout to 
               be heard over the ROARING WIND.

                                     TERRI

                         Don't worry! I've worked with Phil 
                         for four years! I know Jim gave him 
                         a direct order, but he won't leave 
                         without us.

               EXT. PLAINS OF CYDONIA. NIGHT

               The Rover races towards us, the front of the storm chasing 
               it from behind, then completely overtaking the Rover. It 
               disappears from view!

               INT. ERV COCKPIT. NIGHT

               Phil sits in the pilot's seat. He is looking at a computer 
               graphic that shows the engines readying to launch. With 
               resignation, he keys his mike.

                                     PHIL
                         This is ERV, do you read? ERV to 
                         Rover, do you read...?

               Phil waits a second, then reaches slowly for a blinking red 
               switch that reads "LAUNCH." He hesitates, then actually has 
               his fingers on it, about to flip it, when he hears a crackle 
               of static on the radio. Phil keys his mike.

                                     PHIL

                         in.

               And Phil chokes back a sob. Blinking back the tears, he tries 
               to compose himself, then keys his mike.

                                     PHIL
                         Uh, Phil's not here right now. He 
                         left for Earth five minutes ago.

               EXT. THE FACE. NIGHT

               FROM GROUND LEVEL we see that the coils of energy are rising 
               from the forehead of the Face, from its "third eye," spinning 
               and looping faster and faster, starting to form a vortex. 
               But unlike the wind vortex that killed the Mars One crew, 
               this is a vortex of fire. As we watch, more fiery streaks 
               begin to emerge from the sides of the Face, from the chin, 
               cheeks and temples. These all rush upwards, like lava flowing 
               uphill, gathering in intensity as they leap free of the Face 
               itself and spiral into the atmosphere. The peak of the forming 
               vortex is already piercing the lowest layer of storm clouds, 
               causing a dark counter-swirl.

               EXT. MARS ONE BASE CAMP. NIGHT

               Phil stands at the bottom of the ERV's ladder, gripping it 
               to steady himself, staring into the swirling dust.

               THE ROVER appears out of the dust and sand, the immense storm 
               seeming to chase it from behind. Luke and Terri climb out, 
               struggle towards him through the wind. Phil grips their hands, 
               helping them over to the ladder. He looks back, confused.

                                     PHIL

               LOOKING DOWN INTO THE CYLINDER, we see that the cobalt-blue 
               fluid has risen to McConnell's upper chest. Now it's at his 
               shoulders! It pours into his suit through his neck ring.

               He strains on tiptoes, craning his head back, trying to keep 
               his unhelmeted face above the rising liquid.

               He sucks in deep desperate gulps of air, his head thrashing 
               from side to side. Then suddenly the fluid is over his mouth, 
               his nose, his forehead. His whole body is submerged!

               The level of fluid continues to rise towards the unseen top 
               of the cylinder.

               MCCONNELL

               Squeezes his eyes shut, holding his breath. Not so much 
               fighting this anymore as simply floating in place, waiting 
               for his inevitable death...

               side, pushing back the swirling storm that surrounds the 
               Face. As the vortex coalesces its energy into a cylindrical 
               shape, we see through its center to a rising form -- the 
               Martian ship. It is a flattened convex circle whose matte-
               metallic angles replicate the "Face" imagery.

               The vortex is now a tight, rapidly spinning cylinder. As it

               Is spinning and shaking too, more and more violently, as the 
               huge buildup of G-forces tears at his body. We're reminded 
               of Nick Willis just before the vortex exploded him; is the 
               same thing about to happen to McConnell?

               His eyes remain tightly shut, bubbles are streaming from his 
               lips. His last breath is nearly exhausted, it's being shaken 
               from his lungs.

               a SERIES of rapid-fire, almost subliminal IMAGES FROM THE 
               PAST. We recognize each one. Previously, though, we saw them 
               as still photos; now they have movement, life, and we view 
               them from new and slightly different angles. These images 
               INTERCUT with glimpses of McConnell's pale, shaking, near-

               Time itself seems to stop.

               McConnell opens his eyes, staring STRAIGHT AT US. And then, 
               fully accepting his fate, he throws his head back, opens his 
               mouth and takes in a deep lungful of the fluid. He can breathe 
               it.

               His eyes widen in surprise and understanding. He can breathe 
               it! This fluid will keep him alive! His whole body relaxes, 
               the tension draining from his head and shoulders, as he fully 
               trusts this launch for the first time. And then, with his 
               eyes wide open, he sees, from memory, one final image...

               specific point in the stars. Then the Martian ship -- a 
               rounded darker form, little more than a blip within the vast, 
               blue-white column of energy -- shoots away from the surface,

               vastness still boiling orange and brown across the planet's 
               surface, which it now completely covers.

               As the Martian ship flashes by us, it passes another ship, 
               much smaller and slower, rising through the storm clouds on 
               a different trajectory. We recognize the familiar, comfortable

               just starting to level off, when suddenly their cockpit 
               interior is starkly bathed in white light. They wince at the 
               unearthly radiance, shielding their faceplates with gloved 
               hands.

                                     TERRI
                         Dear God. Look at that.

               Through their cockpit window, they watch the Martian ship 
               hurtle by them at a hundred times their speed.

                                     PHIL
                         Is that him?

               Luke nods. Their eyes are glistening. Luke's voice is a 
               whisper, both of prayer and farewell.

                                     LUKE
                         Godspeed Jim McConnell.

               EXT. SPACE

               Looking through the cockpit window we see the Martian ship 
               receding into the infinite distance of space -- a long blue-
               white scratch that in moments begins to fade. Finally it is 
               a tiny point of light, taking its place amongst the limitless 
               expanse of the star-filled heavens.

                                         THE END

    Helium3 is a gas ejected from the surface of the sun and
    blown through space by solar winds.

    It plays an essential role in Cold Fusion, often toted as
    the solution to humanity's future energy needs.

    There is one major problem...

    Helium3 is extremely scarce on Earth. The gas does,
    however, exist in abundance on the Earth's only natural
    satellite:

    The Moon.

    Should we turn to Cold Fusion in the future, it is
    conceivable that man will mine the Moon for Helium3 and
    bring the precious gas back to Earth...

                                                                          2.




                                                 IN THE BLACK:

    We hear something -- a machine -- CHURNING and POUNDING.
    Constant. Rhythmic. Though the sound is slightly familiar,
    we're not sure what it is yet. Hold for a few seconds and
    then

                                                      CUT TO:


1   INT. REC ROOM -- MORNING                                      1

    The sound belongs to a regular old TREADMILL like you see
    in most gyms across the world. Running on it: SAM BELL, mid
    thirties, thick beard, handsome, striking blue eyes.

    Sam's face is flushed and glistening with sweat. He lunges
    for a towel draped over the treadmill's bar, dabs his face
    as he runs.

    We see OUTSIDE THE WINDOW: A gray, powdery landscape
    stretching beneath a BLACK SKY.

                                                      CUT TO:


2   EXT. MOON -- MORNING                                          2

    Aerial view of the Earth's only natural satellite, the
    camera roaming about a hundred feet off the surface.

    Desolation. Serious, uncompromising, desolation. This place
    makes Antarctica look like Tokyo.

    And utter silence.

    Eventually the camera arrives at a moon base, DIVING DOWN
    towards it --

    TITLE CARD: "MINING BASE SELENE. CREW: 1."

                                                      CUT TO:


3   INT. BATHROOM\SHOWER -- MORNING                               3

    Sam takes a shower, treading in a tight circle beneath the
    nozzle, eyes closed, hot water blasting his face.

                                                                       3.




4   INT. COMMS ROOM                                               4

    His hair still wet from the shower, Sam sits before a COMMS
    UNIT, dressed in a "Lunar Industries" boiler suit, a zip up
    the front, colorful patches sewn into the arms. He begins
    to record a message.

                        SAM
              Tess. Hi. It's me. How are you,
              sweetheart? It's the morning
              here. In a few minutes Gerty and
              I will sit down for breakfast, go
              over the day's itinerary.

    As Sam continues his message, we are given a TOUR of the
    mining base. Beginning with:


5   INT. MONITORING STATION                                       5

    This is where you want to be if the shit hits the fan. The
    base's equivalent of HQ. A wall of computers and flickering
    digital displays.

                        SAM (V.O.)
              Today begins my 154th week on
              Selene. I officially have two
              weeks to go before I climb into
              that Return Vehicle...


6   INT. RETURN VEHICLE                                           6

    A small space craft attached to the base. It is essentially
    a tiny room with a coffin like, sealed bed in the middle of
    it: a cryogenic POD with an array of complicated controls
    surrounding it.

                        SAM (V.O.)
              And blast home.


7   INT. REC ROOM                                                 7

    Sam spends most of his time here. It is kitchen and play
    room combined. We PICK OUT a television set, an armchair, a
    Ping-Pong table, the treadmill.

                        SAM (V.O.)
              I never dreamed I'd make it this
              far.

                                                                           4.




     DETAIL: A WOODEN MODEL

     On a table, we also PICK OUT a LARGE MODEL carved out of
     BOLSER WOOD. It's a TOWN. Intricately done down to the
     tiniest details.

                         SAM (V.O.) (CONT'D)
               There were times, as you know...

     We go even CLOSER to the model, seeing that there are
     actual people, actual characters in the little town; actual
     buildings: a CHURCH, a TOWN HALL, etc. Clearly someone has
     put a ton of work into this thing.

                         SAM (V.O.) (CONT'D)
               ...when I thought I was going to
               crack up.


8    INT. GREENHOUSE                                               8

     And the tour of the base continues. Onto a new room. A dark         
     storage area Sam has repurposed to grow a handful of                
     plants. They sit surrounded by darkness, glowing under              
     pools of artificial light.                                          

                         SAM (V.O.)
               But I think I've come out the
               other side now.


9    INT. INFIRMARY                                                9

     A strange angular room, obviously purposeful, but its               
     design more geared to a computer than a human being. A              
     single bed dominates.                                               

                         SAM (V.O.)
               In many ways, this place is all
               about contradictions.


10   EXT. LUNAR LANDSCAPE                                          10

     The empty terrain surrounding the mining base, as viewed
     from the Monitoring Station window. Across the landscape a
     mountain rises from the morning shadows.

                         SAM (V.O.)
               It's bleak, it's beautiful.


     CLOSE UP -- A HAND TOOL

     Some kind of rake or shovel half buried in the powdery
     soil, like a child's toy abandoned in a sand box.

                                                                        5.



                            SAM (V.O.) (CONT'D)
                  It's barren, yet filled with
                  riches.


11   EXT. EARTH -- AS SEEN FROM THE MOON                         11

     From up here it is easy to see why the Earth is sometimes
     referred to as "the blue marble." A swirl of color.

                            SAM (V.O.)
                  The earth is thousands and
                  thousands of miles away, but
                  sometimes looks so close I feel
                  like I could reach out and snatch
                  it with my hand.


12   INT. SLEEPING QUARTERS                                      12

     Sam's bed -- A New York Jets poster on the wall -- a few
     knickknacks bedside, rock samples in jars, a lucky
     tambourine Sam got in Mexico some years ago -- a red stress
     ball -- a photograph by the bed in a frame --

                            SAM (V.O.)
                  I'm incredibly lonely, yet I'm
                  never alone...

     We MOVE CLOSER to the PHOTO by the bed.


     PHOTOGRAPH

     Of a slightly younger and clean-shaven Sam with his arms
     wrapped around his wife of four years, TESS BELL.

                            SAM (V.O.) (CONT'D)
                  Because I have you.

     Tess is a far cry from the stereotypical Astronaut's Wife
     of the 1960's/70's with the plastic smile and beehive
     hairdo.

     Tess is modern, sophisticated, and jaw-droppingly
     beautiful. She looks like she'd be a hard woman to leave
     behind.

     Note: In the photograph Tess is visibly PREGNANT.

                            SAM (V.O.) (CONT'D)
                  And I have Eve. I don't take you
                  guys for granted. You know that
                  now.

                                                                           6.




13   INT. COMMS ROOM                                               13

     Back with Sam at the Comms Unit as he wraps up the message.

                         SAM
               Please kiss Eve for me. And tell
               her daddy will only be away a
               little longer -- seventeen days
               longer, approximately. I love you
               both dearly. Bye.

     And he sends the message.


                                                     CUT TO:


14   INT. CORRIDOR                                                 14

     The main corridor connecting the different rooms. We've
     seen everything there is to see now. The base is small.
     Confined. Claustrophobic. It is easy to imagine how someone
     could crack up here.

     Sam leaves the Comms Room and heads down the corridor.


15   INT. REC ROOM                                                 15

     A state of the art robot, a GERTY 3000 -- known simply as
     "GERTY" -- is preparing Sam's breakfast.

     Gerty is in three sections and moves along a horizontal
     rail that runs throughout the base. He has a readout screen
     that perpetually spews data. His hands resemble pincers,
     but are perfectly nimble.

     For the purposes of helping run the base and looking after
     Sam, Gerty is as good as human, if not better.

     Sam enters.

                         SAM
               Morning, Gerty.

                         GERTY
               Morning, Sam. How are you today?

                         SAM
               Fine. Fine. You?

                         GERTY
               I'm very well. How's your
               headache?

                                                                           7.



                           SAM
                 Much better, thanks, pal.

     Sam treats Gerty more like a person than a robot. Whether
     this is down to Gerty's intelligence or Sam's desperation
     for company isn't clear just yet.

     Note: Gerty talks like a well-educated older man. His
     language doesn't have a great deal of inflection (i.e.
     Monotone) but he is friendly enough.

     Sam switches a dial on a radio but gets nothing but static -
     - he sticks in a mini cd and skips the first few tracks.
     We hear brief clips of talk radio and shuttle through it
     before he allows it to play on, on some random American
     station -- an old weather report:

                           VOICE ON RADIO
                 ...it's a hot one on the East
                 Coast, temperatures soaring to a
                 high of ninety three degrees in
                 New York City --

     They zip around the tiny kitchen, together preparing Sam's
     breakfast, working as a team.

                                                     CUT TO:


16   EXT. MOON                                                     16

     We take in the whole Moon at once. Gray, colorless, eerie.
     From this distance the surface resembling Plaster of Paris.


17   INT. MONITORING STATION -- DAY                                17

     Sam sits before Selene's main computer, known as THE OLD
     MAN. Data flickering off Sam's face. He is making a log
     entry. A CLOCK is running on the monitor.

                           SAM
                 8:32 Pacific Time. Lunar Day 1.
                 All Harvesters running smoothly
                 this morning. Readouts are as
                 follows: Matthew, 14.6 miles;
                 Mark 16.8 miles...

     Sam continues with his entry while we

                                                     CUT TO:

                                                                        8.




18   INT. STORAGE CUBBY                                           18

     Gerty is selecting food for the up-coming week, stacking
     ready-meals on a small fork-lift buggy.

                                                     CUT TO:


19   INT. MONITORING STATION                                      19


     A RED LIGHT

     Pulsing rapidly. The "ping-ping-ping" of an alarm.


     BOARD

     Sam stands before the Big Board. The names of the four
     Harvesters (Matthew, Mark, Luke, John) in a collum. The red
     light is flashing next to Matthew.

     Sam presses an INTERCOM BUTTON, dips down, speaks into it.

                           SAM
                 Gerty, we've got a live one on
                 Mark. I'm going out now to rope
                 her in.

                              GERTY'S VOICE
                 Okay, Sam.

     Sam heads off.


20   INT. CHANGING AREA                                           20

     A SPACE SUIT

     Resembling an unmanned puppet. Sam begins to insinuate his
     body into the suit.


21   INT. DOCK                                                    21

     Three Rovers (moon buggies) parked in their separate bays.
     The Rovers are caked in lunar soil, as though sand blasted.

     In his space suit Sam bends into one of the Rovers, starts
     the engine.

                                                                          9.




22   I/E. ROVER/MOON SURFACE                                      22

     Sam drives along, dwarfed by an enormous lunar bolder and
     the rising slopes of the valley beyond. A toy car in this
     vast and alien terrain.


23   EXT. HARVESTER/MOON SURFACE                                  23

     The second in a fleet of four Harvesters (this one known as
     Mark) collecting lunar soil. The Harvester resembles a tank
     and kicks up clouds of dust. Booming, hulking, efficient.

     Sam catches up in his Rover and accelerates into the back
     of the Harvester up a couple of ramps. An intricate and
     dangerous maneuver he executes deftly.


24   INT. HARVESTER/BELLY -- CONTINUOUS                           24

     Sam is in an area   of the Harvester -- a kind of hatch --
     not dissimilar to   a garage and known as THE BELLY. Once
     safely inside Sam   closes the door. He is able to breathe in
     the Belly without   his helmet, which he duly removes.

     Sam steps up to a wall of computers. A light is flashing to
     indicate one of the pods is filled with Helium3.

     Sam does his thing, eventually removing a keg-size pod of
     Helium3. He hauls it over to the Rover and sticks it in a
     special slot in the equivalent of the Rover's trunk.

     A new pod -- an empty -- replaces the pod Sam just removed.

     Sam puts his helmet back on, returns to the Rover, reverses
     out of the Harvester carefully.


25   I/E. ROVER/MOON SURFACE                                      25

     Sam snakes through the soil on his way back to base, the
     tracks of the Rover as sharp as if they had been made
     through talcum powder. The Harvester churns into the
     distance.

     Sam loads the filled pod into a CARGO CONTAINER. The Cargo
     Container is about the size of a fridge and can take a
     maximum of five pods. There are four pods already inside,
     Sam's new pod taking up the fifth and final slot.

                                                                       10.

     Sam is seated at the Comms Unit recording a message for his
     superiors back on Earth.

                          SAM
                Sam Bell reporting to Central.
                10:14 Pacific Time. Lunar Day 1.
                    (less formal)
                Overmeyers, Thompson? It's Sam.
                How goes it? I've got a full
                container of Helium3 ready to
                roll. The purity is pretty good,
                so assuming your last market
                prices are still relevant I think
                you are looking at getting about
                3 million dollars per kilo with
                this load. By the time this
                message reaches you it should be
                in transit.
                    (a beat)
                Otherwise, everything running
                smoothly. There was a discrepancy
                between a couple of the N3000
                modulators a couple of days ago,
                but Gerty and I caught it in
                time, no big deal. Uh...how are
                things down there?

     Sam desperately wants to talk but has nothing very
     important to say. Then he remembers something.

                          SAM (CONT'D)
                Oh, and I just wanted to thank
                you for sending out the football
                feed. Almost felt live!
                    (getting pissed off)
                Seriously, I don't mean to be an
                asshole, but surely replacing one
                satellite cant be that fucking
                hard! I haven't been able to
                have a conversation with my
                wife... My kid can talk now...!
                Fuck!

     Sam concentrates, getting a grip on his temper.

                Two weeks. Two weeks.
                    (beat)
                Hey. Three years is a long haul.
                If you guys want to run some
                psych evals on me when I get
                back, I'm happy to do it. It
                ain't Disney World up here.

                That's it. Over and out.

     Sam reaches forward, sends the message.

                                                     CUT TO:


28   INT. CORRIDOR -- DAY                                         28

     Sam is loading the Cargo Container into the base's MAGLEV
     LAUNCHER. He works with a sense of routine, far away,
     preoccupied.

     All of a sudden Sam STOPS. He has the feeling someone is
     standing behind him. He slowly turns.

     A GIRL is standing in the doorway watching him. She is
     perhaps fifteen or sixteen years old. A yellow dress. Long,
     wheat-colored hair. Freckles. At once beautiful and
     haunting.

     Sam gets the FRIGHT of his life. He FLIES against the wall.

     WIDEN to reveal Sam and the Girl facing off. Sam POP-EYED
     and SHAKING. The Girl IMMOBILE, arms at her sides, head
     tilted ever so slightly to one side.

     The Cargo Container is sent hurtling through space. A              
     TERRIFIC BLAST. It distracts Sam's attention, breaks his           
     stare...                                                           

     And just like that, the Girl is gone. Sam is just staring
     at an empty doorway. Nothing there.

     Sam is baffled. Had to be his imagination. Had to be. After
     a few seconds he shakes his head dismissively and continues
     working.

29   INT. REC ROOM -- DAY                                         29

     Gerty is cutting Sam's hair.

     Sam sitting back in a chair, barber shop style, while the
     robot snip-snip-snips away with a pair of scissors. Sam is
     gently squeezing a STRESS BALL in his right hand.

                          GERTY
                Sam, is everything okay?

                          SAM
                Everything's fine, Gerty.

     For a moment there is no sound but the snipping scissors,
     reminiscent of keys snapping on a typewriter. Then:

                                                                  12.



                     SAM (CONT'D)
           Why do you ask?

                     GERTY
           You don't seem like yourself
           today.

Sam frowns, contemplative. For a moment we think he is
going to tell Gerty about the Girl he saw earlier -- or
imagined he saw. But he goes with something different.

                        SAM
           It's Tess.

                     GERTY
           Has something happened?

                     SAM
           No, not exactly.

Gerty stops cutting, lowers the scissors.

                     GERTY
           Sam, what is it?

                     SAM
           Something doesn't feel right,
           that's all.

A beat. Sam's fingers twitching around the red stress ball,
squeezing harder.

                     GERTY
           Sam, it might help to talk about
           it.

Sam decides to come clean.

                     SAM
           Tess isn't responding to things.

                     GERTY
           Tess isn't responding to things?

                        SAM
           Right.

                     GERTY
           What kind of things?

                     SAM
               (a beat)
           A couple of weeks ago I asked her
           if she wanted to go on vacation
           when I get back, and that I was
           thinking of either Mexico or
           Hawaii.
                     (MORE)

                                                                    13.

                     SAM (CONT'D)
           Tess never said anything about
           it. Three messages she's sent me
           since...and she's never once
           mentioned the vacation.

                     GERTY
           Im sure she can't wait, Sam.

                     SAM
           That's not the point. This is
           someone who lives for vacations
           and travelling. I thought she'd
           jump at the chance for us to go
           away -- with Eve, of course --
           we'd take Eve.

                     GERTY
           Perhaps Tess didn't receive the
           message?

                     SAM
               (as if anticipating
                Gerty's comment)
           But this isn't the only time it's
           happened, Gerty. When I asked her
           how her dad was doing on his new
           heart medicine she didn't respond
           to that -- I asked her when Eve
           was going to start nursery --
           nothing. Had her brother got the
           position at the University?
           Nothing. Nothing.

Sam is really having a go at the stress ball now.

                     GERTY
           I think her brother did get the
           position at the University. His
           name is Christopher, correct?

                     SAM
           He did?

                     GERTY
           Yes, I seem to recall he got the
           position. Professor of
           Biochemistry, I think. At
           Syracuse University in New York?

Sam is slightly alarmed that Gerty knows this and he
doesn't.

                     SAM
           How do you know that?

                                                                  14.



                      GERTY
           You told me. Some time ago now.
           Towards the beginning of your
           time on Selene. When we were
           starting to get to know each
           other.
               (a beat)
           You were very happy for your
           brother-in-law. You danced around
           the Rec Room, if I remember
           correctly.

Sam looks perturbed. For a few seconds he'd eased up on the
stress ball. He starts up on it again now.

                     SAM
           Gerty, have you heard anything
           new about anyone fixing lunar
           sat?

                     GERTY
           No Sam. From what I understand
           it's fairly low on the companies
           priority list with the Jupiter
           mission active. I would imagine                     
           it would be very expensive to                       
           fix.                                                

A pause. Sam still looks troubled.

                     GERTY (CONT'D)
           Sam, are you ok?

                     SAM
           They need to sort that out.
           Seriously. I've only got two
           weeks left. It's not fair on
           whoever's up here next. Gerty,
           you tell them to sort it out.
           It's not healthy.

                     GERTY
           I will Sam. Do you want me to
           finish cutting your hair later?

                    SAM
           Nah. Come on.   Let's finish
           this.

Gerty resumes cutting Sam's hair, and stops again, sensing
Sam is going to say something more.

The scissors freeze.

                                                                         15.



                          SAM (CONT'D)
                I've got another one of those
                headaches. Can you get me
                something for it?

                          GERTY
                Of course. Now?

                          SAM
                No not now, afterwards.

     The scissors start up again.

                          SAM (CONT'D)
                Thanks, pal.

     Sam with a HAIRCUT and a neatly TRIMMED BEARD is sitting
     before the Bolser Wood model of the little town.

     He is arched over working away with an EXACTO BLADE --
     SQUINTING -- whittling a figure out of wood. This is
     difficult and complicated work, and over three years Sam
     has become highly skilled at it.

     Sam can carve an actual person out of wood -- actual
     cheekbones, actual throats, actual hands -- it's
     fascinating to watch.

     From another room Sam hears the "ping-ping-ping" of an
     alarm.

     Sam sits at the comms unit watching a message from his
     superiors, OVERMEYERS and THOMPSON, a purposeful looking
     woman in charge and her earnest second.

     The two talk RAPIDLY and trade off like a tag team. At
     times their tone can be almost bizarrely whimsical.

     Overmeyers and Thompson seem to have known Sam for a while,
     but even so, there is a practised casualness to the
     repartee. It's a professional friendliness on Overmeyers
     part, no more and for Thompson it's merely an eagerness to
     be involved.

                          OVERMEYERS
                Delighted to hear about the
                latest shipment, Sam.

                          THOMPSON
                According to Albatross 90 it
                should be landing off the
                California Coast within the next
                three days.

                          OVERMEYERS
                Now in response to your question
                about the communications
                equipment, the news is not good.

                           THOMPSON
                Sam, those solar storms did a lot
                more damage than initially
                thought --

                          OVERMEYERS
                Fixing the lunar sat is going to
                take some time. It's a
                significant operation.

                          THOMPSON
                And what with the Jupiter Program
                hemorrhaging money --

     Sam curses to himself.                                           

                          OVERMEYERS
                Lunar doesn't have the budget it
                once did, Sam, you know that.

                          THOMPSON
                Even the coffee machine down in
                the Hub has been broken since I
                don't know when --

                                                                       17.



                          OVERMEYERS
                We have to go to Genesis 3 just
                to get a decent cup of coffee,
                Sam. Genesis 3. That's three
                buildings over.

                           THOMPSON
                We're hoping to get the live feed
                up and running by the Fall. The
                good news is you'll be home by
                then, Sam.

                          OVERMEYERS
                You only have two weeks to go!
                Congrat--

     Sam shuts off the message before Overmeyers can pipe out
     his last line.

     Sam sits before the dead screen -- eyes closed -- taking a
     succession of DEEP BREATHS.

     Sam playing Ping-Pong. He has folded up the second half of
     the table and is using it as a wall. The sound is rapid and
     rhythmic: ca-cluck ca-cluck ca-cluck. Sam taking his
     FRUSTRATION out on the little white ball.

                                                     CUT TO:


35   INT. BATHROOM -- DAY                                         35

     Sam stands before the toilet urinating. Rather ironically
     he is whistling I'm Walking on Sunshine -- focussed ahead
     at his reflection in the mirror -- angling his face,
     admiring his haircut, his beard.

     Then he looks down to flush the toilet and his WHISTLING
     abruptly STOPS.


36   INT. BATHROOM\TOILET                                         36

     It looks like someone just poured a glass of CRANBERRY
     JUICE into the toilet bowl. Literally. The red urine
     clouding the water like a squirt of octopus ink. Yeah, Sam
     just pissed blood.

     There is a "PING!" and Gerty's voice crackles from the
     intercom.

                                                                        18.



                          GERTY'S VOICE
                Sam, a transmission has arrived
                from your wife.

     Sam reaches over and presses the INTERCOM BUTTON.

                          SAM
                Be right there.

     And he flushes the toilet.

                                                      CUT TO:


37   INT. COMMS ROOM -- DAY                                       37

     Sam sitting before the monitor. He hits the "PLAY" button,
     begins watching the message.

     ON THE MONITOR: Tess is sitting in a living room talking to
     Sam. Tess has a sweet voice, she sounds grounded, like
     she's got a head on her shoulders.

                           TESS
                Hi Sam. It's me. How are you?
                     (a beat)
                I got your last message, it was
                really great to hear your voice.
                I know you've been really lonely
                up there, but in a lot of ways
                it's been good for you, I think.
                I hope you don't mind me saying
                that. I'm proud of you.
                     (a beat)
                Hey, someone's got something to
                say.

     A WOMAN, possibly a nanny or some form of hired help,
     swings a LITTLE GIRL into Tess's arms. This is EVE, Sam and
     Tess's daughter.

                          TESS (CONT'D)
                Eve, it's daddy. What did you
                want to say to him?

      Eve just stares. Tess whispers to her ("Remember what we
      practiced", etc.) Finally Eve attempts:

                            EVE
                Asstraut.

                          TESS
                Who's an astronaut?
                    (encouraging)
                Go on!

                                                                         19.



                          EVE
                Daddy asstraut!

     Tess laughs. So does Sam.

                          TESS
                That's right, daddy's an
                astronaut. Clever girl!

     Eve fidgets, rubs her nose, distracted.

                          TESS (CONT'D)
                She's shy. Uh, Cathy, could
                you...?

     The Maid steps in, hoists Eve away. Tess waits until
     they're out of earshot.

                          TESS (CONT'D)
                It's her birthday next month. I
                thought we'd get her a play house
                for the garden. We could even
                pick it out together.

     A pause. Tess just stares into the camera. She is hundreds
     and thousands of miles away, but for a second it feels like
     she's right there in the Comms Room with Sam. It's
     intimate.

     She finally shakes her head, self-conscious, shy.

                          TESS (CONT'D)
                God, I hate these things. Sam, I
                love you. I'm thinking of you
                always. I can't wait to see you,
                sweetheart. Okay. Bye.

     And the message ends.

     ON SAM: smiling, on the brink of tears.

                                                     CUT TO:


38   EXT. THE EARTH -- NIGHT/LATER                                38

     The Earth at night, illuminated by a glittering spider's
     web of artificial lighting. From the Moon this is one of
     the most beautiful sights you'll ever see.


39   INT. REC ROOM -- SAME                                        39

     Sam is in improved spirits. He pours himself a glass of
     juice as Gerty prepares dinner.

                                                                        20.



                          SAM
                What's on the menu tonight,
                Gerty?

                          GERTY
                Baby back ribs with french fries
                and spinach.

                          SAM
                Ribs! Good choice, pal. Fine
                choice.

     It might be baby back ribs with french fries and spinach,
     but it's made from a packet by adding hot water. Nasty.

     Sam sits down with the packet. Digs in with a fork.

                          SAM (CONT'D)
                Oh yeah! Compliments to the chef,
                Gerty, this is delicious!

     Sam eating ravenously.

                                                     CUT TO:


40   INT. GREENHOUSE -- NIGHT                                     40

     Sam is in the Greenhouse pruning plants with a pair of
     secateurs. He treads up the aisles slowly, taking time with
     each of the plants. CLASSICAL MUSIC plays over the sound
     system, Brahms, Beethoven, Bartok, one of the B's.

     Sam HUMS along to the music. A man at peace.

                                                     CUT TO:


41   INT. REC ROOM -- NIGHT/LATER                                 41

     Sam is working on his wooden model of the town. Across the
     room the Ed Sullivan Show is on TV. Ed's guest is a very
     young Goldie Hawn.

     Note: Whenever any TV is watched in the film, it is always
     a show from 1970's America. (Mash, Six Million Dollar Man,
     Laugh-In, etc.) No explanation is given for this.

     Sam is half-watching the TV, but his focus is chiefly on
     the SMALL HOUSE he is carving. And carving beautifully.

     After a few seconds he stands and snaps off the TV with a
     remote. He crosses to the kitchen section of the Rec Room
     to make some tea. The water has just boiled.

     As Sam is about to pour the boiling water, tea kettle in
     hand, he glances across the Rec Room and sees:

                                                                       21.



     The Girl. She's taken Sam's chair before the model. She is
     motionless, staring down at the model like she recognizes
     one of the little figures walking the tiny streets.

     Sam calmly puts the tea kettle down and begins to move
     towards the Girl, slowly, cautiously, like he wants to
     sneak up on her.

     Sam walks right up to the Girl and reaches out his hand...


     SAM

     And then we CUT to Sam standing in the kitchen. Over by the
     model there is no sign of the Girl. The chair is empty.
     She's gone. Her sitting there, Sam's walk across the room --
     apparently he imagined it all.

     Sam looks down. The tea kettle is dangling at an angle and
     BOILING WATER is DRIBBLING onto his left hand.

     Simultaneously: Sam SNAPS his hand AWAY, Sam SCREAMS. The
     tea kettle CLATTERS to the floor.

     Sam HURRIES to the sink and jerks his hand under a stream
     of cold water. Cursing under his breath the whole time:
     "Shit, piss, fuck..."

                                                     CUT TO:


42   INT. INFIRMARY -- LATER                                      42

     Sam sits in a chair as Gerty tends to his scolded left
     hand. It's a nasty burn.

                           SAM
                I'm going to feel that for a
                while, aren't I, Gerty?
                    (then)
                Damn it.

     Gerty applies a translucent balm to the burn.

                          GERTY
                Sam, can I ask how it happened?

                          SAM
                I told you, I saw something on
                the TV and spilled boiling water
                on my hand.

                          GERTY
                You saw something on the TV?

                                                                          22.



                          SAM
                    (a touch petulant)
                Yeah, something on the TV
                distracted me, Gerty, what's
                wrong with that?

     A pause. Gerty is wrapping Sam's hand with a bandage.

                          GERTY
                Sam, you said it was the TV that
                distracted you, but when I came
                in the TV wasn't on.

     Gerty has caught him out. Sam knows it.

                          GERTY (CONT'D)
                Perhaps you were imagining
                things?

     Gerty has hit the nail on the head, in a way that makes Sam
     feel a little uneasy. Is there something Gerty knows that
     Sam doesn't?

                                                     CUT TO:


43   INT. THE SLEEPING QUARTERS -- NIGHT                           43

     Sam asleep in bed.


44   SAM'S DREAM                                                   44

     Sam making love to Tess. We remain very close to their
     bodies in bed. The background a blur. No sound. It's all
     flesh and white sheets. Sensual, delicate, intense. We feel
     almost intrusive watching.


45   INT. SLEEPING QUARTERS -- MORNING                             45

     Sam wakes up and lunges across the bed to shut off his
     alarm clock. We notice a WHITE BANDAGE on the hand that he
     scolded.

     Afterwards: Sam lies back, watching the ceiling, groggy,
     reflective, still surfacing from his dream.

     And then OVER THIS: The sound from the opening of the film,
     THE TREADMILL, and we

                                                     CUT TO:


46   INT. REC ROOM -- MORNING                                      46

     Sam on his morning run.

                                                                          23.




47   INT. REC ROOM -- MORNING/LATER                                47

     Gerty is making breakfast. Sam enters, fresh from the
     shower.

                          SAM
                Morning, Gerty.

                          GERTY
                Morning, Sam. How are you today?

                          SAM
                Fine. Fine.

                          GERTY
                How's the hand?

                          SAM
                It's a little sore.

     Gerty pops the radio on. Just another morning on Selene.

                                                     CUT TO:


48   INT. MONITORING STATION -- MORNING/LATER                      48

     Sam sitting before The Old Man doing his daily log entry. A
     CLOCK is running on the monitor.

                          SAM
                8:19 Pacific Time. Lunar Day 2.
                Readouts are as follows: Matthew,
                9.8 Miles...

     Suddenly the monitor BLIPS -- a BLAST of STATIC -- and Sam
     SEES himself talking on the monitor. It appears to be a
     previous log entry.

                          SAM (CONT'D)
                Luke...7.3 miles...wow, better
                look into Luke...

     But bizarrely, the Sam talking on the monitor has long hair
     pulled back into a ponytail -- and no beard --

     And then another BLIP -- another BLAST of STATIC --   and
     the screen turns completely BLACK.

     A single word begins to flash in the center of the screen:
     "ERROR."

     The word flashes three times -- before the screen returns
     to normal, the CLOCK running again.

                                                                          24.



     It all happened so quickly Sam wonders if he didn't just
     imagine it. After an awkward pause he simply continues the
     original log entry.

                           SAM (CONT'D)
                 Mark, 11 miles on the button...


     CLOSE UP -- RED LIGHT

     Pulsing. Going "ping-ping-ping."


49   INT. MONITORING STATION -- LATER/MORNING                      49

     Sam stands across the room with a mug of coffee, peers up
     at the Big Board, sees that the alarm belongs to Matthew.

     He crosses to the INTERCOM, speaks into it.

                           SAM
                 Gerty, looks like we've got a
                 live one out on Matthew. I
                 wondered what was taking him so
                 long, the old fart. I'm heading
                 out in a few minutes, just going
                 to finish my coffee.

                              GERTY'S VOICE
                 Okay, Sam.

                                                     CUT TO:


50   I/E. ROVER/MOON SURFACE -- MORNING                            50

     Sam at the wheel in his space suit, speeding towards the
     first of the Harvesters, known as MATTHEW.


     HARVESTER/MATTHEW

     As Sam gets closer to the Harvester, he suddenly sees
     something:

     The Girl.

     She is standing maybe a hundred yards away in her yellow
     dress, resembling a FLAME or a FLOWER in the barren and
     colorless landscape. She appears to be staring directly at
     Sam's rover.


     SAM

     His face unfolding with panic, alarm, curiosity. An
     intense, yearning, curiosity.

                                                                       25.



     He drives closer.

     But like in a dream, Sam can't seem to make up any distance
     between the Rover and the Girl. He CRUSHES the accelerator
     peddle.

     For a moment Sam drives right alongside the Harvester,
     clouds of lunar dust being kicked up, cascading against the
     side window. But Sam is looking away from the Harvester,
     focussed on the Girl.

     ON SAM: He doesn't notice Matthew (The Harvester) suddenly
     veer RIGHT, slamming into the side of the Rover and causing
     Sam to lose control.

     The steering wheel swings left and right as Sam desperately
     tries to STRAIGHTEN the path of the vehicle, but a split
     second later the Rover is FLIPPED like a matchbox, and SPUN
     into the path of the Harvester -- a HIDEOUS SCREECH of
     MANGLED METAL -- the Rover gobbled up by the front of the
     Harvester, DEVOURED.

     The Rover is JAMMED under the Harvester's monstrous AXLE,
     resembling a crushed beer can in a fist -- and with a BIG,
     BOOMING GROAN the Harvester slides to a STANDSTILL.

     WIDE SHOT: Silence. The Harvester stationary. The Rover
     caught beneath it.

     No sign of the Girl.

                                                     CUT TO:


     BLACK.

     Silence. Hold it for five seconds and then


51   A BLUR                                                       51

     Eyelids fluttering, bright light, at first broken up,
     filtered, as if viewed through a Kaleidoscope. Slowly
     shapes and impressions begin to form and we know where we
     are.

     It's the Infirmary.


52   INT. INFIRMARY -- DAY                                        52

     A CLEAN SHAVEN and drugged-up Sam is sitting up in bed,
     propped with a pillow. Sam doesn't have a scratch on his
     face, but has clearly been through a terrifying ordeal.

     Gerty is bedside.

                                                                         26.



                          SAM
                Where am I?

                          GERTY
                Sam, you're in the Infirmary. You
                had an accident.

     Sam looks bewildered -- he desperately racks his brain,
     trying to locate the memory.

                          GERTY (CONT'D)
                Do you remember what happened?

                          SAM
                No.
                    (a beat)
                I don't remember a thing.

     Sam just stares back at Gerty, not so much as a flicker of
     recognition.

                          GERTY
                Do you remember me?

                          SAM
                Yes, of course I remember you,
                Gerty.

                          GERTY
                That's good. That's very good.
                It's nice to see you awake again.
                    (a beat)
                I'd like to keep you under
                observation here in the Infirmary
                for a few days and run some
                tests.

     A pause. Sam taking it all in. Eventually:

                          SAM
                How long have I been out?

                          GERTY
                Not long. Sam, go back to sleep.
                You're still very tired. We can
                talk later.

     Sam closes his eyes, sinking deeper into his pillow.

     Sam asleep in bed. Gerty is scanning his head with a small
     instrument resembling a camcorder.

                                                                       27.


     There are READOUTS on a monitor showing blood flow, oxygen
     levels and glucose metabolism in the tissues of Sam's
     brain.

     LUKE, one of the Harvesters, crossing the lunar landscape
     at HALF SPEED.


55   INT. INFIRMARY                                               55

     Sam wakes up from an extended nap. He thrusts his fists
     into his eyes like a child, yawns ferociously.

                          SAM
                Gerty?

     No sign of the robot. Sam is feeling well enough to walk.
     He swings his legs out of bed, begins to plod around the
     room. He is tentative at first, slow, as if walking is
     something he is having to learn from scratch.

     Eventually when he is moving fluidly he goes to the door
     and pokes his head out into the corridor.


56   INT. CORRIDOR -- CONTINUOUS                                  56

     Sam peers around. From another room he can hear the faint
     drone of VOICES. One of these voices belongs to Gerty. The
     other voices are deeper, faster, human.

                          SAM
                Gerty?

     The voices continue. Intrigued, Sam PRESSES ON down the
     corridor.


     ON SAM

     As he walks up the corridor in the direction of the Comms
     Room. Sam is close enough now that he can actually hear the
     conversation.

     Sam arrives at the door of the Comms Room and peers in.

                          GERTY (0.S)
                These were extraordinary
                circumstances, as you know --

                                                                         28.




57   INT. COMMS ROOM -- CONTINUOUS                                57

     Gerty is installed at the Comms Unit. Thompson and
     Overmeyers are on the screen.

     The moment Gerty sees Sam he shuts off the monitor and the
     screen fizzes to black, Thompson and Overmeyers vanishing.

     Strange: Gerty appeared to have a live feed.

                          GERTY
                Sam, you're out of bed.

                           SAM
                I wanted to stretch my legs.
                    (then)
                What was that?

                           GERTY
                Not talking. No. We've been
                having some problems with the
                lunar sat and our live feed seems
                to be down. I was recording a
                video message for Central
                updating them on your progress.
                     (a beat)
                Sam, you need to stay in bed.
                You're not ready to walk around
                yet.

     Sam nods vaguely, turns around and heads back to the
     Infirmary slowly.

     Sam watching TV -- The Muppet Show, the "Pigs in Space"
     sketch -- and eating dinner. He's not laughing.


59   INT. INFIRMARY -- LATER                                      59

     Sam hunched over the infirmary's stainless steel wash basin
     giving himself a shave. He hits the razor on the side of
     the basin -- tap tap tap -- like a conductor with a baton.

                                                     CUT TO:


60   INT. INFIRMARY -- LATER                                      60

     Sam is seated at a table. Frankly he looks better now than
     he did before the accident.

                                                                       29.


     Perhaps it's the rosy hue of his freshly shaven face. He
     certainly looks younger. A man revitalized, a man mended.

     Gerty is giving Sam something very similar to an IQ Test.
     Sam has just arranged a series of blocks into an L-shaped
     tower.

                          GERTY
                Excellent, Sam.

                          SAM
                How much longer do I have to be
                in here, Gerty?

                          GERTY
                Sam, you suffered minor brain
                damage in the crash. This has
                resulted in memory loss and
                slight logic impairment.

                          SAM
                When can I get back to work?

                          GERTY
                Central has asked me to slow down
                the Harvesters to ensure you have
                time to recuperate and get your
                strength back --

                          SAM
                    (dryly, exasperated)
                Terrific.

                          GERTY
                The good news is you can return
                to the sleeping quarters
                tomorrow. But it will still be a
                few more days before you can
                resume anything like a normal
                work schedule.

     Sam's face taught with irritation. He isn't happy.

     Gerty gives him the next puzzle to solve. WE MOVE IN ON
     SAM'S LEFT HAND as he takes the puzzle, the same hand he
     scolded in an earlier scene.

     The BANDAGE is GONE and the BURN appears to have completely
     HEALED.

                                                     CUT TO:

     Sam walking down the corridor in the direction of the
     Sleeping Quarters. He stops at a RED LIGHT on the corridor
     wall, beneath it the word, "EXIT DOORS."

                                                                       30.



     He's locked inside the base.

     Sam pulls a face, disgruntled, continues down the corridor.


62   INT. SLEEPING QUARTERS -- CONTINUOUS                       62

     Sam takes in the New York Jets poster on the wall and walks
     over to the bed -- studies his lucky tambourine and the
     glass jar of lunar rock samples -- like he's trying to
     reacquaint himself with his own belongings.

     His eyes arrive on the red stress ball. Sam scoops up the
     ball and PITCHES it at the wall like he expects the thing
     to bounce back to him. The stress ball doesn't bounce back,
     simply hits the wall with a dull THUD and DROPS to the
     FLOOR.

     A desolation special. The blacker than black sky above.
     None of the ingredients of life. On Earth we have
     rainforests, and flowers, and birds. We have color. Up here
     we realize how lucky we are. The base is lit by large
     halogen comfort lights, alone in the lunar desert. This is
     a lunar night.

     Sam sitting before The Old Man doing a few innocuous tasks,
     collecting readouts, slurping a cup of coffee. Gerty is
     within ear shot.                                                 

     Sam sees something that pulls him CLOSER to the monitor.

                          SAM                                         
                Gerty, do you know about this?

     Gerty approaches. Sam taps the screen.

                          SAM (CONT'D)
                Matthew's got no velocity read-
                out. He's completely still.

                          GERTY (O.S.)                                
                He must have stalled.

     Sam gives Gerty a look. That's not good.

                                                                       31.




65   INT. COMMS ROOM -- LATER                                     65

     Sam is recording a message for Central.

                          SAM
                There's no way to tell from here
                if a track's been thrown, or if
                it's just something jammed in an
                axle, or what... I can shoot out
                there, check it out, get some
                video and maybe save you guys the
                expense of floating in a whole
                crew! I know how tight money is
                right now....

     Sam really frustrated now. He feels cooped up, stir crazy,
     idle.

                          SAM (CONT'D)
                Just give me the word -- or Gerty
                the word, tell him to unlock the
                exit doors -- and I'll go out and
                get Matthew up and running again.
                    (a beat)
                That's it. Over and out.

     Sam sends the message.

     Sam enters the Rec Room, looks around, his eyes settling on
     the model of the town.

     Sam sits down in front of the model, staring -- he picks up
     the HOUSE he was carving earlier -- studies it carefully.

                                                     CUT TO:

     Sam and Gerty are seated at the Comms Unit watching a video
     message from Central. Sam is holding a carved HOUSE,
     examining it as he listens to the video.

     The familiar faces of Overmeyers and Thompson on the
     screen, shoulder to shoulder, the two looking more like
     vultures right now than lizards.

                          THOMPSON
                Sam, we appreciate the offer, but
                you concentrate on feeling
                better.

                                                                       32.



                          SAM
                    (muttering, vexed)
                Oh for Christ's sake...

                          OVERMEYERS
                We don't want you to take any
                unnecessary risks. You're too
                important to us.

                          THOMPSON
                You're to stay put, understand?

                          OVERMEYERS
                It's an order.

                          THOMPSON
                It's an order, Sam. From Lunar.
                Stay put.

                          OVERMEYERS
                We're going to send a Rescue Unit
                to tend to the stalled harvester
                and get the base back on its
                feet.

                             SAM
                       (incensed)
                Why?

     The message ends. Sam turns to Gerty, irate, the message as
     good as a kick in the balls.

                          GERTY
                I'm sorry Sam.

     Sam stares at Gerty.

                          GERTY (CONT'D)
                Sam, I am under strict orders not
                to let you outside.

     Sam throws the half completed wood carving in his hand at
     the other end of the room, breaking it. He FLIES to his
     feet -- growling with frustration -- STORMS out of the
     room.

     Sam and Tess making love. We remain very close to their
     bodies in bed. The background a blur. It's the same dream
     we saw earlier.

     Something is different though.                                     

     We drift past Sam and Tess, and under the sheets of the            
     bed.                                                               

     Down between their entwined feet huddles a bearded, wide-          
     eyed Sam, staring directly at us from under the sheets at          
     the end of the bed!

     Sam is quietly eating breakfast, lost in thought. Gerty            
     puttering around in the background. The radio drones away.


71   INT. COMMS ROOM                                              71

     Sam is seated at the Comms Unit watching a message from
     Tess.

     We assume this is an old message since Tess is heavily
     PREGNANT.

     Her slender hands are spread over her prodigious belly as
     she beams at the camera.

                            TESS
                He's kicking...or she's kicking.
                I'm certain he's a boy. I wish
                you could feel it.
                     (a beat, shifting)
                I think we made the right choice,
                Sam. I really do. We need some
                time apart. We got stuck. That
                happens in marriages sometimes.
                It's nothing terrible.
                     (then)
                Well listen, I love you lots --
                and we'll talk soon, okay? Bye
                Sam.

     A POP and Tess is gone -- the monitor filled with STATIC.
     Sam sits staring into space. Tess' message seems to have
     agitated him.

                            SAM
                Fuck it.

                                                                        34.



     He JUMPS from his chair and HEADS OUT of the Comms Room at
     pace.


72   INT. REC ROOM                                                72

     Sam strides in -- swipes a KNIFE from beside the wooden
     model -- strides out again.


73   INT. CORRIDOR                                                73

     Sam glances left and right -- making sure there's no sign
     of Gerty -- then begins to PRY open a VENT with the knife.

     Once the vent is removed he reaches deep inside and YANKS
     out a bundle of interwoven WIRES -- Sam bends the wires
     around the BLADE of the knife -- and CUTS.

     GAS ISSUES from the cut wires. An ALARM sounds.

     Sam hides the knife away, shouts down the corridor:

                          SAM
                Gerty! Get over here! Quickly!

     Gerty comes out of the Monitoring Station and SHUTTLES down
     the corridor.

                          GERTY
                What happened?

                          SAM
                Don't know -- Micro meteorites,
                maybe? Either way there might be
                damage to the exterior shell. I'd
                better go outside and take a
                look.

                          GERTY
                There is no damage to the
                exterior shell.

                          SAM
                It's not that I don't believe
                you, Gerty, but the inner skin is
                springing leaks like an ACME fire
                hose. Maybe you better let me
                take a look, just in case, huh?

                          GERTY
                Sam, I'm not supposed to let you
                go outside.

                          SAM
                Then let's keep it between you
                and me then. Ok?

                                                                          35.



     The robot takes an inordinate amount of time to think this
     through. The syrupy gas distorts the light as it collects
     at Sam's ankles. Gerty's arms work away as they speedily
     repair the damage Sam has done. Finally:

                              GERTY
                 Okay, Sam.

     The "Exit Doors" LIGHT turns from RED to GREEN. For Sam
     this is like the BLAST of a STARTING PISTOL -- he
     immediately takes off down the corridor --


74   INT. CHANGING AREA                                            74

     Sam finds his space suit is gone, so grabs the spare suit
     and scrambles into it.


75   INT. DOCK                                                     75

     Two Rovers parked side by side. One of the parking bays is
     EMPTY. Sam stands before the empty bay for a moment -- why
     is one of the Rovers missing?

     If Sam suspected something was wrong before, he is certain
     of it now. He climbs into one of the two remaining Rovers.


76   I/E. ROVER/MOON SURFACE                                       76

     Sam speeding along in the Rover. He has Matthew's
     coordinates plugged into his Navigation System and is
     following a MAP on a small monitor.


77   EXT. MOON -- CONTINUOUS                                       77

     Sam heading towards the stalled Harvester. It soon becomes
     apparent that there is something STUCK under the front of
     the Harvester's AXLE. A second later it is apparent what
     that something is: inevitably, it's the MISSING ROVER.

     Sam slows his Rover down, approaching the scene with
     CAUTION. He parks a few feet away from the wreck and opens
     the door of his Rover, stepping outside gingerly.

     ONE SIXTH GRAVITY is like walking on a trampoline. Sam
     takes long strides, bobbing over to the front of the
     Harvester to take a closer look, his boots leaving deep
     FOOTPRINTS in the lunar soil.

                                                                       36.




     THE FRONT OF THE HARVESTER

     The crashed Rover is exactly as we left it after the
     accident, mangled, crushed, captured beneath the trundles
     of the Harvester. Sam peers closer and sees that there is
     an UNCONSCIOUS MAN in a Lunar Industries space suit trapped
     inside.

     Sam can't see the man's face -- he has his back to Sam, his
     body sprawled across the passenger seat like he's searching
     for loose change on the floor of the vehicle.

     With great effort Sam manages to prize the Rover's door
     open. He reaches inside and begins to pull the man out --
     Sam's sheer ADRENALINE giving him the strength of a YETI.

     Sam DRAGS the unconscious man away from the crashed Rover,
     his body leaving a big TRACK MARK in the gray soil. Sam
     takes a second to catch his breath, then leans down and
     turns the unconscious man onto his back.

     He BRUSHES DUST from the glass of the man's HELMET, leans
     down even closer.


     CLOSE UP -- THE MAN

     Through his helmet we see a BLOODY and BEARDED SAM. Sam as
     we remember him. The Sam from the opening twenty minutes of
     the film.

     Sam's face as the PANIC, the ALARM, the SHOCK, the
     REALIZATION hit him like a wrecking ball: this man he has
     just pulled out of the crashed Rover is himself.


     WIDE SHOT -- THE STALLED HARVESTER

     Sam gathers his wits and manages to lift the unconscious
     Sam up over his shoulder, fireman's lift style, taking him
     to the parked Rover.

                                                     CUT TO:


78   INT. DOCK -- A FEW MINUTES LATER                             78

     Sam drives the Rover into the Dock, flies out and removes
     his space helmet, screaming:

                          SAM
                Gerty! Gerty! Help!

                                                                        37.



     He reaches into the Rover, lifting out the unconscious Sam.
     He carries him in both arms, staggering across the dock --
     back arched, arms beginning to sag -- and into the
     corridor.


79   INT. CORRIDOR                                                79

     Sam promptly collapses and DROPS the unconscious Sam onto
     the floor.

                          SAM
                Gerty!

     Gerty approaches, gliding along his rail. Sam is freaking
     out big time, exhausted, panic-stricken, bewildered.

                          SAM (CONT'D)
                I found him outside by the
                stalled harvester. Who is he?
                What the fuck is going on?

     A pause. Gerty literally seems lost for words.

                          SAM (CONT'D)
                    (demanding an answer)
                Gerty!

                           GERTY
                We need to get him to the
                Infirmary.

                          SAM
                Not until you tell me who he is!

                          GERTY
                Sam, we need to get him to the
                Infirmary immediately.

     Sam SCOOPS the unconscious Sam up off the ground and lifts
     him towards the INFIRMARY -- staggering -- stumbling --
     going:

                          SAM
                Who is he! Who is he!

     Sounding like some deranged homeless man. Gerty gliding
     alongside him.

                                                      CUT TO:


80   INT. INFIRMARY -- DAY                                        80

     Lying in the Infirmary bed, propped on a pillow, is the
     first Sam, the bearded Sam, who we will now refer to as SAM
     1.

                                                                       38.


     He has a wicked black eye and a purple bruise on the right
     side of his face, looks like he was on the losing end of a
     brawl.

     He has a DRIP stuck in his arm and a tangle of WIRES
     attached to his bare chest. A MACHINE is BEEPING away.

     Gerty hovers over him, redressing the BANDAGE on Sam 1's
     left hand, the one he scolded a while back.


81   INT. INFIRMARY -- LATER                                      81

     Sam 1's eyes pop open, he is awake, staring directly at
     Gerty.

                           GERTY
                Hello Sam.
                    (a beat)
                How are you feeling?

                          SAM 1
                Where am I?

                          GERTY
                The Infirmary. You had an
                accident out by one of the
                harvesters. Do you remember?

     For a second this is playing out like the other Infirmary
     scene. A case of deja-vu.

     Sam 1's eyes twitch as he catalogues through his memory.
     Yes he remembers the crash. He remembers something else,
     too.

                          SAM 1
                I saw someone out there, Gerty.

                          GERTY
                Who did you see, Sam?

     Just then Sam 1 notices the other Sam -- the more current,
     clean-shaven Sam -- who we will now refer to as SAM 2. He
     is standing against the wall watching Sam 1.

                          SAM 1
                I saw a girl.

                          GERTY
                You saw a girl out by the
                harvester? How is that possible?

     Sam 1 continues to stare at Sam 2, hardly believing his
     eyes.

                                                                       39.



                          GERTY (CONT'D)
                Sam, you suffered a slight
                concussion in the crash and have
                incurred minor injuries, but all
                in all the prognosis is good. I'm
                happy to see you again.

     As he says this Sam 2 crosses slowly from one side of the
     room to the other, never taking his eyes off Sam 1. It's
     like Sam 2 is purposefully keeping his distance, reluctant,
     afraid even, to approach any closer.

     Meanwhile Sam 1 is beginning to look spooked.

                             SAM 1
                Gerty?

                             GERTY
                Yes, Sam?

                          SAM 1
                Is there someone in the room with
                us?

                             GERTY
                Yes.

                             SAM 1
                Who is he?

     But Sam 1 knows exactly who it is. He's seen that face
     every morning of his life in the bathroom mirror.

                          GERTY
                Sam, get some sleep. You're very
                tired.

     Sam 2 wordlessly walks out of the room.

     Sam 1's eyes shift to Gerty, the spooked expression yet to
     leave his face.

                                                     CUT TO:


82   INT. CORRIDOR -- DAY                                         82

     Sam 1 hobbling along, in addition to his facial injuries he
     injured his knee in the crash and is walking with a slight
     LIMP. The camera TRACKING behind Sam 1 as he swings along
     and stops at


83   INT. REC ROOM -- CONTINUOUS                                  83

     Sam 1 in the doorway, he peers in.

                                                                       40.



     Seated before the TV watching The Newlywed Game, Sam 2. He
     turns from the TV and shares a LONG LOOK with Sam 1.
     Finally:

                            SAM 1
                Hi.

     Sam 2 just nods. He turns back to the TV.

     Sam 1 continues on down the corridor.


84   INT. MONITORING STATION                                      84

     Gerty is studying lunar rock samples through a microscope.
     Sam 1 enters.

                          SAM 1
                Gerty, what the hell is going on?
                Who is that guy in the Rec Room?
                Where did he come from?
                Why does he look like me?

     Sam 1 is perplexed, but not freaking out, not yet anyway.

                          GERTY
                Sam, you're out of bed.

                          SAM 1
                Yes, Gerty, I'm out of bed.   Who
                is the guy in the rec room?

                            GERTY
                Sam Bell.

     Sam 1 is officially FREAKING OUT now.

                          SAM 1
                Who the fuck is in the rec room,
                Gerty!?

                          GERTY
                You are Sam Bell.

     A long pause. Sam 1 at the point of tears.

                          GERTY (CONT'D)
                Sam, what is it? It might help
                to talk about it.

                          SAM 1
                I don't understand what's
                happening, Gerty. I think I may
                be losing my mind.

                                                                       41.



                          GERTY
                We could run some tests.
                    (a beat)
                I haven't reported anything to
                central, Sam. They don't know
                you were recovered alive from the
                accident.

                          SAM 1
                Recovered alive? What do you
                mean? Why haven't you reported
                to central?

                          GERTY
                I'm here to keep you safe, Sam.
                I want to help you. Are you
                hungry?

     Sam 1 merely nods at this, turning and plodding out of the
     room, seemingly in a DAZE.


85   INT. CORRIDOR                                                85

     Sam 1 comes out of the Monitoring Station, passes the Rec
     Room without looking in.


86   INT. SLEEPING QUARTERS -- CONTINUOUS                         86

     Sam 2 has taken over the room. The same belongings, of
     course, but there's a different energy. For one thing it's
     very untidy; looks like the bedroom of an unruly teenager.

     Sam 1 stands in the doorway, taking it in.

     Wordlessly Sam 1 begins to tidy the room. He seems almost
     RELIEVED to be able to lose himself temporarily in this
     physical activity -- making the bed, folding clothes, etc.

                                                     CUT TO:


87   INT. REC ROOM                                                87

     Sam 2 has stopped watching TV and is now seated at a table
     playing solitaire. Sam 1 appears in the doorway.

     Sam 2 looks up. The energy bristling with tension.

                          SAM 1
                You're Sam Bell.

     Sam 2 doesn't answer, goes back to his cards.

     Sam 1 enters with CAUTION, takes a seat across the room,
     purposefully keeping his distance.

                                                                  42.



                     SAM 1 (CONT'D)
           I'm Sam Bell, too.

                      SAM 2
           Yeah.

Sam 1 nods. A beat.

                     SAM 1
           This is fucked up.

                     SAM 2
           Completely.

Sam 2 slapping down cards. Sam 1 desperately attempts to
put together a coherent thought.

                     SAM 1
           Why... What are you?

For a second we don't think Sam 2 is going to respond.
Then:

                     SAM 2
           I'm a clone, Sam.    Im a fucking
           clone.

                     SAM 1
           How long have you been here?

                     SAM 2
           About a week.

A beat.

                     SAM 1
           How are you getting on?

                      SAM 2
               (repeating the question
                slowly)
           How am I getting on?
               (then)
           The company ordered Gerty to lock
           all the exits. I haven't been
           able to do anything for seven
           days but sit on my ass.

                     SAM 1
           They locked all the exits? What
           about the harvesters?

                     SAM 2
           Slowed them down to half speed,
           apparently.
                     (MORE)

                                                                       43.

                          SAM 2 (CONT'D)
                And then when I finally trick
                Gerty into letting me outside I
                find a clone of myself in a
                crashed rover. How am I getting
                on? Oh I'm loving it.

                          SAM 1
                I'm not a clone.

                           SAM 2
                Ok, Sam.   You're not a clone.

                          SAM 1
                You're the clone.

                                                     CUT TO:


88   INT. GREENHOUSE - LATER                                      88

     The two Sam's are inspecting plants.

                          SAM 2
                How long have you been here?

                          SAM 1
                Almost three years.

                          SAM 2
                Hence the Captain's beard.

                          SAM 1
                    (with a smile)
                Right.

                          SAM 2
                I didn't know it could get so
                thick. Does it itch?

                          SAM 1
                No, not really.

                           SAM 1 (CONT'D)
                Listen, I wanted to say thank-
                you. If it wasn't for you I'd
                still be out there in the crashed
                rover. You saved my life.
                    (then)
                Will you shake my hand?

     Sam 2 hesitates, eventually shakes Sam 1's hand. Meanwhile
     Sam 1 is staring at his clone, astonished.

                          SAM 2
                    (self-conscious)
                What?

                                                                       44.



                           SAM 1
                 You look just like me. It's
                 incredible.

                           SAM 2
                 Why do I look like you? Why don't
                 you look like me?

                           SAM 1
                 We look like each other, I guess.

     This final line intended as a kind of truce.

                                                     CUT TO:


89   INT. REC ROOM -- LATER                                       89

     Sam 1 and Sam 2 are folding the Ping-Pong table down so
     they can have a real game.


     PING-PONG

     The two Sams playing Ping-Pong. It's slightly competitive,
     but mainly they are just happy to take their minds off
     their situation for half an hour.

                           SAM 1
                 Your serve.

                           SAM 2
                 Score?

                           SAM 1
                 Two points to eighteen.

                           SAM 2                                        
                 Fuck!                                                  

     Sam 2 slaps his paddle on his thigh, his temper creeping up        
     on him. He catches Sam's eye. Gets a grip. Sam 1 is a              
     better player than Sam 2. He's been up here longer. He's
     had more practice.


90   INT. REC ROOM -- LATER                                       90

     After the game, the two Sams are sprawled in their seats,
     sweaty, flushed, energized. They sit before the model of
     the town.

                           SAM 2
                 How long did it take you to do
                 this?

                                                                  45.



                     SAM 1
           I don't remember doing all of it.
           I remember when I did the church
           and the Salvation Army. And a few
           of the people. My mind's been
           acting kind of weird lately,
           though.

                     SAM 2
           It's Fairfield, right?
               (pointing)
           There's Town Hall.

                     SAM 1
           Uh-huh. You know Fairfield?
               (also pointing)
           That's the Baskin&Robbins. And
           there's Tess and Eve. Do you know
           Tess?

The mention of their wife has stopped the conversation in
its tracks. Sam 2 immediately drops into deep melancholy.

                      SAM 2
           Yes.   I know Tess.

                     SAM 1
           You know about Eve, right?

It is obvious from Sam 2's expression that he doesn't.

                     SAM 1 (CONT'D)
           We had a girl.

                       SAM 2
           We did?
                (beat)
           She thought she was going to have
           a boy. She was so sure.
                (then)
           Eve?

Sam 1 nods.

                      SAM 1
           She's beautiful. She's really
           beautiful.

                     SAM 2
           How much did she weigh? Isn't
           that what you're supposed to ask,
           how much did she weigh?

                     SAM 1
           Nine pounds, eleven ounces.

                                                                         46.



     Sam 2 doesn't know what to do with the news: on the one
     hand he is jubilant, on the other he's a clone, the baby
     technically isn't even his.

     All of a sudden there is a "PING!" From the Intercom
     speaker:

                          GERTY'S VOICE
                Sam, a message has arrived from
                Central.

     Sam 1 and Sam 2 share a look, then together SPRING from
     their chairs.

                                                     CUT TO:


91   INT. COMMS ROOM -- DAY                                       91

     Sam 1 and Sam 2 seated before the Comms Unit. Sam 1 hits
     the "Play" button. Overmeyers and Thompson appear on the
     screen.

                          OVERMEYERS
                Greetings, Sam!

                          THOMPSON
                How's our Man? Feeling better?

                          OVERMEYERS
                You getting lots of rest?

                          THOMPSON
                Yeah, you resting up, Sam? You'd
                better be you bastard.

                          OVERMEYERS
                Enjoy it while it lasts! We've
                got good news.

                          THOMPSON
                The Jupiter Program had to be put
                on hiatus, so we've got a few
                free pairs of hands --

                          OVERMEYERS
                We've managed to secure you a
                Rescue Unit ahead of schedule.

                          THOMPSON
                Rescue Unit Eliza.

     A SHOT/STILL PHOTO of Rescue Unit ELIZA. A meaner group of
     sons-of-bitches you have never seen. These guys make the
     rescue team from Apocalypse Now look like The New Kids on
     the Block.

                                                                  47.



                     OVERMEYERS
           They've been stationed on Goliath
           19 for the last couple of months.

                     THOMPSON (O.S.)
           Eliza's been in transit for the
           last day....we expect them to
           reach you in approximately 14
           hours.

                     OVERMEYERS (O.S.)
           Commence to jump for joy!

                     THOMPSON (O.S.)
           You'll be back to work in no
           time.

Now back on Overmeyers and Thompson.

                     OVERMEYERS
           Eliza is bringing you something
           special, Sam. Compliments of the
           company.

                       THOMPSON
           A hooker!

                     OVERMEYERS
           No not a hooker. What's wrong
           with you? It's a little something
           to drink, Sam, that's all, our
           way of patting you on the back
           for all that you've been through.

                     THOMPSON
           In the meantime, keep resting up,
           and hang in there.

                     OVERMEYERS
           Yeah you hang in there, Sam. Over
           and out.

And the screen pops to black. A pause.

For a moment there is silence, neither of the Sams knowing
how to react -- going by the message Thompson and
Overmeyers don't know anything about there being two Sams
on the base now.

                     SAM 1
           They're sending a Rescue Unit?
           Why?

                     SAM 2
           To fix the stalled harvester.
           They didn't think I was up to it.

                                                                        48.



                          SAM 1
                Then I'm going back.

     Sam 2 gives Sam 1 a perplexed look.

                          SAM 1 (CONT'D)
                I've done my three years. That's
                it for me --

     Sam 2 is shaking his head slowly.

                          SAM 1 (CONT'D)
                What?

                          SAM 2
                Is that what you really think?

                          SAM 1
                I've got a contract --

                           SAM 2
                You're a fucking clone! You don't
                have shit!

      At once Sam 1 and Sam 2 ROCKET to their feet -- right in
      each others faces, on the BRINK of BLOWS.

                          SAM 1
                I'm going home!

                          SAM 2
                You're not going anywhere!

      Sam 1 turns around, heads out of the room. Sam 2 STORMS
      after him, TALKING the whole time --

                          SAM 2 (CONT'D)
                You've been up here too long,
                man! You've lost the plot!

      Gerty shuttles along after them.


92    INT. CORRIDOR -- CONTINUOUS                                92

     Sam 1 presses down the corridor, Sam 2 tailing right behind
     him.

                          SAM 2
                What, you think Tess is back home
                waiting for you? What about the
                original Sam?

                          SAM 1
                I'm the original! I'm Sam
                fucking Bell! Me! Me!

                                                                       49.



     Sam 1, stress ball pumping away in his hand, spots Gety and
     angrily faces him.

                          SAM 1 (CONT'D)
                Gerty, am I a clone?

     Gerty doesn't know which way to look.

                            GERTY
                Yes, Sam.

     Sam 1 ducks in the Rec Room, Sam 2 in tow.


93   INT. REC ROOM                                              93

     Sam 1 takes his old seat before the model. Sam 2 stands
     over him.

                          SAM 2
                What about the other clones?

     "Other clones?" Sam 1 just stares back.

                           SAM 2 (CONT'D)
                Yeah, we might not be the first
                two to be woken up.
                    (indicating the model)
                You said that thing had already
                been started when you got here.
                Well, who started it?
                    (then)
                There might be other clones up
                here right now. Think about it.
                How did I get here so quickly                         
                after your crash? They didn't
                ship me in from Central, there
                wasn't time. I must have come
                from the base.

                          SAM 1
                That's ridiculous. Impossible.                        
                Why would hey do that?                                

                          SAM 2
                I bet there's some kind of secret
                room --

                          SAM 1
                    (laughing)
                Secret room?

                          SAM 2
                Yeah, secret room, why not?

                                                                       50.



                          SAM 1                                       
                    (losing his cool)                                 
                You're the one who's lost the
                plot! I've been here for three
                years. I know every inch of this
                base. I know how many dust fibres
                are between those wall panels
                over there -- why would they do                       
                that?!                                                

                          SAM 2                                       
                Look. It's a company, right?                          
                They have investors, shareholders                     
                -- shit like that. What's                             
                cheaper? Spending time and money                      
                training new personnel or just                        
                have a couple of spares here to                       
                do the job. If they make it                           
                through their contract, great.                        
                If they don't, hallelujah! No                         
                contract completion fees, no                          
                retirement package. Just thaw out                     
                the spare, and keep the profits                       
                rolling in. It's the far side of                      
                the Moon, Sam! The tight fuck's                       
                haven't even fixed our                                
                communications satellite.                             

                          SAM 1                                       
                Tess would know.                                      

                          SAM 2                                       
                Do you really think they give a                       
                shit about us? They're laughing                       
                all the way to the bank!                              

                          SAM 1                                       
                Tess would know what's going on!                      
                She wouldn't let that happen!                         

                          SAM 2                                       
                    (exhasperated)                                    
                There's some area we don't know                       
                about. I'm going to find it.                          

     Sam 1 shakes his head dismissively, picks up the wooden
     house, starts whittling.

     Meanwhile Sam 2 has left the room.


94   INT. MONITORING STATION -- QUICK CUTS                      94

     Sam 2 in the Monitoring Station checking wall panels,
     reaching his hand inside cubbies and feeling around deep
     inside, SEARCHING.

                                                                       51.




95   INT. CORRIDOR -- QUICK CUTS                                  95

     Sam 2 moving along the corridor, pressing his ear against
     panels, tapping with his finger --


96   INT. SLEEPING QUARTERS -- QUICK CUTS                         96

     Sam 2 RAMPAGES through the Sleeping Quarters, pushes the
     bed aside, lifts the mattress, goes tearing through a
     closet, ripping clothes from hangers, checks the back
     panel.


97   INT. REC ROOM                                                97

     Sam 2 has come full circle. He shifts the ping pong table,
     goes through cabinets in the kitchen, feels inside --

     Sam 1 half-whittling, half-watching.

                          SAM 1
                I told you.

                           SAM 2
                Shut-up!

     Finally Sam 2 arrives before the model.

                          SAM 2 (CONT'D)
                Get out of the way.

                           SAM 1
                Why?

                          SAM 2
                I want to check underneath there.

                          SAM 1
                You're not moving the model.

                          SAM 2
                Get the fuck out of my way!

     Sam 1 stands, keeps his ground.

                           SAM 1
                No.

     Sam 1 is still holding the knife. Though he's not about to
     use it, both Sams are aware that it's there.

     Suddenly Sam 2 LUNGES for the knife; an INTENSE STRUGGLE
     ensues -- TEETH CLENCHED, sputtering BREATHS -- the two
     Sams less clones right now than ANIMALS.

                                                                          52.



     Sam 2 is able to loosen Sam 1's grip on the knife --
     flinging the weapon across the room -- and SWINGS Sam 1 up
     against the wall.

     Now Sam 2 turns to face the model. Using BOTH HANDS he
     lifts the model up HIGH over his HEAD and PUSHES the entire
     thing UPSIDE DOWN. A massive CRASH.

     There is nothing there but the bare table.

     Sam 1 comes up behind Sam 2 with his nose SPEWING BLOOD,
     wraps both arms around Sam 2's neck. Sam 2 elbows him in
     the ribs -- a quick, controlled jab -- SPINS around,
     manages to secure Sam 1 in an arm lock.

     But suddenly there is no struggle coming from Sam 1: he's
     stopped fighting. Sam 2 removes him from the headlock --
     notices his arm is SMUDGED with Sam 1's BLOOD --

                            SAM 2
                You okay?

     Sam 1 has remained bent over, like he's cast in stone,
     blood RAINING from his face and POOLING at his feet thick
     and fast.

     Sam 2 just staring, as freaked as he is baffled.

                          SAM 2 (CONT'D)
                I hardly touched you.

     Now he tries to help Sam 1.

                          SAM 2 (CONT'D)
                Let me see.

     Sam 1 tears away from him. He looks up, his face a MESS of
     blood -- the WHITES of his eyes unnaturally bright, shouts:

                          SAM 1
                Get off me!

     Sam 1 holds his face with his outstretched hand, as if
     holding it in place -- STUMBLES from the room -- leaking
     BLOOD the whole way.

     A concerned Sam 2 watches him go.

                                                        CUT TO:


98   INT. BATHROOM -- MOMENTS LATER                                98

     Sam 1 spills in and locks the door. He RAPIDLY turns on the
     faucet and cups his hand to transfer water up to his face --
     this going on for a few seconds.

                                                                        53.




      MIRROR

      Sam 1 stares at his reflection in the mirror, holding a
      MOUND of TOILET PAPER against his NOSE. The blood flow has
      subsided

      Suddenly Sam 1 sees the GIRL in the mirror. It gives him a
      hell of a FRIGHT.

      The Girl remains in the mirror looking at Sam 1. A neutral
      expression, impassive. Sam 1 takes a deep breath, lowers
      the toilet paper from his nose.

                             SAM 1
                   Who are you?

      No answer.

                             SAM 1 (CONT'D)
                       (shouting)
                   Who are you!

      Sam 1 swings around to confront the Girl...but she's not
      there, she's vanished. Her reflection has vanished from the
      mirror also.

                                                      CUT TO:


99    INT. REC ROOM                                                99

      Sam 2 snaps on the TV with the remote, starts watching
      Laugh-In, turns, sees Sam 1 wander by in the corridor. Sam
      2 considers calling out to him, opts against it, gives the
      TV his full attention.


100   INT. MONITORING STATION                                    100

      Gerty is stationed at the Old Man collecting data. Sam 1
      enters.

                                GERTY
                   Hello Sam.

                                SAM 1
                   Hi Gerty.

      Sam 1 sits. A pause. Gerty turns from the monitor, faces of
      with an EXHAUSTED and DRAINED Sam 1.

                             GERTY
                   Sam, is everything okay?

                                                            54.



                     SAM 1
           We had a fight. Me and the other
           guy, the other Sam. We had a
           fight, Gerty. He's a maniac. You
           know what he did? He flipped the
           entire model over. Do you know
           how much work I've put into that
           thing?

                        GERTY
           938 hours.

                      SAM 1
           938 hours, exactly.
               (then)
           Really? 938 hours.

                     GERTY
           Approximately.

                     SAM 1
               (a beat)
           He scares me, Gerty.

                     GERTY
           What is it about Sam that scares
           you?

                     SAM 1
           He flies off the handle. I see it
           now...I see what Tess was talking
           about.
               (a beat)
           I've never told you this, Gerty,
           but she left me. Tess left me.
           For six months. She moved back in
           with her parents.

                        GERTY
           I know.

                      SAM 1
           Oh...
               (beat)
           It was the year before I came in
           here. She gave me a second
           chance. I promised her I'd
           change.

                     GERTY
           You have changed, Sam.

                     SAM 1
           Yeah, I guess I have.

A beat.

                                                            55.



                     SAM 1 (CONT'D)
           Gerty, since I've been up here
           I've sent Tess over a hundred
           video messages. Where did those
           messages go? Did they ever reach
           her?

A pause.

                     GERTY
           Sam, I can only account for what
           occurs on the base.

                     SAM 1
           What about the messages she sent
           to me?

A long pause. Finally Gerty repeats:

                     GERTY
           Sam, I can only account for what
           occurs on the base.

                     SAM 1
           Gerty, am I really a clone?

                     GERTY
           Sam, when you first arrived at
           Selene, there was a small crash.
           You woke up in the infirmary. You
           suffered minor brain damage and
           memory loss. I kept you under
           observation and ran some tests.

                     SAM 1
           I remember.

                     GERTY
           Sam, there was no crash. You
           were being awakened.
               (a beat)
           It is standard procedure for all
           new clones to be given tests to
           establish mental stability and
           general physical health. Genetic
           abnormalities and minor
           duplication errors in the DNA can
           have considerable impact--

                       SAM 1
           And Tess?    Eve?

                     GERTY
           They are memory implants, Sam.
           I'm very sorry.

                                                                           56.



      Sam 1 nods at this. He's broken-hearted.   He begins to
      leave.

                           GERTY (CONT'D)
                 Sam, it's been several hours
                 since your last meal. Can I
                 prepare you something?

                           SAM 1
                 No thanks, Gerty.

      Sam 1 exits.

                                                         CUT TO:


101   INT. SLEEPING QUARTERS                                        101

      Sam 1 enters the sleeping quarters -- straightens the bed
      and lies down. He picks up the picture of the pregnant
      TESS, stares at it long and hard.

                                                         CUT TO:


102   INT. REC ROOM   -- LATER                                      102

      The TV is off. Sam 2 is sitting, arms folded, entrenched in
      GLOOM.

      Sam 1 enters and heads for the kitchen, prepares himself a
      snack. Sam 2 is aware that Sam 1 is there, but keeps his
      eyes focussed forward, as immobile as a statue.

      Eventually Sam 1 tentatively comes over.

                             SAM 1
                 You okay?

                           SAM 2
                 I'm staring into space.
                     (points to the window)
                 Get it?

      Sam 1 does get it. He smiles to be polite, sits.

                           SAM 2 (CONT'D)
                 How's the nose?

                             SAM 1
                 Better.

      A beat.

                           SAM 2
                 Listen, I went haywire before. I
                 lost it. I'm sorry.

                                                            57.



                        SAM 1
           It's okay.

                      SAM 2
           No it's not okay. I fucked up
           Fairfield -- your model -- that's
           unacceptable. I don't know what's
           wrong with me.
               (then)
           I've got a temper. I need to do
           something about it.

                     SAM 1
           Yes you do.

A pause.

                     SAM 2
           I've been thinking. That Rescue
           Unit -- Eliza -- they'll be here
           in less than fourteen hours. I
           don't know about you but I'd like
           to figure out where we stand
           before they get here.

                     SAM 1
           Absolutely.

                      SAM 2
           Ostensibly they're coming to deal
           with the stalled harvester. We
           both know that isn't true.
               (then)
           They're coming to dig your body
           out of that rover. They think
           you're in there.

                        SAM 1
           Right.

                     SAM 2
           What'll their reaction be when
           they find out you survived the
           crash? I wasn't supposed to find
           you. Lunar instructed Gerty to
           lock me inside the base for
           Christ's sake.

A pause. Sam 1 thinking it over.

                     SAM 2 (CONT'D)
           And there's something else.
           Something I haven't told you.
               (a beat)
                     (MORE)

                                                                    58.

                     SAM 2 (CONT'D)
           Right around the time I was
           awakened...I walked in on Gerty
           talking to Central. He was having
           a live conversation.

                     SAM 1
           A live conversation?

                      SAM 2
           Yeah.

                     SAM 1
           That's not possible.

                     SAM 2
           No no no, it is possible. It's
           possible because I saw it, that's
           my point.

Sam 2 feels himself losing his temper a little here. He
reigns himself in.

                     SAM 1
           How do you know the conversation
           was live?

                     SAM 2
           It was a back and forth exchange.
           And I saw Thompson and Overmeyers
           up on the monitor. I was supposed
           to be asleep in the Infirmary.
           The moment I walked into the
           comms room Gerty terminated the
           transmission. Now I was a little
           drugged up, granted, but I didn't
           imagine it.

                     SAM 1
           The communications equipment is
           damaged -- there was a solar
           storm --

                      SAM 2
           Tabitha.

                     SAM 1
           Tabitha, right.

                     SAM 2
           Lunar made it up. Maybe. I don't
           know. Bottom line is they don't
           want us to be able to contact
           Earth. Otherwise why would they
           have lied to us?

A pause. Sam 1 staring forward, concentrating. Sam 2
concentrating on Sam 1.

                                                                           59.



                           SAM 1
                 How are they blocking the live
                 feed? The base's communications
                 equipment works fine --

                           SAM 2
                 Maybe they're not blocking the
                 signal from inside the base.

                           SAM 1
                 From where then?

      As if reading each others minds, the two Sams' heads turn
      to the window -- a slow, perfectly synchronized movement.

      The lunar landscape, as black and vast as ever. The view
      almost cruel in its emptiness. It's not giving them any
      answers, not yet.

                                                        CUT TO:


103   I/E. ROVER ONE/MOON SURFACE -- DAY                            103

      Sam 1 speeding along in one of the Rovers. He wears his
      space suit and resembles a cosmic racing driver -- shifts
      up a gear, the vehicle flirting with peak speed.

      He flies past one of the Harvesters, speaks through a
      microphone inside his helmet.

                           SAM 1
                 Just passing the last of the
                 Harvesters -- looks like John --

      All of this against the ROAR of the Rover's engine.


104   I/E. ROVER TWO/MOON SURFACE                                   104

      Driving away from base in a   different direction, Sam 2. He
      also wears a space suit. He   also guns the engine. He also
      has a microphone inside his   helmet. The two clones are able
      to talk back and forth with   no delay.

                           SAM 2
                 How long until you're out of the
                 base's range?

      We INTERCUT between the two Sams in their Rovers.

                           SAM 1
                 If I maintain this speed...a
                 minute. Ninety seconds tops.

                           SAM 2
                 You ever been this far out?

                                                                         60.



                              SAM 1
                 No, never.


      ANOTHER ANGLE -- SECOND ROVER

      Viewed from far away, the Rover's speed less impressive
      from a distance.


105   I/E. ROVER'S ONE AND TWO/MOON SURFACE -- INTERCUT           105

      As the Sams continue to drive.

                           SAM 1
                 You see anything yet?

                           SAM 2
                 Nothing. You?

                            SAM 1
                 There isn't shit out here...I
                 feel like I'm about to drive off
                 the end of the world.
                     (then)
                 It would help if I knew what I
                 was looking for.

      Through the glass of Sam 1's helmet we see his FACE
      suddenly SHIFT.

                           SAM 1 (CONT'D)
                 Wait a second, wait a second.

      Sam 1 squints and leans closer towards the windshield, like
      he's trying to decipher a road sign --

                           SAM 1 (CONT'D)
                 I see something.


      SAM 1'S POV

      About a hundred feet away -- appearing from thin air -- a
      massive metal pole stretches up into the black sky.

                           SAM 2
                 What is it?

                           SAM 1
                 Don't know yet.

      Sam 1 getting closer.

                           SAM 1 (CONT'D)
                 Looks like some kind of antenna.

                                                                  61.



                      SAM 2
           Antenna? Really?
               (then)
           Hang on, looks like there's one
           on this side too.

Sam 2 is indeed approaching something similar.

Sam 1 stops his Rover about twenty feet from the Jammer. He
opens the Rover's door and steps out to take a closer look.


WIDE SHOT -- SAM 1/ROVER

Taking in the Jammer and the adjacent Rover. Sam 1 loping
towards the Jammer, seemingly in slow motion.

The JAMMER is GIGANTIC --An intimidating, stark pole
stabbed into the lunar landscape, like the worlds biggest
caber. Next to it Sam 1 is tiny, a white dot, as
insignificant as a pin prick.

Sam 1 and Sam 2

We cut back and forth between the two Sams as they both
investigate the separate but identical-looking Jammers.

                      SAM 2 (CONT'D)
           I can just make out the top. Must
           be a hundred feet tall at least.
           It's huge!

                     SAM 1
           Whoever built these things meant
           business. They weren't fucking
           around.

Their voices ENERGIZED -- they are excited to have made
this discovery -- they aren't dealing with the negatives
yet.

                     SAM 1 (CONT'D)
           What do you think?

                     SAM 2
           Its not an antennae, dude. Its a
           jammer.
               (looking around)
           No wonder we can't get a live
           feed. These things must be
           blocking our signal.

Suddenly Sam 1 doubles over. He vomits thick, viscous
blood and sick into his helmet. Revolting.

The noise is AUDIBLE over the microphone.

                                                                         62.



                              SAM 2 (CONT'D)
                  You okay?

      No answer from Sam 1. He COLLAPSES backwards onto the
      ground. His chest LURCHES like he's been punched at from
      the inside -- he spins over onto his front --

                              SAM 2 (CONT'D)
                  Sam?

      Sam 1 manages to climb to his feet -- heads slowly back to
      the Rover -- he dips in, closes the door.

                            SAM 2 (CONT'D)
                  Sam, can you hear me?

                             SAM 1
                  Yeah, I hear you.
                      (then)
                  I'm going to head back to base.
                  I'm not feeling too good.

                            SAM 2
                  I'll stay out here a little
                  longer. I want to see if there
                  are any more of these things.

      Sam 1 pulls a U-turn and begins his journey back to base.

      Sam 2 remains out by his Jammer, investigating further.

                                                      CUT TO:


106   I/E. SAM 1'S ROVER/MOON SURFACE                             106

      Sam 1 at the wheel. He has pulled his helmet off within
      the safe pocket of the rovers cabin. He's a grizzly mess
      of splashed sick and blood all over his face and chest.

      Sam 1 screams out with confusion, frustration, terror.

                              SAM 1
                  Fuck!

      He seizes the steering wheel, shakes it FIERCELY --
      beginning to really LOSE IT --


107   INT. DOCK                                                   107

      Sam 1 drives his Rover into the Dock -- not with his
      customary precision -- parks at an angle, grazes the wall.

      The Rover's door JERKS opens and Sam 1 steps out
      unsteadily, his face visibly PALE through the glass of his
      helmet.

                                                                           63.



      He STAGGERS across the dock -- doesn't even close the
      Rover's door behind him -- heads into the corridor.


108   INT. CORRIDOR                                                 108

      Sam 1 goes swerving up the corridor like a drunkard --
      BANGING into walls -- he finally reaches the bathroom and
      ducks in --


109   INT. BATHROOM                                                 109

      Sam 1 sinks to his knees before the toilet bowl. With great
      effort he is able to remove his helmet, placing it on the
      floor next to him. He stares into the toilet.

      For a moment all is calm. The gentle "ping-ping-ping" of a
      computer somewhere inside the base. Sam breathing steadily.
      Spots of sweat on his upper lip.

      And then he VOMITS. He vomits LOUD, he vomits VIOLENTLY.
      His whole body THRUSTS forward in the process, taught,
      tense, like a dog being YANKED on a CHAIN.

      Sam 1 vomits again. And again. And again. And stops.


      ANGLE FROM ABOVE -- SAM 1

      Sam 1's vomit is DARK RED -- he's thrown up BLOOD -- but
      that's not all -- we can clearly see two or three TEETH
      floating in the vomit --


      THE MIRROR

      Sam 1 stands, moves to the mirror, opening his mouth wide
      to look for the missing teeth -- he uses his thumbs, shows
      his gums -- revealing: yes, he's lost at least a couple of
      teeth.

      He flushes the toilet.

                                                      CUT TO:


110   EXT. MOON -- DAY                                              110

      Sam 2 driving along in his Rover. He comes across another
      one of these JAMMERS. He drives right up, ducks down,
      peering up through the windshield -- this new Jammer is as
      tall as the others, in fact, it is identical in every way.

      How many of these things are there?

                                                                           64.



      Sam 2 circles the Jammer in the Rover, drives on.

                                                        CUT TO:


111   INT. MONITORING STATION                                       111

      Sam 1 enters and sits down at The Old Man. Frantically he
      starts typing in numbers.

      An array of Log Entries appear ON THE SCREEN. Sam watches
      one of them.

                           SAM 1
                     (on screen)
                 January 12th, Lunar hour 8:32.
                 All Harvesters running smoothly
                 today. Readouts are as follows:
                 Matthew, 12.7 miles; Mark 11.9
                 miles...

      These are just his log entries. What's he looking for?

      Sam 1 starts scrolling BACK through the log entries, like
      he's REWINDING chapters on a DVD, showing himself at
      various stages of his time on Selene -- his beard
      essentially growing in REVERSE as the messages stretch
      further back -- eventually Sam 1 is clean shaven --

                           SAM 1 (CONT'D)
                     (on the screen)
                 Luke, 12.9 miles; John, 11.1
                 miles...

      Sam 1 keeps typing in numbers.

      ON THE SCREEN: "RESTRICTED. PASSWORD REQUIRED."

      No go.   He tries to hack his way in, but is having no luck.

      One of Gerty's long spindly ARMS slides into the room. Sam
      backs away from the intimidating piece of machinery, but it
      stops within reach of the computer.

      Sam 1 watches as the arm reaches forward and taps the
      password in for him. It leaves the room the way it came
      in.

      Sam 1 continues to go further and further back -- and
      suddenly he POPS up on the screen again -- or is it him? --
      this Sam up on the screen has stubble -- no beard -- and
      looks seriously ILL --

      He is barely able to talk -- in fact he's SLURRING --

                                                                        65.



                           SAM
                     (on screen)
                 ...John, 15.1 miles...sorry, I'm
                 not feeling too hot today -- I'm
                 going to have to continue this
                 later --

      The SEQUENCE becomes a FAST-PACED and NIGHTMARISH MONTAGE --
      continuing to BACKTRACK through the log entries -- showing
      yet more SAMS -- one has a MOUSTACHE -- one has a SHAVED
      HEAD -- one has grown out his hair and has a PONY TAIL,
      we've seen this particular Sam before in an earlier scene.

      But all the Sams have one thing in common: towards the
      latter end of their log entries they all appear to be in
      very bad physical shape --

                            SAM 4
                 ...I've got blood coming out of
                 my nose...

                           SAM 5
                 I don't feel too well, Old Man.

                           SAM 6
                 My hair's falling out...look it.

      Sam 1 searches even DEEPER into the COMPUTER and uncovers
      yet more footage.

      We see the others Sams returning to Earth -- yet they don't
      seem to go anywhere -- when they blast off the RETURN
      VEHICLE remains in its bay --

      Sam 1 views different Sams blasting back to earth in the
      return vehicle -- always with the same result -- the return
      vehicle remaining in its bay, the Sams seemingly VANISHING.

      In one particularly GRAINY SEQUENCE Sam 1 views Gerty
      opening the lid to the cryo pod in the return vehicle and
      beginning to VACUUM what appears to be DUST or DEBRIS --

      Sam 1 understands now that the Return Vehicle is not a
      spacecraft, but some kind of INCINERATOR.


112   INT. RETURN VEHICLE                                         112

      Sam 1 heads into the Return Vehicle. Its dominated by the
      cryo pod, used to hold astronauts in a state of cryogenic
      sleep on their way back to Earth. Sam 1 pops open the lid
      and starts frantically searching the chamber for TRACES of
      the previous Sams, eventually finding particles of DUST in
      the cracks --

                                                                        66.



      He closes the lid. A video showing a TECHNICIAN in a white
      lab coat begins to play on a screen aimed at the glass lid
      of the pod. It's mute, but we can hear a tinny version of
      the audio coming from the cryo pod. Sam 1 pushes a button
      on the monitor and we hear the audio properly.

                            TECHNICIAN
                  ...relax and breathe deeply. The
                  cryo pod is designed to put you
                  into a deep sleep for the
                  duration of your three day return
                  journey back to Earth. As you
                  begin to get sleepy, think about
                  the magnificent job you've done,
                  and how proud your family are of
                  what you've accomplished.

      Relaxing music begins to play. After a moment the music
      stops. There is a pause. Then an almighty pulse of light
      from the cryo pod. This is how Sams past have met their
      end. Nuked to ash like microwave meals in the cryo pod.

      Sam 1 inspects the controls of the spacecraft to see if it
      really is a vehicle -- in the process of his search he
      finds himself down on his knees checking out the wiring.

      Suddenly Sam 1's attention is on the floor BENEATH HIM. He
      appears to be kneeling on some kind of PANEL -- like a
      tablet in the return vehicle's floor -- he presses his ear
      against the panel -- KNOCKS --

      The panel sounds HOLLOW.


      CUBBY

      Sam 1 opens a cubby, swipes something similar to a CROW
      BAR, heads out of the frame --


      RETURN VEHICLE

      Back in the Return Vehicle, Sam 1 stands over the panel in
      the floor. He uses the CROW BAR to prize the panel open --
      this takes an extraordinary effort -- the panel eventually
      LIFTING like a manhole cover.

      Sam 1 can't believe his eyes. At the top of the OPEN PANEL,
      leading down into darkness...there's A LADDER.


113   INT. DOCK                                                  113    

      Sam 2 returns from his tour of the perimeter of the base;
      pulls up alongside Sam 1's Rover, having to compensate for
      his clone's poor parking job.

                                                                        67.




114   INT. CORRIDOR                                               114

      Sam 2 exits the Parking Bay and removes his helmet. Down
      the corridor he sees Sam 1 standing outside the Return
      Vehicle: facing him, waiting.

                           SAM 2
                 I saw three more of those
                 jammers. The base is surrounded.
                 I printed out their coordinates --

      Sam 2 begins to remove a piece of paper from his pocket,
      but suddenly stops. He can tell by Sam 1's expression that
      something has happened.

                           SAM 2 (CONT'D)
                 What? What is it?

                           SAM 1
                 I found your secret room.                               

                                                      CUT TO:


115   INT. RETURN VEHICLE                                         115

      Standing over the Open Panel, an anxious Sam 1 and Sam 2
      stare down.

                           SAM 2
                 Who goes first?

      Sam 1 wordlessly takes the lead, crouching slightly to
      seize the ladder and twist his body down into the hole. He
      begins to DESCEND. When he is roughly half way down Sam 2
      follows.


116   INT. LOWER DECK/CHAMBER -- CONTINUOUS                       116

      Sam 1 reaches the bottom of the ladder. He's in a dark
      room, a kind of CHAMBER -- if NASA did crypts, it would
      look like this.                                                    

      The only light source right now is the coming from the
      Return Vehicle up above. Sam 2 hops down beside Sam 1,
      squints into the darkness.

                           SAM 2
                 Is there a light?

      Both Sams FUMBLE along opposing walls -- Sam 1 eventually
      finding a SWITCH, snaps it on.

      An array of overhead fluorescent bulbs begin to STUTTER and
      FLASH before ILLUMINATING the chamber completely --

                                                                  68.



The two Sams can hardly believe their eyes: stretching back
maybe fifty feet are rows and rows of PODS -- like upright
glass coffins -- and standing inside each pod, an as-of-yet
UNAWAKENED CLONE. It's like an ENTIRE ARMY of Sam Bells...

Spooky as hell.

For a few moments Sam 1 and 2 are too stunned to speak.
They walk to the end of the chamber and back again, looking
at each clone one at a time -- all the clones are bare
chested and wear some kind of white cloth to cover their
genitals, like a diaper.

Of course they all look the same, that's why they're
clones, but this piece of scientific wizardry is mind-
boggling to Sam 1 and 2 -- they MARVEL at how each of the
clones is identical in every way, and down to the minutest
of details -- same length of hair, same skin tone, same
fingernails --

                     SAM 2 (CONT'D)
           Why are there so many of them?

                     SAM 1
           The cryo pod in the Return
           Vehicle is an incinerator.

Sam 2 reacts with appropriate shock.

                       SAM 2
           What?

                     SAM 1
           We don't go home. We're burned to
           death up there. Then the company
           wakes up a new one. Every three
           years. Like clock work.                             

Sam 2 absorbing this. Then:

                     SAM 2
           How do you know all this?

                      SAM 1                                    
               (beat)                                          
           I hacked into the Old Man.
           Actually, Gerty did. I saw
           footage. You're right, there have
           been other clones before us.

                       SAM 2
           How many?

                       SAM 1
           Enough.                                             

A pause.

                                                                           69.



                           SAM 2
                 If that Rescue Unit finds the two
                 of us awake at the same time,
                 they'll kill us both for sure.

      Sam 1 doesn't respond, he's in his own world.

                           SAM 2 (CONT'D)
                 What are we going to do?

      All of a sudden Sam 1 makes a beeline for the ladder,
      starts heading back up.

                           SAM 2 (CONT'D)
                 Where are you going?


117   INT. MONITORING STATION -- MOMENTS LATER                      117

      Sam 1 is digging in drawers, removes some equipment, some
      wires; a radio, a small machine called a VIDEO PHONE,
      referred to as a VP.

      He is watched by Gerty.

                            GERTY
                 Sam, can I help you with
                 something?

                           SAM 1
                 Not now, Gerty, okay?

      Gerty begins to slide out of the room.   Sam calls after             
      him.                                                                 

                            SAM 1 (CONT'D)                                 
                 Gerty? Why did you help me? With                          
                 the password? Doesn't that go                             
                 against your programming or                               
                 something?                                                

                           GERTY                                           
                 Helping you is what I do.                                 

      Gerty leaves.                                                        

      Sam 1 goes on picking up equipment, shoves it all into a
      backpack he swiped from a peg.

      Now Sam 2 appears in the doorway.

                           SAM 2
                 What's going on?

                           SAM 1
                 There's something I've got to do.

                                                                        70.



      Sam 1 brushes by Sam 2 on his way out.


118   INT. DOCK                                                   118

      Sam 1 marches up to his Rover, tosses in the backpack and
      dips inside without his helmet, closes the door and backs
      out into the black day.


119   I/E. SAM 1'S ROVER/MOON SURFACE                             119

      Sam 1 at the wheel, flooring the Rover -- he looks
      possessed, determined -- a man on a mission --


      WIDE SHOT

      Sam's Rover approaches one of the many Jammers that we now
      know circle the perimeter of the base.

      Sam 1 stops the Rover on the other side of the Jammer.
      Here, outside the range of the Jammers, he figures he might
      be able to get a signal through to Earth.

      ON SAM as he removes his equipment from the backpack and
      starts to uncoil wires -- inserts a small BATTERY PACK onto
      the back of the VP, sits the VP on his lap. The VP
      resembles a Play Station Portable with its small but
      nonetheless high-quality screen.

      Sam isn't sure who to contact at first...finally he enters
      some numbers from memory. The VP shaking in his hands. He
      is nervous, scared. He disables the video mode on his end,         
      so he is only sending audio.                                       

      A moment of silence. The VP seems dead.

                            SAM 1
                  Come on...come on...

      Then the VP BEEPS -- the monitor BLIPS -- the message seems
      to have gone through.

      And suddenly a GIRL appears on the screen.

      Sam 1 can't believe it. It's the same Girl from his
      hallucinations. Same wheat-colored hair. Same freckles
      dotting her cheek bones. Same yellow dress.

      The moment Sam 1 sees the Girl he thinks -- naturally --
      that he's imagining things again. But then she speaks:

                            GIRL
                  Hello?

                                                                     71.



That's never happened before. Sam 1 finally manages to
respond:

                     SAM 1
           Uh, Bell residence?

The conversation has a very slight delay, maybe a second or
two, and the Girl isn't completely clear on the monitor. We
assume that these minor technical glitches are the same on
the Girl's end.

The Girl is sweet, chirpy -- nothing like the haunting,
ghost-like figure from Sam 1's hallucinations.

                     GIRL
           This is the Bell Residence.

                     SAM 1
           I'm trying to reach Tess Bell.

The girl's expression shifts -- now somewhere between
melancholy and curiosity --

                      GIRL
           I'm sorry, she passed away some
           years ago.

Sam 1 GASPS. He literally gasps. Like someone just plunged
a paring knife into his belly.

                     SAM 1
           No...no way.

The girl just stares.

                     SAM 1 (CONT'D)
           Tess Bell? Are you sure?

                      GIRL
           Uh, yeah, I think so. I'm her
           daughter.
               (then)
           Can I help you?

And astonishingly, the news of Tess's death actually takes
a back seat as Sam 1 is forced to confront this new
revelation.

The girl is EVE BELL. Sam 1 is talking to his DAUGHTER.

Sam 1 tilts his head, a smile twitches on his face.

                     SAM 1
           Eve?

Sam 1 can't believe it. She's beautiful. She's beautiful.

                                                                   72.



                     EVE BELL
           Yes?

A moment. Eve looking more closely, trying to decipher Sam
1's face. Tears glistening in his eyes.

                      SAM 1
                (overwhelmed)
           Hi... Hi. Eve. How old are you
           now?

For a second Eve is embarrassed -- she blushes slightly --
but is still pulled in, intrigued.

                      EVE BELL
           I'm fifteen.
               (then)
           Do I know you?

                     SAM 1
           How did mom die, sweetheart?

                     EVE BELL
           Uh...

Now Eve is beginning to look spooked. She turns away from
the screen and calls to someone in another room:

                     EVE BELL (CONT'D)
           Dad!

And then we hear a voice. Sam's voice.

                     SAM'S VOICE (O.S.)
           What!

                     EVE BELL
           Dad, there's someone asking about
           mom...

 Sam's voice sounds CLOSER, more SUCCINCT, as he comes into
 the room -- but we don't see him yet -- he sounds, OLDER.     

                     SAM'S VOICE
           Who's asking about mom?


Sam 1 hurriedly shuts off the VP.

He sits there in the Rover, on the Moon, the middle of
nowhere -- hundreds and thousands of miles from Earth --
Sam 1 has never felt more alone than he does right now.

                                                                        73.




120   EXT. ROVER/MOON SURFACE                                     120

      The Rover viewed from outside. We can't hear a thing. Just
      the endless and unrelenting MOON SILENCE.

      Inside the Rover we are able to make out Sam 1, quivering
      at the wheel as he sobs.

                                                      CUT TO:


121   INT. COMMS ROOM                                             121


      CLOSE UP -- THE OLD MAN

      The "ping-ping-ping" of an alarm.

      Appearing on The Old Man's monitor: "RESCUE UNIT ELIZA:
      ARRIVAL TIME, 12 HOURS and 22 MINUTES."

                                                      CUT TO:


122   INT. REC ROOM -- DAY                                        122

      Sam 2 is sitting before the model. He's flipped it back
      over and returned it to the table top. Now he is attempting
      to fix some of the demolished pieces. At this moment he's
      gluing the spire back on the church.

      Sam 2 hears a sound from the corridor. Moments later Sam 1
      appears in the doorway wearing the backpack.

      Sam 1 is beginning to look alarmingly ILL. His depleting
      health has been evident throughout the film, but now it
      seems to have jumped to a new level.

      He watches Sam 2 for a little while.

                           SAM 1
                 Want me to help?

      Sam 2 shifts over to give Sam 1 the adjacent chair. Sam 1
      walks over, sits down. Together they work on gluing the
      church back together.

                           SAM 1 (CONT'D)
                 Remember that crazy drunk guy who
                 used to hang out by the church?

                           SAM 2
                 Barbara Streisand?

                                                                  74.



                     SAM 1
               (with a smile)
           He looked like Barbara Streisand.
           We used to hide his Bible when he
           passed out. Drove the guy nuts.

Sam 2 nods, remembering. A pause.

                     SAM 2
           How do you carve these things?

                     SAM 1
           Want me to show you?

Sam 2 nods. Sam 1 picks up a block of wood, grabs an exacto
blade. Demonstrates.

                     SAM 1 (CONT'D)
           You need to hold the wood away
           from you. Like this.

                     SAM 2
           You're shaking.

Sam 2 isn't kidding. Though he is carving the block of
wood, Sam 1 can't keep it steady.

                     SAM 2 (CONT'D)
           Why are you shaking?

                      SAM 1
           Watch what I'm doing.
               (then)
           You watching?

                     SAM 2
           Yeah.

                     SAM 1
           Now you try.

Sam 1 hands the wood and exacto blade to Sam 2.

Sam 2 attempts to whittle. He smiles, a little embarrassed.

                     SAM 2
           I suck.

                     SAM 1
           You'll get the hang of it.
               (a beat)
           You see, that's a little better
           already.

                                                                  75.



Suddenly Sam 1 turns around and has a vicious coughing fit.
It actually seems to propel Sam 1 out of his chair and up
onto his feet. Sam 2 watches with concern. Eventually the
coughing subsides.

                     SAM 2
           What's happening to you?

Sam 1 averts his gaze.

                     SAM 2 (CONT'D)
           Listen, I realize I've been less
           than cooperative. But I want to
           change that. You and me, we need
           to work together. And that starts
           with not keeping secrets from
           each other.
               (a beat)
           Now what's going on?

Sam 1 tells the truth.

                     SAM 1
           I think I'm dying.

Sam 2 stares back at him.

                     SAM 1 (CONT'D)
           There's blood in everything. My
           urine. My vomit. I've got a
           constant headache. Dizzy spells.
               (a beat)
           The same thing happened to the
           other clones. I saw it when I
           hacked into the Old Man. After
           three years they all started to
           get sick. Now it's happening to
           me. Well, it's been happening for
           a while now. A couple of weeks.

                     SAM 2
           What do you think it is?

                      SAM 1
           Maybe we don't live that long.
           Maybe we start to decompose or
           something.

                     SAM 2
           Jesus.

Suddenly Sam 1 closes his eyes -- SWAYS -- looks like he's
going to pass out.

                     SAM 2 (CONT'D)
           Hey hey hey, you okay?

                                                                        76.



      Sam 2 stands and moves to Sam 1. Holds him up, checks his
      temperature.

                           SAM 2 (CONT'D)
                 Why don't you lie down for a
                 while? Take some tranqs. Get
                 some sleep.

                           SAM 1
                     (grim smile)
                 No tranqs. I don't think I would
                 ever wake up again.

      Sam 1 manages a nod.

      Sam 2 hooks his arm around Sam 1's shoulder, helps him from
      the room.


123   INT. SLEEPING QUARTERS                                      123

      Sam 2 deposits Sam 1 onto the bed. He removes Sam 1's
      backpack, eases a pillow under his head. Sam 1 is instantly
      asleep. Sam 2 pulls the comforter over him.

      Sam 2 begins to leave the room, sees Sam 1's backpack on
      the floor, the VP sticking out of it. Curious, Sam 2 grabs
      the VP.

      FLASHING on the VP's SCREEN: "Last Transmission: 15:14pm."

                                                      CUT TO:


124   INT. REC ROOM                                               124

      Sam 2 enters the Rec Room and shuts the door. He moves to
      one of the tables and sits down, POPS on the VP.

      ON THE VP MONITOR we begin to re-watch the conversation
      between Eve Bell and Sam 1. Obviously we are only seeing
      Eve's face on the screen, but WE HEAR Sam 1's voice in the
      background.

                           SAM 1 (O.S.)
                 Uh, Bell Residence?

                           EVE
                 This is the Bell residence.

                           SAM 2
                     (commenting as he
                      watches)
                 No you didn't...

                           SAM 1 (O.S.)
                 I'm trying to reach Tess Bell.

                                                                           77.



                            EVE
                 I'm sorry, she passed away some
                 years ago.

      Sam 2 and Sam 1 have exactly the same reaction at the same
      time.

               SAM 1 (O.S.)                           SAM 2
      No...no way.                     No...no way.

                           SAM 1 (O.S.)
                 Tess Bell? Are you sure?

                            EVE
                 Uh, yeah, I think so, I'm her
                 daughter.
                     (then)
                 Can I help you?

      I'm her daughter. A couple of days ago Sam 2 didn't know he
      had a daughter, and now he's seeing her as a teenager, a
      young woman. He is stunned.

      Sam 2 continues to watch the message but we

                                                         CUT TO:


125   INT. SLEEPING QUARTERS -- DAY                                 125

      Sam 1 fast asleep. Sam 2 watches him from the doorway.


126   INT. STORAGE CUBBY                                            126

      Gerty is just continuing with his tasks like nothing is
      happening. Right now he's STACKING ready-meals and
      miscellaneous lunar snacks into neat columns.

      Sam 2 walks up.

                           SAM 2
                 Gerty, I need to talk to you.

                           GERTY
                 Of course, Sam, how can I help?

                           SAM 2
                 We found the hidden room. We know
                 about the other clones.

      A long pause. Then:

                           GERTY
                 I don't know of a hidden room.

                                                            78.



                     SAM 2
           The hidden room under the Return
           Vehicle, Gerty. You know what I'm
           talking about. We found it on our
           own. Lunar doesn't know anything
           about it.

A beat.

                     GERTY
           The lower deck is out of bounds
           to awakened clones --

                     SAM 2
           Ordinarily, Gerty, but what with
           there being two of us awake at
           the same time, and what with the
           situation being unprecedented,
           the rules have had to change. Do
           you understand?

                     GERTY
           I understand the situation is
           unprecedented.

                     SAM 2
           Good.
               (a beat)
           Gerty, how long does it take for
           a clone to wake up?

                     GERTY
           A clone is awake the moment his
           pod is opened. But he is not
           fully conscious for several
           hours.

A beat.

                     SAM 2
           Gerty, we need to wake up a new
           clone.

                     GERTY
           I am not permitted to do that,
           Sam.

                     SAM 2
           If we don't wake up another clone
           me and the other Sam will die.
           We'll die, Gerty. Do you
           understand?

                     GERTY
           Yes.

                                                                        79.



                           SAM 2
                 Do you want me and the other Sam
                 to die?

                           GERTY
                 That is the last thing I want.

                           SAM 2
                 Then you have to wake up a new
                 clone. Okay, pal?

      Sam 2 waits for a response. And waits.

                                                      CUT TO:

      CLOSE UP -- THE OLD MAN

      The "ping-ping-ping" of an alarm.

      Appearing on The Old Man's monitor: "RESCUE UNIT ELIZA:
      ARRIVAL TIME, 6 HOURS and 19 MINUTES."

      Sam 1 fast asleep in bed.


129   SAM 1'S DREAM                                              129

      A stretch of green grass dissected by a dirt path. A light
      breeze. Endless blue sky above. No clouds. No visible sun.


130   INT. SLEEPING QUARTERS                                     130

      Back on the sleeping Sam 1. Deep breaths. Eyelids twitching
      slightly.


131   SAM 1'S DREAM -- CONTINUED                                 131

      In the distance, sitting beneath a tree on a blanket, we
      see TESS BELL. She is removing items from a picnic basket.

      Sam enters the frame, his back to the camera. He watches
      his wife for a few moments, maintaining his distance.

      Tess looks up and sees Sam. She lifts her hand, waves.

                                                                        80.




      ON SAM -- IN THE DREAM

      Sam's expression is blank at first, but then he smiles at
      Tess, waves back.


132   INT. SLEEPING QUARTERS                                      132

      Sam 1's eyes open slowly. He's awake.

      Was his dream a memory? A premonition? Or was it simply
      made up?


      ANOTHER ANGLE -- SAM 1

      A BLEARY Sam 1 yawns and stretches his arms over his head.
      He reaches across the bed and rips a couple of tissues from
      a box of Kleenex, blows his nose.

      Afterwards he checks the tissues: a thick RED GOO came out
      of his nose, the color and consistency of tomato purée.
      Yeah, gross.

      Sam 1 rolls out of bed, plants his feet on the ground.

      The base seems eerily quiet. Too quiet. Sam 1 stands and
      crosses to the door.


133   INT. CORRIDOR                                               133

      Sam 1 begins to walk left, down towards the Rec Room and
      the Monitoring Station, but hesitates -- he turns the other
      way, towards the Infirmary, heads that way instead.


134   INT. INFIRMARY -- CONTINUOUS                                134

      Lying in one of the Infirmary beds, eyes closed, a NETWORK
      of WIRES attached to his chest...Sam. We don't know which
      Sam it is yet. He is clean shaven. He looks like any one of
      the clones down in the secret chamber; then again he could
      just as easily be Sam 2.

      And that's what Sam 1 naturally assumes as he enters the
      Infirmary and sees him lying there. Sam 1 moves closer,
      curious, until he is standing right at the edge of the bed.

      Sam 1 reaches out his hand to wake him up when there is a
      voice from the doorway behind:

                           SAM 2
                 Don't touch him.

                                                                          81.



      Our suspicions are now confirmed. The Sam in the Infirmary
      bed is a new clone. We will call him SAM 3.

                           SAM 2 (CONT'D)
                 He's not conscious yet. Gerty and
                 I only woke him up a few hours
                 ago.

      Sam 1 is not even remotely on the same page.

                           SAM 1
                 Why?

      Sam 2 puts his finger to his lips. Then:

                           SAM 2
                 Come to the Rec Room.

      Sam 2 turns and leaves. Sam 1 follows slowly, one or two
      glances at the sleeping clone along the way.


135   INT. REC ROOM                                                135

      We cut straight to the Rec Room and the conversation
      between Sam 1 and Sam 2.

                           SAM 2
                 When the Rescue Unit arrives
                 they'll expect to find a body in
                 the crashed Rover, right?
                     (a beat)
                 We've got our body.

                           SAM 1
                     (points towards the
                      Infirmary)
                 That guy?

      Sam 2 nods.

                           SAM 1 (CONT'D)
                 They'll expect to find a dead
                 body in the crashed Rover.

                           SAM 2
                 I know.

                           SAM 1
                     (stunned)
                 You're going to kill him?

                           SAM 2
                 Someone's got to pull the short
                 straw here, better someone who's
                 unconscious than you or me.

                                                                     82.



Sam 1 simply digesting the gravity of Sam 2's plan.

                     SAM 2 (CONT'D)
           If we go through with this, I'm
           going to need your help hauling
           him out to the crash site.

                     SAM 1
           What about us? Eliza arrives,
           finds you and me as the welcome
           party --

                     SAM 2
           They're not going to find you and
           me as the welcome party, they're
           going to find me. You're going to
           blast back to Earth before they
           get here in one of the Helium 3
           containers.
               (a beat)
           You're going home.

 Sam 1 wasn't expecting that.

                     SAM 2 (CONT'D)
           You've done your three years. I
           can't expect you to stick around.
           Maybe you can meet Eve in person.

 A beat.

                     SAM 2 (CONT'D)
           I saw the message on the VP. Eve
           is beautiful. She looks like her
           mom.

 Sam 1 realizes that Sam 2 knows everything. There are no
 secrets between them now.

 They both absorb the impact of knowing Tess is dead.
 Finally:

                     SAM 1
           How do you think she died?

                      SAM 2
           I don't know.
               (then)
           Jane died of cancer. I mean, it
           was in the family. Who knows? Or
           maybe it was an accident? Could
           have been a million things.

                     SAM 1
           I wish I'd been there.

                                                                           83.



                           SAM 2
                 Yeah. Me too.

      The two Sams sitting together, UNITED by their grief.


                                                         CUT TO:


136   EXT. MOON BASE -- DAY                                         136

      Shot of Selene from across the lunar plane. The base looks
      almost peaceful. No evidence of the DRAMA going on inside.


137   INT. CORRIDOR                                                 137    

      The two Sams are testing out the CARGO CONTAINER to see if
      their plan is going to work and Sam 1 can actually fit
      inside.

      These containers were designed to carry cannisters of
      Helium 3, not to accommodate human beings.

      Sam 1 looks in increasingly bad shape. Blanket draped
      around his shoulders -- gaunt, bobbing, shivering.

                              SAM 2
                 Go for it.

      Sam 1 hunches and slowly insinuates himself into the
      container -- yes, he fits, but it's tight, like really
      tight -- Sam 1 can anticipate one hell of a stiff neck by
      the time he steps out onto terra firma.

                              SAM 2 (CONT'D)
                 Comfy?

                              SAM 1
                 No.

      Sam 2 chuckles.

                           SAM 2
                 But you fit. That's good. You
                 fit.

      With a HEAVE Sam 2 PULLS Sam 1 from the container.

                                                         CUT TO:


138   INT. INFIRMARY -- DAY                                         138

      Gerty is running tests on the unconscious Sam 3.

                                                                        84.



      Sam 1 and Sam 2 stand on opposite sides of the room. Both
      clones seem uneasy. They can't look at each other. They
      can't look at Sam 3. Their eyes roam every inch of the room
      just about before finally settling on Gerty.

      Regardless of Sam 3 being unconscious, are they really
      going to kill him?

                                                      CUT TO:


139   INT. COMMS ROOM                                            139

      Sam 2 sits at the comms unit recording the message, a smile
      plastered on his face, as WIDE as it is FAKE.

                           SAM 2
                 Sam Bell reporting to Central.
                 19:14 Pacific Time. Lunar Day 14.
                     (a beat)
                 Evening Overmeyers, evening
                 Thompson! According to the Old
                 Man Rescue Unit Eliza will be
                 here in just over three hours.
                 Not a moment too soon! I never
                 thought I'd say this, but I want
                 to get out there, I want to work.
                 I feel like a kid who's been
                 grounded. Looking forward to
                 Eliza straightening everything
                 out and things getting back to
                 normal around here. Well...that's
                 it. I'll let you know how it
                 goes. Over and out, gentlemen.

      Sam 2 sends the message, his SMILE instantly COLLAPSING. He
      mutters under his breath:

                             SAM 2 (CONT'D)
                 Bastards.


140   INT. SLEEPING QUARTERS -- DAY                              140

      Sam 1 is sitting on the edge of his bed holding the
      photograph of the pregnant Tess -- staring with great
      concentration -- almost penetrative -- like he's trying to
      will himself into the photograph.

      We find out what's running through his head, cutting to:


141   SAM 1'S DREAM                                              141

      Sam 1 has gone back to his dream -- or his vision -- of
      Tess sitting on the picnic blanket beneath the tree.

                                                                           85.



      Sam and Tess continue to wave to one another. Sam hasn't
      moved. Tess calls out:

                            TESS
                 Come on!

      Suddenly we hear a voice.

                            SAM 2 (O.S.)
                 Sam?


142   INT. SLEEPING QUARTERS                                        142

      Sam 2 is standing at the door. Sam 1 looks up at him.

                           SAM 2
                 We need to do it. We need to do
                 it now. He'll be conscious any
                 minute.
                     (a beat)
                 We've been putting it off for
                 long enough.

      Sam 1 stares back at Sam 2 with defiance.

                           SAM 1
                 We don't have to do anything. I
                 changed my mind.

      Sam 2 isn't following.

                           SAM 1 (CONT'D)
                 I'm not going back.
                     (a beat)
                 I'm coughing up blood, I'm as
                 white as a ghost. I look like I
                 belong in a graveyard. I meet Eve
                 now, I'll scare the shit out of
                 her more than anything else.
                 D'you think she'll even come
                 within ten feet of me, the way I
                 look?

                           SAM 2
                 What are you talking about?
                 She's your daughter, man! She's
                 not going to care what you...

                           SAM 1
                     (angry)
                 She's not! She's not... my
                 daughter. At least, I'm not her
                 father. Not to her.


      Sam 2 keeps quiet.

                                                                  86.



                     SAM 1 (CONT'D)
           I'll put myself in the Rover,
           I'll be the body -- it was me to
           begin with anyway, right? You go
           back to Earth. You go back.
           You're healthy. You've got three
           years ahead of you. You stand a
           much better chance than I do. The
           other guy....Gerty can get him up
           to speed...he can be here to meet
           Eliza when they arrive.

Sam 1 seems to have it all figured out. Although Sam 2
should in some ways be relieved by Sam 1's decision, he
looks closer to distraught.

                     SAM 2
           This is wrong. What are we
           supposed to do? Sit around here
           and wait to die? Fuck that!

                      SAM 1
           I don't know.
               (beat)
           It's what we were designed to do.

Both Sams struggle to hold in their emotions; Sam 1 morose,
Sam 2 angry.

                     SAM 2
           Screw that! I'll go! ...And I'm
           going to find this asshole, Sam
           Bell, and ask him why the hell he
           put us through this shit!

Sam 1 looks concerned.   Sam 2 reads his mind.

                     SAM 2 (CONT'D)
           I'll be careful. I'll keep Eve
           out of it. She wont even know I
           exist.

Sam 1 smiles wearily, watching his old self.

                     SAM 1
           You're a good guy, Sam.

                      SAM 2
           I might stop shaving; It suits
           us.
               (beat)
           If all our memories are implants,
           no disrespect, but I think its
           about time I got some of my own,
           as well.

                                                                         87.



                           SAM 1
                 Yeah. You should travel.     I've
                 always wanted to do that.

                           SAM 2
                 I'd like that.

                                                       CUT TO:


143   I/E. ROVER/MOON SURFACE -- DAY                              143

      Driving to the crash site. Sam 2 at the wheel, Sam 1 riding
      shotgun. Both men staring ahead in silence.


      MATTHEW

      Where all the trouble really started. Matthew, the stalled
      Harvester, with the crashed Rover still trapped beneath it.
      The crash site is beginning to resemble some old underwater
      shipwreck.

      The Rover enters the frame, beginning to slow down as it
      approaches the crash site. Sam 2 rolls the Rover to a
      standstill about ten feet from the front of the Harvester.


144   I/E. ROVER/MOON SURFACE -- MOMENTS LATER                    144

      Sam 2 keeps the engine running as Sam 1 takes a handful of
      TRANQUILIZERS one by one, washing down each pill with a
      swig from a bottle of water.

      Afterwards: a long pause. The two Sams sitting side by
      side, staring across the bleak landscape. Neither of them
      wants to say good-bye particularly.

                           SAM 1
                 Tess came in for the interview,
                 remember?

      Sam 2 is nodding away. Of course he remembers.

                           SAM 1 (CONT'D)
                 She was so beautiful. Even   if she
                 wasn't the best candidate,   I just
                 knew I had to give her the   job. I
                 thought she was so sweet.
                     (a beat)
                 And then it was the end of   the
                 summer.

                            SAM 2
                 She was going back to San
                 Francisco.
                            (MORE)

                                                                        88.

                            SAM 2 (CONT'D)
                 You knew you had to take a
                 chance. So you called her.
                 You were terrified and wrote that
                 whole speech for her answer
                 machine --
                     (a beat)
                 But I didn't need it because Tess
                 answered the phone. And I could
                 tell in her voice as we talked,
                 she was thinking...
                 "Why has Sam called me?"
                 "The internship's over, why's he
                 called me at home?"
                 And then I asked her if she was
                 going to Adrian Fiddle's barbecue
                 and...

      Sam 1 has dropped off to sleep. The back and forth exchange
      is now essentially Sam 2's monologue.

                           SAM 2 (CONT'D)
                 That's when I knew she liked me.
                 Because she didn't want to talk
                 to anyone else! She'd get up, get
                 some potato salad, go to the
                 bathroom, but she'd always come
                 back. And then we kissed. On the
                 steps in front of her apartment
                 building.

      Sam 2 finally turns and looks at Sam 1. Sam 1's head cocked
      to one side, eyes closed.

      Sam 2 lifts the helmet off Sam 1's lap -- carefully lowers
      the helmet onto Sam 1's head.


145   I/E. ROVER/MOON SURFACE                                     145    

      Sam 2 LOPES towards the crashed rover holding Sam 1 in both
      arms like a bride. He places Sam 1 on the ground and PRIZES
      open the rover door -- he slowly slides Sam 1 inside.

      Inside the Rover Sam 1 lies with his head jammed awkwardly
      against the passenger side door. At once he looks peaceful
      and wretchedly uncomfortable.

      Sam 2 can barely bring himself to look at Sam 1. With both
      hands he FORCES the door CLOSED, pivots around and slowly
      BOBS back to his rover.


146   I/E. ROVER/MOON SURFACE -- MOMENTS LATER                    146

      Sam 2 driving back to base. He has removed his helmet and
      is brushing tears from his eyes with his glove.

                                                      CUT TO:

147   INT. COMMS ROOM                                            147


      CLOSE UP -- THE OLD MAN

      The "ping-ping-ping" of an alarm.

      Appearing on The Old Man's monitor: "RESCUE UNIT ELIZA:
      ARRIVAL TIME, 1 HOUR and 40 MINUTES."

148   INT. INFIRMARY -- LATER                                    148

      Gerty is continuing to run tests on Sam 3. Sam 2 enters. He
      carries the freighted exhaustion of a man who has just
      completed a long and difficult journey.

                           SAM 2
                 How long before he's conscious,
                 Gerty?

                           GERTY
                 The new clone will be conscious
                 within one hour.

                           SAM 2
                 That's good. That's very good.

                            GERTY
                 Sam?   Where is Sam?

                           SAM 2
                 He's gone home, Gerty.

      Sam 2 leaves.


149   INT. MONITORING STATION -- DAY                             149

      Sam 2 is loading OXYGEN CANISTERS into the CARGO CONTAINER
      in preparation for his trip back to Earth.

      Sam 2 working FAST, a sense of URGENCY. Eliza will be there
      in a mere 90 minutes! It's coming down to the wire.

      Gerty glides in as he works.

                           GERTY
                 Sam, this is not going to work.                        

                           SAM 2
                 What? Why not?                                         

                                                                        90.



      Now Sam 2 loads food into the cargo container -- moon
      snacks, rations, etc. -- and bottles of water. His final
      addition is a 5 kilo load of precious Helium3; A good 15
      million dollars worth!

                           GERTY
                 If the Rescue Unit examine my
                 memory banks they will discover
                 what has taken place over the
                 last week. As you know I record
                 everything. If they are
                 suspicious, the first thing they
                 will do is search my memory
                 banks, and this would put you in
                 considerable danger.

      Sam 2 straightens up, giving Gerty his full attention now.
      This is serious. It could ruin everything.

      The fact that Gerty has brought it up indicates that the
      robot's loyalties lie ultimately with Sam.

                           GERTY (CONT'D)
                 I recommend erasing my memory
                 banks. I can reboot myself once
                 you have departed.

                            SAM 2                                       
                 So that's what we're going to
                 have to do.

                 I'll require your assistance,                          
                 Sam.                                                   

                           SAM 2
                 Sure, just let me finish this.

      Sam 2 continues his work.

      SAM 1'S DREAM

      Once again we see Tess beneath the tree sitting on the
      blanket. She looks over at Sam, continuing to wave.

                           TESS
                 Come on, Sam! Sam Bell! Come on!

      Sam begins to walk towards Tess.

      Back on Sam 1. The glass of his helmet is beginning to MIST
      with blood. Sam sees a sliver of the sun as he dawns on his
      side of the moon. He closes his eyes for the last time.

                           SAM 2
                 I've set your computer to reboot
                 the second I've blasted off.

                              GERTY
                 Okay, Sam.

                            SAM 2
                 Thanks for all your help, Gerty.
                 I wish I could say I was going to
                 miss you, buddy, but to be
                 honest, I can't wait to get away
                 from here.

                           GERTY
                 I understand, Sam. I hope life
                 is everything you remember it to
                 be.

                           SAM 2
                 Thanks. Are you sure you're                            
                 going to be ok?

                            GERTY
                 Of course. The new Sam and I                           
                 will be back to our programming
                 as soon as I have finished
                 rebooting.

                           SAM 2
                 Gerty, I'm not programmed.

                                                                          92.



      Gerty doesn't respond.    Sam 2 seems troubled.

      Sam 2 leans forward and activates the Memory Erase button.
      Gerty's READOUT SCREEN begins to TWITCH and FLASH with
      RANDOM DATA -- then slowly FADES TO BLACK.

      The Robot has been officially SHUT DOWN.

      Gerty just stands there. Completely still. As lifeless as a
      toy.

      Sam 2 heads out of the room at top speed.

      Sam 2 pauses at the window...looking for Eliza. The Rescue
      Unit is so close Sam 2 might actually be able to pick out
      their spacecraft.

      And he can! It's tiny, but nevertheless it's there -- a
      metallic spacecraft, glinting like a jewel -- and heading
      steadily towards the Moon.

      There isn't a moment to lose. Sam 2 swings around, heads
      for the CARGO CONTAINER.

      We remain inside the Monitoring Station as Sam 2 climbs
      inside the Cargo Container He readies himself. Says a
      little prayer and... he cant do it! Cursing at himself and
      glancing at the time ticking away before Eliza lands, he
      jumps back out of the CARGO CONTAINER and runs back into
      the base.

      arrival causing increased STRESS and TENSION.

      Sam 2 takes out the piece of paper on which the COORDINATES
      of the Jammers are printed out.

      He starts to frantically type, altering the PATH of the
      HARVESTERS.

      Mark trundling along at half-speed. The Harvester suddenly
      changes direction -- veering sharply to the left and
      heading up over a steep slope.

      Pounds the delete button, continuing to type coordinates
      into the Old Man -- He's done! He leaps out of his chair
      and tears off through the base towards the cargo container.

      now. It's like an abandoned house.

      voices as the landing crew enters the base, calling for

      His principal monitor POPS ON and his pincer-like HANDS              
      begin to TWITCH. His READOUT SCREEN streams with DATA.               

      Gerty's head begins to swivel left and right -- as if he's           
      awoken with a stiff neck -- eventually he SEES Sam 3,                
      crosses to him.                                                      

      Just like that, Gerty continues his routine checks of Sam 3          
      -- studying Sam 3's heartbeat, his brain activity -- the             
      robot literally picking up where he left off.                        

      And then Sam 3's eyes open. He is awake. He blinks at

      A beautiful picnic is spread out before them. Tess has
      never looked so radiant, so beautiful. Light from the sky

                 What took you so long?

      Sam just smiles back at her. She hands him a bottle of wine

          Ferris' face is replaced on the plasma screen by a series of

          erupting.

                    the monitor and tell us what you
                    see, say, five minutes from now.
          
          Cris looks at the clock. 16:32 / March 9, 2006. He squints
          and the clock speeds up a little.
          
                              Ferris (o.c.)
                    Are you there yet?
          
          In a few seconds, the clock reads 16:37.

                    Good. Now can you move ahead ten
                    minutes.
          
          Varied images fast forward on the plasma screen. He arrives
          at 16:47 and reports on what he sees.

                    Excellent. Can you get to 1900
                    hours?

          Cris sports a three-day stubble. He struggles to get out of
          the chair, but he is now strapped into it, bound at the wrist
          and ankle. His face fills with rage.

          Like a window into a time machine. Cris' beard lengthens. He
          grows pale. His clothes change every few seconds. Rage gives
          way to the panic of a man trapped on a runaway train.

          Cris ages before his own eyes. Wrinkles etch into skin. Hair
          greys, recedes. Outrage ebbs into hollow resignation as Cris
          watches himself waste away.
          
                                 Woman's voice

          INT. VEGAS HOTEL COFFEE SHOP - DAY
          
          A perky young WAITRESS stands over him, holding a pot of
          coffee.
          
                                 WAITRESS
                    Warm-up?
          
          On cris
          
          Young again.
          
                              CRIS
                    Just the check.
          
          She sets it on the table with a flirtatious smile. He takes
          it to the register and pays cash.
          
                              Cris (V.O.)
                    "The future ain't what it used to
                    be." Ever hear that expression?
          
          A moment later, A SECOND CRIS follows the first Cris to the
          register, repeating his every movement.
          
                              CRIS (V.O.)
                    It's a joke, but it's true. The
                    future changes every time you look
                    at it. Because you looked at it.
          
          As Cris 2 pays cash, Cris 1 proceeds into the casino.
          
                                                                      4.
          
          
          
                               CRIS (V.O.)
                    Cause once you see it, you're
                    different.
          
          Cris 2 follows, literally walking in Cris 1's footsteps.
          
                              CRIS (V.O.)
                    Maybe just a little.
          
          A DRUNK bumps into Cris 1 and spills his Daiquiri on him.
          
                              CRIS (V.O.)
                    And that changes everything else.
          
          Cris 2 -- the real Cris -- follows a moment later and
          sidesteps the Drunk, who spills his Daiquiri on someone else.
          
                              CRIS (V.O.)
                    It's got something to do with
                    quantum physics.
          
          Cris 2 reaches the gaming tables and merges with Cris 1.
          
                              Cris (V.O.)
                    That's why I stay away from
                    roulette and craps. It only takes a
                    millionth of an ounce to change a
                    roll. Just placing a different bet
                    can throw things off.
          
          A roulette ball skitters indecisively between two grooves
          before settling into one of them.
          
                              CRIS (v.O.)
                    I've got other rules, too. I don't
                    play against people, like at poker.
                    Only against the house.
          
          Slot machines. Horse racing. Sports games.
          
                              CRIS (v.o.)
                    And my goal isn't to win big. At
                    least not any more. The idea is to
                    go unnoticed so I can keep coming
                    back to the trough.
          
          He passes the MILLION DOLLAR SLOT. Stops, like it's calling
          out to him.
          
                                                                    5.
          
          
          
                              CRIS (v.o.)
                    So no jackpots. No longshots. No
                    big bets except when I want `em to
                    see me lose.
          
          Cris notices a DESPERATE GAMBLER on the verge of tears.
          Clearly, he's dropped a bundle. Cris approaches him and
          points to the MILLION DOLLAR SLOT.
          
                              CRIS
                    Try that one, man. I've got a
                    feeling.
          
                              Gambler
                        (suspicious)
                    Then you play it.
          
                              CRIS
                    Against my religion.
          
          Cris offers the guy a handful of silver dollars.
          
                              CRIS
                    Do it, quick, before somebody else
                    gets there.
          
          While the Gambler dawdles, a MIDWESTERN DOWAGER plants
          herself at the MEGA-SLOT and starts feeding it dollars.
          
          Cris sighs and walks off.
          
          The Gambler watches him go, then reacts to BELLS, FLASHING
          LIGHTS, and SHRIEKS OF CELEBRATION. The Dowager has hit the
          MEGA-JACKPOT.
          
          Blackjack section
          
          Cris takes a stool at a crowded table.
          
                              CRIS (V.O.)
                    Mainly I stick to blackjack. Boring
                    but controllable.
          
          Cris antes up. Cards are dealt. He's got a four showing.
          Taking a hit, he goes bust with a jack. So in real time, he
          sticks.
          
                              CRIS (V.O.)
                    And safe unless they think you're
                    counting.
          
                                                                   6.
          
          
          
          The dealer turns over his cards. He's got a king and a deuce.
          So he has to draw. Pulls the jack. Busted.
          
          The dealer pays Cris, then presses a button under the table.

          Banks of video monitors display images from the multitude of
          cameras looking down from above the gaming tables. The
          SURVEILLANCE SUPERVISOR, HAWKEYE, repositions in response to
          a red light so he can look over a Surveillance Operator's
          shoulder and study Cris.

                    does Homeland Security give a damn
                    about who's lucky in Vegas?
          
          He's talking to Callie Ferris. We recognize her sardonic
          beauty from the plasma screen in Cris's pre-vision. In
          person, she's edgy, confident, and impatient with those who
          aren't as quick as she is.
          
                              Ferris
                    Maybe they're more than lucky.

                              Ferris
                    I'm not talking about cheating.
                    That's your problem. But if
                    somebody wins consistently and you
                    can't figure out how...Excuse me.
          
          She answers her cell phone.

          Ferris and DAVIS, the casino's dapper CHIEF OF SECURITY,
          stand behind Hawkeye, the Surveillance Supervisor, and study
          Cris on various monitors.
          
                              Ferris
                    Maybe she's in cahoots.

          As Ferris watches Cris on the monitor, he becomes still and
          attentive, as if sensing danger. He squints a little, the way
          we do when we try to remember something.
          
                              Ferris
                    Invite him for a drink.

                    If you don't mind.
          
          INT. CASINO/BLACKJACK TABLE - DAY
          
          As Cris signals for another card, TWO BLACK SUITS appear
          behind him.
          
                              black suit (o.S.)
                    Sir, would you come with us,
                    please.
          
          Cris takes in their grim faces. Turns to see two more pairs
          of goons stationed nearby.
          
                                                       SNAPBACK to:
          
          Thirty seconds ago
          
          The COCKTAIL WAITRESS approaches to take Cris' order.
          
                              WAITRESS
                    What's your pleasure?
          
          This time, Cris hurriedly scoops all his chips into his coat
          pocket, jostling the Waitress as he stands.
          
                              CRIS
                    Scuse me, sorry.
          
          Hustling away, he glances back just as the first TWO BLACK
          SUITS reach his stool, but this time it's empty. They look
          around. One of them whispers into his mike. The three pairs
          of goons get instructions and split up.
          
                                                                   9.
          
          
          
          Tracking shot / eye level
          
          Cris strides crisply through the casino. Sees another PAIR OF
          BLACK SUITS, scanning for him. He ducks into the maze of
          slots. Zigs and zags from aisle to aisle, seemingly at
          random. A moment after each turn, a Black Suit appears ahead,
          behind, or to the side - where they would have spotted Cris.
          
          Tracking shot / high angle
          
          A clearer perspective as TWO BLACK SUITS approach Cris' aisle
          from different directions. Cris has no way to see them or
          know they're coming, but at the last moment, he MOVES in
          between two aisles where neither guard will see him as they
          pass.
          
          surveillance room
          
          Davis and Hawkeye wince as the Black Suits keep missing their
          quarry.
          
                              davis
                    What's wrong with you guys?
          
                              hawkeye
                    He's right next to you! Aisle 63!
          
          Ferris watches the chase, fascinated.
          
          Phalanxes of slot machines
          
          Black Suits converge from various directions, in that fake-
          calm fast-walk.
          
          Cris studies the gamblers playing the machines nearby, then
          heads to a particular spot - where he is sure to be spotted -
          except that a TEXAS-SIZED MAN repositions himself, blocking
          the Black Suit's view.
          
          The Black Suit moves on. Cris shifts to another spot just as
          a different Black Suit arrives at the other end of the aisle.
          This time, THREE FRAT BOYS change machines and obscure Cris
          from his gaze.
          
          surveillance room
          
          Davis is throwing a fit.
          
                              Davis
                    There! There! He's right there in
                    front of you! Walk toward each
                    other!
          
                                                                     10.
          
          
          
          Cris slips away in the shadow of the Frat Boys.
          
                              hawkeye
                    Maybe he's on our frequency.
          
                              DAVIS
                    I don't see an earphone on him.
          
                              hawkeye
                    He's heading to the Convention
                    Annex.

                    Give me a headset. I'm going down
                    there.
          
          Convention annex
          
          Arriving at the foyer, Cris sees Five Meeting Rooms. He
          squints then decisively enters one of them.
          
          FOUR BLACK SUITS arrive an instant later. Without wasting a
          beat, each of them goes through a different door. All except
          the one Cris went through.
          
          Cris re-emerges a moment later and heads back toward the
          casino.
          
          Casino
          
          Ferris, arriving, adjusts her headset.
          
          Cris sees her. Recognizes her from his prevision as the woman
          on the plasma screen. Turns and walks away.
          
          She sees Cris. Takes off after him.
          
                              Ferris
                        (to head mic)
                    He's heading toward...

                    the Ipanema Grill.
          
          Security Staff converge on the area. Cris is in plain sight.
          Suddenly a busload of tourists surge in through a door and
          clog the way.
          
          Cris continues into the...
          
                                                                     11.
          
          
          
          Kitchen area
          
          Passing a room service cart, he rolls it in front of him. A
          few steps on, he takes the bottle of OLIVE OIL on the cart
          and pours some in front of one random closed door. Cris then
          shoves the room service cart down the hall toward an empty
          intersecting corridor. A Black Suit barrels into the empty
          intersection just as the cart arrives - and tumbles over it.
          Behind Cris, a door swings open; a Black Suit charges out;
          steps precisely into the puddle of poured olive oil - and
          falls on his ass.
          
          Cris slips by him, but gets cut off by an arriving group of
          FOUR MORE BLACK SUITS. Big guys. They try to grab him. He
          evades their grasp almost magically and, like a Shaolin Monk,
          somehow leverages them into each other until they are in a
          pile on the floor. Cris darts around them into the...
          
          Lobby
          
          He co-opts a luggage cart that is loaded up for delivery.
          Rolling it to the left, a Black Suit on that side doesn't see
          him - and moves on. Cris switches to the right side of the
          card - just as a second Black Suit would have seen him.
          
          Abandoning the cart, Cris sets off across the lobby in a
          herky-jerky rhythm.
          
          He walks four quick steps without being seen. Then stops
          behind a column just as Black Suit 1 turns his way. When
          Black Suit 1 looks on, Cris resumes his journey, cutting
          across the lobby at an acute angle. In this way, he avoids
          being seen by Black Suit 2. Cris now backs up three steps and
          avoids being seen by Black Suit 3.
          
          By precisely choosing his movements and knowing where his
          hunters will be looking, Cris achieves something like
          invisibility.
          
          The last obstacle to daylight is Ferris. She sees him. He
          makes a run for the door. She dashes after him.
          
                              FERRIS
                    You! I just need to talk to you!
          
          Cris grabs a guest's suitcase and keeps moving.
          
                              FERRIS

          The guest chases after Cris - and collides with Ferris,
          knocking her to the ground. Which allows Cris to slip through
          a door to the...

          Where TWO LAUNDRY DELIVERY MEN are flinging sacks of clothes
          into the back of a truck. Cris steps toward the open tailgate
          with a steady pace. As if on cue, both Laundry Guys turn and
          bend to pick up another sack of clothes. Cris walks right by
          them without being noticed -- and climbs into the truck. A
          moment later, the Laundry Guys pivot back around, toss sacks
          of clothes in after Cris, and slam the rear doors. They get
          in the truck and drive off just as Ferris, Davis, and several
          Black Suits arrive to find a cold trail.
          
                              davis
                    You were right. This guy is a lot
                    more than lucky.
          
          Oddly, Ferris seems almost encouraged.

          Ferris strides purposefully through hallways crowded with
          people hustling just as urgently as she is. She enters the
          large ante-room of a bigshot's office and addresses JEANNIE,
          a civil service secretary.

                    went on Code Orange.
          
                              Ferris
                    What's the threat?

                    We found a dirty bomb in East

                    chatter about a dozen more out
                    there somewhere, ready to blow.
          
          Ferris absorbs the catastrophic news without emotion.

          steps out, nonchalant as James Bond.

          The pursuit of Cris through the casino has been mapped into a

          It's clear that Cris avoids trouble before he sees it.

                    I went screening for it in a highly
                    scientific way. And now I've
                    identified someone who matches all
                    the indicators. So the next obvious
                    step is to...

          He stalks out of the room, leaving her more thwarted than
          sad.
          
          DRIVER'S POV: TRAFFIC IN VEGAS
          
          An elevated freeway. Driving behind a pick-up truck carrying
          a mattress and box spring.
          
                              Cris (v.O.)
                    I'm not God. I don't see
                    everything. Just my own future.
          
          Ext./INT. Cris' car - DAY
          
          Cris drives an old Camaro, muscle-y but inconspicuous.
          
                              Cris (v.O.)
                    To me, it seems normal. The way
                    lightning comes before thunder.
          
          Cris changes lanes to get from behind the truck.
          
                              CRIS (V.O.)
                    Most of the time, I'm not paying
                    attention. Just making sure I don't
                    step in a mess.
          
          In his rearview mirror, Cris sees the mattress fall off the
          truck, causing an accident.
          
                                                                  16.

                    Sometimes I get a blast from far
                    away.
          
          He sees a plume of smoke in the distance.
          
                              CRIS (V.O.)
                    Or I can start with a glimpse of
                    something close and keep pushing
                    on.
          
          He takes the next exit.
          
                              CRIS (V.O.)
                    Usually it's none of my business.
          
          He turns into the parking lot of a bookie shop, THE FINISH

          TERRY BAINES, plainclothed HEAD OF PROTECTIVE SERVICES for
          the Facility, walks down the corridor with three of the
          better-trained MILITARY POLICE who have been brought in to
          augment the regular staff of civilian FEDERAL PROTECTIVE
          SERVICE POLICE. Baines is a handsome former Special Forces
          Lieutenant, early-forties, who takes his work very seriously.
          Ferris runs to catch up with him. He doesn't slow down for
          her.
          
                               FERRIS
                    Terry? Terry! - I know you've got
                    your hands full but I was wondering
                    if you might be able to spare a few
                    warm bodies for an outside
                    operation.
          
                                                                  17.
          
          
          
          She gives him a look. There's some mutual attraction, but not
          a lot of affection.
          
                              BAINES
                    We're strictly internal.
          
                              FERRIS
                    That's why I need your people.
                    Everybody else is assigned.
          
                              BAINES
                    Does Wisdom know about this?
          
                              FERRIS
                    He suggested it.
          
          While Baines arches a dubious eyebrow, an intellectual junior
          analyst, AMANDA, catches up with Ferris.
          
                              AMANDA

                    Agent Ferris. I've got a face match
                    on your subject. His name is Cris
                    Johnson.
          
          Ferris takes Amanda's PRINTOUT and glances at it on the run:
          it's a PHOTO of Cris on a WANTED BULLETIN.

          She hustles off with Amanda.

          A smoky office with a big screen tv and a poker table, but no
          card players. Cris is greeted by GUY, relaxed, professional,
          smartly dressed, mid-forties. He's classier than the joint he
          runs.
          
                              Guy
                    Well, if it isn't the Golden Man.
          
          A look, a hug. A lot of history.
          
                              Guy
                    What brings you crawling back to
                    me?
          
                                                                     18.

                    tagged.
          
          He starts setting them in stacks on the poker table.
          
                              GUY
                    You burned through your stash
                    already?
          
                              CRIS
                    I've been trying to lay low.
          
          INT. State police STATION - dAY
          
          Computer monitor on a desk plays Cris' escape from the
          casino.
          
                              CavANAUGH (o.s.)
                    That's him. I call him the Road
                    Runner. You know? Beep beep.
          
          LT. CAVANAUGH, middle-aged hunter type, beer belly but still
          a menace.
          
                              Ferris
                    What's he running from?
          
          Cavanaugh takes a videocassette from a pile on his messy
          desk.
          
                              CAVANAUGH
                    You showed me yours. I'll show you
                    mine.
          
          He pops the tape into a VCR. Presses play.
          
          On the monitor
          
          Low-quality security camera recording of a liquor store at
          night. Business is good. FIVE PEOPLE wait in line at the
          register. Time code reads November 11, 2004. Cris walks in,
          unsteady on his feet. Heads for the beer locker. Pauses.
          Suddenly runs toward the register at full speed and TACKLES A
          CUSTOMER, shoving him hard to the floor. Cris prepares to
          hold him down, but the tackled man just lies there, a pool of
          blood forming under his head. Cris looks up. The customers
          are gaping at him, terrified.
          
                                                                  19.
          
          
          
                              CRIS
                        (slurred)
                    He was gonna kill you! You all
                    would'a died!
          
          Cris sees that they're afraid of him, not the dead man. He
          runs out. PAUSE TAPE.
          
          Back to scene
          
          Cavanaugh studies Ferris' reaction.
          
          INT. BACK ROOM AT THE FINISH LINE - DAY
          
          Guy finishes counting Cris' chips.
          
                              Guy
                    But you of all people. How could
                    you have let it happen?
          
                              CRIS
                    That was the night Donna broke off
                    our engagement.

                    Ahh.
          
                              CRIS
                    I was so drunk I could barely see
                    now.
          
          Guy opens a drawer, takes out a pack of a hundred $100's, and
          counts out an additional sum from his pocket.
          
                              GUY
                    Well, I hope you don't mind. I
                    called Neal to let him know you're
                    here.
          
                              CRIS
                    Christ, Guy, did you have to?
          
                              GUY
                    You say everything's inevitable, so
                    I guess I did.
          
          Guy returns to his antique copper espresso machine and starts
          to make two cups.
          
                              CRIS
                    Well, you can save your breath.
                    Cause I know what you're gonna say.
          
                                                                     20.
          
          
          
                              GUY
                    Then you're aware that Neal is in a
                    serious cash crunch and could lose
                    it all.
          
                              CRIS
                    I'm sorry to hear that. But I'm
                    done playing the market.
          
          While Guy is distracted making espresso, Cris jams the desk
          drawer shut with a penny.
          
                              GUY
                    Neal's got it all worked out. He'll
                    fly you out of the country on his
                    jet. Put you up in style. He pays
                    taxes, totally legal. You get cash,
                    squeaky clean. Half the net. When
                    your share hits fifty mil, you can
                    say "finito"...and it's over.
          
                              CRIS
                    Except last time, Neal didn't take
                    "finito" for an answer.
          
          Guy slams his fist.
          
                              GUY
                    You need us, asshole! The Law is
                    breathin' down your neck!
          
                              CRIS
                    I can stay ahead of `em forever.
          
                              GUY
                    But why live that way?
          
                              CRIS
                    Because I don't want to be used any
                    more.
          
                              GUY
                    What do you give a shit as long as
                    you get what you want?
          
                              CRIS
                    Cause what I want is freedom. And
                    you don't get it by giving it up.
          
          Guy calms himself and sets an espresso in front of Cris.
          
                                                                    21.
          
          
          
                              CRIS
                    Enjoy it while it lasts.
          
          Cris picks up the cup and knocks it back.
          
          Ext. finish line - Parking lot - DAY
          
          Cris starts up the car. Notices he's woozy. He prepares to
          back out. Instead he blacks out -- as Guy and THREE MEN drag
          him out of the car.
          
                                                          SNAPBACK TO:
          
          Guy's office
          
          Guy sets the cup of espresso in front of Cris, who picks it
          up. But Instead of knocking it back, he sets it down and
          grins cryptically at Guy, who senses something and reaches to
          open his top desk drawer - the one Cris pennied shut. Guy
          can't get it open. Guy reaches under his Racing Form. Feels
          around. Cris holds up a knife.
          
                              CRIS
                    Looking for this?
          
          Guy pulls his arm from under the Racing Form -- spilling the
          cup of espresso that Cris just set down. Guy knows that's not
          a coincidence.
          
                              CRIS
                    Don't mess with somebody who knows
                    your moves before you even think
                    'em.
          
          Cris takes his cash.
          
                              GUY
                    The jet'll be sold in a week. Then
                    there goes your ticket out.
          
                              CRIS
                    Don't wait for me.
          
          Cris heads out.
          
                              Guy
                    You know what I think? I think I
                    know the future better than you do.
          
          Cris scoffs as he leaves.

          Cavanaugh pours coffee for himself and Ferris.
          
                              CAVANAUGH
                    He's just some gambler. Lives
                    completely off the grid. No bank
                    account. No credit cards. No
                    previous record.
          
                              Ferris
                    So why'd he do it?
          
                              CAVANAUGH
                    Must be a wacko. He'd never met the
                    victim. No connection whatsoever.
          
          Ferris tries to make sense of it all.
          
                              feRRIS
                    And in fifteen months, why haven't
                    you caught him?
          
          Cavanaugh sighs woefully.
          
                              CAVANAUGH
                    You saw. He's got eyes in the back
                    of his head. He can see around
                    corners. I even had him in custody
                    once, and he disappeared.
          
                              Ferris
                    Must be very embarrassing.
          
          A painful subject for Cavanaugh.
          
                              CAVANAUGH
                    And what is it you want him for?
          
                              Ferris
                    Questioning.
          
                              CAVANAUGH
                    About?
          
                              Ferris
                    Stuff that hasn't happened yet.
          
          Cavanaugh nods knowingly.
          
                                                                  23.

                    I help?

          A tract house, cheap, from the 60's, could be anywhere.
          Something sad about the place. Cris stands at the door,
          holding a bag of groceries. IRV, a sick old man, opens the
          door, wearing a knit cap and pajamas. He's hooked up to a
          little oxygen tank on wheels. When he sees Cris, his smile
          crimps the tube in his nose.
          
                              IRV
                    What are you doing back here?
          
                              CRIS
                    I came to fix you dinner.
          
                                 IRV
                    Idiot.
          
          Irv pulls Cris inside. Closes the door.
          
          INT. irv's house - night
          
          They embrace like father and son. The oxygen tube gets in the
          way.
          
                              IRV
                    This is what you get from two packs
                    a day.
          
                              CrIS
                    But you quit ten years ago.
          
                              IRV
                    It was already too late. I just
                    didn't know it.
          
                              CRIS
                    Sometimes not knowing is better.
          
          Irv shakes his head.
          
                              IRV
                    Look where you're headed, pal. The
                    big decisions are over before you
                    even realize you made `em.
          
                                                                  24.

          Cavanaugh and Ferris chat with Guy. This time the poker game
          is in progress.
          
                              CaVANAUGH
                    Any idea where he might be going?
          
          Guy turns to Ferris.
          
                              GUY
                    I've got a little problem with the
                    IRS. Think I could get some relief?
          
                              FERRIS
                    Depends how helpful you are.
          
                              GuY
                    Oh, I know everything about him.
          
          He looks at Ferris, knowing. She turns to Cavanaugh.
          
                              FERRIS
                    I need to speak to him alone.

          Guy and Ferris sip cappucino.
          
                              GUY
                    And another thing, no woman ever
                    turns him down, I'm serious. Mainly
                    because he only propositions the
                    ones he knows'll say yes, which is
                    most of `em anyway. But does that
                    make him happy? No. Says he's
                    bored. Never surprised. Has to
                    watch himself die over and over
                    again.
          
                              FERRIS
                    Why'd he come back to Vegas?
          
                              GUY
                    Didn't say, but I'm guessin' it's
                    this friend who's dying. An old
                    fart who took him in when he was
                    strung out on drugs. - He's an
                    orphan, ya know. Been on the road
                    since he was ten.

          INT. Irv's house / living room - night
          
          The place is a mess. Piles of newspapers. Old clothes. Cris
          cleans up as they talk. Irv sits at a table and plays
          solitaire.
          
                              IRV
                    You want my advice? Get yourself a
                    good lawyer and turn yourself in.
          
                              CRIS
                    If I tell `em the truth, you know
                    what happens? I end up with the
                    Feds. - And you know what they do
                    to me?
          
                              IRV
                    Make you a secret agent.
          
                              Cris
                    Don't laugh. They strap me in a
                    chair and make me watch the news.
          
                              IRV
                    Dan Rather or Peter Jennings?
          
                              CRIS
                    It's not funny, Irv. That's all I
                    do, day after day, for the rest of
                    my life. Watch the news until I
                    lose my hair and croak.
          
          Irv is moved by Cris' dilemma.
          
                              Irv
                    There's no way around it?
          
                              CRIS
                    The best I can do is stay away from
                    all of `em.
          
          Irv shakes his head with sympathy for Cris' plight.
          
                              IRV
                    In that case, you've gotta leave
                    the country.
          
                              CRIS
                    I know, I know, but there's
                    something I gotta do first.
          
                                                                  26.
          
          
          
                              IRV
                    What?
          
          Cris doesn't answer. His gaze is distant.
          
                              IRV
                    Cris?
          
          Cris focuses.
          
                              CRIS
                    She's coming here. The Fed.
          
                              IRV
                    You gotta go?
          
          Cris thinks. Shakes his head.
          
                              CRIS
                    Let's play it out.
          
          INT. Irv's kitchen - DAY
          
          Cris makes a lamb roast, studding it with cloves of garlic.
          
                              CRIS
                    I've got the place all picked out.
                    It's called Palau. Three hundred
                    teeny islands in the South Pacific.
                        (places roast in pan)
                    Nothing ever happens there, so
                    there's nothing to foresee.
          
                              IRV
                    Then what the hell are you waiting
                    for?
          
          Cris puts the roasting pan in the oven.
          
                              CRIS
                    Her.
          
                              IRV
                    Who?
          
                              CRIS
                    I haven't met her yet.
          
                              IRV
                    Then find somebody else!
          
                                                                  27.
          
          
          
                              CRIS
                    It has to be her.
          
                              IRV
                    What's so special about this one?
          
                              CRIS
                    She's the mother of my child.
          
          Irv stops shuffling the cards.
          
                              IRV
                    I thought you were shooting blanks.
          
                              CRIS
                    I guess the doctors were wrong.
          
                              IRV
                    I don't mean to be indelicate, my
                    friend, but how do you know the
                    little bastard is yours?
          
                              CRIS
                    He's got my thing.
          
                              IRV
                    Your thing?
          
          Cris holds up his hand, revealing that the skin between his
          two middle fingers is webbed a little higher than normal.
          
                                CRIS
                    My thing.
          
                              IRV
                    I still don't understand why you
                    never got that fixed.
          
          Cris laughs...then suddenly stops.
          
                              cris
                    She's here.
          
          He walks to the door and opens it to discover Ferris standing
          there, with her finger about to press the doorbell.
          
                              CRIS
                    Agent Ferris, come in.
          
          She regards Cris with appreciation.
          
                                                                  28.
          
          
          
                              FERRIS
                    One step ahead of the game.
          
                              cRIS
                    Always.
          
          She enters. Tries not to be intimidated by his ability or
          appearance. Sees Irv, watching them.
          
                               Ferris
                    Is there some place we can speak
                    privately?
          
                              CRIS
                    Let's go in the kitchen. I've got a
                    roast in the oven.
          
                              IrV
                    No, you two stay here. I'll watch
                    the food.
          
          Once out of Ferris' eyeline, Irv queries Cris with his hand
          in the shape of a gun. Cris shakes his head, then turns to
          Ferris - and waits for her to begin.
          
                              FERRIS
                    You're wasting your life, Cris. You
                    have the most amazing talent, and
                    you're running from it.
          
                              CRIS
                    Yeah, people say I could have been
                    a chef.
          
                              Ferris
                    Don't be cute. There's too much at
                    stake here.
          
          Her gravity anchors him.
          
                              FERRIS
                    Now if you say that man in the
                    liquor store was going to shoot
                    five people, I believe you. Why
                    else would you kill a stranger?
          
          Cris guards his reaction.
          
                              FERRIS
                    But no good deed goes unpunished,
                    eh?
                              (MORE)
          
                                                                  29.
          
                              FERRIS (cont'd)
                    And that's how it's going to be in
                    this world. People will either hate
                    you or want to exploit you.
          
                              CRIS
                    Everyone but you, of course.
          
                              FERRIS
                    I can fix your legal problems. More
                    importantly, I can give you a
                    chance to use your gift.
          
                              CRIS
                    Trust me, it's better if I don't.
                    It's better if I just mind my own
                    business.
          
          Ferris looks at him, disapproving.
          
                              FERRIS
                    I'll be honest with you, Cris.
                    That's not an option. Your country
                    needs you. And if we don't grab
                    you, somebody else will.
          
                              CRIS
                    Nobody's grabbed me yet.
          
                              Ferris
                    You're up against more powerful
                    forces now.
          
          She lets that sink in.
          
                              FERRIS
                    I'd like you to come with me for
                    some testing. Would you be willing
                    to do that?
          
          Cris's expression grows dark. He looks at Ferris accusingly,
          then BOLTS away, toward the KITCHEN.
          
                              FERRIS
                    Where are you going?
          
          Cris covers his eyes and dives to the floor as STUN GRENADES
          shatter windows and explode with a FLASH.
          
                              FERRIS
                        (temporarily blinded)
                    Shit! Cavanaugh!
          
          Gas grenades follow.
          
                                                                    30.
          
          
          
          Cris scrambles to his feet as a NEVADA POLICE SWAT TEAM
          bursts through windows and doors, wearing gas masks and
          goggles, scanning with laser-guided rifles. They find Cris,
          dashing for the back door. Open fire.
          
          Cris tumbles, dodges a few bullets, then takes a hit in the
          shoulder, the back, the leg. Staggers forward. Absorbs dozens
          of bullets.
          
          Falls.
          
          Lies there.
          
          Dying.
          
          Cavanaugh steps up to deliver the final shot.

                    In that case, you've gotta leave
                    the country.
          
                              CRIS
                    I know, I know, I've got the place
                    picked out. But there's something
                    I've gotta do first.
          
                              IRV
                    What?
          
          Cris doesn't answer. His gaze is distant.
          
                              IRV
                    Cris?
          
          Cris focuses.
          
                              CRIS
                    I have to go.
          
                              IRV
                    You just got here.
          
                              CRIS
                    I know, but they're coming for me.
          
          Cris takes the pack of cash he got from Guy, pulls out more
          than half the bills, and sets them on a table.
          
                                                                  31.

                    This is for nurses and stuff, to
                    make things a little easier.
          
                              IRV
                    You're gonna need it.
          
          Cris shakes his head and embraces Irv.
          
                              CrIS
                    You're the only one I could trust.
                    Ever.
          
          They're both choked up.
          
          
          
                              IRV
                    I don't suppose you've discovered
                    any last minute escape for me?
          
                              CRIS
                    I looked, Irv, I really did. I went
                    down every path, every treatment.
                    Sometimes there's just no...
          
                              IRV
                    It's okay. It's okay...Now I can
                    relax.
          
          A last look.

          Cris' approaches his parked Camaro with his key out.
          CAVANAUGH and SIX TROOPERS spring from hiding, guns trained
          on him.
          
          Camera pans to cris
          
          In Irv's back yard, watching this scene.
          
          Ext. ALLEY BEHIND IRV'S HOUSE - DAY
          
          A State Trooper keeps watch, smoking. When he steps on the
          butt, Cris enters the frame in the background. When the
          Trooper turns to a wall to piss, Cris crosses the alley,
          unseen. When Cris passes out of frame, the Trooper finishes,
          unaware of what he has missed.
          
                                                                  32.

          A Route 66-vintage highway with stop lights and tawdry
          commercial development. Cris stands on the shoulder, thumbing
          a ride. Cars and trucks pass without stopping.
          
          FAST FOWARD through endless traffic until an OLD CHEVROLET
          pulls over. Cris checks his watch. It's 8:23.

                    Twenty-four minutes.
          
          He looks around. Sees a donut shop. Heads toward it.
          
          INT. Irv's house - night
          
          Cavanaugh's State Troopers, guns drawn, are searching the
          place on a hair-trigger, ready to blow away anything that
          moves.
          
                              FERRIS
                    I need him alive, Cavanaugh. Even
                    if he resists.
          
                              CAVANAUGH
                    Yes, ma'am.
          
          She points to Cavanaugh's troopers.
          
                                 FERRIS
                    Tell them.
          
          As Cavanaugh grudingly walks off to deliver the message, Irv
          approaches Ferris.
          
                              Irv
                    You'll never catch him. He knows
                    what you're gonna do to him.
          
                              FERRIS
                    That's very helpful information.
          
          She walks off, leaving Irv to regret he opened his mouth.
          
                                                                     33.

          Cris steps in. Goes to the counter.
          
                              CrIS
                    Medium coffee, black, and a glazed.
          
          As he waits, he sees a vague REFLECTION in the GLASS DISPLAY
          CASE: a SQUARE CROSS, coming into focus.
          
          Puzzled, Cris looks up and around to see the object that's
          being reflected. He can't find it. Cris turns back to the
          display case, but the reflection is gone. The DONUT GIRL
          gives him his order.
          
          Cris takes it, turns, and notices LIZ COOPER sitting by
          herself at a booth, circling items in the classified section.
          He recognizes her as the future mother of his future child.
          
          Cris gazes at her face, which is both childish and mature,
          shy yet indomitable.
          
          She turns, scowling, from the staring stranger.
          
          Cris approaches Liz and gives her that smile that always
          works.

          him.

          The Donut Girl gives Cris his order. Now confident he's found
          the right approach, Cris approaches Liz and deliberately
          bobbles his coffee. But not in the exact way he did before.
          When it falls, it splashes on her shoes.
          
                              LIZ
                    Aw Christ! Look what you've done!
          
                              CRIS
                    I'm so sorry. I'm a spaz.
          
                              LIZ
                    Yeah, you are.
          
          She wipes her shoe with a napkin.
          
                              LIZ
                    It looked like you spilled it on
                    purpose.
          
                              CRIS
                    Why would I do that?
          
                              LIZ
                    I don't know. To impress me?
          
                                                                     35.
          
          
          
                              CRIS
                    Look, I'm sorry. If I could, I'd do
                    it over.
          
          Disgusted, she hands him a stack of paper napkins.
          
                              CRIS
                    Here.
          
          She watches as he sops up the coffee and carries dripping,
          soggy tissues to the trash. The miserable expression on his
          face finally wins the smile he's been working for.

                    Well, Liz, your luck's about to
                    change.

          Cris glances outside and sees the old Chevrolet drive by
          without stopping. He checks his watch. It's 8:23.

          Cris grabs the steering wheel and jerks it to the right,
          sending them over some speed bumps onto the off ramp.

                    Then what?
          
                              FERRIS
                    We've got to think like he does.
                    We've got to think ahead.

          Willie Nelson on the CD player. Liz holds an Icee in one hand
          while Cris feeds her Kettle Chips.
          
                              CRIS
                    But lately I've been traveling all
                    around Oregon. It's really peaceful
                    up there.
          
                              LIZ
                    All right, I'm starting getting the
                    picture. - Basically, you're a no-
                    good, worthless ramblin' man who's
                    never held a job in life.
          
                              CRIS
                        (smiles)
                    Exactly.
          
          She's charmed, in spite of herself.
          
                              liz
                    At least you're honest about it.
          
          Ext. Liz's car - Outskirts of tahoe - nIGHT
          
          Cris and Liz sing along with Patsy Cline on the radio. The
          song ends as they hit the city limits.
          
                              LIZ
                    This is where I turn into town.
          
          She pulls over.
          
                              CRIS
                    Well, thanks for the ride.
          
                              LIZ
                    Thanks for the card.
          
                              CRIS
                    You're welcome.
          
          They're both reluctant to part.
          
                              cRIS
                    I don't suppose you'd have time for
                    a drink.
          
                              LIZ
                    No, no, I've gotta teach tomorrow.
          
                                                                   42.
          
          
          
                              CRIS
                    I understand...Well, see ya.
          
                                LIZ
                    So long.
          
          He steps out and starts to close the door.
          
                              LIZ
                    Well, maybe just a quick one.
          
          INT. The silver spur - night
          
          Cowboy dive. Crowded for a week night. Liz leads Cris to the
          bar where the BARTENDER is washing some glasses.
          
                              LIZ
                    Hey, George.
          
                                Bartender
                    Hey, Liz.
          
                              LIZ
                    I'll take the usual and he'll have
                    a...
          
                              CRIS
                    Sierra Pale.
          
          The Bartender and Liz exchange a look.
          
                              Bartender
                    Two Sierras.
          
          As he draws two pints, the Bartender leans toward Liz.
          
                              BartENDER
                    Randy's been hanging around.
          
                              LIZ
                    He's not here now, is he?
          
          Bartender nods toward the pool tables, where RANDY, her ex,
          plays 8-ball with a pal.
          
                                LIZ
                    Thanks.
          
          She turns to Cris.
          
                              LIZ
                    We gotta split. My ex is here.
          
                                                                  43.
          
          
          
          Cris lays some money on the bar, and they head for the door.
          But before they get there, Randy sees Liz and bounds after
          her, holding a pool cue. He's much bigger and taller than
          Cris.
          
                              Randy
                    I gotta talk to you, baby.
          
                              LIZ
                    Sure, Randy. I'll call you
                    tomorrow.
          
          She tries to slide by him. Randy blocks the way.
          
                              Randy
                    Bullshit. I've left a dozen
                    messages on your phone.
          
          Cris steps between them.
          
                              Cris
                    Excuse me. We were just leaving.
          
                              Randy
                    And who the hell are you?
          
          Cris stands his ground. Locks eyes.
          
                              Liz
                    Don't mess with him, Cris. He used
                    to play hockey.
          
                              CRIS
                    Just a friend.
          
                              Randy
                    Then don't get between me and my
                    woman.
          
                              LIZ
                    I'm not yours anymore, asshole!
          
                              Randy
                    Baby, I've made a terrible mistake,
                    and I just want to undo all the...
          
          Randy holds Liz by the shoulders.
          
                              liz
                    Let go!
          
                                                                  44.
          
          
          
                              RANDY
                    You still care for me, I know it.
          
          Liz resists. Cris grips Randy's arm.
          
                                 CRIS
                    Easy, man.
          
          Randy hauls off to slug Cris. Cris easily ducks the blow and
          answers with a solid punch to the belly.
          
          Randy recovers and realizes he's up against a skilled
          opponent. He takes a stance, ready to get serious. He sticks
          a few jabs at Cris, who easily slips from each one, like he
          saw them coming a mile away. Randy goes for a hook. Cris
          feints and lands an uppercut to Randy's chin. Most men would
          go down, but Randy is so big, he stays up to take more
          punishment.
          
          Cris delivers an elegant beating that humiliates the big guy
          and makes him look like an oaf. Cris puts an end to it by
          breaking Randy's nose. The big guy falls to his knees,
          bleeding.
          
          Liz rushes to Randy's side, holding her ex and glowering up
          at Cris like he's a sadistic brute.
          
                              LIZ
                    Get out of here! Get out!
          
          Cris realizes he's blown it.
          
                                                        SNAPBACK TO:
          
          MOMENTS BEFORE
          
                              RANDY
                    You still care for me, I know it.
          
          Liz resists. Cris grips Randy's arm.
          
                                 CRIS
                    Easy, man.
          
          Randy hauls off to slug Cris, who this time makes no effort
          to duck. WHAM! Cris takes a sledgehammer in the mouth. Randy
          follows up mercilessly, punching Cris in the gut, then
          holding him up while he punches him again.
          
          Liz grabs Randy's arm.
          
                                                                    45.
          
          
          
                              LIZ
                    Stop it, Randy! Stop it!
          
          Randy flings her aside and finishes up   with a solid right to
          Cris' jaw, that puts him on the floor.   Randy pulls back his
          leg for a pointy-booted cowboy kick to   the ribs, when Liz
          rushes to Cris' side and glowers up at   Randy like he's a
          sadistic brute.
          
                              LIZ
                    Get out of here! Get out!
          
          Randy realizes he's blown it -- and lets himself be pulled
          out of the bar by a couple of buddies.
          
          Liz examines Cris with concern.
          
                              LIZ
                    Oh God, I'll take you to the
                    emergency room.
          
                              CRIS
                    No ho'pital. I don' nee' ho'pital.
          
                              LIZ
                    God, I hate that bastard...Will
                    somebody get some ice!
          
          She strokes Cris' hair.
          
          Ext. Liz's cottage - night
          
          In the foothills. Liz's car pulls up. Cris gets out, holding
          a dish towel full of ice to his jaw.
          
                              CRIS
                    I'm sorry I'm causing you all this
                    trouble.
          
                              LIZ
                    Are you kidding? You stood up for
                    me.
          
                               CRIS
                    Actually, I wasn't standing for
                    that long.
          
          Liz unlocks the front door. Turns on the lights.
          
                              LIZ
                    Sorry it's so cold in here. The
                    heater's broken.
          
                                                                     46.
          
          
          
          INT. Liz's cottage - night
          
          Cris looks around, sore but pleased that he has managed to
          stay in Liz's company. The place is cozy, ranch-like.
          
                              LIZ
                    I really should've left him a long
                    time ago. God knows he deserved it.
          
                              CRIS
                    Why didn't you?
          
                              LIZ
                    Cause I don't leave. I never have.
                    My boyfriends always left me.
          
          She wets a washcloth with hot water.
          
                              LIZ
                    I get attached to people, and then
                    I'll put up with anything.
          
                              CRIS
                    What a terrible quality. You're too
                    loyal.
          
          She returns with a wet washcloth.
          
                              LIZ
                    Sit in the light.
          
          He lowers himself onto the sofa next to the table lamp. She
          comes close and gingerly wipes the blood from his nose and
          lips.
          
                              LIZ
                    I never minded that I was the more
                    devoted one. Somebody's gotta be
                    more this or more that.
          
          He looks in her eyes.
          
                              LIZ
                    But they never appreciate it, that
                    you're there for them.
          
          She tries to stay on task but gets drawn in by his gaze.
          
                              LIZ
                    They just try and get away with
                    more and more, and figure you'll
                    just...
          
                                                                   47.
          
          
          
          He leans forward. Their lips touch.
          
                                LIZ
                    Salty.
          
          It gets more intense.
          
          Then abruptly, she shies away, freaked.
          
                              LIZ
                    Christ, I don't even know you. I
                    have no idea who you are.

          She wipes the blood from his nose and lips. He looks in her
          eyes. She tries to stay on task, but she gets drawn in by his
          gaze. He leans forward. Their lips almost touch. But this
          time, Cris pulls back.
          
          Liz is embarrassed.
          
                              LIZ
                    Sorry to get you caught up in my
                    soap opera.
          
                              CRIS
                    Once you start watching, it's hard
                    not to get involved.
          
          She goes back to tending his wounds.
          
                              LIZ
                    You ever been married?
          
                                CRIS
                    Almost.
          
                              LIZ
                    What happened?
          
                              CRIS
                    She wanted kids.
          
                              LIZ
                    And you didn't?
          
                              CRIs
                    No, I did, too.
          
                                                                  48.
          
          
          
          She looks at him, curious.
          
                              CRIS
                    It's just that...I can't.
          
          Something about his revelation unsettles her.
          
                              LIZ
                    Why are you telling me this? These
                    personal details.
          
                              CRIS
                    I don't know. You asked and...I
                    guess I felt like you'd understand.
          
          Tears well up in her eyes.
          
                                lIZ
                    I do.
          
          Cris looks at her with sympathy.
          
                              lIZ
                    I can't either. Have kids.
          
          Cris comforts her. She looks up into his eyes expectantly.
          
          Fighting the pull, he looks away for a moment to see where
          this is going - then glances back at her, almost dizzy.
          
                              CRIS
                    That was incredible.
          
                                LiZ
                    What was?
          
                                CRIS
                    This.
          
          He kisses her with a quiet intensity that quickly ignites.
          
          Their lovemaking unfolds as it would be experienced by Cris.
          Effect before cause. The pleasure, then the gesture that
          elicits it.
          
          Cris explores her body until she sighs, then snapsback and
          goes directly to the sweet spot. He strings together a
          perfect melody of shudders and moans, without striking any
          false notes along the way.
          
          Moments are superimposed, diaphonous, played against each
          other in counterpoint.
          
                                                                    49.
          
          
          Visual harmonics, elastically out-of-sync. Rising to a
          crescendo. Until all the futures resolve into a single now.
          
                                                          DISSOLVE TO:
          
          AFTERWARDS - nIGHT
          
          Floating in bed. Her head on his chest. His eyes open, sadly
          content, like he wishes he could stop time here forever. Like
          he's afraid it will all disappear if he takes his eyes off
          her.
          
                              LIZ
                    That was...I've never...
          
          Cris forces himself to look away into the distance.

          She rushes in, looking for Cris. - He's not there.
          
          She hears CLANKING from the laundry room.
          
          On the floor, Cris sits next to the heater, which lies in
          pieces. He tries to adjust the remaining apparatus.

                    jealous of their fishing grounds

          Seeing his doleful expression, Liz can't help smiling. She
          glances up and down the hall, then kisses him lasciviously on
          the lips.

                    Put a few in the freezer. I love
                    ice cream sandwiches.
          
          With a mischievous grin, she ducks back into class, leaving
          Cris reeling, but exhilarated.
          
                                                                  54.

          Liz and Cris stuff their mouths with lo mein. She sets down
          her chopsticks, picks up a red pencil and industriously
          resumes marking up a stack of papers.
          
                              LIZ
                    You have been such a bad influence.
                    I'm gonna be up all night grading
                    papers.
          
          Cris watches, bored.
          
                              CRIS
                    I've got a better idea. Run away
                    with me to the South Pacific.
          
                              LIZ
                    Funny. We've only known each other
                    a week.
          
                              CRIS
                    But we're going to be happy
                    together for the rest of our lives.
                    Really, I peeked.
          
          She picks up the chopsticks and takes another bite.
          
                              LIZ
                    I think you're serious.

                    Deadly.
          
          She muses, tempted.
          
                              CRIS
                    Let's go pack your bags. We'll
                    leave tonight.

                              CRIS
                    Don't worry. That's always been
                    easy for me.
          
          She gets lost in the fantasy. He can almost taste the
          fulfilmment of his dreams.

                              LIZ
                    Well, first of all, it's the middle
                    of the school year.
          
                              CRIS

                              LIZ
                    And I'm in charge of science fair.
          
                              CRIS
                    They can pick up the slack.

                              LIZ
                    It disturbs me, Cris, that you
                    think it's okay just to duck your
                    responsibilities.
          
          He's taken aback by her sudden shift.
          
                              CRIS
                    I - I don't think it's okay. I'm
                    not that kind of person. But I
                    have this feeling, this very strong
                    feeling, that it has to be now. We
                    have to leave soon, or it's not
                    gonna work out.
          
                              LIZ
                    I don't believe that. If it's meant
                    to be between two people, somehow
                    it'll happen.
          
                              CRIS
                    Yes, but sometimes you have to make
                    it happen. You have to seize the
                    opportunity before it's too late.
          
          He tries to keep his desperation from showing, but she sees
          right through him.
          
                              LIZ
                    What are you afraid of, Cris? Why
                    are you running away from yourself?

          Liz and Cris file by the PASTOR after the service and mill
          about on the lawn with the other congregants. Kids release

          She drags Cris towards a YOUNG COUPLE WITH KIDS.
          
                              Liz

          Paul and Janice are chatting with Cris and Liz.
          
                              Paul
                    Cris, are you free on Tuesday?
                    Cause I'd like you to be my guest
                    at the Rotary luncheon.
          
                              Janice
                    I'm the first female member.
          
          Cris grows distracted. Out the corner of his eye, he sees a
          SPORTS CAR gunning it down the street, passing a SUNDAY
          DRIVER to beat a red light. At that moment, a kid misses a
          catch and a BASEBALL rolls into a street, where a twenty-ish
          WOMAN JOGGER runs over to get it, just as the sports car
          passes the Sunday driver, sees the jogger, and skids, forcing
          A BUS to swerve and plow into a GROUP OF PEOPLE standing at
          the corner.
          
                                                        SNAPBACK TO:

                    Cris, are you free on Tuesday?
                    Cause I'd like you to be my guest
                    at the Rotary luncheon.
          
                              Janice
                    I'm the first female member.
          
          Cris is spaced out.
          
                                LIZ
                     Cris.
          
          Ignoring them, Cris turns toward the street where he saw the
          accident take place. He sees kids, but they're jumping rope.
          Wrong group. He scans around and finds the kids who are
          playing softball. Someone misses a catch. The ball rolls
          toward the street. The sports car is now coming fast. The
          woman jogger sees the errant ball and runs to fetch it.
          
                              CrIS
                    Miss! Lady! Don't!
          
                                                                  58.
          
          
          
          She's wearing earbuds and can't hear him. He's too far away
          to grab her. He's closer to the approaching sports car. Cris
          picks up a rock, prepares to throw, hesitates a beat,
          squints....
          
          He throws. Misses. Snapback. Throws. Misses. Snapback. Again.
          Again. Scores a hit. Snapback. Opens his eyes and hurls the
          stone.
          
          Liz and the bystanders watch, appalled, as the rock SHATTERS
          the driver side window of the sportscar, which instead of
          skidding, screeches to a halt. The bus drives by without
          incident, injuring no one.
          
          The Driver of the sportscar bursts from his car and furiously
          charges Cris.
          
                              CrIS
                    I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'll pay for
                    the damages.
          
          The Driver curses Cris and tries to grab and hit him. But
          Cris deftly deflects the blows so that they seem harmless.
          
                              CRIS
                    I said I'll pay.
          
          Realizing he can't land a punch, the Driver changes tack.
          
                              DRIVER
                    You're damn right you'll pay! I
                    wanna talk to the cops.
          
                              CRIS
                    No need for that. I'll give you
                    cash. Okay? Will you take cash?
          
          He pulls out his wallet.
          
                              CriS
                    Two thousand? That should cover it.
          
                              DRIVER
                    Make it three.
          
                              CRIS
                    Okay, three.
          
          He digs in his pocket and pulls out the stack of hundreds.
          
                                                                     59.

                               CAVANAUGH
                    I know.
          
          Cavanaugh takes his leave.
          
          EXT. PARK - DAY
          
          Liz reacts to Cris' confession with disbelief.
          
                              LIZ
                    What are you saying, you're some
                    sort of prophet?
          
                              CRIS
                    It's not religious. I just happen
                    to see my life before it happens.
          
                              LIZ
                    Cris, it's sweet that you feel
                    responsible for people. But I think
                    you need help.
          
          She looks down.
          
                              LiZ
                    And I'm...I'm not the one to help
                    you, right now. I've got too much
                    going on in my own life.
          
          Cris can't let her go. He takes a quarter from his pocket and
          hands it to Liz.
          
                               CRIS
                    Flip it.
          
                               LIZ
                    Why?
          
                                                                    61.
          
          
          
                              CRIS
                    Just do it.
          
          She takes the quarter and flips it. Cris calls it in the air.
          
                                CRIS
                    Heads.
          
          She looks. It's heads.
          
                              CRIS
                    Flip it again.
                        (calls it in the air)
                    Tails.
          
          Tails it is, but so what. She flips again.
          
                              CRIS
                    Tails.
                        (she looks;flips again)
                    Heads.
                        (she looks, flips again)
                    Tails.
          
          She looks. Amazed. Disturbed.
          
                              CRIS
                    Now you believe me?
          
          She stares at him like he's the devil.
          
                              LIZ
                    Yeah. And I don't want to have
                    anything to do with you.
          
          She walks away.
          
                                CRIS
                    Liz.
                        (follows)
                    Don't you see? I can get us all the
                    money we need.
          
          She turns abruptly.
          
                              LIZ
                    Don't follow me. Don't talk to me.
                    Get out of my life!
          
          She walks on, leaving Cris bereft.
          
                                                          SNAPBACK TO:

          WALKING IN THE PARK - fiVE MINUTES AGO
          
                              Cris
                    What do you want me to do? Wait for
                    people to die?
          
                              LIZ
                    Cris...I think you should move on.
                    Today.
          
          Cris squints, then chooses his words carefully.
          
                              CRIS
                    Why? Because I care so much about
                    kids that sometimes I overreact?
          
          His words hit the bull's-eye. Liz's whole demeanor softens.
          Although still troubled, she takes his arm, and they walk on.

                    Who's the woman?
          
          Ext. Hillside overlooking park - DAY
          
          Ferris, Cavanaugh, and Policeman Rick are each looking
          through a pair of binoculars.
          
                              POLICEMAN rick
                    Liz Cooper. Nice girl, but very
                    erratic.
          
                              cAVANAUGH
                    Think she'll cooperate?
          
                              POLICEMAN RICK
                    Hard to say. She's impossible to
                    control.
          
                              Ferris
                    Sounds like you've tried.
          
                              POLICEMAN RICK
                    She's quite a challenge.
          
          EXT. PARK - daY
          
          Liz and Cris, still walking, holding hands.
          
                              LIZ
                    I swear, I can't figure you out.
          
                                                                 63.
          
          
          
                              CRIS
                    Believe me, the feeling is mutual.
          
                              LIZ
                    Sometimes you seem mindlessly
                    impulsive. But other times I feel
                    like you're utterly calculating,
                    saying exactly what you think'll
                    push my buttons.
          
                              CRIS
                    What do you mean?
          
                              LIZ
                    Don't you think it's kind of an
                    amazing coincidence that neither of
                    us can have kids?
          
                              CRIS
                    You want to talk to my doctor? I'll
                    get him on the phone. No, really, I
                    mean it. I'll have him send you my
                    records. Because I want you to
                    trust me.
          
          He seems so sincere that she dismisses her concerns.
          
                              LIZ
                    Then open up. Talk to me. Where are
                    you going with your life?
          
          Cris seems unprepared for the question.
          
                              crIS
                    Wherever it takes me.
          
                              LiZ
                    You never think about the future?
          
                              CRIS
                    All the time. - But mainly how to
                    stay out of trouble.
          
                              LIZ
                    No goals? Dreams? Ambitions?
          
                              CRIS
                    There's only one thing I've ever
                    wanted.
          
                              LIZ
                    What's that?
          
                                                                  64.
          
          
          
                                CRIS
                    A family.
          
          She seems disappointed.
          
                              LIZ
                    That's all? Just a family?
          
                              CRIS
                    Well, I was, as they say, left on a
                    doorstep when I was two.
                        (makes light of it)
                    Never found foster parents who
                    could put up with me. - So to me, a
                    family sounds like plenty.
          
          That certainly pressed her buttons again.
          
                              LIZ
                    You've got to be making this up.
          
                                CRIS
                    I wish.
          
          She rests her head on his shoulder.
          
                              LIZ
                    You poor guy.
          
          Ext. Hillside overlooking park - DAY
          
          Still watching Cris and Liz as the couple get into her car.
          
                              CAVANAUGH
                    I say we get the whole department
                    up here and bust his ass.
          
                               Ferris
                    And by that time, his ass'll be
                    long gone.
          
                              CAVANAUGH
                    Then why won't he see through your
                    trap?
          
          Ferris takes a deep breath.
          
                              Ferris
                    Let's try this one more time.
          
                                                                     65.
          
          
          
          ext. old SHOPPING CENTER - daY
          
          Grocery, drug store, hardware, gas station. Liz and Cris get
          out of her Jeep. He heads for the grocery store.
          
                              LIZ
                    I'll meet you inside. I need to
                    pick something up at the drug
                    store.
          
          They split up.
          
          Ext. Across the street - unmarked car - DAY
          
          Ferris, Cavanaugh, and Policeman Rick watch the couple go
          their separate ways. Ferris gets out.
          
                              FERRIS
                    Stay in the car. If he sees your
                    shadow, he won't take the bait.
          
                              CaVANAUGH
                    We hear you.
          
                              Ferris
                    I'm serious. This guy can smell
                    your farts before you even eat the
                    beans.
          
                              rick
                    Miss, I won't even think about
                    beans.
          
          Ferris gets out of the car. Cavanaugh and Rick stay put.
          
                              Rick
                    Sounds like a crock to me.
          
                              CAVANAUGH
                    You haven't been chasing him for
                    three years.

          Liz is in the female department, trying to choose between
          various brands when Ferris approaches.
          
                              Ferris
                    Miss Cooper.

                    Yes?
          
                                                                  66.

                    Agent Ferris.
          
          Ferris shows her badge. Homeland Security. Liz, frightened,
          is ready to listen.
          
          INT. Drug store - dAY
          
          Ferris and Liz huddle in a quiet corner. Liz is in shock from
          what she has just heard.
          
                              LIZ
                    He's not a killer. He needs help.
          
                              Ferris
                    I agree. But he has a long history
                    of resisting arrest, and the state
                    wants to hunt him down with fifty
                    trigger-happy cops.
          
                              LIZ
                        (aghast)
                    You're not gonna let them.
          
                              FERRIS
                    That's why I came to you.
          
                              LIZ
                    Okay, I'll talk to him. I'll try to
                    get him to...
          
          Ferris shakes her head lamentably.
          
                              FERRIS
                    Even his best friend says he'll
                    never turn himself in. - At this
                    stage, there's only one way to keep
                    him from self-destructing.
          
          Liz knows she's facing an agonizing decision.
          
          EXT. GROCERY STORE PARKING LOT - DAY
          
          Cris waits impatiently by her Jeep. Liz finally approaches,
          carrying a couple of heavy bags filled with wine and booze.
          
                              crIS
                    What took so long?
          
                              LIZ
                    I ran into a friend I hadn't seen
                    in a while.
          
                                                                  67.
          
          
          
          Liz holds out a single key on a ring.
          
                              LIZ
                    She said we could use her cabin up
                    at the peak.
          
          ACROSS THE STREET
          
          Ferris rejoins Cavanaugh and Ferris in Rick's car.
          
                              caVANAUGH
                    Did you tell her about the future
                    thing?
          
                              Ferris
                    Of course not. I wanted her to
                    believe me. - But I loaded her up
                    with liquor, to dim his headlights.
          
          Ext. Mountain road - DAY
          
          Liz's Jeep grinds up a steep, winding road, past a sign that
          says "State Line."
          
          She turns onto a dirt driveway that leads to a cabin and a
          glorious panorama.
          
                              CRIS
                    God, this is gorgeous.
          
          Inspired, he kisses her, but she's distant.
          
                              CRIS
                    What's wrong?
          
          She smiles wanly, then gives him a peck.
          
                               LIZ
                    Nothing.
          
          She hops out of the truck.
          
          
          Ext. STAKEOUT SITE across the CANYON - DAY
          
          Cavanaugh and Rick look through binoculars. Ferris peers
          through a telescope on a tripod. Baines approaches with a
          half dozen tech and construction guys.
          
                                                          68.
          
          
          
                               baines
                    Okay, when you press the remote,
                    the cabin will lock down like a big
                    jail cell.
          
                              FERRIS
                    But silently, right?
          
                              BAINES
                    Unnoticeably.
          
                              CAVANAUGH
                    And that's when we go in.
          
          Ferris rolls her eyes with exasperation.
          
                              Ferris
                    You still don't get it.
                        (tries to be patient)
                    This has to be clear to your whole
                    army.
                        (to Baines)
                    And yours. -- After she comes out
                    and we lock down the cabin...We
                    don't do anything. We wait.
          
                              Policeman RICK
                    But if he's already trapped...?
          
                               FERRIS
                    Gentlemen, try to think like him. -
                    If the plan is to go in right after
                    he's trapped, he'll see it coming
                    and he'll slip away before he's
                    trapped...
                        (to Cavanaugh)
                    Like he's always done.
          
                              cavANAUGH
                    How does your plan change anything?
          
                              baines
                    At least he won't hear it when the
                    trap closes.
          
                              FERRIS
                    And if he doesn't know he's
                    trapped, he can't foresee knowing
                    he's trapped.
          
                              CAVANAUGH
                    That kinda makes sense.
          
                                                                  69.
          
          
          
                              FERRIS
                    The eureka moment is when he
                    realizes he's been trapped.
          
                              CAVANAUGH
                    When is that?
          
                              ferriS
                    That's the point. We want to delay
                    "eureka" for as long as possible.
                    So by the time he sees trouble and
                    decides to waltz away...
          
                              baines
                        (finally gets it)
                    He's already been in the trap for
                    hours.
          
                              FERRIS
                    Voila.
          
          Cavanaugh and Rick nod with a kind of awe.
          
                              RICK
                    You're smart.
          
          Baines looks at her with new respect.
          
          INT. Cabin bathroom - sunset
          
          Liz looks in the mirror, torn.
          
          INT. Cabin - parlor - sunset
          
          Cris is lighting a fire he has built. Liz drifts in, pensive.
          
                              LIZ
                    Cris. Do you think we met for a
                    reason?
          
                              CRIS
                    You mean, do I believe a higher
                    power brought us together?
          
                              LIZ
                    Yeah.
          
                              CRIS
                    No. I think we're just the last in
                    a long chain of accidents that
                    started with the Big Bang.
          
                                                                   70.
          
          
          
                              LIZ
                    That's not very romantic.
          
                              CRIS
                    Oh, but it is. Think of it: For us
                    to meet, everything from the very
                    beginning, every sub-atomic event,
                    every galactic cataclysm, every
                    step of evolution, every act, every
                    accident, every decision in the
                    history of the universe had to
                    happen exactly the way it did just
                    so you and I could be together,
                    right here and now.
          
          She is moved by his words, but they make her strangely sad.
          
          Cris pours two glasses of Scotch. Hands one to Liz.
          
                              CRIS
                    To whatever happens next.
          
          She doesn't drink.
          
                              LIZ
                    I shouldn't.
          
                                 CRIS
                           (concerned)
                    Why?
          
                                 LIZ
                    I'm late.
          
                                 CRIS
                    Late?
          
                              LIZ
                    That's why I went to the drug
                    store. To get a pregnancy test.
          
          Off his puzzlement, she hands him a small plastic tab.
          
          A SQUARE CROSS is coming into focus.
          
          He recognizes the image from the Donut Shop display case just
          before he met Liz for the first time.
          
                              LIZ
                    You know what this means?
          
                                                                  71.
          
          
          
                                CRIS
                    I do now.
          
          They look at each other, equally perplexed.
          
                              LIZ
                    How did it...?
          
                              CRIS
                    I have no idea. Unless...But that
                    still doesn't explain...
          
          She struggles to make sense of it.
          
                              CRIS
                    Liz, I really did have this
                    problem. I wasn't lying to you.
          
          He can't read her reaction.
          
                              CRIS
                    But this is good. This is amazing.
                    I want this baby more than
                    anything.
          
          She looks at him, emotional.
          
                              LIZ
                    It's like a miracle.
          
                              CRIS
                    For both of us.
          
          She lets him hold her.
          
          EXT. AROUND THE MOUNTAIN - NIGHT
          
          State Troopers are camped out in two's and three's. Fifty of
          them. Plus Baines' SIX MP's, wearing different uniforms.
          
          INT. cabin - Bedroom - night
          
          Liz and Cris in bed. Her head on his chest. This time he's
          the one sleeping while she lies awake.
          
          Ext. STAKEOUT SITE - NIGHT
          
          Ferris and Baines sip coffee and wait. They find each other
          attractive.
          
                              baines
                    Think she'll come through?
          
                                                                  72.
          
          
          
          Ferris shakes her head with certainty.
          
                              FERRIS
                    Women hate good-looking men.
                    Rejecting them makes us feel
                    powerful.
          
                              Baines
                    And that's more important than
                    love?
          
                              FERRIS
                    No. But she doesn't really love
                    him.
          
          INT. cabin - Bedroom - night
          
          Liz eases away from Cris, trying not to wake him. He
          stirs...but settles back into slumber. She slithers out of
          bed and tiptoes to the bathroom. Silently closes the door
          behind her.
          
          INT. Bathroom - night
          
          Liz stands there in the dark, heart pounding. She sees that
          the window is open. She looks at it, deciding.
          
          INT. cabin - DAY
          
          The morning sun on Cris' sleeping face. His foot slides in
          search of Liz. Not finding her, he opens his eyes. Checks the
          clock. 10:09 AM.
          
                              CriS
                    Liz... Liz?
          
          No answer. He walks to the bedroom door.
          
          Locked. He tries to force it. Won't budge.
          
          Tries the window. Bars across it - that weren't there before.
          Shakes them. Solidly bolted. Looks outside. No one's around.
          He's about to shout, but stops himself.
          
          Runs into the bathroom. Bars over that window, too. As he
          stands there, trapped, Ferris steps into view outside.
          
                                FERRIS
                    Surprise.

          Cris' eyes flash open in bed. Liz isn't there.
          
          He throws off the covers, pauses to scan ahead -- then rushes
          straight to the bathroom and throws open the door.
          
          Liz is still there, in the dark, facing the open window.
          
                              CRIS
                    You lying bitch! You betrayed me!
          
          She darts for the window and starts to climb through. Cris
          pulls her back by her robe. She SCREAMS.
          
          Bars slide silently into place over the bathroom window,
          locking them both in. BLINDING LIGHTS spike on throughout the
          forest, converging like javelins at that cabin.
          
                                                          SnAPBACK TO:
          
          INT. Cabin: MOMENTS EARLIER
          
          Cris throws open the bathroom door.
          
          Liz is still there, in the dark, facing the open window.
          Seeing the expression on his face, she darts for the window.
          This time, Cris doesn't move.
          
                              CRIS
                        (whispers)
                    Liz, please, I love you.
          
          She hesitates.
          
                              CRIS
                    Let me talk to you for one minute.
                    I won't hurt you, I promise.
          
          She turns around, trembling.
          
                              LIZ
                    Cris, I know you don't mean to hurt
                    people. But you need help or you're
                    going to keep on hurting them.
          
                              CRIS
                    The man I killed was there to rob
                    the store. He was going to panic
                    and shoot five innocent people.
          
                                                                     74.

                    How do you know this?
          
                              CRIS
                    Because I saw them die.
          
                              LIZ
                    Like yesterday, with the car?
          
                              CRIS
                    Yes.
          
                              LIZ
                    You were afraid something bad might
                    happen so you...
          
                              CRIS
                    Not "might"! Those people died! -
                    They just hadn't died yet.
          
          His certainty is almost convincing.
          
                              LIZ
                    What if you hadn't done anything?
                    Have you ever waited to see what
                    would happen?
          
                              CRIS
                    Once.
          
          The trauma replays on his face.
          
                              CRIS
                    That's why I don't go out much. So
                    I won't be there to see.
          
          Liz doesn't know what to believe, but she feels for him.

          Liz steps toward Cris.
          
                               LIZ
                    Cris, you're a good man. And I will
                    stand by you through this. But you
                    have to...
          
                              CRIS
                    If they catch me, they'll put me in
                    a cell without a trial, and they'll
                    never let me out. They do that, you
                    know.
          
                              LIZ
                    I won't let it happen. I'll get you
                    a lawyer.
          
          Suddenly distracted, Cris squints with that faraway gaze.
          
                              LIZ
                    Cris...Cris.
          
          He snaps out of it.
          
                              CRIS
                    There's one decent path.
                        (fixes her gaze)
                    But if we're gonna stay on it, I
                    need you to do exactly what I say.
          
          How can she listen to this madman?
          
                              CRIS
                    Will you give me one chance? One
                    chance in exchange for a miracle?

                              FERRIS
                    Okay. Wait for my signal.

          Liz listens, dubious, as Cris crouches beneath the window
          sill, scribbling a note on a scrap of paper.
          
                              CRIS
                    A few steps on, your robe will get
                    caught on a thornbush. You won't be
                    able to get unstuck. Ferris and a
                    tough guy will come help you.
                    She'll say, "You've done your

                    you're safe.
          
          He tucks the note into her robe pocket.
          
                              LIZ

                    Bet on it.
          
          She gathers her courage and steps to the open window.

          Everyone is coiled, waiting for Ferris to give the word.
          Cavanaugh is on the radio with his men, ready to pass it on.
          
          Ferris takes a last look through the nightvision binoculars.
          That's when Liz climbs awkwardly out of the bathroom window
          in her bathrobe.
          
                              Ferris
                    She's coming now.

                     And I can tell you this: he doesn't
                     love anybody. How could he? To him,

                    We're the characters in a

          Cris on foot, running over rough terrain. State Troopers
          converging. Searchlight beams crisscrossing.
          
          A cone of light passes over Cris. Comes back. Finds him.

                    There! I got him!
          
          He finds himself face to face with two Troopers, guns aimed
          straight at him.
          
                              TrooPER 1
                    Stop!
          
          Cris tumbles, draws fire, serpentines through the woods,
          feinting, freezing, unhittable - moving closer.

          Cris is within fighting distance. Chop to an arm. Punch to
          diaphragm. Cris is now holding Trooper 1's SIX-SHOT REVOLVER.
          
          Trooper 1 runs. Cris does not fire after him. Instead, he
          takes aim at a searchlight at a great distance. Squints. Then
          fires and scores a direct hit with the first shot.
          
          Turns to a second search light. Squints. Squeezes off a
          second shot. The lamp shatters.

          THE HUNT
          
          Cris gets pinned down behind a tree. A Trooper keeps firing,
          trying to drive him from hiding. Cris boldly comes out from
          cover and runs, giving the Trooper a clear shot. But the
          Trooper runs out of ammo at just that moment.

          Baines' well-trained MP's have set up a triangulated trap.
          They operate like skilled Special Forces commandos. One of
          them signals, fingers to eyes, that he has spotted Cris. Cris
          enters a clearing and continues straight into the trap! The
          TEAM LEADER prepares to give the signal to shoot.
          
          Cris' movement flushes a STAG from the hiding. It knocks over
          one MP and causes another to miss his shot. The Leader sees
          the stag and scans around for Cris. CAMERA repositions to
          reveal that the stag now stands between Cris and the Leader.
          The Leader shoots the stag, killing him, but not before Cris
          dashes to cover in another stand of trees.
          
          Two MP's fire at Cris. But shoot each other.

          Cris is suddenly the target of a turkey shoot. He hops around
          like a mountain goat while bullets CHING off rocks and
          SPLINTER trees. He stays alive, but only by a hair's breadth.
          
          Cris finds himself pinned down by Four Troopers. He rushes
          Trooper One, who fires, and hits Cris solidly in the chest.

          Cris rushes the Third Trooper, who hesitates, frightened,
          then shoots -- and misses. Cris charges up to him, knocks his
          shooting arm away, takes his weapon, uses him a shield, then
          fires at a Fourth Trooper as he charges out from the trees.
          It's Cavanaugh, now covered in blood.

          Cris uses Trooper Three as a shield, but when Cavanaugh comes
          charging from the trees, Cris DOESN'T FIRE. Instead he shoves
          Trooper Three at Cavanaugh, sending them both tumbling down a

                    I'm getting used to miracles.
          
          Three MP's grab onto the car's mirrors and door handles. Cris
          weaves violently until they lose their grip and fly off.
          
          In Rick's Police Cruiser - dawn
          
          Liz and Cris grin at each other.
          
                              CRIS
                    Where were you going?
          
                              LIZ
                    No idea. I was just trying to be
                    unpredictable.
          
                                                                    87.

          Ferris urgently unrolls a road map and studies it.
          
          In Rick's Police Cruiser - dawn
          
          Cris speeds down the treacherous curves.
          
                              LIZ
                    So what's the plan? Bonnie and
                    Clyde?
          
                              CrIS
                    Remember that place in the South
                    Pacific?
          
                              LIZ
                    It's starting to sound really good.
          
          He pulls out his cell phone.
          
                              CRIS
                    I'll check on our ride.
          
          INT. LAS VEGAS PENTHOUSE - daWN
          
          NEAL, a 60-ish tycoon with silvery hair, finishes packing an
          expensive suitcase. A high-maintenance SHOWGIRL puts the
          finishing touches on her make-up in his marble bathroom.
          Somebody's cell-phone plays the theme from "Peter Gunn." Pan
          across eight large suitcases, his and hers, ready to go, and
          find Guy on the sofa, watching CNBC financial news. He
          reaches into a coat pocket and flips open his handset.
          
                                 Guy
                    Yeah...
          
          Guy signals Neal. This is the call they were expecting.
          
                              Guy
                    No, the jet's not sold...I'm here
                    with him now...Of course, he's
                    pissed...I can ask.
          
          With a smirk of triumph, he turns to Neal.
          
                              Guy
                    He wants to know how soon the jet
                    can be ready.
          
          Neal conceals his evident satisfaction.
          
                                                                  88.
          
          
          
                              Neal
                    I'll wait until eight o'clock. But
                    if he's not there, I'm taking off
                    without him.
          
          INT. Rick's Police Cruiser - dawn
          
          Cris, driving fast on the treacherous winding road, closes
          his cell phone.
          
                              cRIS
                    It's arranged. But we have to get
                    to the North Vegas airport by
                    eight.
          
                              LIZ
                    Will we make it?
          
          He concentrates as he screeches around a curve.
          
                              CRIS
                    Right now I'm just trying to stay
                    alive.
          
          They hit a patch of ice. Skid wildly.
          
          MOUNTAIN ROAD
          
          Rick's Police Cruiser swings over the side and tumbles down a
          steep slope. There will be no survivors.
          
          Hold on curve.
          
          Rick's Police Cruiser speeds into view AGAIN!?? But this
          time, Cris steers around the ice patch, skids dangerously,
          almost goes over the side, but continues safely downhill.
          
          Rick's Police Cruiser
          
          Liz, palpitating, tries to catch her breath.
          
                              LIZ
                    Christ, you live dangerously.
          
                              CRIS
                    Just the opposite. I never take
                    chances.
          
                                                                   89.
          
          
          
          MOUNTAIN ROAD - PREVIOUS CURVE
          
          Cavanaugh's Car speeds into view, skids on the same patch of
          ice and skates over the side of the road, as Cris did, the
          first time.
          
          There will be no survivors. And no second chances.
          
          STAKEOUT SITE
          
          As a Federal Chopper idles, Ferris marks up a ROAD MAP of the
          area with X's.
          
                              FERRIS
                        (to radio)
                    Cavanaugh, get all your men into
                    town.
                        (waits)
                    Cavanaugh? Tell them.
          
          Baines approaches.
          
                              BaINES
                    He's dead. Crashed.
          
          Ferris winces, then moves on like a general in battle.
          
                              FERRIS
                    You take command of the chase.
                        (hands him the map)
                    Have cars block these intersection.
          
          She heads over to the copter.
          
                                 BAINES
                    Why these?
          
                              FERRIS
                    Get in the chopper.
          
          He follows her inside, and the copter takes off.
          
          MOUNTAIN ROAD
          
          Cris takes blind curves at high speed.
          
                              CRIS
                    Did the doctors ever say why you
                    couldn't have kids?
          
                              LIZ
                    I grew up at Love Canal.
          
                                                                     90.
          
          
          
                              CRIS
                    What's that?
          
                              LIZ
                    A neighborhood back East built over
                    a chemical dump. A bunch of my
                    friends had birth defects.
                        (looks back)
                    I always figured I was lucky just
                    to be sterile.
          
                              CRIS
                    Except you're not. And neither am
                    I. We're different, that's all. We
                    just had to find the right match.
          
          A look between them.
          
                              LIZ
                    And somehow we did.
          
          They approach the entrance to the town.
          
          EXT. hendersonville - DAWN
          
          Police vehicles converge on the area, systematically blocking
          the intersections that Ferris indicated.
          
          Rick's Police Cruiser
          
          Cris threads his way through town, zigging and zagging down
          streets and alleys.
          
          FROM THE HELICOPTER
          
          Ferris sees Cris maneuvering perfectly through the maze,
          avoiding imminent traps and confrontation.
          
          
          
                              BAINES
                        (discouraged)
                    He doesn't miss a beat.
          
                              FERRIS
                        (pleased, to herself)
                    Come to momma.
          
          Cris dodges another trap.
          
                                                                    91.
          
          
          
                              FERRIS
                        (to radio)
                    Stay after him. Keep the pressure
                    on.
          
          The bypassed police cars chase after Rick's stolen Cruiser,
          which leaves town on a street that merges with a WINDY NARROW
          CANYONSIDE ROAD.
          
                              BAINES
                        (incredulous)
                    He's driving right into it...
          
          Up ahead, beyond a blind curve, the road leads to a ONE-LANE
          BRIDGE over a DEEP CHASM with RAGING RAPIDS at the bottom.
          
                              BAINES
                    Sometimes looking one step ahead
                    isn't enough.
          
          On the FAR SIDE OF THE BRIDGE, out of sight, beyond a curve,
          EIGHT STATE POLICE CARS form a barricade across the road.
          
          INT. Rick's Police Cruiser - DAY
          
          Having escaped from town, Cris and Liz share a glimmer of
          relief.
          
                              LIZ
                    You make it look easy.
          
          Cris' expression darkens.
          
                              CRIS
                    Oh shit. Oh no.
          
                              Liz
                    What is it?
          
                                 CRIS
                    I blew it.
          
          They round a curve and the NARROW BRIDGE comes into view.
          
          FAR SIDE OF BRIDGE
          
          Behind the barricade, Ferris' helicopter comes in for a
          landing.
          
                                                                    92.
          
          
          
          INT. Rick's Police Cruiser - DAY
          
          Cris checks his rearview mirror. A six-pack of cop cars are
          right behind him. To his left, a steep rock wall. To his
          right, a vertical drop-off into the canyon.
          
          Cris drives on, the blood draining from his face.
          
          FAR SIDE OF THE BRIDGE
          
          Ferris strides across the span, Baines in her wake. Arriving
          at the barricade, she approaches the biggest state police
          car, a HUMMER -- and flashes her badge.
          
                                 FERRIS
                       I need your vehicle.
          
          She walks through the Trooper and gets into his Hummer.
          
                                 BAINES
                       What's the plan?
          
                                 FERRIS
                       Playing chicken.
          
                                  BAINES
                       Don't be stupid! He knows what
                       you'll do!
          
                                 FERRIS
                       But so do I. And for once, that
                       makes us even.
          
          She starts up the Hummer. It roars.
          
          THE BRIDGE
          
          Cris slams on the brakes. Stops the car. Police cars stop
          behind him, blocking retreat.
          
                                 CRIS
                       GET OUT! NOW! OR YOU'LL DIE!
          
          She hustles out.
          
                                 LiZ
                       What's going to happen?
          
                                 cris
                       We'll find out.
          
          A quick look good-bye and he drives on.
          
                                                                  93.
          
          
          
          HUMMER
          
          Ferris gathers her determination and floors it.
          
          ON THE BRIDGE
          
          A game of chicken with a difference.
          
          ON CRIS
          
          Squinting.
          
          CRIS' VISIONS:
          
          Fast forward to the HEAD ON COLLISION! Then a COLLAGE of
          ALTERNATE CHOICES AND OUTCOMES: Cris swerves; slams on the
          brakes; gets shot making a run for the rail; spins out on the
          roadbed; crashes over the side, over the side, over the side!
          But in every version, the Hummer is unchanging. Unrelenting.
          Dead on.
          
          THE BRIDGE - NOW
          
          They're speeding closer.
          
          FERRIS
          
          Total focus. No doubts or decisions.
          
          CRIS' VISIONS: FAST, QUICK, CONDENSED
          
          The falling car crashes onto the canyon wall, tumbles
          downhill, explodes; falls again, this time crashing directly
          onto boulders at the bottom...
          
          ON CRIS
          
          He drives toward a specific segment of railing between two
          light posts.
          
          THE BRIDGE
          
          Rick's Cruiser crashes through the railing and plunges over
          the side of the bridge.
          
          Liz runs to the rail and leans over the side, watching the
          Cruiser fall down, down, down through the narrow ravine.
          
          IN THE FALLING CAR
          
          Cris unbuckles his seat belt. Opens the door. Just before
          impact, he LEAPS OUT, away from the car.
          
                                                                    94.
          
          
          
          BOTTOM OF CANYON
          
          The car smashes into boulders at the shallow side of the
          river. A moment later, Cris SPLASHES a few yards away in the
          deepest part of the rapids.
          
          ON THE BRIDGE
          
          Ferris peers down into the canyon.
          
          IN THE RAPIDS
          
          Cris bobs to the surface and is carried away by the fierce
          current. The smashed Cruiser also gets carried into the
          river. Fighting the current, Cris watches as the smashed
          police cruiser surges ahead of him - then disappears!
          
          Perplexed for a beat, he suddenly understands and desperately
          swims for a rock and clambers onto it.
          
          CAMERA pulls back to reveal that Cris is stuck in the middle
          of the river -- about five feet from where it drops off into
          a WATERFALL!
          
          A HELICOPTER
          
          flies over him.
          
          ON THE ROCK
          
          Cris looks for a way out. Seeing none, he jumps!
          
          And is swallowed up in dark thunderous death.
          
                                                          SnapBACK TO:
          
          CRIS
          
          Still on the rock. Looks up and sees a cable being lowered
          from the helicopter. He looks around? Is there another way
          out? Out of choices, he reaches for the cable. Misses! Loses
          his balance. Flails. At the last second, he steadies himself.
          
          He wants to live.
          
          The cable dangles back into range.
          
          Cris grabs it.
          
          The cable is hooked to A PAIR OF HANDCUFFS.
          
                                                                  95.
          
          
          
          FERRIS
          
          Watches through binoculars as Cris snaps one cuff around his
          wrist -- and waits. She shouts into her radio.
          
                                 FERRIS
                       Cuffs on both wrists. Leave him if
                       he doesn't.

                                 BaiNES
                       What can he do hanging by one arm?
          
                                 FERRIS
                       I don't want to find out.
          
          Baines speaks to Cris via loudspeaker.
          
                                 Baines
                       Both wrists!
          
          On the rock
          
          Cris, defeated, attaches the second cuff to his other wrist.
          He is lifted up into the air, hanging by both arms.
          
          Bridge
          
          Liz sits, handcuffed, in the back of a second U.S. Government
          helicopter. Ferris approaches.
          
                                 FERRIS
                       I was wrong about one thing. He is
                       capable of love.
          
          HELICOPTER
          
          Descends, with Cris hanging below by a cable. MP's are
          waiting below with a tarp which they wrap around Cris, then
          tape him like a mummy, up to his neck. When he's bound as
          securely as Hannibal Lecter, Ferris steps close and gets her
          first good look at him.
          
                                 Ferris
                       Cris Johnson, we meet at last.
          
                                 CRIS
                       Why does everybody have amnesia but
                       me?
          
                                                                  96.
          
          
          
                              FERRIS
                    I only ask one thing from you. Give
                    me a chance to earn your trust.
          
                              cris
                    I did, and you failed.
          
          She seems genuinely surprised.
          
                              FERRIS
                    Then give me another chance. You
                    get `em all the time.
          
          She signals and Cris is dumped into the waiting helicopter.
          The door is slammed behind him.
          
          INT. helicopter - DAY
          
          Inside, Cris is surprised to find himself alone with Liz. He
          edges closer so they can hear each other.
          
                              CRIS
                    Don't let them know you're
                    pregnant.
          
          The helicopter takes off.
          
                              CrIS
                    You don't have to raise him. But at
                    least let him be born. Can you do
                    that? It might be the only chance
                    either of us gets.
          
                                 LIZ
                    I promise.
          
          They gaze at each other with intense longing.
          
                              LIZ
                    Work with them Cris. So we can be
                    together.
          
          He shakes his head, fatalistic.
          
                              CRIS
                    I'll get us out of here. We can
                    still make the plane.
          
          She knows it's hopeless.
          
                                                                  97.

          MED TECHS perform a battery of tests on Cris and Liz. Wisdom,

                              Wisdom
                    Are you out of your mind? Did you
                    ever play chicken before?
          
                              FERRIS
                    This game was different. He knew I
                    wouldn't flinch.
          
          Baines covertly makes the "big balls" gesture with two clawed
          hands. Wisdom nods knowingly.

          wrist. Click, the metal shackles open automatically and drop
          to the floor.
          
          Cris reaches down for them. Possible weapon. Struggles to

          Cris gives up on the chains and sullenly steps forward.
          
          WHITE ROOM
          
          Size of a squash court. Cris enters gingerly and peers
          around. Twenty feet up, an OBSERVATION WINDOW, opaque. On the
          other walls, RIFLE BARRELS poke through NARROW SLITS. The
          door slides shut behind him.

          Ferris leans forward and speaks.

                       Cris, we'll be firing at you with

          Ferris signals Wisdom to be patient. Cris just stands there,
          flatfooted, arms folded, unafraid.
          
          Ferris nods. A Techie presses a button. The THREE RIFLES
          FIRE.
          
          Cris is hit square in the chest!
          
          By THREE BLUE PAINTBALLS.
          
                                 CrIS

          Wisdom looks her in the eye. Sees her certainty.

                    It's your experiment.
          
          Ferris leans toward a microphone, but before she can speak...
          
                              CRIS
                    "From now on, Cris, the bullets are
                    real."
          
          Ferris sits back and nods to the techies to proceed.
          
          BARE WHITE CHAMBER
          
          Cris balances, at the ready, as the three rifles take aim at
          him. He LUNGES at the very instant that one rifle FIRES. A
          bullet ZINGS by his ear.
          
          As the second rifle fires, Cris contorts -- and a bullet
          parts his hair.
          
          As the third rifles fires, he tumbles away, almost a blur.
          
          More shots, in rapid sequence, erratic rhythm. Two at a time.
          Three at a time.
          
          Like a pinball, Cris pivots, crouches, dodges every bullet.
          Then suddenly stops. Stands there. An easy target. Click,
          click, click, the guns are out of bullets.
          
                              FERRIS
                    He's almost impossible to shoot,
                    hit, surprise, capture, or contain.

          Wisdom takes out his handgun, carefully aims, and discharges
          six shots at Cris - doesn't score a hit.
          
                                                                 100.

          Ferris pushes a toggle, and a pocket door slides open in a

                    The floor is electrified. He must
                    have tried resisting and foreseen
                    the result.
          
          Cris walks through the doorway into...
          
          THE SMALLER WHITE ROOM
          
          which is familiar from the opening sequence, but not exactly
          the same. Because it's not exactly the same future. A HEAVY
          CHAIR, bolted to the floor, faces a PLASMA SCREEN MONITOR on
          the wall. To the left of the screen is a MIRROR; to the
          right, a DIGITAL CLOCK-CALENDAR.
          
          Ferris' FACE appears on the monitor.
          
                              Ferris on monitor
                    Cris, it's time to get started with
                    the next test. This won't be
                    unpleasant. We just need to you sit
                    in the chair.
          
          Cris eyes the chair with suspicion.
          
                                                                 101.
          
          
          
                              Ferris on monitor
                    I want you to look ahead, tell me
                    the time on the clock and then tell
                    me what film clip you see playing.
                    Let's start with five minutes from
                    now. Then we'll press ahead as far
                    as you're capable of.
                        (to Wisdom)
                    The clips have been assembled at
                    random by a computer, so nobody
                    knows what'll be playing next.
          
          Cris looks into the mirror and sees his face reflected - as
          an old man. He turns away.
          
                              cris
                    Look, I'll stand here and tell you
                    what I see.
          
          INTERCUT BOOTH / WHITE ROOM
          
                              Ferris on monitor
                    I'm afraid we need you to sit.
          
                               CRIS
                    Why?
          
                               Ferris on monitor
                    Why not?
          
                              CRIS
                    I know what happens.
          
                               Ferris oN MONITOR
                    Tell us.
          
                              CRIS
                    You tie me down and never let me
                    out.
          
          Wisdom looks at Ferris. She shrugs, sheepish.
          
                               FerriS
                    That's only because you won't
                    cooperate.
          
                              CRIS
                    Because you're trying to force me.
          
                                                                   102.
          
          
          
                              Ferris
                    Work with us, Cris, and you can be
                    a hero. Fight us, and things will
                    get worse and worse.
          
          Cris squints, frustrated, looking for a way out.
          
                              Ferris ON MONITOR
                        (severe)
                    Now sit in the chair. One. Two.
                    Three.
          
          Ferris switches the toggle. The sizzle of electricity.
          
          Cris hops and jumps in agony.
          
          Ferris turns away, then makes herself look.
          
                              WISDOM
                    Whoa, you are one tough bitch.
          
                              FERRIS
                    We're still in a Code Red if I'm
                    not mistaken.
          
          She turns off the juice.
          
                              WISDOM
                    He knew he'd get shocked, but he
                    chose to resist.
          
                              FERRIS
                    He's almost never had to face
                    consequences.
                        (flips toggle)
                    Cris, are you ready to get in the
                    chair?
          
          Cris, recovering, shoots her the finger.
          
          She switches the toggle again - and leaves it on. Wisdom
          doesn't have the stomach to watch.
          
                              FERRIS
                    We need information, right?
          
          Cris collapses, unconscious.
          
                              FERRIS
                    Leave him there. We'll start again
                    when he recovers.
          
                                                                   103.
          
          
          
          INT. Wisdom's office - DAY
          
          Wisdom and Ferris are both traumatized by the torture.
          
                              WISDOM
                    Okay, how do we use him to find the
                    bombs?
          
                              FERRIS
                    Simple. We make him watch the news
                    and tell us about it.
          
                              WISDOM
                    How far ahead can he see?
          
                              FERRIS
                    I don't know. But I suspect we can
                    increase his range with practice.
                    Especially if we restrict his
                    future to only watching news. Then
                    he'll be like a timescope.
          
          Wisdom nods.
          
                              WISDOM
                    You were right. This is huge.
          
                              FERRIS
                    This is just for starters. You want
                    to stage a pre-emptive strike, he
                    can tell you if you'll hit the
                    target and whether they hit back
                    and what went wrong. And you can do
                    this over and over until you get it
                    perfect before you begin.
          
          Wisdom chuckles at the enormity of the potential.
          
                              wisDOM
                    And all he's ever done with it is a
                    little gambling and securities
                    fraud?
          
                               FeRRIS
                    I know, it's amazing; but he's not
                    ambitious.
          
                              WiSDOM
                    Damn, how will we control this guy
                    when he figures out what he's
                    capable of?
          
                                                          104.
          
          
          
                              Ferris
                    We control him now. We just have to
                    keep it that way.
          
                              WISDOM
                    Right now, sweetheart, we can't
                    even get him to sit in a chair.
          
          Dread suddenly washes over Wisdom.
          
                              WISDOM
                    We've got to think this through.
                    Your friend could be more dangerous
                    than the terrorists.
          
                              Ferris
                    Aren't you running ahead of
                    yourself?
          
                              WISDOM
                    With this guy, you have to. Or
                    it'll be over before it begins.
          
                              Ferris
                    So we'll keep him in chains.
          
                              WISDOM
                    That may not be enough. We may
                    have to cut off his arms and legs.
                    Then I might start to feel safe.
          
          Ferris grins uncomfortably.
          
                              Ferris
                    You're not serious.
          
                              WISDOM
                    Think about it. What we're talking
                    about here is the next step in
                    human evolution. And I'm not gonna
                    make the same mistake the
                    Neanderthals made when they ran
                    across this good-looking Homo
                    Sapien fellow and all the lady
                    Neanderthals said, "He's so cute.
                    Let's keep him around."
          
                              FERRIS
                    Can we deal with your sexual
                    insecurities at another time?
          
                                                                   105.
          
          
          
                                 WISDOM
                       You mean after it's too late?
          
          Ferris seems to come around to Wisdom's logic.
          
                                 Ferris
                       I wish you'd given me a chance to
                       chain him up before you decided to
                       prune him into a stump.
          
          They are both filled with dread.
          
                                 wisdom
                       You think he knows? Already?
          
          white room
          
          Cris on the floor. His expression hardens.
          
          CorrIDORS
          
          Ferris and Wisdom stride through the facility almost at a
          run.
          
                                 WiSDOM
                       I haven't made any firm decisions.
                       Maybe we will just keep him tied
                       up.
          
                                 FERRIS
                       I told you, he doesn't read minds.
                       He sees the results.
          
          WHITE ROOM
          
          Cris rises from the floor into a crouched position, like an
          animal ready to pounce.
          
          The door flies open and A DOZEN ARMED MP's charge in, rifles
          at the ready, and surround Cris. Cris checks the time on the
          digital clock. It's 5:12 PM.
          
          Corridors
          
          Ferris and Wisdom getting closer; he's on a cellphone.
          
                                 Wisdom
                       Tell Baines to meet us there. And
                       bring a dozen men.
          
                                                                   106.
          
          
          
          WHITE ROOM
          
          Motionless, in a crouch...Cris suddenly dashes between two
          MP's, shoves them aside, makes for the door. He gets smashed
          by the RIFLE BUTTS of the nearest ones, then stomped by the
          full contingent. [Attempt #1]
          
          AREA OUTSIDE THE White ROOM
          
          Ferris and Wisdom arrive and look through the window.
          
          THEIR POV:
          
          Cris is alone in the room, in that crouched position. No
          MP's. What we've just seen...hasn't happened yet.
          
          OUTSIDE THE WHITE ROOM
          
          Baines arrives with THE DOZEN ARMED MP's we saw in the
          previous scene.
          
                                 WISDOM
                       Wait for my signal, then go in and
                       surround him.
          
          Wisdom and Ferris hurry upstairs into the Observation Booth.
          
          We pass through the wall into the...
          
          White room
          
          Where in some future Cris is once again surrounded by the
          Dozen MP's who are actually outside, waiting to charge in.
          Suddenly, Cris pounces low at one soldier's hips, shoving him
          into the soldier next to him, which knocks over a third
          soldier. Cris dashes for the door, but four MP's pull him
          away before he can get out. [Attempt #2]
          
          Observation ROOM
          
          Ferris and Wisdom enter and look down at Cris, who crouches
          alone, motionless, in the White Room. Ferris prepares to
          speak to him. Wisdom interrupts.
          
                                 WISDOM
                       I'll do the talking.
          
          Wisdom goes to the microphone.
          
                                 WISDOM
                       Cris, this Eric Wisdom. I'm the

                       I don't believe you.
          
          Outside WHITE room
          
          BAINES and the DOZEN MP's wait, ready to charge in.
          
                                 WISDOM (o.s.)
                       I apologize for the way you've been
                       treated. Agent Ferris got a little
                       carried away.
          
          White room
          
          Cris, once again surrounded by the same Dozen MP's, suddenly
          punches one of them, kicks another, and now has the mobility
          to start using his Tai Chi moves. But the other MP's gang up
          on him and pile on, burying him under their weight. [Attempt

                       please sit in the chair so we can
                       begin?
          
          observation ROOM
          
          Wisdom and Ferris watch as Cris still just crouches there,
          motionless, alone, in the empty room. He checks the clock.
          It's 5:09 PM. Just minutes before The MP's will charge into
          the room.
          
          WHITE ROOM
          
          Cris runs to the door and tries to bar it so they can't
          enter. He gets shoved aside by the force of the MP's as they
          charge in. [Attempt #4]
          
          observation ROOM
          
          Wisdom and Ferris watch as Cris still just crouches there,
          motionless, in the empty room. Wisdom flicks off the mike.
          
                                 WiSDOM
                       What's he doing?

                    Cris, time is running out.
          
          White room -
          
          Cris is again crouched and surrounded by the Dozen MP's.

                    We need your cooperation right
                    away.
          
          Suddenly Cris attacks using his Tai Chi skills. He outfights
          four of them, but then is subdued by the others. [Attempt #5]
          
                                                          SnAPBACK:
          
          Cris is again crouched and surrounded by the Dozen MP's.
          
                              wiSDOM (plasma screen)
                    Cris, don't you feel some sense of
                    obligation to the rest of us? Your
                    ability could save so many lives.
          
          Suddenly he repeats the martial arts attack, but refines it,
          beating six MP's this time before being subdued... [Attempt
          #6]
          
                                                          SNAPBACK:
          
          Cris is again crouched and surrounded by the Dozen MP's.

                    ability could save so many lives.
          
          Faster and faster, over and over, Cris relives the attack,
          perfecting his movements, finding new opportunities. His
          skill increases with each iteration as he anticipates every
          soldier's action and counters it with the greatest economy of
          means. [Attempts #7-12]
          
          The fight takes on the quality of choreography as the MP's
          seem to step right into Cris' punches and kicks. Cris flips
          and throws them into each other, leveraging their movements
          to achieve his goals with perfect efficiency.
          
          But Cris still can't quite get out the door.

          Looking down at Cris, still crouched there, alone.

          Baines gives the signal and the dozen waiting MP's charge in
          through the door, rifles at the ready. The foreseen attack is
          now beginning in real time.
          
          INT. White room
          
          The MP's surround Cris, as foreseen. He remains in the center
          of them, crouched, motionless.
          
          For a long beat, they just stand there, rifles aimed at their
          frozen quarry.

                    ability could save so many lives.
          
          Cris suddenly attacks...and with perfect economy of movement,
          like a diver executing thirteen twists in the second before
          he hits the water, Cris executes the previous routine with a
          new "finale" and...
          
          Elegantly slips past all the MP's into the hall - and slams
          the door behind him, locking them in!
          
          The escape has the quality of magic. It takes a beat for the
          MP's to realize what has happened.

          Ferris draws her gun and charges down the stairs.
          
          OUTSIDE white room
          
          Cris is waiting for her and somehow he has her gun in his
          hand.

          Cris spins and shoots Wisdom in the shin as he starts down
          the stairs. Wisdom collapses.
          
                                CRIS

                      and legs.
          
          Cris spins and gets the drop on Baines.

          Baines sets down his gun. Cris takes off.

          Ferris attends to Wisdom, bleeding on the stairs.

          Cris. Running. MP's and general Security Police close behind.
          No place to hide. Soldiers open fire. Cris dives for the
          floor, tumbles, gets to his feet, serpentines, and ends up
          behind a door that opens at the moment, as if by mental
          command, shielding him from gunfire.
          
                                                                 111.
          
          
          
          Security Police pour out from the other side. Cris reaches
          around and grabs someone's gun. He opens fire, buying himself
          enough cover to get to a doorway.
          
          Cris stops, thinks, then charges out shooting, fighting,
          running -- completing a condensed burst of four impossible
          tasks that get him to the next point of refuge.
          
          He waits, thinks, charges and, with another burst of
          choreographed action, makes it into an elevator whose doors
          conveniently open at that moment. He darts inside, keeps
          shooting, presses certain buttons - starting several stories
          up, and waits for the doors to close.

          alert.
          
          Leo watches as the Security Forces split up. He scans the

                              Cris (o.c.)
                    Unscrew the vent.
          
          She moves a chair under the vent and prepares to stand on it.
          The door opens and several MP's march in.

          Without looking up at Cris, she moves the chair back against
          the wall and sits in it.
          
          VENTILLATION DUCT

          Settling in, Cris looks at his watch. 5:17. He concentrates
          and time speeds by - until a flashlight beam lights up the
          duct from a distance.

          As more Security Police and flashlights fill the shaft, Cris
          checks his watch: 5:33.
          
                                                          SNAPBACK:

                    Sixteen minutes.
          
          Cris takes a deep breath and crawls forward. Remarkably, he
          seems to be CRAWLING OUT OF HIS MOTIONLESS BODY like a snake
          shedding its skin! - In fact, Cris 1 lies there in deep
          concentration, while Cris 2 creeps onward.
          
          EXPLORATION SEQUENCE
          
          Cris drops down from a ventillator shaft into an office. He
          opens the door, walks into a corridor, and strides forward,
          preternaturally calm.
          
          He advances through an unfolding panorama of "stage sets" on
          which different hypothetical scenarios play out, one at a
          time, several simultaneously, or layered in like the melodic
          themes in a round or fugue, creating the visual equivalent of
          harmony and counterpoint.
          
          Cris encounters Security Police searching for him. When they
          discover Cris, they aim their weapons at him. He checks the
          time. Snapback a few seconds. He hides before they arrive.
          
          He goes through a door into a room. People are there.
          Snapback. Hides in a different room. It's empty. Cris
          searches the room. Looks in the desk drawers. Puts things in
          his pockets. The door flies open. Security Police find him
          and shoot. Snapback.
          
                                                                  114.
          
          
          
          Cris treads down empty corridors. He multiplies into a legion
          of Cris Johnsons, duplicated again and again, as he explores
          room after room, searching them sequentially. Simultaneously.
          
          He spends much time in a Handyman's Storeroom, while other
          Cris Johnson's fade away.
          
          Cris 27 finds the surveillance room with Leo in charge. Cris
          scans the room. He is seen. He waits to see who will shoot
          him first. He is hit in the chest. Fade out.
          
          Cris 35 gets caught by two Security Police. He fights them,
          takes their guns, but gets killed by reinforcements.
          
          Cris 63 waits in a room and peers through a crack in the door
          as his POV FAST FORWARDS, and he charts the comings and
          goings of the search parties, until they discover him, at
          which point he snapsback and hides in a different room. He's
          hiding in many rooms simultaneously. Spying. Piecing together
          the schedule of the patrol in that corridor.
          
          The same situations repeat. Scanning for security cameras.
          Fighting. Winning. Losing. Dying.
          
          He goes down a stairwell. One version of himself exits at a
          landing. A second iteration of himself continues to the next
          floor down. At that landing, two iterations of himself turn
          in different directions, left and right.
          
          We follow the one that went to the left.
          
          He sees MP's taking Liz from her holding room and escorting
          her somewhere else.
          
          He follows. Gets seen. By her. By them. Snapback.
          
          He is waiting in several locations, watching to see where the
          MP's will emerge with Liz. The MP's and Liz emerge from an
          elevator in one of the locations. The other Cris' fade out.
          
          Liz is ushered into a room and locked inside. Four guards
          depart. Two guards remain posted outside. They see Cris.
          
          He runs down stairs. Into the corridor. Into the room
          directly under the room where Liz is being held.
          
          Cris enters A FORENSICS LAB where the captured bomb is being
          studied. There is a barrel of C4 PLASTIC EXPLOSIVE. MP's in
          the room turn on him and open fire. Cris is blasted and falls
          to the floor, dead. Snapback to...
          
                                                                    115.
          
          
          
          VENTILLATION DUCT
          
          Cris, where he started, motionless as a hibernating bear,
          exploring his futures. CAMERA passes through walls, floors,
          ceilings and finds Baines rushing through the corridors.
          Baines enters...
          
          Wisdom's office
          
          Where Wisdom paces with one crutch while Ferris sits on a
          sofa like Rodin's Thinker, in concentration almost as deep as
          Cris'.
          
                              Baines
                    He hasn't gotten out through any
                    exit. The bad news is...
          
                              wisdOM
                    You've lost him.

                    I'm issuing infrared to all my men.

                    You realize if he gets away now,
                    we'll never get him back. He'll be
                    out there, and he'll be our enemy.
          
          Ferris looks up.
          
                              FeRRIS
                    I know how to flush him out.

          The thought crystallizes as she speaks.
          
                               FERRIS
                    We don't actually have to do

                    We just have to decide to do
                    something...unthinkable.
          
          Ferris shudders at the dark brilliance of her own idea.
          
                                                                   116.
          
          
          
          int. ground floor of facility - DAY
          
          Guards stand in a solid line. No way out. Cris off to one
          side, in a niche just inside the door. Camera pans and finds
          a second Cris standing back, away from an exit. Pans and
          finds a legion of Cris Johnsons, duplicated again and again,
          trying each exit.
          
          At one dim exit, he lies on the ground, charred and dead,
          next to the gauntlet of MP's he has tried to outrun.
          
          Wisdom's office
          
          Wisdom and Baines are looking at each other, appalled, then
          turn to Ferris.
          
                              WISDOM
                    You want me to threaten to kill a
                    pregnant woman?
          
                               FERRIS
                    Threats don't count. When he
                    foresees that you actually did kill
                    her, that she's dead...
                        (beat)
                    He won't let it happen. - He'll
                    come to us. Surrender. And she'll
                    live.
          
          Wisdom regards her with perverse admiration.
          
                              FERRIS
                    But it only works if we're not
                    bluffing. Because he'll know.
          
          Wisdom considers the decision that lies ahead for him.
          
          INT. NEAR THE LOBBY - DAY
          
          Cris is still trying to get out the front door, but there's
          one Soldier, call him CRACK SHOT, who kills Cris repeatedly.
          Cris snapsback and tries various tactics, but he can't get
          past Crack Shot alive.
          
          He gives up. Turns and runs back into the heart of the
          building.
          
          Cris' mental pov expands to include the entire facility, like
          a crystal doll house. Simultaneously, he is observing every
          room, present in every room, charting the place, testing
          possible actions.
          
                                                                    117.
          
          
          
          The facility is a bee hive of activity. A bee hive that
          accelerates to fast forward -- until all times are
          simultaneous. Until the simultaneous activity is made even
          denser by the accumulated layers of possibility.
          
          Cris-134 spies Ferris and Wisdom walking together. He follows
          them for a while, until he is discovered. Cris-134 fades out.
          The Ferris and Wisdom who saw him fade out. But another
          Ferris and Wisdom continue through the building, and their
          trail gets picked up by Cris-62, who has detoured in order
          to encounter them.
          
          As Cris' goals are accomplished, superfluous versions of
          himself fade away.
          
          The surveillance of a sequence of Ferris-and-Wisdoms is
          continued by Cris-91, then Cris-14, who watches as Wisdom and
          Ferris approach two guards standing outside an INTERROGATION
          ROOM. We recognize them as the MP's who are guarding Liz,
          inside. Wisdom is let into the Interrogation Room by the
          MP's. Ferris proceeds into a nearby office alone.
          
                                                       SnaPBACK TO:
          
          vENTILLATION duct
          
          Cris comes out of his trance. Checks his watch. Sixteen
          minutes have passed.
          
          Cris composes his thoughts, takes a breath, then crawls
          forward, leaving no Cris behind. Now it's for real.
          
          A moment after he rounds a corner, A FLASHLIGHT BEAM stabs
          into the duct that he vacated. It scans around. Withdraws.
          
          NOTE:
          
          The situations that Cris has just previewed from the
          Ventillator Shaft constitute the raw material that he will
          now re-craft into a single narrative: the story of his actual
          escape attempt, staged in long takes, unfolding in almost-
          real time. When appropriate, to illustrate Cris' ability, we
          will portray several locations simultaneously via split-
          screens which change in number, size, shape, and placement.
          
          INT. HANDYMAN'S STOREROOM - DAY
          
          Ceiling. The ventillator grill pops open. Cris drops to the
          floor. He grabs a backpack conveniently hanging on a hook.
          Without the slightest hesitation, he goes from shelf to box
          to drawer, loading particular objects into the backpack.
          
                                                                  118.
          
          
          
          CORRIDOR
          
          Empty. A door opens. Cris steps out into the hall carrying
          the backpack and a foot stool. He stays close to a wall,
          steps on the foot stool, and spray-paints over the lens of a
          surveillance camera.
          
          SURVEILLANCE ROOM
          
          Leo spots Cris as he blinds one camera after another.

                     I've got him. Third level, building
                     C. Pete, Brian, get up there. Kyle,
                     block off the west staircase.
                     Jason, bring your dogs in from the
                     east.
          
          CORRIDOR
          
          SOLDIER PETE and SOLDIER BRIAN charge into an empty corridor
          and begin their search for Cris.
          
          A door slams open, bashing Pete in the face. Cris breaks his
          shooting arm, grabs his M-16, hides behind the door, and
          sprays bullets low, hitting Brian in the shins. He runs to
          Brian, breaks his shooting arm, takes his rifle. Drags Brian
          and Pete into an open room. Tapes their mouths.
          
          SURVEILLANCE ROOM
          
          Baines arrives and takes command.
          
                               Leo
                     He was on third level seventy
                     seconds ago.
          
                               BaINES
                     But where is he now?
          
          INT. WEST STAIRWELL - DAY
          
          Cris pours floor polish in specific places.
          
          SOLDIER KYLE and his TROOP charge out off the stairwell. Each
          one steps directly into the polish and slips.
          
          As they fall, Cris punches them out or puts them in
          chokeholds, utilizing the elegant minimum of force or
          violence. Child's play. As soon as they are unconscious, Cris
          takes their guns, tear gas, and a gas mask.
          
                                                                 119.
          
          
          
          CORRIDOR
          
          SOLDIER JASON and THREE TROOPS are on the way, each with a
          GUARD DOG.
          
          ANOTHER CORRIDOR
          
          Cris lies in wait for the patrol. When they appear, he is
          perfectly placed to mace each dog and each soldier with a
          quick spritz. He goes back and sprays them again, to keep
          them out of commission.
          
          Surveillance room
          
          Cris appears on several screens.
          
                               LEO
                     He's on this floor!...Shit! He's
                     coming here!
          
          The door opens. A tear gas canister flies in. A moment later,
          Cris charges in wearing a gas mask.
          
          He opens fire at the video monitors, shattering every one.
          
          By the time the MP's are ready to respond, Cris reaches and
          grabs Baines' handgun. He swings out into the corridor with
          Baines' gun in his hand...Without looking, his hand aims and
          shoots several times.
          
          CORRIDOR
          
          Emerging into the hallway, Cris looks down at the end of the
          hall and sees two MP's falling to the floor, wounded.
          
          Cris wraps electrical tape around the door handle and a pipe
          on the wall, sealing the room shut, then turns and maces the
          last of the dogs.
          
          SURVEILLANCE ROOM
          
          As the tear gas clears, the damage is visible. Every monitor
          in the surveillance system has been shattered. Leo, coughing,
          feels his way to a phone.
          
          WISDOM'S OFFICE
          
          Wisdom answers on speakerphone.

          Cris, on the run, encounters CRACK SHOT - not where he was

          breaks his arm before Crack Shot can fire.

          INT. CORRIDOR OUTSIDE INTERROGATION ROOM - DAY
          
          Cris sneaks into room where he foresaw that Liz will be
          brought. The door is recognizable by its industrial look.
          
          WAITING ROOM
          
          Where Liz is being baby-sat by four MP's. Baines enters.

          INT. INTERROGATION ROOM - DAY
          
          Cris writes a note. Slips it onto a side table. Opens the
          drawer of a desk. Writes in it. Puts something inside.
          
          CORRIDOR OUTSIDE INTERROGATION ROOM
          
          Baines and the four MP's arrives with Liz. Baines, Liz, and
          two MP's wait while two officers carefully open the door and
          check out the room.
          
                                                                 121.
          
          
          
          We expect them to find Cris. But they don't.
          
          Outside, in the hall, a pencil rolls on the floor toward Liz.
          She notices it and looks where it came from. Sees Cris,
          hiding behind a janitor's cart. He puts his fist over his
          heart. Gesture of love.
          
          The two MP's in the room signal for Liz to be brought inside.
          
          Two MP's outside the room bring her in. Baines stays on guard
          outside.
          
          INTERROGATION ROOM
          
          While the Guards stand on alert, Liz sits in a chair and
          discovers a piece of paper on a side table, placed exactly
          where her hand has come to rest. On the paper, in pencil, a
          square with a square cross within. She flips over the note.
          It reads, "GO CRAZY!"
          
          She considers, then SCREAMS as loud as she can while running
          around wildly.
          
          OUTSIDE INTERROGATION ROOM
          
          Hearing the commotion, Baines opens the door. Behind his
          back, Cris steps from hiding, opens the door to a room and
          slips inside, closing the door just as Baines looks back.
          
          INTERROGATION ROOM
          
          The MP's force Liz into a chair behind a desk.
          
                               SOLDIER
                     Sit there and shut up.
          
          Liz sees a drawer which is partially open. She looks inside.
          Sees a hefty pair of scissors. Inside the drawer, a message
          is written on the wood. "5:44, stab Wisdom." She looks at a
          clock in the room. 5:41. But Wisdom isn't there.
          
          CORRIDOR

          She accepts the terrible responsibility.
          
                              FERRIS
                    I'll join you in a minute. I need
                    to take care of some details.
          
          Wisdom turns to Baines.
          
                              WISDOM
                    Get more men up here.
          
          Ferris walks to a nearby office and goes inside.
          
          INTERROGATION ROOM
          
          Liz anxiously checks the clock. 5:43 and still no Wisdom.
          Then the door opens. And Wisdom enters.
          
          They study each other, neither knowing the other's plans. She
          glances aside at the clock.
          
          FERRIS' OFFICE
          
          She picks up the phone. Dials a number.
          
                              FERRIS
                    This is Ferris. I'll need a chopper
                    tanked up and ready.
          
          Behind her, Cris steps out of hiding. By the time she sees
          him, his forearm is around her neck.
          
          INT. INTERROGATION ROOM
          
          At 5:44, Liz grabs the scissors, lunges at Wisdom, and stabs
          at his neck. He raises his arm in time to block the blow.
          
                                                                   123.
          
          
          The two MP's in the room fight her off, calling to the
          sentinels outside.
          
          OUTSIDE THE INTERROGATION ROOM
          
          Baines and the sentinels rush in to help.
          
          When the corridor is empty and no one is looking, the door to
          Ferris' office opens, and Cris emerges with Ferris as his
          hostage.
          
          INT. INTERROGATION ROOM
          
          MP's drag Liz away from Ferris.

          Cris and Ferris make their way toward the entrance. They come
          across a Patrol. The MP's take aim. Cris holds his gun to

          Baines, on the radio, turns to Wisdom.
          
                                BAINES
                      You won't believe this. He's got

                      I don't know, but he's on his way
                      to the front door.
                          (beat)
                      They want instructions.
          
          Wisdom thinks hard.
          
                                                                 124.

                      Then how are we going to stop him?
          
                                WISDOM
                      We don't. We let him go.
                      - It's part of the plan.
          
          Baines tries not to be insubordinate.
          
                                BAINES
                      You're sure about this?

                      No, but Ferris is.
          
          Wisdom takes a deep breath - then grabs Liz by the arm and
          aims his gun at her head.

          Cris walks into view and fires one shot, which wings the
          substitute sniper -- causing him to miss his shot at Cris.
          
          Cris pulls Ferris to the next location.

          CORRIDOR
          
          As they pass under him, Ferris sees the sniper above. Cris
          takes aim at an empty space and fires just as a soldier
          charges from hiding and absorbs the bullet as if deliberately
          catching it with his body.
          
                                                                 126.

          Cris breaks a window. Tosses a grenade outside.

          The grenade explosion attracts many of the guards. Cris and
          Ferris slip out the front door where the Guards were
          previously stationed.
          
          He addresses a Soldier in a patrol car.

                    Give me your keys.
          
          The Soldier obeys. Cris shoves Ferris into the car and gets

                                 CRIS
                       It'll never happen.
          
          She offers her card.
          
                                 FERRIS
                       My door will be open. We can start
                       from scratch.
          
          He takes it. The phone number stands out: 888-CFerris. Flips
          the card out the window.
          
                                 FERRIS
                       The magic word is cooperate. That's
                       all we've ever wanted to hear from
                       you.
          
          A helicopter lands on the road ahead, blocking the way.
          
                                 CRIS
                       When are they going to give up?
                       After you're dead?
          
          Cris holds his gun threateningly to Ferris' head. Two MP's
          get out of the helicopter, carrying something heavy.
          
                                                                    128.
          
          
          
          Cris reacts to what he can't see yet.
          
          They are carrying a body. They remove the hood from its head.
          It's Liz. Dead.
          
          Quaking with rage, Cris prepares to shoot Ferris.
          
                                                           SNAPBACK TO:
          
          INT. HOMELAND SECURITY - Corridors - DAY
          
          Twenty minutes earlier. Cris is marching Ferris through the
          corridors to the exit.
          
                                ferriS
                      I wish you had a little more sense
                      of duty.
          
          Cris stops in his tracks, quaking with rage.
          
                                CRIS
                      To a gang of murderers?
          
          Ferris seems pleased.
          
                                FERRIS
                      I see you got our message.
          
          He checks his watch. 5:54.
          
                                CRIS
                      What's about to happen...you've
                      brought it on yourselves.
          
          Cris changes course and charges into a...
          
          STAIRWELL
          
          which he descends at a run, roughly dragging Ferris with him.
          
                                fERRIS
                      It's not too late Cris. You can
                      save her.
          
                                CRIS
                      I'm planning on it.
          
          Cris shoves Ferris in front of him as a shield. Approaching a
          turn in the stairs, he fires blindly. Rounding the turn, he
          sees his would-be assassin collapsing, dead.
          
                                                                    129.
          
          
          
          INTERROGATION ROOM
          
          Wisdom keeps his gun aimed at Liz's head as he watches the
          clock: 5:55 PM.
          
                               Soldier
                     He's heading this way.
          
          CORRIDOR
          
          Cris charges out of the stairwell, shooting without
          hesitation - forward, left, right, back - efficiently
          targeting Security Police in the precise order of their
          imminent readiness to fire at him. For each bullet, one
          soldier dies.
          
          Wisdom's voice comes over the P.A. System.
          
                               WiSDOM (o.S.)
                     Johnson, this is Wisdom. It's 5:55.
                     You have five minutes to turn
                     yourself in...
          
          Cris and Ferris keep moving.
          
                               Wisdom (o.S.)
                     Or your worst nightmare will
                     happen.
          
          Cris marches right up to the Interrogation Room where Wisdom
          holds Liz prisoner, using Ferris as a human shield.
          
                               WisDOM (o.S.)
                     Look ahead if you don't believe me.
          
          Cris opens the door to the room, revealing Wisdom, Ferris,
          and thirty Security Police and MP's - who take aim at him and
          fire. Cris gets chopped to pieces.
          
                                                           SnAPBACK TO:
          
          Cris crouches on the floor outside the Interrogation Room,
          reaches up and opens the door. He gets off a shot at Wisdom,
          who lives long enough to put a bullet in Liz's heart.
          
                                                           SnAPBACK TO:
          
          Cris uses Ferris as a shield, gets off a burst of shots at
          Wisdom, killing him instantly.
          
                                                                   130.
          
          
          But a Soldier at Wisdom's side puts a bullet in Liz's heart --
          then the thirty Security personnel blast Cris and Ferris to
          pieces.
          
                                                       SnAPBACK TO:
          
          STAIRCASE - ONE MINUTE EARLIER
          
          Cris, dragging Ferris, arrives at the level of the
          Interrogation Room and continues down one more flight.
          
          Using Ferris as a human shield, he shoots his way into...
          
          INT. FORENSIC LAB - DAY
          
          Where Cris previously saw the seized barrel of C4 Explosive.
          He guns down several armed MP's whom he knows would be
          present, then threatens the technicians.
          
                                 CRIS
                    Get out!
          
          They flee. Cris locks himself and Ferris inside.
          
          Cris goes over to the bomb. Squints for a beat. IN FAST
          FORWARD, CONDENSED TIME, MULTIPLE SNAPBACK, he goes through
          the whole learning curve on bomb detonation, blowing himself
          up - and snapping back to life -- several times before
          figuring out the right way to set it off.
          
          INTERROGATION ROOM
          
          Wisdom holds Liz at arm's length with his gun pointed at her
          head. Watching the clock count up to 6:00 PM. It's 5:59:41/
          /42/43...
          
          THE LAB
          
          Cris moves the bomb. Closes his eyes for a beat. Moves the
          bomb again. Closes his eyes. Opens them. Sets the detonator
          to 10 seconds.
          
          CORRIDOR OUTSIDE LAB
          
          MP's wait, preparing to gun down Cris when he emerges. The
          door opens. Ferris sprints out.
          
                              feRRIS
                    It's going off in ten seconds!
          
          The crowd flees with her.
          
                                                                 131.
          
          
          
          INTERROGATION ROOM
          
          Wisdom watches the clock count advance. 5:59:55/56/57...
          
          CORRIDOR
          
          Now empty. Cris runs for it. Dives.
          
          INTERROGATION ROOM
          
          As Wisdom prepares to the pull the trigger, the bomb explodes
          in a giant cataclysm.
          
          Smoke and dust
          
          Roiling. Opaque. Then clearing.
          
          The center of the building
          
          is gone. A jagged raw atrium extends several stories down and
          up.
          
          To the side, on a narrow ledge of floor extending from a
          wall...crouches Liz. The only person remaining. She has
          survived by inches. Very precise.
          
          As she recovers from the blast, a door opens behind her. Cris
          appears, extends a hand and helps her from her perch.
          
          Ext. North vegas airport - night
          
          A private jet warms up on the tarmac.
          
          ext. Private jet - night
          
          Cris and Liz bound up the entry steps, exhausted but elated.
          
          INT. JET - NIGHT
          
          At the door, no one is present to greet them. Odd.
          
          They continue into the main cabin, where Neal, the Showgirl,
          the Pilots, and the Flight Attendant are glued to the
          television. Neal sees Cris and Liz, but hardly acknowledges
          them. He's in shock. They all are.
          
          Cris and Liz turn to the TV.
          
                                                                 132.

                    The situation in Chicago is not
                    quite as severe as in the other
                    nine cities where the dirty bombs
                    exploded, as prevailing winds blew
                    the nuclear waste across Lake
                    Michigan rather than straight into
                    town. Radiation levels in Detroit,
                    on the other hand, may require the
                    entire city to be evacuated.
          
          Liz and Cris look at each other, ashen.
          
                              LIZ
                    This is what they wanted you to
                    prevent?
          
                                 CRIS
                    I guess...
          
                              LIZ
                    And you wouldn't help?
          
                              CRIS
                    They didn't explain. They were
                    trying to force me.
          
          Liz shakes her head, incredulous.
          
                              CrIS
                    They were gonna make me a slave.
          
          She looks at Cris like he's scum - and heads for the front of
          the plane.
          
                              CRIS
                    Liz? Where are you going?
          
                              Liz
                    To the doctor.
          
          She walks out of the jet and down the steps.
          
                              NEAL
                    She's not coming with us?
          
          Cris stands there, bereft, and watches her go. He has run out
          of futures.
          
          CLOSE ON CRIS

          Tears escaping from his eyes. ROTATE FRAME and discover that
          the previous cut was actually a...

          Where Cris lies in bed with Liz's head on his chest, the
          morning after their first night [p. 45]. Since that point,
          Cris has been up for hours - scanning the futures. Finding no
          path worth taking.
          
          INT. Wisdom's HOUSE - dawn
          
          Ferris sleeps next to Wisdom. She's hogged the covers. Her
          cell phone rings. Drowsily, she answers.
          
                               FeRRIS
                    Ferris.

                    This is Cris Johnson.
          
          She sits up.

          INT. Liz's kitchen - dawn
          
          Cris is dressed. Despondent.

                    I want to cooperate.
          
                              FERRIS
                    That's music to my ears.
          
                              CRIS
                    But I have conditions.
          
                              FERRIS
                    I'm sure we can work something out.

          Liz. Sleeping. Cris sits next to her on the bed.

          Her eyes flicker open. She sees him looking down at her like
          an angel.

                    Come back to bed.
          
                              CRIS
                    I can't. - I have to go.
          
                              LIZ
                        (incredulous)
                    You're not leaving?
          
                              CRIS
                    There's something I have to do.
                    Something you'd want me to do. And
                    I can't put it off any longer.
          
                              LIZ
                        (wounded)
                    Fine. Then go. What do I care?
          
                              CRIS
                    Liz, it's not like that. I searched
                    for you for a long time. I want to
                    be with you forever.
          
                              LIZ
                    Don't overdo it. We just met last
                    night.
          
                              CRIS
                    But a lot has happened since then.
          
                              LIZ
                    While I was sleeping?
          
          He proceeds with difficulty.
          
                              CRIS
                    We're going to have a child.
          
                              LIZ
                    Then you really are an angel.
          
                              CRIS
                    I don't expect you to believe me.
                    But when you do find out, remember
                    that we came together for a reason.
                    That this wasn't just...one night.
                    It was a special chance for both of
                    us.
          
                                                                 135.
          
          
          
          Seeing his misery, she softens.
          
                              LIZ
                    Then why are you running away from
                    me?
          
          He holds back tears.
          
                              CRIS
                    I'm not...I'm taking the long way
                    around.
          
          Now she's crying.
          
                              LIZ
                    I don't understand. We got off to
                    such a great start.
          
          He nods, wistful.
          
                              CRIS
                    And I looked for a happy ending...
                    But this was the best I could do.
          
          They kiss good-bye, and she makes it so wickedly sweet that
          he can barely pull himself away.
          
          Liz watches, mystified, as he leaves - stirred by feelings
          for Cris that are just coming into being.
          
                                 LIZ
                    See ya?
          
                              CRIS
                    I wouldn't be surprised.
          
          And he walks out the door.
          
          Ext. LiZ'S HOUSE - DAY
          
          Cris walks down the driveway to the street. He stands there a
          beat, then Ferris' car drives up and stops in front of him.
          Cris opens the passenger door and gets in.
          
          INT. Ferris' car - DAY
          
          They look at each other, coming from very different places.
          
                              Ferris
                    Mr. Johnson, we meet at last.
          
                                                                 136.
          
          
          
                              CRIS
                    I wasn't ready till now.
          
          Ferris shifts into gear and drives off.
          
                              FERRIS
                    We don't have time to waste. Maybe
                    you could start by telling me how
                    your talent works.
          
          He thinks how to phrase it.
          
                              CRIS
                    "The future ain't what it used to
                    be." Ever hear that expression?
          
          Ext./Int. front window of cottage - DAY
          
          Liz watches from inside as Ferris' car pulls away.
          
                              CRIS (v.O.)
                    It's a joke, but it's true. The
                    future changes every time you look
                    at it. Because you looked at it.
                    Cause once you see it, you're
                    different. And that changes
                    everything else.
          
          Liz puts her hand on her belly.

                         FADE IN:

          EXT. THE PLANET - MORNING

          Huge mountains, destroyed STRUCTURES. Buildings
          enveloped by flows of earth. Awe-inspiring beauty.

                    JACK (V.O.)
          They arrived almost half a century
          ago. Aliens, Scavs, whatever you
          want to call them. Their idea of
          how-do-you-do was to blow up our
          moon.

          Giant waterfalls crash where lava cooled through iron and
          concrete. Telephone polls half-buried in sand.

                    JACK (V.O.)
          Without her moon, the earth went
          insane. Most were killed in the
          floods, as the cities came down,
          as everything caught fire. A year
          later their ground troops landed,
          to exterminate whoever was left.
          A station wagon half protrudes from a lava flow. A
          child's plastic flip-flops on the dash.

                    JACK (V.0.)
          They were probably surprised, what
          we were willing to do, to survive.
          We used the nukes.

                         (BEAT)
          We won the war, but lost the
          planet.

          Low on the HORIZON, the TET rises with the sun. It's a
          WHITE TETRAHEDRON (SIX-SIDED) SPACE STATION that circles
          the earth once a day, like an artificial moon.

                    JACK (V.0.)
          Humanity had to flee the Earth.
          We had to unlearn what it meant,
          to call something our home. Now
          we live on the Tet, our man-made
          moon. A temporary home before the
          next step. Everyone's there now.

                         (BEAT)
          Well, almost everyone.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          2.

          INT. BEDROOOM - MORNING

          An ALARM chirps. A man's hand reaches out of bed,
          silences it. The MAN swings his feet onto the floor. He
          sits with his face in his hands, waking up. We hear a
          SHOWER RUNNING. He looks up.
          A WOMAN showers near him, only steamed glass walls
          between them. She sees him, smiles at him, without
          modesty. He looks back at her.
          OVER TITLES. We watch a familiar morning routine:

          INT. A HOME - MORNING

          BATHROOM. The man flicks on a light, stares at himself
          in the mirror. This is JACK. Early 40's, a good face
          that enjoys rugged living. Tan and weathered skin. His
          eyes are curious, kind, almost child-like.
          The woman squeezes in next to him, VICTORIA. 30s, a tom-
          boy shock of red hair, towel around her neck. She
          brushes her teeth.

          KITCHEN. Victoria watches the coffee drip, bites toast.
          SHOWER. Jack lets warm water blast him in the face.
          READY ROOM. Jack pulls a worn high-tech workman's suit
          from a locker, revealing a photo taped to the door: It's
          of him and Victoria, younger, in a white-walled high-tech
          corridor, smiling eager at the camera. He stares at it
          for a moment, closes the locker door.
          KITCHEN. Victoria hands Jack his coffee. He kisses the
          top of her head, heads out to work.

          EXT. SKY TOWER - CONTINUOUS

          He walks out onto the deck of a futuristic home perched
          1,200 feet in the air, literally above the clouds. As
          our minds are blown, Jack moves away from the glass-
          walled home towards his BUBBLESHIP, a futuristic-cross
          between a Bell 47 Helicopter and a jet fighter, and we
          CRANE UP UP UP... INCREDIBLE VERTIGO until we're looking
          down at this impossible structure. Jack, climbing into
          his ship.

          3.

          EXT. THE SKY - DAY

          The SKY stretches to infinity above roiling planetary
          cloud-cover. The BUBBLESHIP streaks through our frame,
          dropping faster than free fall.

          INT. BUBBLESHIP - CONTINUOUS

          Through the canopy of the Bubbleship: The cloud cover
          below seems to FALL UPWARDS at us, that's how fast we're
          diving. There's a small worn BOBBLE-HEAD on the dash
          which vibrates with the ship.
          Jack is un-phased by the drop, touches a few controls.

          VICTORIA (V.O.)
          Good morning, Jack. I'll be your
          flight attendant for the day.
          This is day... three thousand two
          hundred and twenty five, in case
          you were wondering.
          JACK is running instruments. A day at work..

                         VICTORIA
          Today we will be running support
          on five Resource Gatherers working
          the seaboard. Coordinates coming
          to you... now. Please do confirm.
          On Jack's heads-up display, five icons glow to life.

                         JACK
          Yeah, I got 'em. You got 'em,
          Bob?
          The Bobblehead bobs.

          INT. SKY TOWER, CONTROL STATION - CONTINUOUS

          VICTORIA watches the Bubbleship's icon on a screen.
          She's now wearing a work jumpsuit open over a man's
          undershirt. She has a natural ease with tech and stress.
          She sips her coffee, punches up a feed, multi-tasking
          with cool.

                         VICTORIA
          Drone perimeter defense is intact,
          although one went offline last
          night. How's the drop?

                         (CONTINUED)

                         

                         

                         

                         

          4.

                         CONTINUED:

                         JACK
          Oh, you know. Same ole' same.
          In front of Victoria, almost a hundred years of
          technological advances. Most prominent a MAP overlaid
          with environmental, meteorological, radiation levels...
          Other screens stream cam-footage from the Bubbleship.

                         VICTORIA
          Alright, you're blind in five,
          four, three...
          INTERCUT WITH JACK IN THE BUBBLESHIP. JACK watches the
          cloud wall RUSH UP at him.

                         VICTORIA (CONT'D)
          Two... one...

                         JACK
          You should come with me sometime.

                         VICTORIA
          No, thank you. Have a nice ride.
          The Bubbleship HITS CLOUDS, goes completely blind. Just
          vapor and water HAMMERING the canopy like bullets.
          On the heads-up display, GPS numbers roll. The readouts
          deal with climate, terrain below... Even in this hell,
          Jack takes the controls, starts to pilot on instruments.
          One of Victoria's boards flashes. She squints as a large
          MASS forms near Jack's ship.

                         VICTORIA (CONT'D)
          Jack, you got some weather on your
          five, closing.
          The Bubbleship is VIBRATING, buffeted.

                         JACK
          What do you call this?
          What does a storm look like inside a storm? Like this.
          The WALL OF WEATHER comes out of the wind and rain from
          behind Jack's ship, simply eats it up.
          Suddenly Jack's going end over end, helpless. Warning
          lights flash. Jack punches controls that won't respond.

                         JACK (CONT'D)
          (humming to himself)
          "I've got sunshine...

                          JACK (CONT'D)
          on a cloudy day. When it's cold
          outside I've got the month of
          May..."
          Victoria watches the readouts, helpless.

                         JACK (CONT'D)

                         (STILL SINGING)
          "I guess you'd say... What can
          make me feel this way?"
          (a little tense)
          Okay, Bob. Need you to work with
          me here.
          In the Bubbleship, Jack works the display, literally
          SMACKS a panel with his fist. Suddenly, the Bubbleship
          SURGES with power. Jack regains control as:

          INT/EXT. BUBBLESHIP - CONTINUOUS

          The Bubbleship BURSTS through low clouds, hurtling down
          past turbulence into...
          THE SKY ABOVE A BEAUTIFUL DESOLATE PLANET. Mysterious
          black sand dunes, active volcanoes, swirling orange and
          gold sediment, steaming bright blue hot springs and rich
          brown craters.
          Jack takes a moment to marvel at it all.

                         JACK
          (under his breath)
          "Talkin' 'bout my girl..."
          Jack shifts the Bubbleship, in the distance a series of
          RESOURCE-GATHERERS on the horizon. Essentially titanic
          vacuums, sucking up the oceans.
          In front of her console, VICTORIA charts the Gatherers,
          and the patrol arcs of their defensive Drones. One
          blinks, stalled.

                         VICTORIA
          Okay, we've got another Drone
          downed last night.

                         JACK
          Send it.
          NUMBERS FIRE across the heads-up. Jack touches a button.
          A BAR GAUGE begins to fill, like a street racer turning
          on the NOX before dragging...

                         CONTINUED:

                         VICTORIA
          Would you like to set a course to
          reserve fuel?

                         JACK

                         (SMALL SMILE)
          Absolutely not.
          Bar gaucre hits top. Jack punches it.
          JACK vibrates in his seat, pinned back. The ship SCREAMS
          over the surface, following the signal.
          Now A HUGE CRATER opens up in front of him which he DROPS
          INTO, barely missing an edge... which seems to have
          architecture to it.
          The ship skims close along the walls which are revealed
          to be rows and rows of stadium seats, half buried in
          sand. We're in Giants Stadium, New Jersey.
          Old news to Jack. He surveys below...

                         JACK (CONT'D)
          I see it, looks like full mid-
          flight impact. What was its last
          destination?
          BELOW, through blowing dust, we see a DRONE, a spherical
          mechanical weapon, plunged into the sand.

                         VICTORIA
          Yo no se. No data. It's not
          transmitting.
          (checking the map)
          Tet coverage will go live in 11
          minutes.
           Jack stares forward at a huge broken sign: "Home of the
          2015 World Champions..."

                         JACK
          You know, I actually read about
          this game. Giants are literally
          on their own seven with 25 seconds
          on the clock...

                         VICTORIA
          Please do not reminisce on my
          Comm, thank you very much.
          He puts the Bubbleship into a soft descent. Victoria
          observes it on her console.

          Negative, technician. I have no
          eyes in the sky for another ten
          minutes. Do not land.
          SEEN FROM INSIDE A STADIUM TUNNEL: The bubbleship lands
          thirty yards from the Drone, moors itself by setting
          spikes from its skids. Blowing sand whips around both.

          INT. BUBBLESHIP - CONTINUOUS

          JACK grabs an old YANKEES CAP from between the seats and
          slides it on backwards. He hoists a WEAPON, a carbine-
          sized gun on a sling, and checks its charge as he slides
          the door open. He's BLASTED with sand and wind which now
          suddenly still, like a freight train that's passed.

                         JACK
          Anyway... QB lets off this mile-
          high bomb...
          The weather's fast and erratic like this. As Jack starts
          moving towards the Drone, a heavy mist forms, shrouding
          it in grey. There's almost no sound, just Jack's feet on
          earth...

                         JACK (CONT'D)
          The thing just sails the length of
          the field.
          Victoria anxiously checks a screen, the arc of the Tet's
          "vision" still not covering Jack's location.

                         VICTORIA
          Jack I have no scope. The Tet is
          still offline.
          He pauses. A faint sound on the wind... like a whine.

                         JACK
          And at the one yard line...
          interception. Devastation. It's
          all over.

          EXT. STADIUM - CONTINUOUS

          LIGHTS connected to the ship's two AUTOMATIC GUNS reach
          from the hull of the BUBBLESHIP, backlighting JACK as he
          reaches the downed drone.

                         CONTINUED:
          THE DRONE, a spectacular piece of technology, has landed
          hard, half-buried in the sand. The basic electronics are
          still humming, cycling.

                         JACK
          But the guy's too eager. He
          starts running it back.
          Everyone's yelling "Fall down,
          just fall down!"
          Jack goes to his knees, examining it, his hands expertly
          locate an empty tube-like space on the side of the Drone.

                          JACK (CONT'D)
          Huh... The fuel-cell has been
          taken.

                         VICTORIA
          What do you mean taken? Was it a
          malfunction?
          Jack looks at the casing... beaten, pried open? He
          glances at the ground around him, the dark tunnels.
          REVERSE ANGLE. From inside a caved-in tunnel entrance,
          Jack looks small, vulnerable. Something watches Jack...

                         JACK
          No... It's a master drone, too.
          166. Looks like it was hit mid
          flight, managed to limp its way
          here. Watch my back, I'm starting
          field repair.
          INTERCUT: VICTORIA AT SKY TOWER. Glances at the arc of
          the Tet's vision - still six minutes away.

                          JACK (CONT'D)
          Bob, I'm going to need a cell.
          AT THE BUBBLESHIP. An exterior compartment opens
          revealing spare parts, etc... At the same time, a small
          ROVER, an ball-shaped independent gopher, rolls free from
          the ship, sprouting wheels...

                         VICTORIA
          Jack, you need to get out of
          there. Bring it home to the shop.
          Jack has a panel open. He pulls a lead from the sleeve
          of his suit, connects it to a board. We see FLIGHT DATA
          transfer to the Bubbleship.

           So the guy keeps running. 30, 40,
           50 yards and BAM! He gets pasted.
          Ball goes loose...

                         VICTORIA
          Jack, you know they can weaponize
          a fuel cell.
          Now a DRIVER shoots out of the tool cuff of his suit.

                         JACK

                         (STARTING WORK)
          And wouldn't you know it, Giants
          recover, start running it back.
          Total insanity.

                         VICTORIA
          I'm reading the whole central core
          off alignment, you don't have the
          necessary tools.
          Jack's got an arm and half his chest inside. He takes
          his CHEWING GUM, presses it in next to a board...
          Systems go green on Victoria's console.

                         VICTORIA (CONT'D)
          Hold on, what did you just do?

                         JACK
          (calling to the ship)
          Bob, I said I needed...
          He turns to find that the ROVER is already there, a
          DEUTERIUM FUEL CELL sitting in its payload bay.
          A SOUND now reaches Jack. Distant, an animal in pain?
          Jack listens, but it's gone. He slots the cell. A
          HUMMMM as the Drone powers up, systems coming online.
          Jack looks around at the stadium.

                         JACK (CONT'D)
          Can you imagine it? 80,000 people
          on their feet. Everyone yelling
          "Go! Go! Go!..." Touchdown...
          He sets his gun against the Drone, raises his arms,
          running in a circle, making the crowd roar sound...

                         JACK (CONT'D)
          "Yahhhhhhhhhhhhhh... ."

          INTERCUT VICTORIA: Listening to his stadium cheer sound
          over the Comm. She rests her head in her hands.
          WITH JACK. The empty ruined structure stares back.
          Reality returns, sadly...
          He reaches for the open Fuel Cell door... hesitates,
          hating what comes next... and that SOUND comes again.
          Distinctive. An animal's whimper...

          INT. STADIUM TUNNEL - MOMENTS LATER

          Jack stands at the tunnel entrance, shining a light into
          the depths. The sound is clear now, a low WHIMPERING.
          Jack makes his way down the tunnel, carefully. Ahead,
          the tunnel meets the circular tunnel that rings the
          stadium. His light plays over the silty floor, finds:
          A DOG. Starving, shivering. It COWERS in a corner.

                         JACK
          Hey there, boy. Easy...
          Jack moves forward, hand out.

                         JACK (CONT'D)
          You got nothing to be scared of,
          buddy...
          The dog suddenly SCURRIES away into the dark
          BEHIND JACK, a HUGE FORM RISES. We see GREY SKIN,
          TEETH... and Jack hears ITS HEAVY LABORED BREATH...

                         JACK (CONT'D)
          Ah, shi...
          JACK SPRINTS, full speed! The animal, A GIANT EMACIATED
          HAIRLESS BEAR, comes SURGING out of the darkness,
          lumbering after him.
          Jack TEARS back down the tunnel, the bear's form almost
          FILLING the tunnel behind him.

          EXT. STADIUM - CONTINUOUS

          We HEAR JACK before we see him. A loud "AHHHHHHHH'.!!!!"
          as Jack comes STREAKING out of the tunnel, the bear on
          his heels.

           VIEW FROM ABOVE: Jack streaks down the field, 50, 40,
          30.. The giant bear closing...
          WITH JACK. He can see the drone in front of him, the
          Fuel Cell Door still hanging open. He puts on a burst of
          speed but STUMBLES, sliding on his chest, arm
          outstretched towards the Drone as the bear LEAPS!
          He REACHES, flips the Drone's fuel cell door shut.
          Drone 166 REACTIVATES. It SURGES UP, weapons POWERING UP
          and RRRRRRRRRRRRip!! It opens up with white plasma fire
          on the bear which seems to go nova in mid air,
          disintegrating to BLACK ASH which covers Jack.
          Jack stumbles to his feet. Drone 166 NOW WHEELS ON HIM.
           Its smoking red-hot cannons inches from his face.
          JACK averts his gaze as the Drone SCANS Jack. Breathing
          hard, hating this moment. With its ganglia still hanging
          out, it doesn't seem to be processing... And then just as
          quickly, the Drone rockets up into the sky and is gone.
          Jack falls to his knees in the sand, exhausted. Only now
          realizing that Victoria has been calling his name.

                         VICTORIA
          Jesus, Jack. What the hell was
          that?
          INTERCUT VICTORIA. The Tet's scanners finally giving her
          a high-rez thermal view of Jack. Her display burning red
          from the residual plasma fire.

                         JACK

                         (SPITTING ASH)
          Call in number 166 for service up
          top. It's practically got its
          motherboard and half its
          hydraulics hanging out.
          (under his breath)
          But it still wants to kill
          everybody...

                         VICTORIA
          Jack, what happened?
          Nowtrudging to the ship:

                         JACK
          I'll see you at the house later.
          You want anything? Milk? Bread?

          thing to hear.

                         JACK
          Well if you want anybody else,
          you're out of luck.
          He boards the BUBBLESHIP.

                         VICTORIA
          We only have two more months,
          Jack. Please try to resist the
          urge to do something stupid.

                         (BEAT)
          There's no other service signals.
          Come home.
          ON VICTORIA. A relationship off balance. She wants him
          home. He wants...

                         JACK
          No...
          ON JACK. The captured Drone data right there in front of
          him on the heads-up. He's too curious.

                         JACK (CONT'D)
          That Master Drone was hit right
          over mid-town. Same area as the
          one we lost last night.

          EXT. HILLSIDE -- LATER

          JACK'S BUBBLESHIP, locked and armed, sits atop a ridge,
          against the bruised and lightning-fractured sky.
          Jack SCANS the horizon with his BINOCS, past deserted
          landscape, an early iron-framed skyscraper that came down
          semi-intact on its side. Nothing.
          He lowers the Binocs, glances upwards to where one of the
          HUGE RESOURCE GATHERERS blots out half the sky, breath-
          taking. It's hovering over what is left of a subsided
          harbor, a few blasted and rusted hulks of ships. The
          water level has dropped by a kilometer.

          At the top of the giant machine, Drones work tirelessly,
          ferrying containers of Deuterium energy up into the sky.
          Jack raises the Binocs, snaps a few photographs...

                         VICTORIA
          There's no Drone signal there.

          One day when we get to Mars,
          someone will want to know about
          this. From someone who was here.
          He stares at the HUGE columns of water draining upwards.

                         JACK (CONT'D)
          Do we have to take it all?

                         VICTORIA
          It's not doing anyone any good
          here.
          JACK nods, starts to turn away when something GLINTS on
          the horizon. He raises the Binocs, PANS to a gallows-
          like structure. He ZOOMS, but it is still unclear.

                         VICTORIA (CONT'D)
          Jack, without a signal, you're
          looking for a needle in a
          haystack. I think we've had
          enough excitement for one day.
          JACK is at the back of the Bubbleship, throwing levers.

                         JACK
          Actually I've got a bit of a
          problem with a gyro here, call you
          when I've fixed it.
          He releases a catch, pulls a WHITE RECTANGULAR CASE from
          a slot in the Bubbleship. He kneels down, hands working
          expertly, producing a full UNFOLDING MOTORCYCLE.
          As Jack locks the rear wheel in place, the bike HUMMS to
          life. He gets on and opens up the throttle, rooster-
          tailing off. The bike's electric, but it MOVES.

          JACK rides over what used to be the sea-bed, soaking up
          the thrill of catching top speed air over embankments of
          black sand. Completely carefree, enjoying himself like a
          man who is utterly and completely alone.

          EXT. SINK HOLE - DAY

          Something was here. A large metal beam has been propped
          onto rocks, stretching over... a COLLAPSED SECTION OF
          EARTH. This was the source of the light reflection.
          Jack stares down into the hole... black. He POPS a
          flare, drops it in. It comes to rest far below, next to
          the unmistakable form of a DRONE.

                         JACK
          .There you are.
          An instant of BLACK...
          And we're suddenly looking at Jack THROUGH ALIEN
          BINOCULARS. High tech, symbol readouts changing.
          Something is watching him.

          INT. SINK HOLE - DAY

          Inside the hole, looking up. A CLIMBING ROPE spills
          towards camera.
          We descend with Jack, all the way down into the hole, the
          light receding above. He touches his suit and a light
          array blazes on, illuminating the walls passing by.

          INT. LIBRARY -- DAY

          Jack drops down through what used to be a roof... into
          the READING ROOM OF THE NEW YORK PUBLIC LIBRARY. Vast,
          ruined, the far end totally collapsed, like a sky-scraper
          fell on it. He reaches the silty floor, the flare's
          burning light illuminating the room.
          He STARES at the expanse of SHELVES that line the walls,
          stripped and empty. Wonder... and disappointment.
          He turns to his task, kneels by the Drone. The thing's a
          wreck. A METAL SHAFT protrudes from a crease. Jack
          marvels at the accuracy of the shot...
          He carefully reaches out, slides the fuel cell door open.
          Again, the FUEL CELL is missing.

                         JACK
          Vika, you're not going to
          believe...
          WHITE NOISE on the comm. There's no signal down here.

          EXT. HILLSIDE -- CONTINUOUS

          The static BUBBLESHIP sits inert.

           VICTORIA ON THE COMM
          Jack? Jack... ?

          INT. SKY TOWER, CONTROL STATION - CONTINUOUS

          Victoria, worried. Finally, she turns to the TET COMM.
          A station reserved for high-tech, long-range
          communication with the home base. A STATUS indicator,
          and a screen for text communication.

          TET COMM STATUS: "COMMUNICATION ENABLED."

                         VICTORIA
          Mission, this is Lieutenant
          Victoria Kohl, requesting Drone
          intercept at coordinates sending
          now.
          Her AUDIO goes through a SCRAMBLING PROCESS, then is
          uploaded where a few seconds later its receipt is
          acknowledged: STATUS: "APPROVED."
          She stares up at the map, sees one of the Drones turn
          towards Jack's location. She settles back, watching.

          INT. LIBRARY - DAY

          JACK looks up and sees how the Drone was brought down:
          above it is a twisted tangle of chain-mesh and cables
          strung between two structures, a DRONE TRAP.
          MOVEMENT FROM THE DARKNESS. Jack spins, his gun coming
          off his back in a fluid motion. Just the empty cavern,
          the wreckage at the end.
          Jack squints at... a wall of books on the shelves beyond
          the wreckage.

                         JACK
          .Jackpot.

          16.

                         CONTINUED:
          He steps forward... ALMOST FALLS INTO A GIANT HOLE!
          He raises the flare off the ground, illuminating a void
          where the entire floor has imploded down seven more
          stories. What's left is a PIT, with a building-sized ton
          of twisted metal hanging over it...
          A single bent GIRDER still spans the hole. Jack tracks
          the possibilities... steps out onto the girder. He
          reaches up to the suspended wreckage to balance...
          IT SHIFTS! A hundred tons of twisted metal just moved an
          inch above him. Best leave that alone...
          He balances, inching across this metal tightrope.
          Finally reaching the other side...

          AT THE FAR SHELVES
          Jack approaches the wall of books, hundred of them. He
          kneels, lifts one, blows dust off the cover: "THE

          EDUCATION OF HENRY ADAMS."
          He steps back, admiring it... SNAP! A BEAR TRAP hidden
          in the debris closes around his leg, piercing armor and
          flesh. Jack has a second to process and a cable rises
          from the debris, goes taught!
          JACK is dragged through the dust inhumanly FAST, headed
          towards a darkened alcove. He activates a LASER CUTTER
          on his cuff, slices through the cable which WHIPS AWAY as
          he brings his rifle up, FIRES rounds into the darkness.
          INHUMAN SCREAMS. Half animal, half electronic.
          Something's in pain, but not retreating, CLOSING ON HIM.
          Jack SLICES DOWN, cutting loose the claw, and RUNS FOR IT
          back towards the HOLE as his girder is yanked away in
          front of him, pulled into the void below.
          Jack doesn't slow, reaches the edge, LEAPS!
          A moment, Jack hanging in space, gravity clawing at him,
          falling... SLAMMING into the far side. For a moment
          dangling over the fall, then Jack hauls himself over the
          far side.
          ALIEN FORMS emerge from recesses. We get glimpses of
          feathers, oily flesh, metal... They CLOSE as he reaches
          his line, clips in and RISES automatically, the suit
          riding the line up at neck-snapping speed...

                         (CONTINUED)

                         

                         

                         

                         

          17.

                         CONTINUED: ( 2)
          ABOVE. The line trembles under his weight and stress...
          A KNIFE, improvised from bone and sheet metal, enters the
          frame and CUTS THE LINE.
          Jack has a second to feel the slack hit. And then he's
          FALLING... IMPACTS the ground. Can't get his air.
          Staggering wildly to his feet, FORMS CLOSING...
          Suddenly a DRONE blasts down through the ceiling hole.
          Its lights turning night to day, its cannons FIRING.
          In the STROBING FLASH of canon fire, we see SCAVS
          INCINERATED. Metal and hair fry to ASH as the insect-
          like creatures SCREAM!! Other shots IMPACT WALLS. Fire
          and plaster dust fills the space.
          Jack shields himself from the debris as the Drone ceases
          firing, WHIRLS on Jack. The same awful moment as it
          SCANS him.
          Then it lifts away, is gone as quickly as it arrived.
          And with its departure, the darkness comes again.
          Silence, whatever was here is now gone.
          Jack takes in the destruction for a hard beat: The ash
          of an alien, burning paper twisting in the air. He looks
          up towards the light above. A long ways above.

          EXT. SINK HOLE - LATER

          Jack appears, dirty-faced, filthy and frustrated,
          crawling, lugging his own weight up through the sink
          hole. Finally back to the surface.
          He shakes himself off... notices his bike has been taken.

                         JACK

                         (AD-LIBBING

                         EXPLETIVES)
          That was my bike!!
          He kicks at the dust, the rocks, curses at the pain as
          he's reminded of his injured leg. He stares at the long
          walk ahead, the wall of wind and rain that now hits him,
          soaking him. He starts walking.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          18.

          EXT. BUBBLESHIP - DUSK

          The debris in the air makes for spectacular sunsets.
          Jack's Bubbleship bursts from the low clouds, carrying
          Jack home after the long day. We see the "PLANETARY
          RING" formed by the rubble from the destroyed moon.

          INT. BUBBLESHIP - CONTINUOUS

          Jack marvels at the ring, thoughtful. But then checks
          his read-outs. Victoria knows what he's looking for.

                         VICTORIA
          Check your seven.
          Jack touches his controls and the Bubbleship Canopy
          REVOLVES so Jack's facing away from the direction he's
          traveling in.
          Low on the HORIZON, the TET floats in the sky. It's
          setting, glows a dull orange, like a Harvest Moon.
          INTERCUT VICTORIA. She's leaning back in her command
          chair, her feet propped on the console, also staring out
          at the Tet. Strangely quiet.
          In Jack's face a curious mixture of nostalgia, and
          confusion... This small metal planet is his home.

                         JACK
          Goodnight, folks... See you back
          here tomorrow. Same time, same
          channel...
          He punches the throttle, and screams across the tops of
          the clouds through the beautiful light, arriving at...

          EXT. SKY TOWER, LANDING PAD - CONTINUOUS

          The GLASS walls of the SKY TOWER reflect the Bubbleship
          as it lands. HOOKS catch the landing rockers of the
          BUBBLESHIP and lock it down against the buffeting wind.

          INT. SHOWER - DUSK

          Jack drops the last piece of his environment suit. He
          touches a button and warm water sprays down. Through the
          glass, he can see Victoria inside the Sky Tower. She
          nods at him, a tense welcome home. He nods back. There
          is no privacy in the Sky Tower.

                         (CONTINUED)

                         

                         

                         

                         

          19.

                         CONTINUED:
          As the glass walls go opaque with steam, he closes his
          eyes, the water running over his face. POPS OF MEMORIES
          go through his imagination:
          SKY TOWER. Early in their tour, Victoria girlishly jumps
          on the sofa with a pint of ice cream, laughing.
          BEDROOM. Also early. Jack watches Victoria sleep,
          brushes hair from her face, affectionate...
          And the memory... SEEMS TO DISTORT. Suddenly becoming:
          THE NEW YORK SKYLINE, seen through a cheap telescope.
          Jack, pulling away from the telescope, happy, turning
          to... A BRUNETTE WOMAN, staring back at him.
          Jack STARTS, snapping out of the memory.

          INT. SKY TOWER, STORAGE AREA - DUSK

          Rows and rows of shelves, mainly empty now. Jack and
          Victoria have gone through almost all of what they needed
          for a 5-year tour. Jack grabs a container of water.

          INT. SKY TOWER, READY ROOM - MOMENTS LATER

          Jack starts to hang up his workman's suit, pauses to
          stare at the photo of a younger him and Victoria on the
          Tet. They look so eager, so innocent.
          He shifts slightly to where he can see out to the Tet
          itself, sinking below the horizon.

          INT. SKY TOWER 2, WORK AREA - DUSK

          The area is devoted to DRONE REPAIR. Lifts, parts,
          shelves, odds and ends of gear and weaponry, tables of
          tools, a written-off DRONE at the back.
           Jack comes in, glances at his newest arrival, the self-
          beached DRONE 166. Even deactivated, it looks like
           trouble, like pure evil.
          He opens a drawer, slips THE EDUCATION OF HENRY ADAMS
          into the drawer, shuts it.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          20.

          INT. SKY TOWER, LIVING AREA - DUSK

          We finally see the whole thing. It couldn't be more
          comfortable, although it continually vibrates in the
          wind: VICTORIA is sitting, reading her own work notes.
          In the background, Chaplin's "Modern Times" plays
          silently on a large screen.
          JACK goes up behind her and kisses her on the head.

                         VICTORIA
          (not looking at him)
          You're not supposed to bring up
          surface items.
          JACK sips water, then waits even longer before...

                         JACK
          No. I'm not supposed to bring
          them in the house.
          He's right. He exchanges his water for a glass of
          something stronger, and goes and sits down.

                         VICTORIA
          I tried to reach you earlier...
          If we're going to be an effective

                         TEAM --

                         JACK
          You're right.

                         VICTORIA
          Then you can't just --
          Jack leaps up, only to return a second later with a small
          bundle held together by an old rag. He hands it to her,
          pleased, watching her reaction.
          She opens it to reveal a small GREEN SEEDLING in a pocket
          of fresh, rich soil. Her eyes play over it...

                         VICTORIA (CONT'D)
          Where did you find this?

                         JACK
          Ah-ha. So it's okay when I bring
          you something. But if I --
          She MOVES suddenly, opening one of the glass doors of the
          Sky Tower and heading outside where she holds the
          seedling away from her body, off the edge, lets it drop.

                         (CONTINUED)

                         

                         

                         

                         

          21.

                         CONTINUED:
          She comes back in, washes her hands in the sink, upset.

                         JACK (CONT'D)
          Was that really necessary?

                         VICTORIA
          I know you think I'm a stickler
          for the rules, but you have no
          idea what sort of toxins could be
          in something like that.
          He chuckles...

                         VICTORIA (CONT'D)
          I'm sorry, I don't think it's
          funny.

                         JACK
          It was just a plant, Victoria.

                         VICTORIA
          That's not the point. We have two
          more months and the last thing we
          need is you putting it all at
          risk.
          He shakes his head, grimaces as he limps away.

                         VICTORIA (CONT'D)

                         (CONCERNED)
          You're hurt. What happened?
          He admits it with a glance, offers no explanation. She
          comes over to him, examines the wound professionally.

                         VICTORIA (CONT'D)
          Come on.

          TNT. INFIRMARY BAY - DUSK
          It is tiny, but state of the art. VICTORIA seriously
          examines his wound, cleaning it out. It's no small wound
          but they're less concerned than we would be.
          Victoria pulls on gloves, opens cabinet and removes a
          watery substance as well as a small electronic wand. She
          smears the substance onto his wound, a HEALANT.

                         VICTORIA
          This is gonna pinch a little...

                         (CONTINUED)

                         CONTINUED:

                         JACK
          Hit me.
          She activates the wand, shines ultra violet light onto
          the substance. A beat, then he BENDS OVER in pain.
          Through the healant we see the FLESH begin to knit and
          repair. Skin and sinew literally regenerating... to new.

                         VICTORIA

                         (AFFECTIONATE)
          Serves you right.
          She kisses him on the forehead, turns away.

          INT. SKY TOWER, DINING ROOM - LATER

          Wine is involved, candles. Victoria is mellower, much.
          This is a couple who knows each other's differences and
          admires them. This isn't an argument.

                         VICTORIA
          .I'm not saying you can't go
          into your caverns, I'm saying we
          have a job and if I'm trying to
          reach you and you're off on one of
          your adventures --

                         JACK
          Look, they trained me to fix
          drones. That's my job, I get
          that. But it's not what I am. I
          can't simply do the same thing
          over and over again, every day,
          with that... world down there.
          (toasts the sky)
          And if mission has a better Drone
          tech, they can get him to baby-
          sit.
          He gets up, tries out his leg. Stiff, but healed.

                         VICTORIA
          It's only a little while longer.
          The Gatherer's have collected most
          of the resources we need for Mars.
          Pretty soon --

                         JACK
          Pretty soon, there won't be
          anything left down there. No more

          So forgive me if I want to enjoy
          it a little before the end.

                         VICTORIA
          You act like there's not a war
          going on down there but there is
          and we can't leave even two of
          those things alive...

                         (NO RESPONSE)
          Dammit, Jack. They nearly killed
          you today.
          They eat in silence for a moment, then:

                         JACK
          Actually, it was like they were
          trying to... catch me.
          (trying to joke)
          Guess I look tasty.
          He goes over to her, puts his arms around her.

                         VICTORIA
          Please be careful. If they get to
          you, what happens to me?
          JACK puts a finger to her lips, then kisses her.

                         VICTORIA (CONT'D)
          Answer the question.
          Jack considers this. Then he pulls his shirt off over
          his head. For sex?

                         VICTORIA (CONT'D)

          Come on.

          EXT. SWIMMING POOL - NIGHT

          Talk about an infinity pool. The pool is miles in the
          sky, with a glass bottom. The cold wind is constant
          overhead but heaters flare with the changes in
          temperature, compensating.
          Jack glides graceful underwater, his nude form
          silhouetted against the roiling dark clouds below. He
          surfaces near Victoria, who's stayed dressed on the edge
          with a glass of wine.

          He kisses her, steals a sip of her wine, then pushes back
          into the water, looking up at the stars, the streaming
          moon-rubble above.

                         VICTORIA
          Can you imagine when we go back
          up? Having a face to face
          conversation again? I can't
          believe it's finally ending.

                         (TOASTING HIM)
          We made it.
          Jack looks away...

                         JACK
          It's not so bad down here. They
          certainly don't have anything like
          this.

                         VICTORIA
          I wonder what duty I would have
          pulled. Probably programming the
          Mars boats.

                         JACK
          I'd have been overhauling the zero-
          G toilets.

                         (SHE LAUGHS)
          I'm serious, it's dangerous work.
          I mean, you think you have control
          of the situation.
          He swims closer. She smiles, he presses on.

                         JACK (CONT'D)
          But then you realize, there are
          some things that were never
          supposed to happen in zero G.

                         VICTORIA
          Stop!

                         JACK
          It's awful. Just thinking about
          it, I get afraid...
          She LAUGHS, reaches for her wine, accidentally knocks the
          glass which tips over, and rolls right off the Sky Tower.
          They watch it disappear into the darkness below.

                         JACK (CONT'D)

          (watches water fall
          from her hand)
          I can't remember zero gravity.
          Physically. Can you?

                         JACK
          Here, let me show you...
          He reaches up PULLS her into the pool. She screams,
          laughing as she goes in. She surfaces, pulling her
          soaking shirt over her head and tossing it to the side.

                         VICTORIA
          I should have seen that coming.
          Jack smiles, then takes a breath and goes under. He
          floats face-down, staring through the bottom of the pool
          into the lightening-stung clouds below...
          .and then Victoria's form glides underneath him,
          looking up at him, smiling. She stops moving and her
          body rises towards his. He opens his arms, and she
          floats up and against him. They embrace, kiss...
          Two bodies, intertwined underwater, a thousand feet above
          a roiling thunderstorm.
          Their lips part, he pulls back to look at her ...
          But it's the BRUNETTE WOMAN who stares back at him!!

          INT. SKY TOWER, BEDROOM -- LATE NIGHT

          Jack wakes, breathless, troubled. He doesn't know this
          woman who invades his dreams...
          Next to him, Victoria lies asleep, curled in the sheets.
          Shaken, he quietly gets up, grabs clothes... and goes
          where he goes when Victoria is asleep...

          INT. SKY TOWER, WORKSHOP AREA - NIGHT

          Jack moves to a BENCH where he keeps his finds... a few
          coins, a watch, a pistol, a snow globe showing the
          Nativity. A book: THE LAYS OF ANCIENT ROME.
          JACK produces his newest find from the library: THE
          EDUCATION OF HENRY ADAMS. He opens it.

          TNT. SKY TOWER, COMAND CENTER - LATE NIGHT
          The console sits inert, unattended. Suddenly, a BLIP
          radiates on the MAP, its origin elsewhere. A signal.

          EXT. DEEP SPACE - NO TIME

          A NASA SHUTTLE floats in deep space, a recognizable
          design from our time.

          INT. SPACE SHUTTLE - NO TIME

          Empty, dark. Frozen crystalline dust hangs in the air.
          The ship is dead.
          Suddenly a panel "blips" on. Other systems go active.
          The ship is waking up. There's a VISIBLE RUMBLE as the
          engines prime...
          FURTHER BACK, in the hold. ROWS OF DELTA SLEEP PODS. We
          close on one...

          AND THE SHUTTLE'S GIANT ENGINES ERUPT IN FIRE.

          INT. SKY TOWER, BEDROOM - MORNING

          Jack's eyes blink open, waking from another dream. He
          sits up, troubled.

          EXT. SKY TOWER - DAWN

          Victoria works in her GARDEN. She grows perfect,
          blemishless ROSES. The roof is open to the sky.
          Victoria makes a small depression in the earth, taps
          three seeds out of a labeled envelope.

          Don't go out today until we get a
          signal.
          Jack looks back. She's never said this before. She's
          genuinely worried.

                         JACK
          .Then what would you say in your
          report?
          Victoria looks away, stuck.

          unless I'm already out there. You
          know that.
          He turns, disappears through the glass mechanical doors.

          EXT. SKY TOWER - MOMENTS LATER

          JACK suits up and gets into the bubbleship and for the
          first time we see the startup procedure.

                         JACK
          One, Two, Three. Jack Harper.
          Lights sparkle across the board. Activation sounds.
          Jack hits switches. Outside, protective barriers lower.
          The stratospheric wind VIBRATES the bubbleship.

          He waves, blows the chocks. The WIND whipping off the
          tops of the clouds instantly grabs the ship, HURTLES it
          into the void.
          WITH JACK, just letting the wind twist him and the ship
          in freefall. Loving this feeling.

          Victoria takes a sip of coffee, turns to another task,
          when again a BLIP on her map pulls Victoria's attention
          back. That signal, radiating near Jack's position.
          She swipes up a grid, intensifies her sensors...

          EXT. WATERFALL - DAY

          Jack's ship skims over the surface of a deep pool of
          water. Up ahead, a waterfall explodes its force into the
          pool, spray and mist already reaching the Bubbleship.

                         JACK
          All right, I'm coming up to the
          location.
          Jack begins flying slowly up the twelve hundred foot wall
          of falling water which almost seems to conceal a Petra
          behind its veil. Jack reaches the top...
          JACK'S POV - THE SPIRE AND OBSERVATIONAL DECK of the
          EMPIRE STATE BUILDING, now part of a cliff, set in
          shifted sea-bed, a gushing river pouring past.

          EXT. OBSERVATION DECK - MOMENTS LATER

          Jack lands and gets out of the craft, grabbing his weapon
          and Yankees cap as he does. He looks around, half
          nervous, half in awe that the old girl is still standing.

                         JACK
          (under his breath)
          New York, New York... It's a
          wonderful town. The Bronx is up,
          and the Battery's down...
          He can hear nothing over the wind and the water. He
          moves to the balcony edge, looks "downtown" at the sunken
          city. A Venice set in a matrice of rubble and sea-bed.

          sense of Deja-Vu...

                         VICTORIA
          Jack, you're right on top of it.
          What do you see?
          Jack starts a circuit of the deck. A pile of old deck
          chairs in his way, he pushes at them with his foot...
          finds a WIRE, running below them, linked to two CAR
          BATTERIES, hidden under the rubbish.
          He traces the path of the wire... up.

          EXT. TOP OF THE ESB ANTENAE - LATER

          JACK has made an arduous climb to discover a TRANSMITTER,
          hooked to an old MILITARY REPEATER, and both hooked to...
          we look up as Jack does... the RUSTED, DAMAGED, ESB
          Antenna atop the building.

                         JACK
          Bob, give me audible on this
          signal.
          Almost immediately from the Bubbleship comes the
          intermittent electronic SQUACK of the signal.

          EXT. OBSERVATION DECK - MOMENTS LATER

          At the bubbleship, Jack watches the frequency analysis of
          the signal play on his heads-up. He touches the screen
          and the signal goes quiet.

                         VICTORIA
          What did you find?

                         JACK
          It's an old radio system. It's
          been reactivated.

          the whole territory. You need to
          blow the structure.

          It's ancient history, Jack. You

          He pulls several CHARGES from the Bubbleship's storage,
          starts to set them...
          He pauses, staring at the railing, the old telescope.
          Change of plans. He walks towards the batteries, a blade
          sliding out of the cuff of his suit. He reaches them and
          SEVERS the lines. The signal dies.

          EXT. OBSERVATION DECK - MOMENTS LATER

          The Bubbleship lifts off. Jack can't help staring down
          at the Observation Deck as the ship lifts into the air.

          TNT. BUBBLESHIP - DAY
          Jack is in the air, troubled. Up ahead in the distance
          we see a LARGE NATURAL RIDGE. Some instruments light up.

                         VICTORIA
          Check your course, you're headed
          right at the border.

                         JACK
          Yeah, I may have seen another
          drone trap...

                         INTERCUT VICTORIA
          She checks her map. Jack's Bubbleship is headed straight
          at a large red swath of territory marked out, toxic
          radiation levels constantly monitored.
          A small ALARM goes off in the Bubbleship cabin.

                         VICTORIA
          You're at the edge of range, Jack.
          You're starting to break up.

          It's okay --

                         VICTORIA

                         (SERIOUS)
          No, it's not okay. You get in too
          close that radiation --

                         JACK
          -- will cook me from the inside
          before I know it. Don't worry,
          I'm still more than five clicks
          from the beacons...
          IN THE BUBBLESHIP. A BIGGER ALARM goes off, Red skull-
          and-crossbones flash across the heads-up. Jack DIVES the
          ship, down over huge rocky outcroppings.
          Jack, intent on piloting. Static. Some GARBLED SOUNDS.
          Victoria's voice barely coming through.

                         VICTORIA
          What are -- you ---- out there
          Jack?
          The signal goes to pure static as Jack steers into a
          steep canyon, rock on all sides. Barely room to squeeze,
          but Jack's not worried. This is all familiar.

                         JACK
          That's right, Bob. You know where
          we're going.

          INT. SKY TOWER, CONTROL STATION - CONTINUOUS

          Victoria stares at the screen, static hiss low and empty.
          It's not the first time he's done this, but she hates it
          every time.

                         VICTORIA
          Jack...?
          Victoria works the panel, upping signal, boosting
          reception. The static is again MIXED WITH GARBLED
          SOUNDS. She listens, confused, ups the volume...
          BLIP! That signal from the Empire State starts again.
          This time it LOCKS ON, a loud and continuous electronic
          pattern.

          EXT. CRATER LAKE - DAY

          JACK's ship emerges from a canyon into a beautiful
          landscape we have never seen before. This is Jack's
          SECRET PLACE. TREES exist on an island surrounded by
          clean water.
          And near the shore, a GROTTO, a carved-out portion of the
          hillside, supported with scavenged timbers, protected by
          plastic tarps. A ton of gear is piled inside. JACK has
          been scavenging for a long time.
          The BUBBLESHIP lands. JACK walks into the structure,
          slapping on a relay from a SOLAR GENERATOR. All around
          are young growing plants, including small yellow flowers
          and their GREEN SEEDLINGS -- the same Jack gave to Vika.
          Jack kneels down by an old military JAMMER. He checks a
          screen: the Crater Lake location is being jammed.

          INT_SKY TOWER, CONTROL STATION - DAY
          Victoria sits, the repetitive audio of the signal playing
          from her console. She stares at the empty map, the
          notable absence of the Bubbleship's icon on it. She keys
          the Comm, one last time.

                         VICTORIA
          Jack? Jack, I really need you
          online...

          EXT. CRATER LAKE - DAY

          A RECORD PLAYER is taped into his solar power system. An
          EARLY METAL POWER-BALLAD floats out of the speakers.
          Jack has a basketball hoop lashed to a pole. He shoots
          hoops by himself, the ROVER retrieves the ball.
          LATER. Jack brings a single CHAIR out in front of the
          water. He sits, and with care produces the books he's
          brought with him. He opens one with burnt edges:

          TREASURE ISLAND.
          .I remember him as if it were yesterday,
          as he came plodding to the inn door, his
          sea-chest following behind him in a hand-
          barrow...
          JACK is in an obscure state of frustration. He lifts
          another book, THE LAYS OF ANCIENT ROME:

          Jack closes the books, strangely unsatisfied...

          Will communicate findings on next
          Tet cycle. Understood.
          Victoria clocks off. Stares at the border area on the
          map where she last saw Jack.
          A KLAXON goes off in her workspace. Victoria STARTS. For
          the first time she seems confused as she works the
          console. She can't immediately figure it out...
          Suddenly she brings up a WIDE SCAN for tracking the Tet,
          The whole Eastern Coast of the continent. And something
          is closing, coming over the poles, FAST.

          ON VICTORIA...

          EXT. CRATER LAKE - DAY

          Jack folds the page of his book, stuffs it in his cargo
          pocket and walks down to the water sparkling over stones.
          Motion catches his attention. It's the ROVER,
          approaching with the basketball.

                         JACK
          So, um... Victoria.
          The ROVER shifts, confused.

                         JACK (CONT'D)
          I was thinking, when our tour is
          up, maybe we'd stay. We could put
          in for another -- Wait, wait.
          Stop yelling. Hear me out. No,
          don't throw that, that's a...
          The ROVER turns around. Jack smiles at the poor
          machine's confusion. The smile dying... this is serious.

                         JACK (CONT'D)
          Maybe you should go, and I should
          stay...

          He's spoken the words. He lies back on the bank, looks
          at the clouds rolling overhead.

                         JACK (CONT'D)

          JACK's eyes snap open. It is much later in the day. He

          SOMETHING... something desperate...

          BOOM!
          What appears to be A METEOR streaks across the sky,
          leaving a trail of flame and white smoke.
          Jack grabs his binocs and traces the meteor path...
          resolves it just barely as the shuttle, crashing down.
          It disappears over a rise, a beat, then a FIERY

          EXPLOSION.

          A MOUNTAINOUS AREA of what was once sea-bed. Smoky
          orange fire blows across the ruined landscape. A fire in
          a dust storm. A GUST now reveals...
          The crashed NASA space shuttle, with the name ODYSSEY on
          its fractured hull.

          Vika works her displays, scanning, wanting to keep him
          safe. The wreckage has strewn out thousands of flaming
          pieces of debris, all which register heat signatures.

          This thing is ancient, one of the
          old pre-war shuttles.
          JACK'S POV - THE WRECKAGE. The ship's guts are strewn
          across the earth. Several pod-like canisters strewn
          around, more fixed into the burning wreckage.

          JACK TOUCHES DOWN, rolling out of his Bubbleship even
          before it's settled. He heads straight into the burning
          wreckage, into hell. Heat SEARING his eyes, disorienting
          him. All around metal POPS and GROANS as it distends.
           He moves through metal panels, dodging flames and burning
          debris -- searching wildly.
          Jack sees what looks like a SURVIVOR! HAULS it over to
          discover it's only an empty NASA jumpsuit. But beyond
          that... A DELTA-SLEEP POD, split wide open. Its
          interior EMPTY. Jack moves on, finds another POD,
          presses his face against the glass...
          A HUMAN FACE on the other side. A MAN, sleeping...
          A FUEL EXPLOSION plumes into the dark sky. Jack STUMBLES
          ON, tracks another pod literally ON FIRE. Beyond that, a
          whole portion of the ship is semi-intact, the hull ripped
          lengthwise. Jack tracks a burnished STEEL CYLINDER with
          radioactive markings, locked in strong moorings...
          And near that, another POD, still locked in the ship's
          wall. Jack moves to it, wiping away soot and grime,
          pressing his face close and sees her...

          .THE BRUNETTE WOMAN FROM HIS DREAMS.
          She's asleep, her face lit by moving firelight. JACK is
          stunned. Eyes dart to readouts: She's alive.
          ON JACK. Confused, amazed, moved. He puts a hand out,
          towards the glass of the pod...

                         OKAY
          SVUNK! SVUNK! Behind Jack, plasma rounds impact the Pod

          NO! 1!
          Cannon fire erupts all around him! TWO DRONES settle on
          the site, their weapons kicking out energy, locking on
          and destroying Pods...

                         JACK (CONT'D)
          NO! NO! They're firing on the
          ship. Vika, it's one of ours.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          40.

          INT. SKY TOWER, CONTROL STATION - CONTINUOUS

          Victoria stares at her screens, perhaps for the first
          time in her life, frozen. Jack's voice blares over
          speakers.

                         JACK
          There are people here, and they're
          killing them!
          Victoria opens her mouth to respond. She can't.

          EXT. CRASH SITE - CONTINUOUS

          A Drone passes right over Jack, locks into position,
          lining its cannons on the Pod with the WOMAN in it...
          Jack moves between the Drone and the Pod. The Drone
          hesitates...
          SCANS him. Weapons literally red hot from
          repeated fire.
          The Drone SHIFTS AGAIN, FAST, looking for its shot. Jack
          counters, keeping his body between the Drone and the Pod.

                         JACK
          Get out of here! Go away! Get!
          A moment of insane bravado, Jack un-shoulders his weapon,
          strafes the Drone with gunfire which knocks it back.
          It re-centers, weapons chugging with energy.
          INTERCUT VICTORIA. Staring at the feeds. A screen
          catching a half-image of Jack firing at the Drone. She's
          absolutely still, holding her breath...
          Jack stares at the Drone, at certain death.

                         JACK (CONT'D)
          Well, what the hell are you
          waiting for? GO ON!
          And suddenly, the Drone moves on, Canons live, searching
          on into the wreckage, annihilating other Pods.
          ON JACK, chest heaving...
          An instant of BLACK, shuttering back to:
          CROSS-HAIR POV: We suddenly see Jack through CROSS-
          HAIRS, tracking him as he shields the Delta Pod with his
          body, dragging it towards the Bubbleship...

          41.

                         CONTINUED:
          A high-tech, high-powered RIFLE rests in two alien-
          armored hands. Like a metal-coated insect tarsus (barbed
          feet of a fly). The alien begins to depress the
          trigger... Then another tarsus presses the barrel down.
          Don't. Don't fire.
          SHIFTING OVER: Close on an ALIEN. Our first real look,
          still too close to truly comprehend. Thick stubbled hair
          armored with metal, bones; A head-dress of authority.
          Behind layers of dusted cracked goggles, the older alien
          eye... blinks.

          EXT. CRASH SITE - CONTINUOUS

          JACK reaches the Bubbleship, heaves the Delta Pod onto
          the carrier which immediately secures it with armatures
          designed to carry damaged drones.
          JACK steals another look at the sleeping face of the
          WOMAN. He touches the glass, wiping away soot and dust.

                         JACK
          It's you...

          SEEN FROM FAR AWAY
          The Bubbleship flies up and up, The DELTA SLEEP POD
          securely hanging from its belly, carrying Jack and this
          mysterious woman away into the evening sky.

          EXT. SKY TOWER, BUBBLESHIP PAD - SUNSET

          The WIND is wild and brutal. As the Bubbleship touches
          down, CLAMPS snap on the landing skids.
          Jack is in motion, bursting out of the ship. He glances
          up. Victoria stands behind the glass of the Sky Tower
          living room, staring at him.
          THUNK. He releases the armature. HAULS the Pod with him
          towards the house. HAMMERS ON THE GLASS.

                         JACK
          Open it!
          Victoria obeys, opens the glass doors. WIND fills the
          living room as Jack hauls the Pod in. Then Victoria
          touches a control and the walls SEAL.

                         JACK (CONT'D)
          The drones tried to kill her.
          They destroyed the other
          survivors.

                         VICTORIA

                         (RATIONALIZING)
          Well it didn't recognize her.
          It's machinery. It's programmed

                         MACHINERY --

                         JACK
          She came off a NASA shuttle. The
          drones were specifically targeting
          the pods --

                         VICTORIA
          I don't know what the machinery
          did or didn't do. There's
          protocol...

                         JACK
          Protocol? Protocol?! Who's the
          machinery now, Victoria?
          VICTORIA stares at him. Then retreats from the question
          into the task at hand. She kneels by the Pod.

                         VICTORIA
          Go get the cutter, and a breather,
          and my big bag. Now. The Pod's
          been damaged, she's not doing
          well, let's get her out of there.
          Jack moves. Victoria, almost holds back, but...

                         VICTORIA (CONT'D)
          .This has to be reported.
          HE SPINS. Stares at her. Really angry.

                         JACK
          I know it does. And when we
          report it, we'll also report that
          drones slaughtered the other human
          survivors from one of our ships.
          See what they make of that.
          He goes for the equipment. Victoria stares at the
          woman's face, deeply unsettled...
          Jack returns with Victoria's bag, and firing up a CUTTER.

                         (CONTINUED)

                         

                         

                         

                         

          43.

                         CONTINUED: ( 2)

                         VICTORIA
          Right there, be careful...
          Jack directs the blue arc towards a seal. The Pod
          depressurizes with a sudden exhale of dead air. Jack
          pulls back the pod door.
          Inside, the woman lies in a gauzy sleep suit. Her hair
          is matted. Her body looks frail, her skin translucent,
          veins dark, lips blue, like a drowning victim.
          Vika pulls her feeding tube, takes her pulse, checks her
          eyes, lifting the lids.

                         VICTORIA (CONT'D)
          Lift her up, we have to get some
          air into her.
          JACK gets his arms around the woman, pulling her upwards.
          FLUID seeps from her mouth...
          And suddenly she's ALIVE, COUGHING, spewing fluid across
          Jack and the floor. He sets her down as she painfully
          wretches, then SUCKS IN AIR. Her eyes flutter open.
          She's suddenly violently ill again. Instinctively, Jack
          goes to hold her --

                          VICTORIA (CONT'D)

                         (PROFESSIONAL)
          No. Don't. Let her get the fluid
          out.
          The woman stops heaving. Looks up at both of them...
          She tries to stand, disoriented by the glass walls, the
          infinite vertigo that surrounds them. She falls to her
          knees and stares with amazement down into the clouds.
          Jack kneels beside her, puts a hand on her shoulder.

                         JACK
          You're safe. You're in a
          skytower, on Earth.

                         WOMAN
          .Jack.
          Victoria gives a sharp look at Jack. He's stunned.
          Now completely exhausted, the woman SLUMPS into
          unconsciousness. Jack catches her. Victoria comes
          close, slides an oxygen breather mask over her face.

                         VICTORIA
          We need to get her cleaned up.

          INT. SHOWER - MOMENTS LATER

          A bizarre and almost beautiful tableau: ALL THREE
          together under the water, Jack holding the unconscious
          Woman like a child. The warm water spraying over their
          three forms, soaking the woman's gauzy suit which clings
          to her body. Water running across Jack and Victoria's
          faces, their open eyes, locked on each other.
          The water finally stops.

                         VICTORIA
          We have to get her up to the Tet.

                         JACK
          I know.

                         VICTORIA
          I don't have the facilities here.
          Once she's stable...

                         JACK
          I know.
          The glass door slides open behind them. Neither move.

                         VICTORIA
          What's going on?
          He shakes his head. He has no idea.

          INT. INFIRMARY BAY - LATER

          The WOMAN lies in a bed. VICTORIA checks her readouts,
          adjusts her UV drip. She glances over her and realizes
          that the woman's eyes are open, staring at her.
          Beat. Victoria turns, offers the woman some water.

                         VICTORIA
          Here. Drink this. You're
          dehydrated... You've been in a
          very bad crash. Your ship came
          down.
          This DISTURBS the woman. She tries to sit up.

                         WOMAN
          What about the others? How did
          you get out?

                         VICTORIA
          What's your name?

                         WOMAN
          .Julia. Julia.
          The woman, JULIA, sinks back down, exhausted.

                         VICTORIA
          You need to rest quietly. You've
          been in delta sleep for a long
          time.

                         JULIA
          How long...?

                         VICTORIA
          Best guess? About 65 years.
          Julia takes that in...

                         JULIA
          Where's Jack...?
          Julia STARTS. Looks down at her arm where Victoria has
          just slid a needle under her skin. She stares at her,
          almost afraid. Victoria depresses the plunger.

                         VICTORIA
          Shhhhhh...

          EXT. SKY TOWER - NIGHT

          SEEN FROM AFAR. The Sky Tower a lonely refuge in a
          roiling storm, turning on its axis, like a weather-vane
          And we PLUNGE DOWN. Down and down, to the base of the
          SKYTOWER, to see...

          EXT. SKY TOWER BASE - NIGHT

          AN ALIEN, battered by wind, rags blowing, raises its mask
          to the sky. Looking up towards the tower. It wears the
          DISTINCTIVE HEAD-DRESS that we have seen before.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          46 ,

          INT. SKY TOWER, DINING AREA - NIGHT

          Victoria is very subdued, poking at food. Both very
          aware of the woman sleeping in the infirmary.

                         VICTORIA
          Tomorrow, I'll report that we have
          her.
          Jack nods, but won't look at her. Deep in thought.

                         VICTORIA (CONT'D)
          Jack...

                         (BEAT)
          What do you want from me, Jack?
          This isn't just a Shakespeare
          Sonnet, a buffalo nickel, some
          vase...

                         JACK
          It's a Greek funeral vase. Which
          I want my ashes in, incidentally.
          Victoria collects the dishes, heads for the kitchen.

                         JACK (CONT'D)
          I just think we need to know why.

                         VICTORIA
          Jack, please. This isn't why
          we're here. This is just what we
          have to do before our real lives
          begin. We've given them five
          years and now we get to go home.

                         (BEAT)
          So just leave this alone. It's
          not our job.

                         JACK
          And what if I can't?
          They stare at each other, each obscurely frightened.

          EXT. INFIRMARY - NIGHT

          Julia sleeps, a mask taped to her face, oxygen hissing.
          Jack watches her. Now cleaned and dry, there's a
          natural, earthy, freckled beauty to her. Air passing
          peacefully through her lips, now returned to color.

          47.

                         CONTINUED:
          Jack reaches out to brushes hair from her face. He
          notices the outline of a necklace with a pendant under
          her nightgown.

          INT. SKY TOWER, KITCHEN - NIGHT

           Victoria sets dishes in a dishwasher. She stops. She
           can see Jack in the Infirmary, staring at Julia.

           INT. WORKSHOP AREA - NIGHT

          DRONE 166 sits in its hub, repaired. Jack replaces a
           panel, moves to a laptop and activates the drone.
          It POWERS UP, rising fast, bringing its canons around.
          We should be afraid, very afraid, that something is wrong
          with it. It SCANS Jack, as menacing as ever. But
          something's changed in Jack. He just stares back at it.
          Beat. Then the DRONE FIRES itself off into the black
          clouds, disappearing towards the earth below.
          Jack stares after it; then he turns, looks across empty
          space to the underside of the glass pool. Victoria has
          just dived in. She swims laps, kicking hard,
          bubblestreams peeling across her body. Exercise, not
          pleasure.

          EXT. SKY TOWER, POOLSIDE - NIGHT

          Jack stands at the end of the pool, watches Victoria
          stoke powerfully towards him. She sees him as she
          reaches the edge, stops, looking up at him.
          This is important, something Jack's been wanting to say
          for a long time:

                         JACK
          I read these books, of what it was
          like down here, before...
          He sits, his legs dangling into the water. She pulls up
          close, her arms on the side.

                         JACK (CONT'D)
          In this one book I was reading, a
          man describes being a child. He
          remembers a yellow kitchen, a
          baked apple.

          48.

                         CONTINUED:

                         VICTORIA
          I know. That was the world
          before. Your little obsession...

                         JACK
          What was so wonderful about life
          on the Tet?
          She looks away...

                         JACK (CONT'D)
          When our time is up next month. I
          want to put in for one more tour.
          Victoria pushes off from the side, drifts back...

                         JACK (CONT'D)
          It's almost all gone, Victoria. I
          want to be here for the end.
          She turns, resumes swimming laps. Hard, driving through
          the water. He watches her for a moment, then turns away.

          INT. SKY TOWER - NIGHT

          Victoria comes in from the pool. She can see Jack in the
          bedroom, sitting on the bed, his back to her.
          She moves into the Infirmary, moves to Julia and checks
          her IV drip. She starts to adjust it, stops.
          She stares down at Julia.

          INT. SKY TOWER, BEDROOM - MOMENTS LATER

          Victoria comes in from the infirmary. She opens a
          closet, changes into a night shirt.

                         JACK

                         VIKA --
          She turns and grabs him, desperate.

                         VICTORIA
          Please. Please. Don't you
          understand? We have a chance to
          be on the first boats out, to be
          the first to settle Mars, raise a
          family. Five years. Proof that
          we are an effective team.

          49.

                         CONTINUED:
          She holds his face, kisses him, willing him to want her
          as desperately.

                         VICTORIA (CONT'D)
          Everything we've wanted is waiting
          for us up there. Please, Jack.

                         JACK
          I don't know if it is or not,
          Victoria. I can't remember.
          She starts to reply... has nothing. Shakes her head.
          She grabs blankets and pulls them around herself, her
          back to him, her eyes open, scared. Jack also lies down,
          staring upwards. And then Jack asks the 64,000 dollar

                         QUESTION:

                         JACK (CONT'D)
          Do you remember her?
          Victoria doesn't move. Stares straight out.

          EXT. THE SKYTOWER - NIGHT

          WIND shakes the SKYTOWER, and the clouds boil beneath it.
          Jack and Victoria sleep next to each other.
          In the infirmary, Julia sleeps alone. A machine "beeps."

          EXT. OBSERVATION DECK - DAY (DREAM)

          We're in the deep saturation of Jack's dream. Images fly
          by, then SLOW. People, enjoying the view. New York
          City. Jack, looking through the pay telescope. Then
          turning, seeing...
          Julia right next to him, smiling up, happy.

          INT. THE SKY TOWER, BEDROOM - NIGHT

          Jack's eyes open. That dream again. Victoria's still
          asleep next to him. He rises out of bed...

          INT. SKY TOWER - VERY EARLY MORNING

          Jack pads out into the main room. STOPS when he sees
          Julia, risen from the infirmary, standing at one of the
          glass walls of the Sky Tower, staring out.

                         (CONTINUED)

                         

                         

                         

                         

          50.

                         CONTINUED:
          It's early early morning. Probably 3:00 am. While it's
           dark below, the first signs of dark blue and orange
          sunrise are visible on the horizon. THE PLANETARY RING
          glows with soft golden light.
          JULIA'S POV: In the distance, the Tet is rising, faint
          light on its surface as it crests the planet's curve.
          VERY CLOSE on Julia. The image of Tet reflected in the
          corneas of her eyes. She's been crying, silently, and
          alone. One hand at her chest.

                         JACK
          It's beautiful, isn't it? It's
          your home now.

                         (NO RESPONSE)
          How do you feel?
          She wipes her eyes.

                         JULIA
          A bit more... located.

                         JACK
          What was your shuttle's mission?
          She turns to him, watches him carefully in the dim light.
          And then, lying:

                         JULIA
          I don't remember. I should get
          back to the ship. I might be able
          to find the flight recorder.

                         JACK
          Your ship... it's pre-war.

                         JULIA
          (again, careful)
          Have you ever seen a ship like
          that?

                         JACK
          No. No, of course not.
          This answers something important for Julia.

                         JULIA
          I wonder what brought us back?

                         JACK
          .There was a transmission. I
          don't know who sent it.

          51.

                         CONTINUED: (2)

                         JULIA
          We'll never really know without
          the flight recorder.
          (almost casually...)
          She says we can't go down there,
          that it's too dangerous.
          He laughs a little, shakes his head.

                         JULIA (CONT'D)
          What?

                         JACK
          Funnily enough, you've found your
          man.

                         JULIA

                         (SMILING)
          Have I?
          An awkward beat, then:

                         JACK
          How did you know my name?

                         JULIA
          .You look like someone I once
          knew.
          (extending her hand)
          I understand I owe you my life.
          Thank you, Jack.
          They shake. A weird moment. She breaks away, looks back
          at the Tet which now glows a pale orange on the horizon.

                         JULIA (CONT'D)
          What happens now?

                         JACK
          In a few hours, the Tet will come
          online. Victoria will report your
          rescue and I imagine they'll send
          someone down for you.

                         JULIA
          From... the `Pet?

                         JACK
          Yes.
          She gestures out to the Bubbleship on its pad.

          52.

                         CONTINUED: ( 3)

                         JULIA
          You fly that thing?

                         JACK
          .You could say that.
          She SMILES, pleased. A twinkle in her eye...

                         JULIA
          Alright then. Don't you want to
          know?

          EXT. SKY TOWER, BUBBLESHIP PAD - EARLY MORNING

          JACK and JULIA are suited up, ready to go. The Tetis
          still low and far on the dark horizon, silhouetted bythe
          first signs of sunlight growing in the East...
          The Bubbleship's ENGINES start up with their distinctive
          whine. As they head towards the ship, Victoria comes out
          from the house, a robe pulled on...

                         VICTORIA
          Jack! What are you doing?

                         JACK
          I'll bring her back before Tet-
          Rise. We just want to try to find
          the flight recorder. You can't
          know everything watching from a
          mile up.

                         VICTORIA
          She shouldn't be --
          Julia turns on Victoria, quickly.

                         JULIA
          Thank you. I feel very well.
          Then, coldly, she boards the ship.

                         JACK
          She's the flight officer, she
          wants. to see the wreck of her ship
          and secure items there. You'd
          want to do the same thing.

                         VICTORIA
          Jack, please.

                         (CONTINUED)

                         

                         

                         

                         

          53.

                         CONTINUED:

                         JACK
          Don't worry, we'll be back before
          you have to make your report.

                         VICTORIA
          That's not it. I can't protect
          you with the Tet offline and I
          just have a very bad...

                         JACK
          I'll be fine.
          He turns and boards. Julia is staring at her through the
          bubble-canopy.
          The bubbleship rises and then falls off to the side,
          plummeting towards earth.

          INT. BUBBLE SHIP - EARLY DAWN

          Jack pulls the ship out of its dive, sets course across
          the altered earth. Julia is STARING down, a little
          afraid, but darkly fascinated...
          Victoria's voice cuts through on the Comm.

                         VICTORIA
          Jack... This isn't just about
          protocol. I'm trying to
          understand.

                         JACK

                         (BEAT)
          I'll be home for breakfast.
          And he SWITCHES OFF the Comm.

          INT. SKY TOWER, COMAND CENTER - CONTINUOUS

          Victoria STARES at the dead Comm. A moment, then she
          SLAMS the panel with her fists. She backs off, staring
          at the panel.

          INT. BUBBLESHIP - CONTINUOUS

          They fly in silence. Julia gazes down at sights we're by
          now familiar with, becoming visible as the first light
          hits. The craters, emaciated seascape.

          54.

                         JULIA
          So I guess I'm around... a hundred
          years old.

                         (BEAT)
          What happened next?
          He gestures towards the moon ring in the sky.

                         JACK
          The Scavs assumed taking out the
          moon would wipe us out, and it
          almost did. But we re-grouped,
          fought back. We beat them in the
          end.
          She glances at him.

                         JACK (CONT'D)
          That's if you call nuking half the
          planet beating anybody.
          He looks at her, shrugs. They fly past a RESOURCE
          GATHER, its column of water lifting from the seas.

                         JACK (CONT'D)
          We harvest seawater to supply the
          Mars colony with the energy we
          need to live there. We're almost
          done. Pretty soon, there'll be no
          more water down here.

                         JULIA
          A dry planet...
          He nods at the Tet, rising in the distance.

                         JACK
          Yeah. What's left of us are up
          there now, ready to go where you
          were headed, Mars. 40 acres and a
          mule. What we've got left. What
          you've got.
          Julia stares out at the Tet.

                         JULIA
          What about you?

                         JACK
          We were born and raised up there.
          Vika's the A-student. I'm just a
          tech... I fix things. I...

          55.

                         CONTINUED; ( 2)
          JULIA looks at him. Something out of the groove.

                         JACK (CONT'D)
          Why are you looking at me like
          that?

                         JULIA
          Sorry.
          She stares back down at the landscape.

                         JULIA (CONT'D)
          It's so beautiful.
          He looks at her, surprised. He thought he was the only
          one...

          EXT. CRASH SITE - EARLY MORNING

          THE BUBBLESHIP sits landed amidst the wreckage. A low
          still fog has condensed, leaving visibility low, moisture
          everywhere. While there was light up high, they've
          descended back into the pre-dawn darkness.
          The ROVER has detached, shining its small light in their
          direction to help.
          Julia searches fruitlessly. Everything from the wreck
          small enough to carry away has been taken by Scavs. Every
          piece of fabric and metal.
          Jack half watches her, half tracks the periphery, his
          weapon slung low.

          INT. SKY TOWER, COMAND CENTER - CONTINUOUS

          Victoria sits at her workstation, upset.
          She's got the Bubbleship up on the map, its cam feed on
          display.

          EXT. CRASH SITE - CONTINUOUS

          Julia, still weakened from Delta Sleep, hauls aside
          debris, revealing a metal floor-plate, unscrewed and
          discarded. The slot within is empty.

                         JULIA
          No! NO! It's been taken. DAMN

          IT!

                         CONTINUED:
          She backs off, upset, breathing hard.

                         JACK
          Look, it doesn't matter --

                         JULIA
          It matters, okay!? You don't...
          you can't understand... I need
          that flight recorder. I need to
          know what happened.

                         (BEAT)
          You need to know what happened.

                         JACK
          We should stay close to...
          She ignores him, moves on. Deeper in the wreckage, she
          locates the empty moorings that held the Steel Cylinder
          Jack saw. It's also gone.

                         JACK (CONT'D)
          What was it?
          She STARES at him, wanting to say something. Deciding
          not to. She leans back against a wall of the shuttle.

          INT. SKY TOWER, COMAND CENTER - CONTINUOUS

          Victoria has tried to ignore the cam feeds, working on
          other things. She glances over, then away just as a FORM
          passes by one of the cam feeds!
          Victoria checks another readout, glances back as TWO MORE
          FORMS pass by the camera. Glimpses of metal and fur...

                         VICTORIA
          (hitting the Comm)
          Jack! Jack! There's something
          coming your way. JACK!!"

          TNT. CRASH SITE - CONTINUOUS
          Jack's Bubbleship sits silent. The COMM still switched
          off. Suddenly ANOTHER FORM moves through our line of
          sight, something's there, and CLOSE.
          WITH JACK and JULIA.
          The air still, damp. Almost no sound. She picks through
          the remains of the ship. He's staring at her.

                         JULIA
          (without looking up)
          You're staring at me.

                         JACK
          I'm sorry.
          INTERCUT: Victoria watches as MORE AND MORE Alien
          figures pass the camera feed. Moving towards Jack and
          Julia's position. Victoria, HELPLESS.
          Julia looks up at Jack, directly for the first time.
          He stares at her...

                         JACK (CONT'D)
          How do I know you...
          ON JULIA'S FACE. Suddenly her vision racks...
          JACK SPINS, sees emerging out of the mist, SCAVS. A
          dozen of them. Alien tribesmen, bristling with weapons,
          war-like high-tech headdresses. Mandibles and claws.
          Terrifying and close.
          Jack reaches for his weapon, bringing it around and --
          SLAM! He's hit from the side by a SCAV. Its armored
          body bringing him to the ground. He tries to CRAWL AWAY,
          sees Julia grabbed. He twists, sees Scavs crawling over
          the Bubbleship.

                         JACK (CONT'D)
          Bob! HOME!
          In the background, the Bubbleship BLASTS OFF, Scavs
          falling off as Jack KICKS BACKWARDS, breaking the Scavs
          hold. He rolls away towards his weapon-
          - straight into the legs of a GIANT SCAV holding an
          improvised club which now comes down, IMPACTING JACK...

          INT. SKY TOWER, CONTROL STATION - CONTINUOUS

          VICTORIA stares at image of the wreck growing SMALLER as
          the Bubbleship rises.

                         VICTORIA

          JACK! JACK...!

                         

                         

                         

                         

          58.

          EXT. OPEN LAND - DAWN

          Darkness. LOUD SOUNDS. ANIMAL PANTING. Small, glimpses
          of earth moving by, then darkness again.
          Jack and Julia are tied to a huge SCAV SLED pulled by
          twelve FERAL DOGS. A combination of old scavenged
          military hardware and new innovation to adapt to a world
          without engine-power. Giant treads roll forward as the
          dogs STRAIN against metallic harnesses.
          Jack's head lolls to the side. He blinks, looks over to
          see Julia next to him, unconscious. He tracks up. At
          the top of the sled, a massive Alien Scav pilots the
          sled, sand whipping through a head-dress we recognize:
          The LEADER. He holds a long whip, cracks it over the
          dogs who haul the sled forward.
          We slow, letting the sled pull away from us into the dark
          as we travel BACK, towards where we came from, reveal...
          The Bubbleship's ROVER has been following. A machine
          meant for small journeys, it rolls inside the tread path
          left by the sled, but it can barely handle the terrain.

          INT. SKY TOWER - MORNING

          Victoria hears the SOUND OF THE BUBBLESHIP, arriving.
          She rushes to the glass of the Sky Tower, sees the
          Bubbleship, docking itself. Auto pilot. No one inside.

          EXT. MOUNTAIN CANYONS - MORNING

          From far away, we see the sled wind up this rocky canyon
          which opens onto a massive wall of old concrete and
          steel. Something giant and industrial in its time.
          The sled approaches, seems to disappear as it moves under
          a shadowy outcropping of rock. In the dark underneath,
          huge metal doors... close.

          INT. A DARK SPACE -- NO TIME

          Almost complete blackness, just the SOUND of a slow drip
          of water. In the far distance, the howls and chatter of
          Scavs.
          Jack's blood-encrusted eyes blink open. Irises dilate
          trying to orient. He raises his head, can barely see.

          59.

                         CONTINUED:
          He and Julia lie in the only pool of light in the room,
          filtering in from a high ventilation shaft. She's
          unconscious. Around him, in the dark, the sense of
          movement.
          His eyes adjusting, he squints into the dark. There's a
          FORM on the edges of the light, watching him. Jack
          tenses as the figure...
          .strikes a match on the floor, brings the flame to its
          face, revealing... An Old Man: BEECH. He sucks in on
          the end of a cigar. For a moment, their eyes meet.
          Then the match goes out. Dark silhouette again. Only
          the feint orange glow from the cigar.

                         BEECH
          MonteCristo, #2. Do you have any
          idea how long I've waited, for
          this?
          He EXHALES a stream of smoke into the beam, then moves
          closer, into the light. Beech's face is lined with age
          and exposure, his skin scarred from battle. His teeth
          yellowed and crooked, but his arms and body are strong.
          Jack TENSES. Beech's voice is calm, with a barely held-
          back malice lurking just under the surface.

                         BEECH (CONT'D)
          Well, let me tell you, Jack. It's
          been a long time...

                         JACK
          Who are you? Where is this?
          BEECH inhales again. There's a piercing curiosity to
          Beech's gaze, studying him.

                         BEECH
          We're deep underground. Very deep
          underground.

                         JACK
          We were taken by the Scavs...

                         BEECH
          Oh... The "Scavs".

                         (BEAT)
          Tell me, Jack. Have you ever met
          a Scav, up close?

                         (CONTINUED)

                         CONTINUED: (2)
          Jack is suddenly aware of other FORMS in this room.
          Motion, on the periphery. Hair... Feathers. Scavs?

                         BEECH (CONT'D)
          No, of course not. You just
          repair the damage, keep the Drones
          up and killing. Don't ask many
          questions, do you, Jack? No part
          of the...

          Beech pulls off the cigar...

                         BEECH (CONT'D)
          Brutal, if you think about it.
          The way your Drones -

                         JACK
          The Scavs took everything from us.
          And if you're working with them --

                         BEECH
          Interesting, Jack. Interesting.
          You're worried I might be some
          kind of... Collaborator.
          Jack doesn't respond.

                         BEECH (CONT'D)

                         (ASIDE)
          Lllllllights!
          A beat, then a BANK of lights flickers on, revealing
          HUMANS, all around them, heavily armed.
          Julia GROANS, the light bringing her to. Jack moves to
          protect her, tracks ten, TWENTY people... He looks UP
          where ROWS AND ROWS of men and women stare down from
          above with undisguised animosity. Forty, fifty more...
          At the front, a strong battle-scared Scav, SYKES, hovers
          on the edge of violence. He's been recently WOUNDED.

                         BEECH (CONT'D)
          You see...? We're not Aliens,
          Jack. We're very much human.
          Jack can't process. Human face after human face.

                          BEECH (CONT'D)
          Of course that's a problem. Your
          drones go for human shapes, human
          voices. So... we change our
          shapes, change our voices.

                         (INHALING SMOKE)
          The Drones still kill us, but
          they're not nearly so aggressive
          as when they smell a human target.
          Did you ever ask yourself why that
          is?

                         JACK
          No, they're programmed to

                         BEECH
          To what, Jack?

                         (OFF JULIA)
          You saw it yourself. You almost
          got yourself blown to bits
          protecting her. I've been meaning
          to ask you, why did you do that?

                         JACK
          Anyone would have...

                         BEECH
          Anyone. Would have. Interesting.
          Julia comes around, her eyes flickering open, She
          SCREAMS, looking frantically for an escape. Jack GRABS
          her, protecting her, calming her.
          Beech gets CLOSE, studies Jack, what he's doing. Nods.

                         BEECH (CONT'D)
          Very interesting.
          Beech moves away. Jack moves after him and suddenly
          forty or more weapons lock onto him. Sykes closer than
          any other.

                         BEECH (CONT'D)
          Careful, Jack. I'm afraid you're
          not very popular here.
          Beech switches his gaze to Julia.

                         BEECH (CONT'D)
          Welcome back to earth, commander.
          Hope you like what we've done with

          INT. GROW-HALL, RAVEN ROCK - CONTINUOUS

          They pass into a giant area devoted to agriculture. ROWS
          of wide, two-story glass tubes hold PLANTS bearing fruit.
          Their roots are held bare, bathed only in moist air...

                         BEECH
          We grow what we can, under the
          lights. It isn't much; Wheat-
          grass, some vegetables, what beans
          and soy we can. The general state
          of our health proves that human
          beings are not herbivores, but the
          alternative is not appetizing to
          anybody.

                         (SARDONIC WINK)
          Not yet, anyway.

                         JACK
          When we get you up to the Tet,
          there's plenty -

                         BEECH
          There is? Plenty. Plenty of
          what?

          -- Your organs boil from the
          inside. I've heard.
          Beech moves on, turning down another corridor.
          There are PAINTINGS, stacked against the walls. Picasso,
          Monet, Kandinsky, Warhol. SCULPTURES in piles.

          A Grand Piano is pushed in a corner, other instruments
          propped against it. They pass a room filled with BOOKS,
          another with a SCREEN mounted in front of a projector.
          For a moment, Jack forgets everything else. It's like
          his private collection at Crater Lake, but a hundred
          times bigger, richer...
          Julia stops in front of a painting of a young girl in a
          field of golden grass, staring towards a farmhouse on the
          horizon. She turns to Jack.

          second-in-command, the battle-hardened SYKES, whispers
          heatedly in his ear, glancing back. Not everyone thinks
          having Jack and Julia here is a good idea.
          Jack peers over the edge of the gantry they are on. FAR

          It took three decades to build the
          Tet. And when it was finally
          ready and it was time to go up,
          there were people who refused.
          Leaders, who told their people to
          stay.

          Jack! Jack! There's something
          coming your way. JACK!!!!
          Victoria LISTENS, chilled. She hits REWIND, then PLAY:

                         JACK'S VOICE
          .It'll be fine. Trust me.

                         VICTORIA'S VOICE
          I'm trying to.

                         JACK'S VOICE
          I'll be home for breakfast.
          Alone in the Sky Tower, this hits Victoria hard.
          REWIND. Victoria STARES at the counter, letting it go
          further back. Then, PLAY.
          Just STATIC. Then we hear Victoria's end of a
          conversation we already witnessed:

          What are you doing out there so
          far, Jack?
          Then the static for a moment filled with GARBLED SOUNDS.
          Victoria hits STOP. She stares. Makes an adjustment,
          plays the SOUNDS again. Something drawing her in...

          INT. WORK HANGAR, RAVEN ROCK - CONTINUOUS

          A Large bay, filled with machinery, computers. Other
          things scavenged from the wreck of the Odyssey including
          several Delta Sleep Pods. Scav Soldiers work in the
          center of the bay on a DOWNED DRONE. It's been opened
          up, taken apart. All of its circuit boards and wiring
          spread out, hooked to computers.
          To the side, other soldiers are grouped around something.
          Jack tracks the object they're working on: The scarred
          STEEL CYLINDER Jack saw on the Odyssey. Its been opened
          up and some ten scavenged Deuterium fuel cells have been
          fitted inside the casing.

                         JULIA
          The bomb...
          She REALIZES something, wheels on Beech, angry.

                         JULIA (CONT'D)
          You brought down the Odyssey. You
          sonofabitch you crashed our ship.
          There were people on board, all so
          you could get --

                         BEECH
          I know what I did. But tell us,
          Commander, why did you have a bomb
          on board, what was it for? Tell
          him.
          She looks at Jack, reluctant to say it, but...

                         JULIA
          The Tet... is an alien ship, Jack.
          The odyssey's mission --- Our
          mission, was to investigate it.
          Jack shakes his head no. Angry...

          unleashed its primary weapon, a
          brilliant weapon...

                         JACK
          I was born there!

                         BEECH
          I was born in Chicago, Jack. I
          used to go to baseball games with
          my father. I used to get two big
          hot dogs, fill 'em up with relish,
          and mustard. Just go to town. Me
          and my pops, watching the sox.
          (quick, pressing)
          You have any memories like that
          Jack?

                         JACK
          No, my father was a --

                         BEECH
          Was what? Tall? Fat? He yell at
          your mom? Ever go to a baseball
          game, Jack?

                         JACK

                         (GETTING ANGRY)
          I already told you --

                         BEECH
          Right, sorry. Tell me how your
          mother smelled.

                         JACK
          What?

                         BEECH
          My mother, smelled like warm
          fruit. Like oranges, sitting in
          the sun.
          Jack starts to speak... Stops. Beech moves to one of
          the scavenged DELTA SLEEP PODS, runs his hand over the
          embossed name-plate...

          If you had looked more carefully
          at the wreckage of the odyssey,
          you would have noticed there were
          two empty sleep pods. The Pilot,
          and the Co-pilot...
          Jack stares at the name plate on the POD: "J. Harper."

                         JULIA
          It was you, Jack.

                         JACK
          What?

                         JULIA
          You and Victoria. We were all on
          the Odyssey. We were supposed to
          make contact...

                         JACK
          No.

                         BEECH
          The Tet is an alien vessel,
          Commander Jack Harper. It came
          and destroyed our moon and most of
          humanity when it did. And ever
          since, with your help, it's been
          trying to finish the job.

                         (BEAT)
          I'm sorry, Jack. It's not good
          news, I know. You've been turned
          to the wrong side.
          Beech goes to the BOMB, stares down at it

                         BEECH (CONT'D)
          But now, with your help, we can
          finally destroy it.

                         JACK
          You're insane. This is insane.
          He turns to Julia, but she won't help him.

                         JACK (CONT'D)
          (to both of them)
          There are people up there -

                         BEECH
          What? People like you? We are
          the last real people.

          planet.
          Beech raises his gaze to Jack. Deadly serious.

                         BEECH (CONT'D)
          We didn't win the war, Jack. We
          lost.
          These words hit Jack. He starts to reply, finds he
          can't. Beech approaches, fatherly, gentle.

                         BEECH (CONT'D)
          It has taken us ten years to get
          here, but we finally have a
          weapon, and a working Drone to
          carry it. Except we can't
          successfully program the Drone.
          It's not our technology.

          EXT. RAVEN ROCK - CONTINUOUS

          The ROVER crawls up the Canyon finally arrive at the
          entrance to Raven Rock. It stops, scanning the face of
          Raven Rock...
          BLAMI!! A SHOT hits it, it tumbles back, utterly
          destroyed.

          INT. SKY TOWER, CONTROL STATION - CONTINUOUS

          Victoria is working hard, intent on deciphering the
          sound. She doesn't notice the image of Raven Rock appear
          on a side monitor, transmitted from the ROVER.

          INT. WORK HANGER - CONTINUOUS

          Suddenly, SYKES and several other Scavs burst into the
          area. All eyes go to Jack and Julia as the ruined ROVER
          is brought in.

          Beech, processing. All around the periphery, REACTION.
          This is a disaster.

                         BEECH
          Well well, we may be out of time.
          Set the Drone to return to the Tet
          upon reactivation. It needs to go
          right to the center --

                         JACK
          No! It will kill -

                         (RAGING)
          It will kill that ugly stain on
          the sky. That's all! Now program
          the Drone!
          Soldiers push Jack towards the opened Drone. Jack stares
          at the read-outs, the electronics. Sykes GRABS a weapon
          from a female Scav soldier, lines it on Jack.

                         JACK
          No. I won't do it.

                         SYKES
          He won't help us. We bury them
          both, make our run as soon as we
          can load up.

                         JULIA

          NO!!
          Jack stares Sykes down.

                         JACK
          You know I stare into weapons
          every day, so you can put that
          away. Because here's what I can
          tell you...
          (back to Beech)
          If the Rover found us, the Drones
          will too. Unless you want them to
          find you, let me get somewhere
          where I can send a signal.

          TNT. RAVEN ROCK - MOMENTS LATER
          Jack and Julia stand near the entrance to Raven Rock.
          Sykes appears with the white rectangular box, tosses it
          down in the dirt at Jack's feet.
          Beech watches as Jack unfolds his motorcycle. Behind
          them, other Scavs are packing up, readying an exodus.

                         JACK
          I can fix this.

                         BEECH
          Well, you're the repairman.
          Jack powers up the bike and gets on. He looks at Julia
          who hesitates, then she climbs on the back of the bike.

                         JACK
          I'll get to the antenna, send a
          signal with my location. The Tet
          will call off the search. .You
          should be safe, for now.
          Jack starts to go.

                         BEECH
          Jack... What if I told you that I
          had been to your radiation zones.
          And what I found there... Would

          Beech stares after them, the rooster-tail of Jack's bike
          racing away across the ruined landscape.

                         SYKES
          What makes you think he's any
          different from the others?
          Beech stares at him a moment, then back out.

          She does.
          Beech turns away.

          EXT. THE RUINED EARTH - DAY

          Jack pilots the electric bike across STAGGERING
          BEAUTIFUL VISTAS... LANDSCAPES OF THE IMAGINATION. On
          the back of the bike, Julia takes in the incredible
          beauty around her.
          Finally, in the shadow of a jagged mountain, the BIKE
          slows and STOPS. Jack checks the charge: it's dead.
          They climb off and Jack leaves the bike where it lies,
          headed off on foot.

                         JULIA
          What happened...?
          She's staring into the distance where an old WRECK of a
          RESOURCE GATHERER lies shattered against a cliff-face.

                         JACK
          The Scavs brought it down ten
          years ago. All. this time, I
          thought we were at war with the
          Scavs... but it turns out we were
          just killing each other.
          He turns, heads off on foot. After a moment, she
          follows.

          EXT. CLIFF TOP - DAY

          Jack and Julia reach the top of a high cliff, with what
          looks like a METAL SPIRE protruding upwards at its edge.

          We PASS OVER them, staring down a familiar 1,200-foot
          waterfall. Jack has returned to the top of the Empire
          State, this time approaching from above.
          Together, they climb DOWN the craggy rock face. Two tiny
          figures against a massive backdrop, a mortal fall below.

          EXT. OBSERVATION DECK - DAY

          Jack is the first to drop onto the cracked cement of the
          deck. He moves forward, pulling the plastic and
          camouflage off the transmitter and repeater. He gets to
          work on the repeater. It's old tech, hard to make it
          talk to the Bubbleship.
          Julia stands a ways off. For a moment, their gazes meet,
          then he continues working.

          INT. SKY TOWER, COMAND CENTER - DAY

          Victoria is hard at work, processing the sound that
          caught her attention. She has it playing through the
          whole sky tower: The SOUNDS are broken, static-like,
          almost ALIEN. Strange and guttural.
          Fingers fly over controls, making adjustments. This time
          the sounds parse into WORDS. A male and a female voice.
          Almost apprehensive, she pulls an electronic filter,
          overlays it on the signal, which suddenly drops into
          perfect clarit : A recording of Jack and Victoria, from
          a different patrol.

          on Mars, Honey.

                         VICTORIA'S VOICE
          Okay, fine. No dishwasher. How
          about just you. All the time.

                         JACK'S VOICE
          Yes. When we get there.
          ON VICTORIA. Her face totally still. Strangely frozen
          in the face of this sweet little exchange...

          The voices BOOM through the Sky Tower, over and over.
          Frightening that their simplicity contrasts so much with
          the effect they are having on Victoria who moves into the
          main room, white as a sheet. She looks up as..
          The Bubbleship lifts off from its platform and sails
          into the sky. She watches it go, then rushes back
          towards her station.

          EXT. OBSERVATION DECK - DAY

          Jack stares at the ESB Antenna, down at the repeater and
          the line of code he hopes he's transmitting.

                         JULIA
          What will you do now?
          Jack doesn't answer. He moves to the edge of the deck,
          stares out, unwilling to meet her eyes.

                         JACK
          That old man is smart. Those fuel
          cells, the way he's got them tied
          in with your device... He could
          blow the whole station.

                         JULIA
          Jack, you can't turn them in.
          He glances at her, shakes his head.

                         JACK
          What do you want from me? I'm
          just a repairman.

                         (BEAT)
          This is bigger than me.
          Jack moves off to a corner of the deck by the old
          telescope. She follows him, steeling herself.

          But for you, it was always the

                         JULIA
          I'm talking about a man I knew,
          who was fearless. A man who
          wouldn't bow out of a fight, ever.

                         JACK
          STOP! You and that old man have

          He turns, starts to lean on the old telescope, draws
          back, staring at the thing like it bit him.

          Jack is staring at the telescope, agitated, confused.

          Julia comes close, puts a hand out, rests it on his
          chest. She moves closer to him, searching his eyes.

                         JULIA (CONT'D)
          Don't you remember what happened

          A YOUNGER JULIA is staring out over glorious intact New
          York City. Next to her, a YOUNGER JACK peers through the
          telescope. Now he pulls away, turns to her...

                         YOUNGER JACK
          There, right there. Take a look.
          She smiles, puts her eye to the telescope.

          Oh, okay. I don't understand.
          YOUNGER JACK nervously produces an ENGAGEMENT RING from
          his pocket.

          EXT. OBSERVATION DECK - DAY (PRESENT)

          VROOOOMMMM! The Bubbleship RISES INTO VIEW directly in
          front of them. Jack, kissing Julia, tries to break away,
          confused, guilty. Julia holds on.
          She reaches to her collar, pulls free a necklace, a
          familiar ring dangles from it...

                         JULIA
          There are a few pages missing, but
          it's the same book.

          INT. SKY TOWER, CONTROL STATION - CONTINUOUS

          Victoria stares at the screen, the image of Jack kissing
          Julia, then breaking away. She's strangely cold, like
          there's simply nothing left to feel...

          INT. BUBBLESHIP - MOMENTS LATER

          Jack pilots the ship, a tense silence between he and
          Julia. He checks a few readouts, then hits the Comm.

                         JACK
          Vika, it's me. I'm... all right.
          I'm coming in. Don't report in to
          Mission, not until I get back.
          No response. Dead air. Julia is pressed far back in her
          seat, watching Jack.

          INT. SKY TOWER, CONTROL STATION - CONTINUOUS

          Victoria is still motionless. She hears Jack's calls on
          the Comm, does nothing.

          which suddenly comes alive. Readouts go active, data
          history starts to play. The Tet is accessing everything.
          Visual and Voice recordings blaze by. Images, everything
          the Bubbleship has seen. We see the image of Raven Rock
          sent from the ROVER.

          INT. SKY TOWER - CONTINUOUS

          Victoria enters the Sky Tower, staring at it as if it was
          all alien to her. As she moves through, she unzips her
          jumpsuit, steps out of it, moves on. Her shirt, then
          bra, land on the floor. She moves on...

          JULIA and JACK step out of the Bubbleship, head towards
          the interior of the Sky Tower. The whole thing has been
          opened up. Wind blows freely through papers, magazines.
          Vases have been blown over, water spilled.

          Jack comes out near the garden. It's been ripped to
          shreds. What plants are left lie uprooted and broken.
          Flowers strewn about. PETALS float off the side of the
          sky tower and down into the clouds.
          VICTORIA stands near the far edge, looking out. She's no
          longer in her jumpsuit. She wears a beautiful flowing
          dress which waves in the wind. Her hair is free.

                         JACK
          Vika... the Scavs. They're
          humans, like us. The war has

          A cup of coffee, now cold. A jacket on the back of her
          chair. On a monitor, a wavelength plays silently. The
          signal she descrambled.

          And if he's just a crazy old man?
          Jack looks at her. It'd be a funny moment, but it's not.

                         JACK
          I've been wrong about everything
          else.
          He dives the ship towards the clouds below.

          EXT. CANYON - MORNING

          Drones shoot down a canyon towards RAVEN ROCK.

          INT. BUBBLESHIP - CONTINUOUS

          The Bubbleship BURSTS through clouds. Up ahead, the
          familiar RIDGELINE is approaching...

          AND THREE DRONES WATTTNG.
          Jack HAULS the ship over as the Drones bear down on them
          OPENING UP. We recognize one: Drone 166.
          Canon fire ROCKS the Bubbleship, pieces blowing off.
          Jack REVOLVES THE CANOPY to return fire. A Drone
          EXPLODES but Drone 166 and another blast through the
          smoke, firing.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          83.

          INT. RAVEN ROCK - CONTINUOUS

          Everything has been packed, loaded, ready to leave.
          Beech watches Sykes supervise the final lashing of the
          BOMB onto a sled. Beech gives a command and the great
          steel door groans OPEN, revealing...
          SIX DRONES, waiting. Their weapons POWERING UP.
          ON BEECH, a final realization washing over him.

          EXT. OPEN SKY - CONTINUOUS

          Jack SPINS the ship, evading pursuit, even as he checks
          his heads-up, tracks the two Sky Tower Drones closing
          from behind. He hauls over, pursuing Drones turning with
          him, firing as the two Drones burst out of cloud cover
          FAST, MID-AIR COLLISION, two more Drones go down!
          Jack hits the brakes. Another Drone overshoots him,
          pulls up. Jack sites the Drone, starts to fire...
          The Bubbleship is raked with fire! Drone 166 is right on
          them and firing. The canopy is hit! CRACKS spider-web
          across it. A canon is blown clean off.
          Jack tries his remaining weapon. It's dead.

                         WITH DRONE 166
           It pulls out of an arc, ACCELERATES, closing on the
           Bubbleship as the Bubbleship tears away into a cloud
           bank, goes in. Drone 166 follows, seconds behind.
          Drone 166 EMERGES from the cloud bank into open air, its
          cannon lining on... nothing. Empty sky. It REVOLVES
          quickly, sensing for ...
          SMASH! Jack's Bubbleship IMPACTS the Drone from above,
          the ship's manacles designed for transporting broken
          Drones CLAMPING ON. Suddenly the two vessels are LOCKED.
          And the Drone goes wild. It's engines THRUSTING,
          fighting against the counter-force of the Bubbleship's
          engines. The Drones GUNS BLASTING in every direction,
          but unable to elevate to hit the Bubbleship.
          INSIDE THE BUBBLESHIP. Julia screams as the ship tumbles
          end over end. Jack stays on the controls, tracking the
          last Drone closing from above.

                         (CONTINUED)

                         

                         

                         

                         

          84.

                         CONTINUED:
          Jack FORCES Drone and ship to turn, turning Drone 166's
          canon on the last Drone which EXPLODES.

                         JACK
          There...
          He punches the throttle. The Bubbleship with Drone 166
          attached blasts in the direction of A CLIFF FACE.
          DRONE 166 gets free of one restraint, rotates so its
          cannon come to bear on part of the undercarriage. OPENS
          UP, blasting the storage to bits...
          And Jack PULLS UP, just clearing the ridge, Drone 166
          IMPACTING ROCK. The Drone blasts clear through, CRASHES

          ONTO VOLCANIC ROCK.

          INT. THE BUBBLESHIPP - CONTINUOUS

          Jack and Julia in the damaged, smoking, now-shaking ship.

                         JACK
          You okay?

                         JULIA
          No.
          Jack nods, turns the ship north again. The Bubbleship
          shaking and smoking. Up ahead, the RIDGELINE
          approaching.
          WARNING ALARMS trigger on the Bubbleship's display
          Claxon-like.

                         JULIA (CONT'D)
          What is that?

                         JACK
          Radiation warning. We're five
          clicks from the border.
          Jack makes an adjustment, the Bubbleship SURGES with more
          speed. It sounds like it's going to tear itself apart.

          EXT. ROCKS NEAR CRATER LAKE - CONTINUOUS

          The smashed Drone 166 POWERS BACK UP. A moment as it
          runs its systems, then BLASTS OFF in pursuit.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          85.

          INT. BUBBLESHIP - CONTINUOUS

           On the heads-up, they can see Drone 166 coming up behind
          them, closing FAST. Jack touches a familiar button. The
          Bar-guage for his extra boost starts to fill...
          FROM BEHIND THEM, blasts go wide. Drone 166 is firing,
          missing.
          The bar gauge FALTERS, something broken. Jack SLAMS the
          dash. Gauge keeps rising. The Bubbleship starts to buck
          as RED WARNING TEXT STREAMS ACROSS THE CANOPY: "LETHAL

          RADIATION LEVELS APPROACHING. DO NOT ENTER."

                         JULIA
          Jack...

                         JACK
          I got this.
          Jack hits it. They're both propelled back into their
          seats. The radiation zone coming up fast... They CROSS

          INTO THE ZONE!!
          .and the Bubbleship goes completely DEAD.
          Jack works controls, punches at the display. But there's
          nothing. Just the whistling sound of wind...

                          JACK (CONT'D)
           Bob! BOB! What are you doing
           Bob!!!!!
           Bob just bobbles... BLAM! BLAM BLAM!! The blasts from
          Drone 166 impact them, helpless.

                          JACK (CONT'D)
          Hold on!!
          Jack grabs a level, a mechanical lever, and HAULS IT UP.
          THE COCKPIT OF THE SHIP SEPARATES FROM THE BODY. The
          dead body of the ship tumbles backwards as Drone 166
           BLASTS IT, tries to pull up but the Bubbleship IMPACTS
          Drone 166 which SPINS OUT OF CONTROL towards the ground.
          THE BUBBLESHIP COCKPIT skims the surface, IMPACTS a
          ridge, blasting through it. It hits another ridge, the
          canopy shattering, earth piling in on them as they
          finally grid to a stop.
          Jack groans, leans to checks that Julia is okay. She's
          coughing, dazed, but alive.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          86.

          EXT. RADIATION ZONE - CONTINUOUS

          Jack opens the canopy door. It falls off. He stumbles
          out, himself still dazed. Wind and sand blow around him.
          CLOSE ON JACK. He breathes in. Breathes again. Waiting
          for a painful death, that doesn't arrive.

                         JACK
          Son of a bitch, old man...
          Words die on his lips as he tracks the plume of smoke
          from the downed Drone 166, lifting over a nearby ridge.
          He turns back to the ruined ship, grabs his carbine.

                         JACK (CONT'D)
          Stay here.
          Jack runs towards the smoke which is already being blown
          clear by a rising sand storm. He flops down in the dirt
          at the top of the rise, bringing his weapon up.
          JACK'S POV - DRONE 166. It lies smashed and smoking at
          the bottom of an incline. Finally dead. The wind and
          sand are beginning to whistle now, growing intensity...
          Jack starts to stand... when a FAMILIAR SOUND makes him
          turn.

          THAT OF A BUBBLESHIP.
          Jack hits the dirt as A BUBBLESHIP, just like Jack's,
          screams overhead and lands next to the DRONE, in a moment
          eerily reminiscent of the first scene of the film.
          Below, a MAN gets out of the second Bubbleship. He wears
          the same kind of suit as Jack. ANOTHER REPAIR MAN. He's
          got a bandana wrapped around his lower face to shield him
          from the sandstorm.
          Jack reaches for his BINOCS, bring them to his face only
          to find the lenses shattered.
          Reaching the downed Drone, the MAN kneels next to it and
          in a familiar fashion begins utilizing his tools to fix
          Drone 166. He locks a damaged cannon back into place,
          tightens it...
          Jack suddenly realizes what the man's doing. He stands,
          the wind now blasting in his direction, he starts running
          down the hill towards the man.

          87.

                         CONTINUED:

                         JACK (CONT'D)
          Hey! Hey, wait! Stop! Don't
          touch that Drone!
          His words are eaten up by the wind and sand. He rushes
          forward.
          WITH THE REPAIRMAN. We only see his hands as he works on
          Drone 166. He's very good. Even in the growing
           sandstorm he clips out a ruined board, slots a new one
          in. Runs a by-pass around a wire-bundle.
          The Repairman's fingers go to a familiar switch to
          activate the Drone...

                         JACK'S VOICE
          No! Wait!
          The Repairman hears the voice, even as he flips the
          switch. He LEAPS BACK, spinning around, his carbine
          coming off his back, lined on Jack fifteen feet away who

          STARES BACK AT HIM IN UTTER ASTONISHMENT.
          JACK'S POV -- THE REPAIRMAN. Holding the weapon on him.
          The man is Jack. A cleaner, newer, but identical version
          of Jack... A CLONE.
          Jack stares, transfixed. Now it all makes sense: The
          Garbled transmissions, Victoria's last words, who or what
          he really is, and is not.
          Not so for Jack 2. He takes a step back, confused,
          horrified. A tense moment.

                         JULIA'S VOICE
          Jack!?
          Julia has just crested the rise, sees the two Jack's.
          Also understanding...

                         JACK
          Julia! Stay back!
          Jack 2 senses her movement, SPINS and AIMS his rifle as
           Jack rushes forward --

                          JACK (CONT'D)
          No!
          -- He HITS JACK 2 and they both go down, the weapon
           FIRING! They fight over the weapon.

                         (CONTINUED)

                         

                         

                         

                         

          88.

                         CONTINUED: ( 2)
          Blow for blow combat, their physical strength and
          training identical, the only exception being that JACK 2
          is fresh, his suit immaculate, a man who has just arrived
          at work, maybe just arrived on the planet.
          WITH JULIA. Standing, watching the two clones fight...
          she suddenly drops to her knees, her hand on her side.
          Blood seeps between her fingers. She's been shot, badly.
          WITH JACK AND JACK 2. Jack grapples with Jack 2, trying
          to control him...

                         JACK (CONT'D)
          STOP! You have to understand! You
          have to understand...
          Jack 2 throws Jack, leaps on top of him, trying to
          throttle him, in a full panic. Jack drives up into his
          gut, rolls away.

                          JACK (CONT'D)
           We're just Drones! We're just
           Drones, man! You and me! Don't
           you get it? Don't you know?
          Jack 2 comes at Jack wildly, emotion over-amping
           technique. Jack DUCKS the blow, wraps Jack 2 up in a
          choke-hold. SQUEEZING...

                         JACK (CONT'D)
          It's okay. It's going to be
          okay...
          Jack 2 goes limp, unconscious. Jack lets him go,
          staggers back. Everything finally processing. Then:

                         JACK (CONT'D)
          Julia...
          He turns towards Julia, sees her kneeling there, holding
          her side. The blood seeping between her fingers...
          JACK runs to her as she begins to fall. She is conscious,
          but just barely. But still, she PULLS BACK from him.

                         JULIA

                         (HORRIFIED)
          Don't touch me. Don't
          She lurches away from him, body running on fear and
          adrenaline. Jack nods, accepting her terror of him.

                         (CONTINUED)

                         

                         

                         

                         

          89.

                         CONTINUED: ( 3)
          He moves forward, lifts her up against her willand
          carries her to shelter among the rocky terrain closeby.

          EXT. SMALL ROCKY ENCLAVE - CONTINUOUS

          Jack sets her down. There's blood frosting her lips and
          her skin has gone pale. He looks back, sees the
          Bubbleship and Jack 2's form lying next to it. He
          realizes something.

                         JACK
          I'll be back for you.

          INT. BUBBLE SHIP 2 - MOMENTS LATER

          Jack climbs in, looks around at the interior of the ship,
          at the similarities. He stares out at the unconscious
          Jack 2 in front of the ship.

                         JACK

                         (EMPTY WORDS)
          One, Two, Three. Jack Harper.
          A moment... then lights sparkle across the board.

                          JACK (CONT'D)
           Okay... Let's go home.
          The Bubbleship 2 lifts off.

          INT/EXT. BUBBLESHIP 2 - DAY (LATER)

          ON JACK. Making the approach. And then he sees it:
          Another Sky Tower, just like his. It had to be there.
          The Bubbleship closes on this new Sky Tower.

          EXT. SKY TOWER 2, GARDEN - DAY

          A woman we know but do not know is starting her new
          garden. VICTORIA 2. She looks happier, a little younger
          and more radiant than the Victoria we knew. It's earlier
          in their tour.
          Victoria 2 looks up as the Bubbleship lands. SMILES as
           Jack gets out and crosses the bridge towards her.

                         VICTORIA 2
          You're early...

                         CONTINUED:
          As he approaches she notices his damaged environmental
          suit.

                         VICTORIA 2 (CONT'D)
          What happened out there? I lost
          contact.
          JACK stares at her, heartbroken.

                         JACK
          .Just a bit of a dust up.

                         VICTORIA 2
          Are you all right?
          He nods. She comes over to him. He marvels at her
          beauty, the simplicity of life here...

                         VICTORIA 2 (CONT'D)

                         (SELF-CONSCIOUS)
          .What?
          She comes close, brushes his hair away from his forehead.

                         VICTORIA 2 (CONT'D)
          You dreamed a lot last night. I
          was thinking, you have to start
          writing them down.

                         JACK
          I cut myself, I just came by
          for...

                         VICTORIA 2
          I'll get it.

                         JACK
          No, I'll get it.
          He kisses her. Gentle, loving...

                         JACK (CONT'D)
          I'll get it. You stay here.
          And as JACK goes into the sky tower, she returns to
          happily planting her roses. Oblivious.

          INT. SKY TOWER 2, WORK AREA - MOMENTS LATER

          As Jack heads through his work area he sees A COLLECTION.
          Just started, but not much different from his own.

          Some coins, a book, THE COLLECTED POEMS OF T.S. ELLIOT,
          left open to a page, a passage underlined. He reads:
          We shall not ceasefromexploration
          And the end of allourexploring
          will be to arrivewherewe first started
          and know the placeforthe first time.
          He nods, strangely moved, moves on.

          INT. SKY TOWER 2, INFIRMARY - CONTINUOUS

          He grabs the healant and wand. He shuts the cabinet,
          stares at his reflection in the burnished steel.

          INT. SKY TOWER 2, READY ROOM - CONTINUOUS

          He opens the door to the locker. Stares at the brand-
          new, unworn picture of he and Victoria, taped to the
          inside of the door.

          INT. SKY TOWER 2 - MOMENTS LATER

          Jack comes out into the living area of Sky Tower 2,
          noticing everything: The furniture, the big things are
          exactly the same, but the little personal touches, the
          smaller details are different.
          He sees it all in a different light now. Things that he
          never looked twice at before. The items used to keep
          them from the truth.
          Victoria 2 comes in from outside, washes her hands.

                         VICTORIA 2
          We should watch a movie tonight.
          He sits, looking around himself. He belongs here. He
          fits here. Victoria munches on something.

                         VICTORIA 2 (CONT'D)
          I was going over the catalog and
          there's still a bunch of your
          favorites I haven't seen...
          She glances over, smiles. Who wouldn't forget everything
          for that smile?

                         

                         

                         

                         

          92.

          INT. BUBBLESHIP 2 - MOMENTS LATER

          Jack stares down as the Bubbleship LIFTS OFF from Sky
          Tower 2. He sees Victoria 2 come out, looking at him
          puzzled. Then she moves towards her Control Station.
          After a moment, her voice comes over the Comm.

                         VICTORIA 2
          Hey, you didn't say goodbye.

                         JACK

                         (BEAT)
          Good bye...
          He turns the Bubbleship, towards

          EXT. RADIATION ZONE - DAY

           Jack touches down in the second Bubbleship. Drone 166
          still lies there, but Jack 2 is GONE.

          EXT. SMALL ROCKY ENCLAVE - DAY

          Jack clambers into the enclave to where he left Julia.
          She's passed out, she looks dead. There's blood on the
          ground around her.
          He pulls her into his lap, pulling away the clothing
          around the wound. As he does, her eyes flutter open.
          She's delirious, eyes fixing on him.

                         JACK
          This is gonna pinch a little.

                         JULIA

                         (NOT PROCESSING)
          Okay...
          He spreads the HEALANT over her wound, activates it. For
          a moment, nothing. Then the skin starts to knit.
          And Julia starts to SCREAM...

          INT. BUBBLESHIP 2 - LATER

          Julia is unconscious, propped in the passenger seat of
          the ship. Jack climbs in, jams Bob the Bobblehead onto
          the dash. It bobbles at him, ready.
          Jack hits the gas and the Bubbleship lifts into the air.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          93.

          INT. BUBBLESHIP 2 - DAY

          The Bubbleship soars through the sky. There's something
          particularly calm, picturesque, exquisitely beautiful
          about the earth below.
          Jack pilots. In the seat next to him, Julia is pale,
          propped against the canopy, recovering. She watches him.
          He's aware of her gaze, but he doesn't look over.

          INT. CRATER LAKE, GROTTO - SUNSET

          Julia weakly stands amidst the tarped supplies, aware
          she's trespassing somewhere utterly private. Outside,
          the sound of Jack splitting wood. She takes in the
          books, the records, the mementos of the past. Sees the
          Jammer up and working...
          Jack comes in, gets to work piling wood in the fireplace.
          He won't meet her eyes. Scared of himself, ashamed in
          front of her...

                         JACK
          I always thought that plateau up
          there could be for a house
          someday. I thought about
          remaining here, letting the rest
          of humanity run off to Mars. And
          we'd just stay here.
          Jack stops himself, realizing how easily he said "we."

                         JULIA
          I'm sorry. Jack...

                         JACK
          No.
          He moves away from her, lights the fire, it starts to
          crackle. He gets up and goes, walking down to the lake.
          She stands near the fire, glad for its warmth, watching
          him out there, silhouetted in front of the lake.
          WITH JACK. He stares out over the water. Letting the
          truth wash over him.
          And then MUSIC from the grotto... the opening bars to the
          Temptation's "My Girl."

                         

                         

                         

                         

          94.

          INT. GROTTO, CRATER LAKE -- NIGHT

          Julia stands by the record player, watching the disc
          revolve. She looks up when Jack's form appears in the
          doorway. He's been out there too long, cold.

                         JULIA
          He loved this song.
          Jack sits, shivering, looking out at the lake. She moves
          to him, wraps a blanket around him.

                         JACK
          What was he like?

                         JULIA
          He was arrogant, and annoying, and
          the best man I'd ever known.
          Some distant part of Jack smiles at that.

                         JULIA (CONT'D)
          .And I loved him.

                         JACK
          I'm not that man.

                         JULIA
          Shhhhh. Yes you are.
          She rests her head against on his shoulder, holds him.
          Simple, caring. His eyes... close.

          INT. MISSION CONTROL, NASA - EVENING (FLASHBACK)

          A group of ASTRONAUTS and NASA CONTROLLERS are
          celebrating. A television screen reads: "Odyssey Mission
          a GO!"
          A YOUNGER JACK and JULIA are among the people
          celebrating. As an ASTRONAUT pops champagne, Jack and
          Julia find a private alcove, he lifts out the engagement
          ring that she wears on the necklace around her neck...

                         YOUNGER JACK
          We should just tell everybody.

                         YOUNGER JULIA
          No, when we come home...
          They KISS...

                         

                         

                         

                         

          95.

          TNT. A DARK ROOM - NIGHT
          Their bodies entwined. Kissing, touching. Clothing
          pulled away. Staring into each other's eyes.

          INT. NASA CREW APARTMENT - EARLY DAWN

          Younger Jack stares out the window at the Odyssey on its
          launchpad in the distance. Steam rolls off its engines.
          It's being readied to launch.

                         YOUNGER JULIA
          Hey...
          He looks over, smiles. She's naked under the sheets,
          happy, smiling back at him.

          EXT. CRATER LAKE - MORNING (PRESENT)

          Jack's eyes blink open. Julia is asleep near him,
          peaceful. He turns, stares into the lightening morning
          sky. The Tet rising with the sun.

          EXT. CRATER LAKE -- MORNING

          Jack walks to the water's edge. He stares at the
          reflection of the Tet in the glassy surface of the lake.
          And under that, a fish, nibbling algae...
          He smiles at the fish.

          JULIA (O.S. )
          Good morning.
          He turns. She's there, arms held around herself against
          the chill of morning. They look at each other, so much
          to be said.

                         JACK
          We can't stay here.
          She smiles, nods.

          INT. BUBBLESHIP 2 - DAY

          Jack and Julia fly low over terrain. As the Bubbleship
          crests a rise and drops down into a steep canyon, she
          takes his hand. He glances at her, lets his hand stay in
          hers. The entrance to Raven Rock looms ahead...

          His eyes narrow. There's SMOKE, drifting from inside
          Raven Rock.

          EXT. RAVEN ROCK - DAY

          As the Bubbleship touches down, the carnage becomes
          clear. A few shattered DRONES lie here and there, but
          there are bodies and smoking blast points everywhere.
          JACK grabs his carbine, heading inside.

                         JACK
          Stay here...

          INT. RAVEN ROCK - DAY

          As Jack moves into the darkness of the ruined Raven Rock,
          his suit's lights blaze on. He moves in, weapon ready.
          Bodies are everywhere, blasted to pieces.
          FIRES still burn here and there. Paint bubbles on
          burning canvas. Records melt and drip in the heat...
          Jack turns a corner, finds Sykes STARING AT HIM! But his
          eyes are dead. Sykes still holds a spear implanted in a
          Drone's wrecked body.
          A FLICKERING LIGHT draws Jack's attention.

          INT. RAVEN ROCK, CHAMBER - CONTINUOUS

          BEECH is slumped in a chair, blastburnt, clutching a
          charred black box in his arms. His eyes half-lidded, he

                         STARES AT:
          Newsreel footage, from when the Tet arrived. On the
          screen crowds stare, the UN meets, Cults form.
          THE MOON in the sky, its surface VIBRATES, then starts to
          come apart. People SCREAM... Cutting to War Footage.
          Alien Troop-ships touching down, their design distinctly
          Tet-like. They discharge waves of warriors...
          CLOSE ON: Hand held, war-journalism. We see the alien
          soldiers pushing back resistance. All of them are
          versions of Jack. One sights the cameraman, BLAM! Blows
          him away. Camera hits dirt..
          SMASH! Jack is there next to Beech. He's just pushed
          the projector over.

          Beech slowly, painfully, looks at him. Little emotion in
          Beech, just resigned recognition.

                         BEECH (CONT'D)
          Later, there were new versions.
          More... creative. The Tet needed
          something different. And finally
          there was... you.

                         JACK
          I'm the weapon of this war.
          BEECH smiles sardonic, nods.

          The Tet. The clockmaker God.
          Such brilliant, complex

          Jack kneels in front of Beech. The old man's eyes are
          open, fixed on the artwork, the remnants of humanity...
          But they don't blink any longer. Beech is dead.
          Jack reaches up, closes Beech's eyes. He removes the box
          from Beech's arms: The flight recorder from the odyssey.

                         JULIA'S VOICE
          There is a way.
          Julia stands in the doorway to the library.

          The room destroyed. The disassembled Drone a smoking
          hulk. Jack works in front of an open Delta Sleep Pod
          from the Odyssey. He HAULS the cylindrical BOMB to the
          Pod, slots it into the space for personal effects...

                         JULIA
          Is it ready?
          Julia is standing at the entrance to the room. He nods

          She moves to climb in, then turns to Jack and kisses him.
          It's a kiss filled with a lifetime of kisses missed.
          Finally, it breaks. She backs away, into the Pod, next
          to the BOMB. Trembling as the door starts to CLOSE.
          Suddenly, she's very scared. Fighting back panic.

          He touches a button and a pale gas starts to fill the

          The Bubbleship hovers high above the clouds, the Delta
          Pod attached beneath it. Jack STARES down at the earth.
          He hits a control and the ship rotates, so it's facing
          upwards towards the Tet which fills the sky above. Jack
          touches the throttle and the Bubbleship begins to CLIMB.
          Jack has the odyssey flight recorder on the seat next to
          him. He touches a control and THE AUDIO fills the
          canopy. It's distant, fuzzy, recorded from deep space.
          Jack listens as the Tet grows in size in front of him.

          ORIGINAL JACK'S VOICE
          Good morning folks, this is
          captain Jack Harper here in the
          cockpit. We're settling in at a
          cool one hundred and fifty clicks
          from the unidentified flying
          object...

          The ORIGINAL JACK in the Pilot's seat, ORIGINAL VICTORIA
          next to him, co-piloting. Jack GRINS as he peers out at
          the Tet, just a small geometry among the stars...

                         ORIGINAL JACK
          (to Mission Control)
          So far, from this distance, we're
          still reading zero heat
          signatures, no sign of organic
          life. Did I mention we're still
          really far away?

                         ORIGINAL VICTORIA
          Mission plan has us approaching to
          one hundred kilometers, doing our
          initial readouts...

                         ORIGINAL JACK
          Yes, because everyone knows, if
          you want to really know something,
          one hundred kilometers is the best

                         DISTANCE --

                         ORIGINAL VICTORIA
          Stop. We don't know what it is,

          I think she just made my point --

          INT. BUBBLESHIP 2 - CONTINUOUS (PRESENT)

          Jack touches a control, the sound from the recorder FAST
          FORWARDS. Hours and hours of time on the odyssey fly by.
          The Bubbleship has reached the stratosphere where the
          blue sky gives way to black space. We see the small ship
          detach from the blue curve of earth, the blackness of
          space in front of it.

                         JACK
          Bob, let's prep for outer
          atmosphere.
          OUTSIDE, the Bubbleship starts to transform for outer

          It could be inert. Anything on it
          could be long gone by now.

          ORIGINAL VICTORIA (CONT'D)
          (to Mission Control)
          I agree with Commander Harper. It
          crossed whatever light years of
          space and time to come this close
          to us. We're not going to really
          know anything about it from this
          far away.

          INT. BUBBLESHIP 2 - CONTINUOUS PRESENT

          Jack sits in the Bubbleship, the Tet looming above, the
          voices surrounding him.., remembering.

          INT. ODYSSEY SPACE SHUTTLE - NO TIME (FLASHBACK)

          They must have been given clearance to approach, because

          What are you doing?

          He lifts out of his seat, floats back towards the mid-

          He looks over. original Victoria is already pulling on
          her spacesuit...
          A last glance back at Julia, then he turns away. He
          smiles at Victoria, drifts next to her, pulling out a
          small camera and pointing it back at the two of them...

                         JACK
          Let's make history.
          FLASH. The birth of the picture of the two of them, eyes
          filled with anticipation. The photo in Jack's locker.

          EXT. THE ODYSSEY IN SPACE - NO TIME

          The shuttle airlock cracks. Two figures in Space Suits
          emerge. Small puffs of gas, they head towards...
          REVERSE ANGLE. The Tet MASSIVE in front of them. Their
          small forms shrinking at they approach it.
          CLOSE ON JACK. His face seen through his visor as they
          approach. Filled with wonder. The dark shadow of the
          Tet crossing over him, blacking out everything.

          INT. BUBBLE SHIP 2 --- CONTINUOUS PRESENT

          Our Jack sits at the controls, the Tet now similarly
          massive in front of him, blotting out all other sight.
          He glances at the Bobblehead, which trembles from the
          ship's engines.

          It's okay Bob, I'm scared too.

          INT. THE TET, OUTTER CHAMBERS - CONTINUOUS

          The TET is obviously of alien manufacture. In this huge
          bay, other BUBBLESHIPS are being constructed, welded

          BEHIND THE BUBBLESHIP. DRONES detach from the walls of

          BOOM! A drone blast EXPLODES A whole engine of the ship.
          The Bubbleship goes into an uncontrollable SPIN, headed
          straight at a WALL...

          Julia looks down at her hands which hold: A rolled
          canvas, the only object inside the metal cylinder. She
          unrolls it now. We glimpse a girl lying in golden
          fields, a farmhouse in the distance. The painting from
          Ravens Rock that reminded her of home.

          The Tet arrived almost half a
          century ago. And it changed our
          world forever...
          We're at CRATER LAKE, three years in the future.
          The Grotto has been turned into a house, the ground has
          been cultivated. Roses and yellow flowers grow near the
          house. A SOLAR ARRAY powers the spot. All Jack's
          scavenging has gone to very good use. There's a small
          make-shift boat moored at the Lake's edge.

          JULIA (V.0.)
          It was probably surprised, what we
          were willing to do, to survive.
          Jack's basketball sits alone near the hoop.

          JULIA (V.0.)
          We had to unlearn what it meant,
          to call something our home.
          There's a familiar painting, hanging on the wall. The
          girl in the field of wheat, yearning towards home.

          JULIA (V.0.)
          But we did. We started over. And
          so here we are now, everyone
          that's left...

                         (CONTINUED)

                         CONTINUED:
          JULIA is turning over a patch of ground for next year.
          Next to her, A CHILD is digging her fingers through loam.
          The CHILD looks up, stares across the water.

                         JULIA
          Well, almost everyone.
          A MAN stands at the edge of the water, on the opposite
          side. He wears the wrecked remains of a worksuit, and
          carries a pack. It is Jack 2. He's aged three years,
          his hair has grown, his boots are scavenged. He has
          travelled a long way, and we know that as he stares
          across the water, he knows exactly what he is looking at.

                         CHILD
          Who is that?
          ON JULIA. It's been a long journey to this moment for
          her as well. She smiles.

                         JULIA
          It's your father. Come on, let's
          go pick him up.

          END.

            This is a copy of the 1st revised draft of Omega Man, back when it was still titled I Am Legend. I obtained a copy of this script from a charity auction for retired actors; the script was signed by Charlton Heston and Producer Walter Seltzer. I AM LEGEND Screenplay By John William Corrington First Draft: 6/26/70 Revised: 7/18/70 Property of Walter Seltzer Productions Inc. Warner Bros. Studios I AM LEGEND FADE IN: WIDE ANGLE MED. LONG SHOT WE SEE a palm-lined richly attractive street in a Los Angeles suburb. The houses are set back from the street; the street itself is quiet, empty -- except for a few cars parked in front of the houses. While the camera takes no notice, the tires are down on the parked cars, the lawns of the houses are uncut. A Ford experimental model convertible turns corner INTO VIEW. It drives at a medium speed. MED. CLOSE SHOT - NEVILLE IN CAR - HEAD ON ROBERT NEVILLE is driving car. He wears sunglasses, a sport shirt, a neckerchief, and looks altogether like a wealthy man out for a drive. CAMERA ALLOWS CAR TO PULL ABREAST, so that SHOT BECOMES SIDE ANGLE. As the CAMERA ENTERS passenger space of the car, we HEAR MUSIC, "Everybody's Out Of Town." Neville hums along with it. He seems at ease, unconcerned. We SEE the houses on his right side passing by. Then his humming stops, his jaw tightens. The car stops with vicious suddenness, and CAMERA PULLS BACK to MED. SHOT, as if aghast at the sight to follow. Neville, in a single motion of astonishing speed, comes up with a sten gun in his right hand, fires directly INTO CAMERA. REVERSE SHOT - DARKENED BALCONY WINDOW OF HOUSE CAMERA ZOOMS IN from MED. LONG to MED. CLOSE SHOT of a deeply shadowed window in one of the houses. Bullets smash into the frame of the window, tear out chunks of the stucco. We SEE, barely, a figure fall backward. We cannot see any details of the figure. Its presence is more intuited than seen. CLOSE SHOT - NEVILLE'S FACE IN F.G. is Nevilles sten gun, almost obscuring his features. FREEZE-FRAME. CUT TO: CREDIT MONTAGE A rapid series of SHOTS as titles begin. Title of film is not shown now but held to the last frame of the film. Titles begin with star names, etc. and are distributed over following scenes except where noted. ALIEN MISSILE being raised to point toward sky. FACE OF CHINESE SOLDIER twisted with anger, SCREAMING. TV SCREEN - IN THE CLEAR - MATTHIAS READING NEWS MATTHIAS ... the Sino-Russian border war continues to escalate, according to... ANOTHER MISSILE RISING. Under this and subsequent FLASH CUTS there should be the constant CRACKLING SOUND of RADIO transmissions in Russian and Chinese. MEETING ROOM with a small number of officials angry, frightened. On the wall behind there are crossed red flags, a portrait of Lenin. ANOTHER MISSILE. We HEAR, overlapping one another, Chinese and Russian VOICES counting down almost together from ten to one like a chorus of doom. Missile is fired SOUND BREAKS OFF. FLASH CUTS OF SERIES OF ATOMIC BLASTS, one after another, each one a slightly CLOSER SHOT, garbled RADIO TRANSMISSIONS under SHOTS -- including French, Russian, Chinese, British and American accents.

Attention ... Yellow Alert..." ZOOM SHOT - PAST OFFICERTS FACE TO ILLUMINATED WALL MAP At edge, we begin to SEE RADAR-STYLE BLIPS approaching North American continent from East. Radio transmissions increase in intensity, volume, and in the GARBLED HYSTERIA, which is just below the voices. "Condition Red ... Red... Red ... Bogies on screen ... origin ... What is origin? What is origin?... Asia ... no, Jesus, from all over. They're both ... we see... both of them are ... PROCESS SHOT - MISSILES IN SPACE SOUND is killed for this and similar SHOTS. Alien missiles apparently motionless in space with the earth turning very slowly below. MED. CLOSE SHOT - ANTI-MISSILE MISSILES being raised, fired.

Tracking is...ninety seconds to initial... PROCESS SHOT - ANTI-MISSILES IN SPACE showing anti-missiles zeroing in on the much larger alien missiles. SOUND OFF. WE SEE some of the small missiles about to hit the larger ones. MED. SHOT - MILITARY TECHNICIANS at consoles. CAMERA PANS TO WALL MAP showing small blips conjoining with the large ones6 SOUND SUDDENLY. "Abort antis ... repeat abort.... configuration..." MED. SHOT - MILITARY TECHNICIANS They frown at one another, one shrugs. SOUND: another VOICE, "Impact... Impact... score mounting. Impact on thirty percent of incoming ... now fifty-one point six. Impact.." PROCESS SHOT - MISSILES COLLIDING MED. SHOT - MILITARY TECHNICIANS as they hear the transmissions, their expression of nonunderstanding turns to one of panic. SOUND: Initial VOICE, "Abort firings. Missiles do not conform to nuclear-configurations. Repeat, abort firings. Do not intercept. Non-nuclear attack underway ... Repeat, non-nuclear attack underway. PROCESS SHOT - MISSILES EXPLODING Color of explosions should be geared to the color of water in the plaza fountain, which is perhaps illuminated by CAMERA orange and red and yellow spots under the water. IMAGE BLURS at explosion. CAMERA MOVES DOWNWARD from explosion, picking up earth far below, keeps going down more and more rapidly, finally BLURRING In speed. VERY HIGH SHOT - SHOPPING CENTER CAMERA is still going DOWN, less rapidly. This SHOT seems to follow out of preceding one. At first, we SEE the shopping center, then SHOT CENTERS at the sidewalk In front of a single store. It is a Saturday afternoon, hundreds of people milling about, many oars moving. SHOT-finally NARROWS down on a single man walking out of store. CAMERA MOVES TO CLOSE SHOT. Man looks vaguely troubled, then panicked, grabs his eyes, his head CAMERA MOVES IN for a VERY CLOSE SHOT of his face, then his mouth alone as he opens It to give a blood curdling HOWL of agony and fear. VERY CLOSE SHOT - CAR STRIKING POLE The driver is dead or dying. His car veers crazily into another car, ends up striking pole. TV ANNOUNCER - IN THE CLEAR MATTHIAS MATTHIAS ... the entire Los Angeles area. Already, hospital facilities have begun to crack under the strain and Civil Defense authorities state that the situation is much the same... MED. SHOT - TV SCREEN - IN THE CLEAR - MATTHIAS from between heads of two people watching TV. We watch the screen and then, as fragment of news reporter's story is cut off, CAMERA REVERSES showing people watching are dead, eyes, mouths open. MATTHIAS ... across the entire country. Martial law is now nation-wide. Whether a state of war between China and Russia -still exists is not important any longer. Our fellow countrymen are dying. The very foundations of civilization are beginning to crumble... CLOSE SHOT - RADIO It is a small transistor on a counter in a filling station. As CAMERA PULLS OUT showing station deserted, cars stopped here and there, a man and woman dead in a convertible at the gas pumps. ANNOUNCER ... CONELRAD channel. This is a class one emergency. All civilian traffic is barred from streets and highways. Stay in your homes... CLOSE SHOT - RADIO IN POLICE CAR We SEE the receiver, HEAR the emergency message as CAMERA PULLS BACK revealing a policeman lying, eyes open, across the steering wheel of the car. ANNOUNCER Those found without specific military orders are subject to summary execution ... Repeat This is a... LONG SHOT - DOWN A H0SPITAL CORRIDOR As the CAMERA PANS HALLS, WARDS, ETC., there are, here and there, a few bodies in the hallways, the beds are full. MED. CLOSE SHOT - IN THE CLEAR - NEVILLE IN LABORATORY Neville sits at his desk in white lab coat, sign on desk says COLONEL ROBERT NEVILLE. He is watching a small TV on his desk. MATTHIAS so now the question is survival. Is this the end of technological man? Is this the conclusion of all our yesterdays, the boasts of science, the superhuman conquests of space and time... the age of the wheel? Neville grimaces, shakes his head. At the end of next speech PHONE RINGS. MATTHIAS We were warned of judgment. Well, It's come now. This is the Judgement, the weeping and gnashing of teeth... Oh, God, where will it end...? CLOSE SHOT - NEVILLE ON PHONE nodding, face set. NEVILLE Yes. Soits airborne bacteria. Let's try-vaccine 93-b-71. How the hell do I know? I don't... It might. Ill be there in an hour. NEVILLE RUNNING DOWN CORRIDORS with small satchel. NEVILLE ON AIRSTRIP running toward waiting helicopter. He wears fatigue coveralls. NEVILLE IN AIRBORNE HELICOPTER with satchel of vaccine in lap. PILOT next to-him. ZOOM SHOT - TO PILOT grabbing eyes, falling forward onto controls. HELICOPTER GOING DOWN Neville showing signs of illness too. HELICOPTER CRASHED Neville drags himself from wreck. Only one bottle of vaccine is unbroken. He injects himself, passes out. LAST TITLE FADE OUT. FADE IN: MED. LONG SHOT - INT. DARK TRAVEL AGENCY from rear of office. There are posters on the walls: "See Mexico." "Visit London," "TWA to Hong Kong," etc. Dust is over everything, the floors are filthy and-, littered with paper. CAMERA points out OPEN DOOR to street. Suddenly we SEE Neville FLASH by in his car. CUT TO: LONG BOOM SHOT - DOWN ANGLE ON EMPTY STREET from roof of building. In left F.G. WE SEE clothesline. Clothes hanging on it are bleached. have begun to fall apart. We HEAR in DISTANCE ' high-pitched ROAR of Neville's ENGINE. Then he races by in street below. CUT TO: MED. SHOT - DESERTED SCHOOL ROOM CAMERA points out OPEN WINDOWI- with a broken blind hanging alongside. In left frame, next window has Easter bunnies, eggs, etc. made by children. In right side of frame, teacher's desk with small flag, rotten apple. Again, SOUND of CAR, Neville passes outside. CUT TO: MED. SHOT - NEVILLE IN CAR As he rounds corner, he sees things lying scattered in the street ahead. He tries to stop, but runs over them. CLOSE SHOT - TIRE GOING FLAT MED. SHOT - NEVILLE GETTING OUT OF CAR He is irritated, looks around as if seeking a filling station attendant in order to get tire fixed. Glances down. He has run over a broken steel box, with US Mint markings. Its torn hinges have shredded the tire, and the gold ingots it contained are scattered under the wheels. He glances across street. A Brink's truck sits crashed into a fire hydrant, its rear doors open, swinging useless in breeze. Mint boxes and gold bullion lying unguarded. MED. CLOSE SHOT - NEVILLE His expression is one of total disgust. He speaks sardonically. NEVILLE Why don't they keep the goddamn street clean. MED. SHOT - NEVILLE He unloads car, hangs gun over his back, puts a few grenades in his belt, lifts gas can. As he walks away from car, he muses. NEVILLE There was a Mercedes agency on Sunset. Or was it Wilshire? MED. LONG SHOT - NEVILLE WALKING Ahead is the agency. Windows are broken. A 230SL convertible sits in the showroom. Neville walks through the broken window, walks around car. NEVILLE The color's not right, but ... how long did you say it takes to get a new one from Germany...? He walks to another car. NEVILLE How about this one? One careful Pasadena driver in tennis shoes? What's her phone number? MED. SHOT - NEVILLE SERVICING CAR He has put in battery, gas, etc. He closes hood, gets in. Glances at watch. NEVILLE My God, is it that late? He guns the motor and drives out through the broken window. CUT TO: . WIDE ANGLE LONG SHOT - NEVILLE IN CAR We see Neville speeding down an empty main thoroughfare, the car accelerating faster and faster. He makes an impossible turn, the car bottoming, righting itself, fishtailing, straightening out and zooming on. CUT TO: WIDE ANGLE SHOT - A DIFFERENT PERSPECTIVE A long DOWN SHOT, which shows the car reaching speeds of over a hundred miles an hour. CUT TO: VERY CLOSE SHOT - NEVILLE IN CAR This is HEAD ON. Nevilles concentration, his tension must show. He looks like a master-driver in the ultimate test of his career. Meanwhile, it is getting darker, closer to night. CUT TO: WIDE ANGLE LONG SHOT - NEVILLE IN CAR CAMERA RUSHES IN as SHOT OPENS, to MED. SHOT of the car careening down a deserted street in absolute recklessness. As Neville nears the end of the street, he slightly sideswipes a car parked out from the curb. VERY CLOSE SHOT - TIRES AND LOWER SECTION OF CAR Tires squeal as Neville turns corner. CAMERA MOVES OUT TO MEDIUM SHOT as car rights itself and shoots away. MED. SHOT - NEVILLE IN CAR The car lights are on now, and as Neville slows down, it is deep twilight. He turns into drive in front of a tall apartment building. CAMERA MOVES IN TO MED. CLOSE SHOT of Neville in car. He presses remote-control button and WE SEE garage door open ahead of him. CAMERA SWIEEPS to Neville's face. He shows relief, as if he has made, It through a very tough race indeed. MED. SHOT - DOWN ANGLE FROM BEHIND CAR As Neville guns motor and starts into garage, a figure detaches itself from growing darkness and leaps onto him. The figure seems simply to materialize) and it leaps high, landing almost in the car. Neville tries to fight back as the car drifts down the drive into garage. MED. SHOT - INT. GARAGE from within the garage. WE SEE the car drifting down the ramp into garage, Neville and the black-clad figure wrestle as the car, at low speed, crashes into a pillar or another car. Neville pushes the black figure away, hits him, hits him again, jumps from the car with his sten gun and fires a burst into the black figure. CAMERA RUSHES IN FOR CLOSE SHOT OF NEVILLE as he turns from the fallen figure. He looks outward at the still-open garage door, his face reflecting fear, horror. REVERSE SHOT - GARAGE DOOR AREA Two more black-clad figures are rushing in armed with clubs or spears. CLOSE SHOT - NEVILLE CAMERA JERKS as Neville fires his sten gun directly into LENS. Above the gun, his face is clenched in hatred, loathing. MED. SHOT - GARAGE DOOR AREA The door is lowering now. There is a body lying in a dark heap-just inside. WE can SEE one or two others scurrying away outside in the dark as the door closes4 MED. SHOT - NEVILLE He has lowered his gun, holds the remote-control box, pressing the button to lower the door. He is exhausted, shoulders slumped. He walks through the garage stopping to check a large gasoline-powered generator that has been jury-rigged to a panel to distribute current. There are shelves full of oil and batteries and similar supplies. He walks through the low-lighted garage. There are several rows of bright automobiles, sports cars, jeeps, a few pick-up trucks, a single armored car. All are kept in good condition, brightly polished. Neville walks back out into the open area of the garage, surveying the damage to the Mercedes, shaking his head. NEVILLE That's a shame. So hard to get a repairman these days, too. MED. SHOT - NEVILLE AT ELEVATOR Neville unlocks an elevator, gets in and pushes the button for the top floor. NEVILLE Penthouse, Robert. He's probably anxious to get on with the game. He leans back against the side of the elevator, eyes closed, exhausted, but still on the verge of laughter. NEVILLE Some game... CUT TO: LONG SHOT - ELEVATOR DOOR OPENING - NEVILLE The elevator opens directly into penthouse. Neville coming OUT into his fortress-apartment. In left F.G. of SHOT is silhouette of profile of what appears to be a man in a military--cap. Neville drops sten gun slowly to the floor, looks around room, his eyes light on figure. NEVILLE Okay, Okay, Im ready. CAMERA MOVES PAST SILHOUETTE, MOVES ACROSS LARGE ORNATE CHESSBOARD in middle F.G. to MED. SHOT on Neville-. He pulls off dirty shirt, tosses it aside, walks to his left. CAMERA STAYS ON HIM. NEVILLE Go ahead ... move. Neville walks into what seems another world, as CAMERA TURNS to FOLLOW HIM. It is a very long gallery-like room with many mahogany bookcases, walls covered with major paintings, pieces of sculpture here and there. He walks to a beautiful and ornate bar-liquor-cabinet, takes down a bottle of fine scotch. He pauses and studies the label as he twists off the cap. He speaks back over his shoulder. NEVILLE Why dont you have a belt? It might improve your game. He takes a long pull from the bottle, then moves on to the far end of the room where we can SEE a beautiful bed, armoire, old fashioned wash-basin, mirror, etc. These are perhaps screened off from the rest of the long gallery area by some bookcases set at right angles to the wall, forming a small chamber behind. CAMERA STAYS at ENTRANCE to SMALL CHAMBER. Neville rummages for a clean shirt, slips it on. NEVILLE But tonight you're going to lose. Luck over skill... CAMERA MOVES IN QUICKLY FOR CLOSE SHOT showing that beneath is sardonic humor, Nevilles loneliness and isolation tell on him. MED. CLOSE SHOT - NEVILLE He still carries glass, and is rummaging again, this time in a storage cabinet. It is white, antiseptic, very large. It contains a multitude of canned goods. Neville gets out a can of beans. He moves to stainless steel refrigerator, also large, gets out a summer sausage, and ice cubes and a chilled glass for scotch. NEVILLE You hear all that downstairs? I let sundown catch me out. So he took the gambit and threw away a few pawns. I was lucky... Neville opens can, cuts casing off one end of sausage. CAMERA moves OUT to MED. SHOT, showing this opposite end of apartment. It is as stark, barren and utilitarian as the other end is cultivated and civilized. In it are kitchen facilities, laboratory equipment, and a massive arsenal. (See Appendix for more on apartment) NEVILLE From time to time he gets nervous. He smells the end game coming... Neville is looking toward center of room as he talks. CAMERA MOVES BACK so as to place chessboard once more in middle F.G. Neville is walking toward board, scotch bottle and glass In one hand, beans (with spoon in can) in other. Summer sausage Is slang across his shoulder, held by string looped over finger of hand holding beans. He saunters to board, looks down studying situation. We now have time to SEE that the board, and its pieces, are both large and superb: a museum-quality set. NEVILLE But end games are fall of surprises, arent they? Ummm. My move, and discovered ... check! He puts down beans and sausage on edge of table, and moves knight, revealing check from his queen on opponent's king. Neville smiles and sits down. MED. SHOT - ACROSS BOARD - NEVILLE'S POINT OF VIEW We find that his partner is a bust of Caesar propped in the chair with an old and badly battered garrison cap on it. Cap bears eagle Insignia of colonel. CAMERA MOVES TO TWO SHOT. Neville studies board, absently presses a switch located under the table. After a moment, we HEAR MUSIC. It is Frankie Laine singing "We'll Be Together Again." RECORD No tears, no fears, we both have a lifetime before us... So what if we have to part, we'll be together again... Neville hits reject switch. Another tune, instrumental COMES ON. "Harlem Nocturne," Ted Heath's orchestra; alto sax solo. MED. SHOT -NEVILLE AT CHESS BOARD Neville makes a move on board. As he does, we HEAR NOISE, COMMOTION outside. Breaking glass, yells. Neville stands, studying board Intently. As the noise INCREASES, CAMERA MOVES to CLOSE SHOT of his FACE. His jaw tightens at he tries to Ignore the SOUNDS. ZACHARY (O.S.) Come out, Neville Neville sighs, smiles at bust. NEVILLE Excuse me, won't you. Just for a moment. He walks quietly to window, reaches down and picks up a Springfield 1903 rifle with a Sniperscope attached. He steps to the window. The windows are full-length and open onto a narrow balcony. All along the balcony rail, spaced every thirty feet or so, are floodlights pointed down into plaza in front of building. Neville has knocked out partitions between portions of balcony so as to have access to flood lights all along building. Down below In plaza or courtyard, there Is a large and brightly illuminated fountain, water bubbling In it, cascading from level to another. Neville stares out over darkened city. In far distance, perhaps a mile away, we SEE a fire start up, blaze higher. REVERSE SHOT - NEVILLE'S SILHOUETTE IN WINDOW NEVILLE They're at It again. Burning, wrecking. I wonder what tonight? A library? A laboratory? Maybe they've found the Museum of Fine Art. Goddamn those crazy bastards... MED. CLOSE SHOT - NEVILLE AT WINDOW He raises the rifle. LONG SHOT - INFRA-RED TELESCOPIC SHOT PANNING weird and unreal area outside range of floodlights. Passes a hunched, squatting figure. Stops, moves back Crosshairs glow as sight is given fine adjustment. IMAGE RECOILS as we HEAR REPEAT OF RIFLE. Figure slumps. MORE NOISE, CONFUSION, CRIES. MED. CLOSE SHOT - NEVILLE SHOT is across chessboard, through pieces from busts POINT OF VIEW. Neville is grinning sardonically. He raises the rifle in salute. NEVILLE Hall Caesar! And what do you suppose Brother Matthias is going to say about that? CUT TO: MED. LONG BOOM SHOT - NEVILLE AT TABLE SHOT is from outside window. CAMERA IMMEDIATELY PULLS BACK farther and farther until we SEE Neville's penthouse, a circle of brilliant light in an ocean of surrounding darkened buildings, no street lights. CAMERA HOLDS when penthouse is only a small glimmer of light. (Matte) DISSOLVE TO: CLOSE SHOT - FIRE IN FOG. Fire flickers as CAMERA PULLS BACK to reveal that it Is made 'up of burning books. CAMERA PANS titles: Molecular Biology, Astrophysics, etc. In B.G. we see many members of the Family systematically wrecking scientific and computer equipment. MATTHIAS (O.S.) Three? You're sure? Not three. ZACHARY (O.S.) Three, Brother. Two were inside the garage when he brought down the door, We heard the shooting. Then Joshua... CAMERA TURNS RIGHT, bringing Matthias INTO FRAME, CLOSE SHOT, head and shoulders. Matthias has dead-white hair, complexion, wears enormous sunglasses with reflecting lenses. MATTHIAS The light, you have to stay clear of the light... CAMERA PULLS BACK, revealing Zachary. He Is like Matthias, white with sunglasses. But his hair Is natural and his features clearly African. Zachary speaks defensively. ZACHARY Brother, there wasn't no light... That cat hit Joshua in pitch black... MATTHIAS He cant see in the dark-...anymore than we can In the light. Zachary shrugs. ZACHARY Go tell him. Brother. He sees good enough, dark or light. Matthias walks in the glare of flames, wrecking continues In B.G. His dialogue is delivered sadly, reasonably at first. MATTHIAS one creature... caught in a place he can't stir from in the dark. One lone man... ZACHARY He aint a man, Brother. MATTHIAS No, no, you're right. But he is alone, outnumbered hundreds to one, with nothing to live for but memories ...nothing to live with but his gimmicks and gadgetry, his guns and ears...and yet the whole Family cant bring him down out of that...that... ZACHARY Pig-paradise, Brother? MED. CLOSE TWO SHOT - MATTHIAS AND ZACHARY Matthias smiles sadly. MATTHIAS Forget the old ways, Brother, the old hatreds, the old pains. The Family is one... Zachary nods, matching Matthias grin. ZACHARY Hog heaven, then... But Matthias is getting worked up. MATTHIAS Its not a joke, Brother. Remember the word! That thing, that Neville, is a creature of the wheel! He uses forbidden weapons, to6.ls! He has the power of Hell In those evil things! CLOSE SHOT - ZACHARY He is agitated, tired of hearing this. He has told them before that he can bring Neville down. He tries again. ZACHARY Well, let me put the power on him. Look... CAMERA FOLLOWS his pointing finger. In a glass-fronted refrigeration unit are flasks of nitroglycerin. CAMERA SNAPS BACK to ZACHARY. ZACHARY ...or there's cannons. I can go to the old Guard armory. I could get a rocket-launcher ... Just turn me loose... MED. SHOT - GROUP - MATTHIAS AND FAMILY We SEE that a group of five or six others who are like Matthias have gathered around while others continue destruction in B.G. The group mumble amongst themselves, shake their heads. Matthias answers him, as if he were explaining to a child. MATTHIAS Oh, yes, Brother, you could do that. Any one of us could. But if we did, The curse would begin once more, don't you see that? CLOSE SHOT - ZACHARY Zachary is sullen. ZACHARY I see that bastard living In the light like God whilst we rot and hide down here like grubs ... What do you reckon will happen if he hunts as out while We sleep? MED. GROUP SHOT MATTHIAS, ZACHARY, OTHERS MATTHIAS Put it out of mind, Brother. He will be destroyed. But not by guns and explosives. They are forbidden. They are never to be used again. When we have cleansed the word the flood of our righteousness will sweep it all away... As Matthias speaks he picks up a book and hurls it toward the fire, knocking elaborate glass structure down. MATTHIAS And Neville will be brought down... down to the Family and judgment. For blasphemy, for murder... As he speaks SLOW DISSOLVE from fire, grown larger now, engulfing whole building behind, to brightly lit top story of Neville's apartment.' VERY LONG SHOT TOP STORY OF NEVILLE'S APARTMENT FADE OUT FADE IN: MED. LONG SHOT - EMPTY STREET, EARLY MORNING The street is one of those with many apartment-hotels, etc., as on portions of Wilshire Blvd. SHOT is through trees, grass is tall in the-lawns, etc. We HEAR NOTHING at first but BIRDS. Then we HEAR the SOUND of someone RUNNING. CAMERA TURNS, finds a LONE FIGURE RUNNING TOWARD IT. SHOT. should be made INTO RISING SUN, sun rays refracted and diffused around dark silhouette of figure. MED. CLOSE SHOT - NEVILLE RUNNING He is in sweat suit, the shirt has JOHNS HOPKINS in large letters on front, his sten gun is on sling over shoulder, canteen and pouches in utility belt at waist. Flashlight, knife, etc. There is also a small tape recorder hung on belt. Neville continues to run, looking from time to time at numbers on buildings. At last he stops in front of a building, inspects it. He is breathing hard. NEVILLE ...And Big Bob Neville shakes off the last of the tacklers and scores with fifty thousand fans tearing up the stands... Another six for Hopkins...yea. Neville. He squats, pulls map from pouch, studies it, speaks into small tape-mike. CAMERA MOVES OUT FOR MED. LONG SHOT OF NEVILLE, down ANGLE from building POINT OF VIEW. NEVILLE This is 6306 Rimini Boulevard, sector two. The last six blocks have been clean. In the 5500 block, some signs they'd been foraging for food in a small drive-in grocery. (sardonically) You'd think prices would keep them in the super markets. MED. CLOSE SHOT - NEVILLE He unlimbers sten gun, checks it, sets it down, checks flashlight. Then he opens canteen, squats and drinks. Assumption is, it's whiskey. He gargles a little, spits it out, studies the building narrow-eyed. Talks into recorder. NEVILLE You've got to hand it to the bastards. They cover their tracks. It's been a damn year now. Drinks again, lets mike-hang, eyes distant in thoughts NEVILLE If I could find the nest, find where he stays thered be an end-run, and an end game, sure enough... He gets up, closes canteen, picks up equipment. NEVILLE But what would I do then...? CUT TO: SERIES OF SHOTS - NEVILLE SEARCHING He moves through dark corridors, into rooms. He is very efficient in his checking, spending only a few moments in each place. MED. SHOT - INT. ROOM Dark, dusty, light falling through half-closed blind. SHOT is ACROSS BED. Neville kicks open door, sees bed. There is someone or something apparently in it. Neville jerks back sheet, sten gun ready. CLOSE SHOT - CORPSE IN BED The body, left from plague-time, is not a skeleton, but simply a decayed and desiccated ruin, disgusting and piteous. CLOSE SHOT - NEVILLETS REACTION He is sickened, his raised adrenaline draining away. MED. SHOT - NEVILLE IN BASEMENT He probes in comers, closets. Obviously is well practiced at this "search and destroy" technique. . MED. SHOT - NEVILLE IN OFFICE BUILDING He is moving. rapidly through offices, dust everywhere, files, etc. scattered.

LONG SHOT - OFFICE - PAST NEVILLETS SHOULDER It is paneled. drapes, dark furniture, thick carpets, etc. It is very long with a huge ornate desk at the far end. Behind the desk, sitting in a large high-backed swivel chair is a body. Neville studies the figure in the chair for a moment. The figure wears a hood, and it is this which keys Nevilles response. CAMERA DRIFTS DOWN ROOM toward figure. CAMERA now in Neville's POINT OF VIEW. CAMERA GLANCES FROM SIDE TO SIDE as it approaches figure, making sure there are no others lurking in corners. CAMERA STOPS on MED. SHOT, figure in chair, it stirs. NEVILLE (O.S.) All right, Dracula. Wake up. You've got company. Figure does not move. WE SEE BARREL of sten gun poked toward him from BOTTOM OF FRAME. We cannot see eyes of figure. NEVILLE (O.S.) Where's Matthias? Where does he stay? Figure does not move. MED. CLOSE SHOT - NEVILLE He shrugs, sighs. NEVILLE I always ask, and I always get the same answer (beat) Once more: where's the hive? Where does the king bee stay? MED. CLOSE SHOT - FIGURE IN CHAIR As Neville finishes speech, he pokes figure with barrel of gun. It falls forward, hood coming off. It Is dead and Disintegrating. SHOT HOLDS. We HEAR Neville's VOICE into tape recorder. NEVILLE (O.S.) 6806 Rimini Boulevard, sector two. Found another. Matthias' crowd is dying from the plague, one by one. Sweep continues. DISSOLVE TO: FADE IN: LONG SHOT - NEVILLE WALKING ALONG STREET He walks, one hand in pocket, a sten gun In the other, window-shopping. Some of the windows in the stores are broken. Behind others, the displays are askew, dusty. A liquor store Is almost demolished. He reaches an expensive looking clothing store, pauses, walks inside. Dialogue Is VOICE OVER. He palls off sweatshirt, drops it on floor. NEVILLE You dumb bastard, why did you ever bother to wash these things? Youre the only consumer left in town. CUT TO: MED. SHOT - NEVILLE IN MENIS CLOTHING DEPARTMENT He takes a garment from the rack, looks at it, drops it then frowns, picks it up and re-hangs it on the rack. He draws out a beautiful brocade tuxedo jacket, turns it, smiles, hangs it back. NEVILLE The Officers club is closed, isn't it? Permanent undress is the correct uniform. CUT TO: LONG SHOT - NEVILLE WALKING THROUGH DARKENED STORE Away from windows, it is shadowy in-the store, and we watch Neville walking, some clothes over his arm. SHOT is PAST HEAD AND SHOULDER OF A MANNIKIN. CUT TO: LONG SHOT - THE SAME - ANOTHER ANGLE Again POINT OF VIEW of a manikin -- as if those inert figures are watching Neville's progress past them. He seems unconcerned, but his sten gun is in his right hand. MED. LONG SHOT - ANOTHER ANGLE THIS SHOT is from between the upraised arms of a manikin. CLOSE SHOT - FACE OF MALE MANIKIN CLOSE SHOT - ANOTHER MANIKIN CLOSE SHOT - NEVILLE'S FACE He has stopped in relatively light portion of store. He is looking up, face filled almost with reverence. MED. UP ANGLE SHOT - FEMALE MANIKIN This manikin wears a very brief bikini. She is remarkably life-like. Her hips jut forward provocatively, her eyes point down toward Neville, and her long brown hair falls about her tanned shoulders. She wears the smallest of smiles. MED. SHOT - NEVILLE LOOKING UP AT MANIKIN This SHOT is past the head and shoulder of another manikin across the aisle from where Neville stands. It is as if his moment of passion and remembrance is overseen. MED. CLOSE SHOT - NEVILLE - SIDE VIEW He is I still looking upward. He puts out his hand to touch the almost-flesh of the manikin. Then, suddenly, there Is a small indefinite SOUND. He pauses, his jaw tightens. CAMERA RUSHES BACK TO MED. LONG SHOT as Neville whirls, sten gun up, clothing dropped. He is about to fire. MED. SHOT - GROUP OF MANNIKINS AND LISA These are female manikins including some with Negro features, In various dress, various poses. CAMERA FINDS LISA AMONG THEM, MOVES IN SUDDENLY TO MED. CLOSE SHOT. WE SEE the "manikins" mouth open In horror. MED. LONG SHOT - NEVILLE'S POINT OF VIEW - LISA Lisa turns suddenly and vanishes Into the shadows of the store. CLOSE SHOT - NEVILLE He is petrified. He cannot believe what he has seen. The gun hangs useless in his hand. He stands thus for's long moment, then, finding his voice, he calls after her. NEVILLE Wait...come back...wait... Youre real! Youre not... LONG SHOT - NEVILLE RUNNING THROUGH STORE Again, this SHOT is through a group of male manikins, well dressed, grinning at Neville as he runs. MED. LONG SHOT - ANOTHER ANGLE - NEVILLE RUNNING He gets another glimpse of the girl as she runs out a side door of the store. MED. SHOT EXT. STORE This store is across the street from a large park. Neville pauses outside the store, looking up and down. CAMERA RUSHES BACK TO VERY LONG SHOT, still focussed on Neville. When CAMERA STOPS, the SHOT is FRAMED by the girl's hair and one shoulder. We do not see her face, but we can tell she is looking back at Neville from within the park. CAMERA ZOOMS IN on Neville again as he sees the girl. He begins running across the deserted street toward her. SEQUENCE OF SHOTS - NEVILLE RUNNING THROUGH PARK In none of these shots do we see the girl again. We see Neville running through trees, past a lake or stream; pausing to get his breath ' looking in all directions. He is almost frenzied. It has been almost two years since he has seen a normal human being alive -- much less a lovely girl. As the sequence ends, he is obviously exhausted. The shadows are much longer now. It is afternoon. MED. CLOSE SHOT - NEVILLE SEATED ON BENCH He sits, head down, his gun beside him. He is beginning to wonder if he has hallucinated the girl, if at last he is slipping toward insanity. NEVILLE Does it begin this way? Is two years alone too much? Then his head comes up. He has control again. NEVILLE No. you silly bastard, it doesn't begin this way, and two years alone is all right. The way it begins is asking yourself idiot questions. Now, let's find a drink before it's time to go home. He stands up, stretches, looks refreshed. DISSOLVE TO: CLOSE SHOT - CANDLE GUTTERING IN HOLDER CAMERA PULLS BACK, showing Neville in bar mirror. He drinks from glass, pours a little more from bottle, turns from-the bar. The room Is dark, light coming only from candle and from windows at front. The door is open. Neville, sten gun in left hand, drink in right, walks through tables, stands at door. Across the street is a federal court building. His eyes go up its height as CAMERA TURNS for LONG SHOT of BUILDING, Neville In RIGHT SIDE of FRAME. MED. CLOSE SHOT - NEVILLE BACK INSIDE He puts down empty glass, starts to pick 'up his equipment. Suddenly pauses as he HEARS a CRASH from a breaking bottle. His jaw tightens, he becomes tense and turns toward sound. CLOSE SHOT - WINE KEG DISPLAY Sign reads "Visit Our Wine Cellar -- For the Experience of a Lifetime" MED. SHOT - NEVILLE He squints at sigh, heads for the stairway with candle. MED, SHOT - NEVILLE GOING DOWN STAIRS WITH CANDLE MED. LONG SHOT - NEVILLE IN CELLAR This should be a spooky and generally tense atmosphere. The cellar, like much contemporary commercial architecture is made to look like an "authentic" wine cellar, and two years' dust and cobwebs have improved on art. SHOT is from BEHIND wine rack, over bottles, showing Neville at foot of steps, looking about cautiously. He puts candle on hogshead for general lighting, pulls out flashlight to examine MED. REVERSE SHOT - WINE RACKS, NEVILLE'S POINT OF VIEW MED. LONG DOWN SHOT - NEVILLE LOOKING AT WINE RACKS His flashlight probes here and there along walls. Stops on a. particular area of one of the racks. VERY CLOSE SHOT SIDE VIEW OF WINE BOTTLES IN RACK Neville's light falls on bottle. Behind rack we SEE another HAND at back. CAMERA HOLDS. The hand is still when light first strikes it, then it comes to life, moves, clenches. MEDIUM SHOT - BEHIND RACK OF BOTTLES We SEE a FAMILY MEMBER who has apparently been sleeping in cellar and has knocked wine bottle over in sleep. He comes awake fully as Neville enters cellar. NEVILLE - CLOSE SHOT From the shadows to his left rear. Also made from behind wine rack. CAMERA RISES from near floor level to five feet or so, following POINT OF VIEW of Family member. MED. WIDE ANGLE SHOT - WINE RACK From behind Neville. As he approaches rack, the entire Rack tilts and slowly falls toward him. MED. SHOT - NEVILLE throws himself back, trying to avoid the rack, but as he does so, he looks up. MED. CLOSE SHOT - UP ANGLE - CREATURE ON TOP OF WINE RACK hood flaring behind, arms outstretched CLOSE SHOT - NEVILLE'S REACTION MED. SHOT - RACK FALLING ON NEVILLE bottles falling out of rack and exploding on floor. Creature jumps free from top of rack, MED. LONG SHOT - DOWN ANGLE FROM STAIRS Three more of the creatures pile-out from behind barrels, wine racks, wherever they've been sleeping. MED. SHOT NEVILLE UNCONSCIOUS UNDER WINE RACK CLOSE SHOT CREATURE'S FACE Shook as CAMERA SNAPS IN for very CLOSE SHOT: dead white face, Its mouth open, twisted with hatred and anger, eyes still obscured by hood. FADE OUT. SLOW FADE IN: As light begins to fill the SCREEN again, BLURRY, without FOCUS, WE HEAR, as from a great distance, TINY in sound, the VOICE of Matthias once more. He is preaching in away not much different from his last TV appearance in the credit montage. His voice has a peculiar mixture of the comforting and the sinister in it. As he goes on, his voice RISES, moves toward HYSTERIA. MATTHIAS- ...and, oh, brothers and sisters, I ask you to look at him. Does he have the Marks? Do you see them? (muffled answers of "no, no.") You see him as we were before the Punishment, before we gained grace. You see lying there, the last of scientists and bankers and business- men...the users of the wheel! Do we use the tools of the wheel, as he does? ("no, not.") Is he of The Family? ("no, not") Is he of the Sacred Society? (no, not.") Then ... what is he? (confused mumbling, anger) CAMERA CLEARS VERY SLOWLY TO AN UP SHOT NEVILLE's POINT OF VIEW WE SEE the vague image of someone in robes in a high pulpit, behind a high bench. CAMERA MOVES SLOWLY, APPEARING TO SEEK FOCUS. THEN IT SNAPS INTO FOCUS IN ZOOM - VERY CLOSE SHOT of large reflective sunglasses. It is Matthias. His hood is pushed back, and the rooms illumination is quite low. He seems to float in the darkness with candle-flames flickering around and behind him. LONG DOWN SHOT - NEVILLE TIED ON FLOOR MATTHIAS POINT OF VIEW Neville is regaining consciousness. CAMERA MOVES SLOWLY DOWN on him as Matthias talks. MATTHIAS (O.S.) He is part of the dead...he has no place here. He has the stink of oil and electric circuitry about him. He is obsolete... ( ...yes, yes.") WIDE ANGIE SHOT CHAMBER IN FEDERAL COURT BUILDING Its former function should still be evident, but it-now serves as the place where the Sacred Society governs the Family. It is courtroom, meetinghouse, church of the group. It is dark, hung with black cloth. The room is full of the hooded creatures that we have seen before. Only Matthias and perhaps half a dozen of his immediate followers do not wear hoods. Their hair and skin is dead white, their eyes are covered by an assortment of shields. MATTHIAS And what shall we do with old machinery...? ZOOM CLOSE SHOT - MATTHIAS - NEVILLE'S POINT OF VIEW He points at Neville. MATTHIAS ... you are discarded. You are the rubbish of the past... MED. CLOSE SHOT - NEVILLE His initial horror and fear past, he LAUGHS aloud. NEVILLE This is a bloody Halloween party... Youre all sick ... You need... Those nearest, knock him back down, silence him. MED. SHOT - MATTHIAS He smiles, shakes his head. His voice becomes soft with false compassion. He leans down over his pulpit. MATTHIAS How hard it is to admit the truth. (beat) Take him to the little room. For the Questioning... MED. SHOT - CREATURES DRAGGING NEVILLE CAMERA FOLLOWS as they take Neville into a smaller room. MED. LONG SHOT - THE LITTLE ROOM - MATTHIAS AND NEVILLE This room resembles the small chambers in which private questioning took place during the Inquisition. The table is long and there are candles and books on it. The scene should be Gothic and just this side of a put-on. Taste here, as elsewhere, must be exquisite so as to tread the line between the grotesque, the demented, and the Camp. MATTHIAS Well, now, Mr. Neville, we can talk for a little while. It's been a long time since you've talked -- except to yourself. CLOSE SHOT - NEVILLE'S REACTION Neville is surprised. He has assumed Matthias was truly and completely insane. NEVILLE So you dont rant all the time? Why bother with it at all? MED. SHOT - MATTHIAS He LAUGHS, walks around the dark room. MATTHIAS Yes, you were a scientist. The kind of man who understood nothing until there was almost nothing left to understand. NEVILLE (surly) I'm getting along... MATTHIAS You're getting dead, Mr. Neville -- or doctor or colonel, whatever they called you. I have responsibility for the last tiny remnant of mankind ... I have that responsibility. NEVILLE Then why the hell dont you live up to it? Why don't you throw away the costumes and get these people organized, try to work on a cure... Matthias turns on him angrily. MATTHIAS Oh. we are organized. You know that well enough. A cure? There is none. In the early days ... Have you seen the ruins of the general hospital? Thousands of bodies littering the corridors, rooms jammed with the dead ... and finally... those pitiful few who were left, hopeless, going mad, lynching the doctors, the technicians who had betrayed them... By the way, why weren't you there... Doctor? REACTION SHOT - NEVILLE NEVILLE I tried. There was a crash... TWO SHOT - MATTHIAS AND NEVILLE, MATTHIAS It doesn't matter. There was no cure. Is none. The curse you people created, couldn't stop, is... forever. So Ive turned that curse into a blessing. CLOSE SHOT - NEVILLE'S REACTION MATTHIAS (O.S.) No. now the Family has found its way. It can bear the burden -- the only curse left is -- you. NEVILLE You are insane. And before very damn long, youll be dead -- can't you see that? CLOSE SHOT - MATTHIAS MATTHIAS (angrily) last night you killed how many? Three of us? And today We don't know yet. And before that? You've killed dozens...Youre the messenger of death, Doctor, not us. TWO SHOT - NEVILLE AND MATTHIAS OTHERS come INTO the room now, and Matthias manner changes. Once again he adopts the portentous pose of judge-prophet. NEVILLE I was defending myself ... You lunatics came after me... MATTHIAS He's confessed all, Brothers. Murder, use of forbidden tools, practice of proscribed rites. He admits 'science, medicine, weapons, machines, electricity. He has not shared the Punishment; he does not bear the Marks... CLOSE SHOT - NEVILLE NEVILLE What is the Punishment? The Marks? WIDE ANGLE GROUP SHOT - MATTHIAS AND GROUP OF FAMILY As Neville speaks, the group stares at him. This is the first group appearance of the Family. WE SEE that they are of both sexes and all races. Some seem fairly young, however there are no children. In addition to the hoods, we find some wearing goggles, some helmets with dark visors, etc. Obviously, all these forms of eye guards have been scavenged in the empty city. SERIES OF CLOSE SHOTS - INDIVIDUAL FAMILY MEMBERS As CAMERA PANS from one to another, each removes his or her glasses, goggles, etc. revealing blank white eyes. CAMERA completes pan, stops on Matthias. He removes glasses, shows his own white eyes. For the first time, WE SEE the OPAQUE EYES of the Family. MATTHIAS (quietly) These are the Marks, Mr. Neville ... The Punishment is what you and those like you brought upon us... CAMERA CLOSES on Matthias, closes slowly on his face, eyes, as he talks. MATTHIAS In the beginning, we tried to help one another, those that were left. We tried to clean things up, set them straight. We buried and burned. And it came to us that we were spared for just that work... PAN SHOT - FAMILY MEMBERS LISTENING TO MATTHIAS MATTHIAS (O.S.) ... to bury what was dead, to burn what was evil, dangerous... Neville's VOICE breaks in harsh, angry. NEVILLE (O.S.) So you burned libraries, laboratories...You wrecked computer centers, engineering facilities ... a herd of insane barbarians. Every night you go on burning. PAN SHOT ENDS ON MATTHIAS. He still speaks very quietly. MATTHIAS You call us barbarians, Neville'. Very well, it's an honorable name. We mean to cancel the world you made. We will simply erase history from the time that machinery and weapons began to threaten more than they offered. CLOSE SHOT - NEVILLE NEVILLE You'll play hell... CLOSE SHOT - MATTHIAS MATTHIAS No, you've played hell you and your dead kinsmen of the car and the plane and the tank and the bomb ... and when you die, the-last living reminder of hell will be gone ... forever. As he speaks, CAMERA PULLS OUT TO GROUP SHOT. The Family RS assent. Matthias turns to Zachary. MATTHIAS Brother Zachary? ZACHARY We got everything ready. MED. SHOT - EXT. - NEVILLE, MATTHIAS, ETC. An alley or narrow street. There, a cart has been brought. It has high sides and two solid wooden wheels about five feet in diameter. It is filled with old newspapers, books, files, broken pieces of wooden furniture, etc. SHOT is made BETWEEN Neville and Matthias. Matthias and Family have glasses or shields back on. Zachary comes over, jerks Neville roughly toward cart. Matthias stops him. MATTHIAS One thing, Neville, now that its over... Neville stares back at him. MATTHIAS why didn't you leave? Why didn't you get out of the city...? NEVILLE I wasnt sure about that ... until now. MED. LONG SHOT - NEVILLE IN CART On his head is a conical cap obviously made of computer printout paper. This scene echoes the burning of heretics. Again, if it is done tastefully, it will gather still another fragment of the past which haunts us. Neville is bound in the small cart. It is pulled by members of the Family. HOWLING members of the Family throw rubbish at him -- scientific debris -- and curse him. The cart is in the midst of a dense crowd, each member of which carries a candle. The lighting is weak, bizarre. CLOSE SHOT OF OLD WOMAN in hood, eyes opaque, LAUGHING insanely, throwing objects at Neville. CLOSE SHOT - HANDS trying to reach through the slats of the cart to scratch Neville. They are dead white. MED. CLOSE - NEVILLE over a wave of candles, the flames flickering Insanely. LONG SHOT - THE CROWD filling a narrow street from Neville's POINT OF VIEW. CAMERA TRANSITION TO NEVILLE who stands tied to the cart, wood and paper and books piled around him. CAMERA PULLS BACK to WIDE ANGLE LONG SHOT. We find that we are in a VAST EMPTY STADIUM. In the midst of the field, THE FAMILY, all carrying candles, are gathered around the stand from which Matthias preaches. The cart has been turned upside-down and the technological debris it contained is piled below one of the wheels, to which Neville Is bound, spread-eagled. It stands in a large circular burned area. This is where Matthias and the Family have burned bodies after the plague's onslaught. MED. LONG SHOT - MATTHIAS - NEVILLE'S POINT OF VIEW MATTHIAS Here Is evil... MATTHIAS past Neville's profile. As Matthias speaks, CAMERA FOCUS ALTERS FROM MATTHIAS to NEVILLE. MATTHIAS Is this not the place where all the dead burned? And this (pointing to Neville) Is the last of the dead...And what will we do with this corpse? As Matthias asks his question and the Family HOWLS for Nevilles death, CAMERA PULLS OUT VERY QUICKLY TO WIVZ ANGLE LONG SHOT as stadium LIGHTS COME 0N. At first flickeringly, then with a BURST of fall power. All the lights do not come on. Some bulbs ate burnt out or have failed over the past year or so, but still the field la flooded with light. MED. SHOT - MATTHIAS AND OTHERS OF THE SOCIETY falling back from their stand, trying to cover their eyes despite their sunglasses. MATTHIAS (surprised) What...? NED. LONG - CROWD SCENE Family members dropping their candles, falling, groping, trying to find a way out of the blazing arc lights. CLOSE SHOT - FAMILY MEMBER writhing on ground in agony. MATTHIAS (O S.) Find the switch, get those lights off...! Give us the darkness again! More dark ... more dark! NED. CLOSE - FAMILY MEMBER stumbling blindly toward sidelines of stadium. NED. CLOSE - FAMILY MEMBER trying to stab Neville, missing him In his blindness. WIDE ANGLE LONG SHOT - STADIUM Neville still staked out in center of stadium. Last of the creatures Is crawling or hobbling away out of the light. After a long moment the are-lights begin to fade, wink, and finally go out. CAMERA ZOOMS DOWN TO CLOSE SHOT of Neville struggling, trying to get loose. Then he pauses, fear in his expression, He HEARS someone COMING. NED. SHOT - BLURRED IMAGE OF SOMEONE MOVING ACROSS FIELD walking swiftly across the empty field, Neville tries to twist his head around to see, but it is too dark down in the bowl of the stadium to see more than a shadowy figure. CLOSE SHOT - HANDS UNTYING NEVILLE - SEMI-DARKNESS WE SEE HANDS quickly loosening the ropes on Neville's ankles and hands. MED. SHOT - NEVILLE'S POINT OF VIEW Shadow of someone above him. MED. SHOT'- NEVILLE FREEING SELF FROM ROPES He pulls loose from the last rope. NEVILLE Who are you? Dutch (O.S.) Shut up. Move, move, MOVE! Neville begins to run, pushed by the shadowy figure. SEQUENCE OF SHOTS: MED. CL0SE - NEVILLE running to edge of field. MED. LONG - NEVILLE AND FIGURE running into ramp area, disappearing under stands. MED SHOT - NEVILLE Figure behind him pushes him along in the darkness, giving him no pause. LONG SHOT MATTHIAS AND FAMILY RECOVERING FROM LIGHT Matthias and his people are re-grouped, looking for Neville. CLOSE SHOT - MATTHIAS MATTHIAS Find him. Search the Corridors... the storerooms...everywhere... CLOSE SHOT NEVILLE Figure behind pushes him through a door, slams it closed. Neville falls to his knees, shakes his head, trying to get his bearings. A beam of light from an electric torch sitting on a box dimly illuminates the room. He rises, starts to turn. Then, from shadows behind him, between lockers he HEARS: LISA (O.S.) All right, son of a bitch. Just hold tight... (beat) Uh-uh, dont turn. Stand. When I want you turned, Ill turn you. on or off or around. Lisas voice is low, smooth, sophisticated, but there is in It the sound of a profound self-confidence. MED. LONG SHOT - NEVILLE - REAR VIEW AGAINST LIGHT Lisa slowly drifts INTO FRAME LEFT. FOCUS is on Neville. Lisas head, right shoulder are blurred. Her hand comes up holding a .45 automatic. FOCUS MOVES TO GUN, Neville still In B.G. LISA Thats fine. Now put your hands out... way out, shoulder high. Like they were going to crucify you. CLOSE - NEVILLE looking AT CAMERA, his head and shoulders in LEFT HALF OF FRAME. In shadows behind, WE SEE LISA vaguely, the .45 VIVID in SHAFT OF LIGHT from torch. NEVILLE As a matter of fact, they were going to roast me. Why did you stop them? Lisa comes closer. We can SEE HER. She Is beautiful, and black. She Is wearing a shirt, tails tied, and long shorts, with cycle boots. Her face is composed, almost amused as she moves up behind Neville. LISA We've got a reason, Neville's eyebrows rise. He is setting himself to turn on her. NEVILLE My name is Robert... LISA Your name's mud, Mister. Neville whirls, CAMERA FOCUSES on Lisa who lifts the .45, brings it chopping down with moderate force. MED. TWO-SHOT - NEVILLE AND EISA Lisa is breathing a little harder, but her composure is fine. She cooks pistol. Neville is getting off floor staring into muzzle of .45, rubbing his head, looking at the girl with grudging respect. LISA ...and youre not going to need a name if you fool with me again. She nudges Neville toward the door. He raises his hands automatically. They walk. NEVILLE Where did you pick up that cute way of saying stop? WE SEE LISA still behind, looking from one side to the other as they traverse corridors. LISA Oakland. I was a Raider. Anyhow, I only said slow. You know how I say stop? The pistol nudges Neville's ribs. Neville keeps walking. NEVILLE You keep clowning around, and those spooks out there are going to... LISA Shut up. Dutch is taking care of the honks. LONG SHOT - FROM CORRIDOR OF STADIUM LOOKING OUT ONTO FIELD WE SEE MATTHIAS' PEOPLE running closer toward the corridor, This shot, we discover, Is from POINT OF VIEW of the shadowy figure, Dutch, who now stands in darkness. WE HEAR Dutch fumbling with something. CAMERA FOCUSES now on F.G. Dutchs hand rises, holding cylindrical container. Matthias' people still in B.G. reach corridor entrance. Dutch throws container. REVERSE SHOT - CORRIDOR FROM MATTHIAS' POINT OF VIEW As they try to enter, there is a blinding explosion of LIGHT, only moderate SOUND, as a phosphorus grenade explodes. SHOT should capitalize on diffusion, refraction of phosphorus blow-up, its brilliant blue-white glare. MATTHIAS No, no ... get back ... The next entrance... MEDIUM TWO SHOT - NEVILLE AND LISA Neville is in F.G., Lisa behind with pistol. They are trotting. LISA okay... stop, Open it up. They are standing near a utility room. Neville turns and sees her for the first time. NEVILLE Youre..! LISA Okay, you've seen me before. Pull it out buster ... move! Neville wheels out a small motorcycle, NEVILLE (admiringly) You plan ahead... LISA We plan every which a way. Now look, you're gonna ran this thing, but I'm the ramrod, you know? Neville says nothing, seating himself on the bike. LISA Do me a favor, will you? Don't screw up. I know how to roll, Out It's hard on the elbows ... and oh, yeah, If you just have to play James Bond, I'm gonna sift your brains All over the walls, Neville grins In spite of himself. NEVILLE Yes, ma'am... CAMERA PULLS BACK as he, starts cycle and they move OFF down shadowy corridors. LONG SHOT - MATTHIAS AND FAMILY IN CORRIDOR They tan along corridor, seeking Neville. SOUND of bike can be heard MED. CLOSE SHOT - CANISTER ROLLING INTO MATTHIAS' PATH As we see another grenade appear, we HEAR Alts laughter from side corridor. Grenade explodes, spurting burning phosphorus onto one of Family. CAMERA PULLS OUT to MED. SHOT as Family member SHRIEKS in pain. MATTHIAS Down the other way. We'll catch them at the main exit ... the ramp. SERIES OF SHOTS - NEVILLE AND LISA ON BIKE IN CORRIDORS Lisa yells directions to him as Neville skids bike around corners, in and bat, around obstacles like heaps of cushions, piles of coke cases, etc, Shot should take advantage of bike light, refractions, shadows, veering of bike, near collisions. LISA Left, left, goddamn It. (beat) Another leftand step on it. LONG SHOT - RAMP OF STADIUM Shot is from Dutchs POINT OF VIEW. CAMERA PULLS BACK, revealing Dutch, standing about ten yards from ramp. He holds a grenade In each hand. It is still dark, but the first signs of pre-dawn are APPEARING. We HEAR the roar of the Family as they run inside the corridor toward ramp. As they APPEAR, Dutch lofts the first one and then the other grenade, tossing one on each side of the exit, leaving a narrow passage directly in the middle, free of the phosphorous, though bathed in blinding LIGHT. Matthias and Family fall back in confusion. We HEAR sound of bike over their yells, Dutchs laughter. MED. SHOT - NEVILLE AND LISA ON BIKE They skid around final corner. Neville hits brakes, Leaves rubber. REVERSE LONG SHOT - DOWN CORRIDOR, NEVILLVES POINT OF VIEW Matthias and his people, turned and blinded by burning phosphorus, HEAR Neville coming. CAM8RA ZOOMS to MED. CLOSE SHOT, Matthias. MATTHIAS He is coming ... There... MEDIUM CLOSE SHOT - NEVILLE AND LISA ON BIKE LISA What the h6ll you stopped for? Hit It, you dumb honk! NEVILLE You want me to? Lisa prods him with the pistol. LISA Right on, you lump. They're blinded. Right on! Neville shrugs, races engine. NEVILLE Okay, baby, hitch up your drawers... He revs engine, kicks off straight toward Matthias and Family. LONG SHOT - MATTHIAS AND FAMILY NEVILLES POINT OF VIEW We see Matthias and the rest coming closer and closer as SOUND of bike becomes deafening Behind Family is burning phosphorus. Matthias Puts out his hands as If to wave Neville to a stop. MATTHIAS Stop them, stop them... FLASH CUT - CLOSE SHOT - NEVILLE'S FACE. LONG SHOT - MATTHIAS AND FAMILY NEVILLES POINT OF VIEW Shot MOVES RAPIDLY closer to Family. FLASH CUT - CLOSE SHOT - LISA,'S FACE LISA Down the middle, right down he middle! MEDIUM SHOT - SIDE ANGLE - COLLISION OF BIKE AND FAMILY As bike flashes through them, some of the Family try to stop Neville. Bike veers, rights, sails through, knocking Family members in all directions, MEDIUM-SHOT - BIKE GOING BETWEEN PHOSPHORUS GRENADES Neville manages to steer down slot between the two bombs Dutch has thrown. For a moment, the bike and its riders are bathed in weird glow of phosphorus. Howls of disappointed Family can be heard. LONG SHOT - LISA AND NEVILLE ON BIKE DUTCHS POINT OF VIEW They roar down ramp and into empty parking lot. CAMERA PULLS BACK showing Dutch in F.G. cranking up his own bike, laughing exultantly at the success of the escape. He watches Neville and Lisa race away, and after another look in the direction of the stadium where the grenades still burn, he follows them. LONG SHOT - CYCLE ON FREEWAY - FRONT ANGLE MED. SHOT - SIDE ANGLE - LISA WITH ARM AROUND NEVILLE She has left arm around his middle, gun in right hand aimed into ribs. Yells Into his ear: LISA Take the next exit... As they reach exit, Neville wheels the bike suddenly. Lisa has to grab him with both hands. He plucks gun from her hand, lowers the hammer as they speed down off-ramp. Lisa Yells: LISA You sneaky bastard Neville LAUGHS, hands her back the gun. She sticks it into her belt and puts both arms around him at they go off onto country road. DISSOLVE TO. MED. LONG DOWN ANGLE SHOT - NEVILLE AND LISA They pull up in front of an apparently deserted house perched on the edge of a canyon. Neville leans the bike on its stand, stretches, turns. MED SHOT - LISA She is holding gun on him again, smiling broadly. MED. SHOT - NEVILLE He scratches his head. NEVILLE Well, I'll be damned. I thought we'd gotten past that... CAMERA PULLS OUT TO TWO SHOT LISA Youre sweet. Now just walk on up to that house. MED, LONG SHOT - LISA AND NEVILLE WALKING TO HOUSE SHOT is THROUGH OPEN WINDOW next to door through which they will pass. Window looks dusty, drapes faded, torn. As Lisa and Neville approach door, CAMERA PULLS BACK across barrel of Thompson submachine gun and hands holding it, revealing that SHOT is from GUNMANIS POINT OF VIEW. MED. SHOT - LISA AND NEVILLE WALKING INTO HOUSE It is moderately dark In house. Neville rubs his eyes. SHOT is still ACROSS GUN BARREL. Neville sees gunman. Lisa moves up beside him. LISA It's all right, Tommy. This is the Man.... I mean THE Man.... but he's tame. REVERSE SHOT - TOMMY He Is a small Chinese boy of about twelve who holds the machine gun nervously pointed at Neville, He smiles at Lisa, frowns at Neville. TOMMY What are you gonna do with him, Lisa? GROUP SHOT - LISA, NEVILLE, TOMMY. LISA (to Neville) Have you got any idea what Tom would have done If you'd come up to this house carrying my .45? Neville nods. NEVILLE Im beginning to get an idea. CAMERA PULLS OUT as others walk into light. They have been waiting to see what was happening. LISA This is the crop... There are perhaps six or eight young people about evenly divided between boys and girls. The others, except for Lisa and her brother, are white. LISA all there is. At least that we know of. There are others around, I guess... If Matthias and his nuts havent killed them all. Neville is astonished. The kids seem healthy, alert. NEVILLE I didnt know there were...any. LISA (sardonically) Between Matthias and his goons at night and you In the daytime shooting anything that moved, we stayed low, NEVILLE I was staying Alive, The others exchange glances, LISA If you call that living. Neville Is Irked. He did not come for a seminar In ethics. Then there is the SOUND of a motorcycle outside, All turn, toward the door, TOMMY Its Dutch... He runs toward door, Lisa and the rest follow, Neville in rear. MED. SHOT -DUTCH He climbs off cycle, drops kickstand. He wears a leather jacket, a air of pearl-handled .45 automatics on his hips. Saddlebags are staffed with grenades, a Thompson submachine gun, etc. Dutch also wears goggles, an old World War I style helmet, riding breeches and Jack-boots. His hair is long, and on the back of his jacket is painted the upraised red fist of revolution--with the middle finger extended. He is a tough cookie, but very bright indeed. Tommy and Lisa WALK into picture. LISA Hey, it's the mad bomber. Where you at, baby? Dutch pulls off his helmet, smiles at Lisa, ruffles Tommy's hair. CAMERA MOVES OUT to include others in GROUP SHOT. Dutch looks at Neville. DUTCH I see you got my partner, the mad doctor, here all right. CLOSE SHOT - NEVILLE'S REACTION NEVILLE You know who I am? CAMERA MOVES OUT to GROUP SHOT LISA Dutch knew about you. He knew your work... Neville looks astonished. NEVILLE My work...? Dutch stares upward, hands in back of breeches, reciting from memory. DUTCH "Biowar Pathology Parameters in Urban and Semi-urban Environment" Journal of Military Medicine, June, 1974, "Incremental Effects Countermeasures to Toxic Agents in Liquid Systems Delivery" Microbiological Letters, January, 1975 LISA God Almighty, Countermeasures to what...? DUTCH To somebody poisoning your well. Neville grins. NEVILLE Where did you pick up on that? DUTCH Med school, I was a senior when they scratched the whole world. I was going to apply to Biowar Labs for a post-doc, but the next term never came. Neville is surprised, touched. NEVILLE I'm sorry you didn't make it. LISA If you all are done with the mutual admiration, you reckon we can go on Into Richie? NEVILLE Richie? They walk toward house. DUTCH Lisas brother. He looks like hes about to go over. CLOSE SHOT NEVILLE He frowns uncomprehendingly. NEVILLE Go over...? TWO SHOT- DUTCH AND NEVILLE They have reached house now head down hall into darkened bedroom. DUTCH Oh, that's right. You've only seen the tertiary cases ... Were primary, you see. Neville is stunned. It simply has not occurred to him that the young people are also victims of the plague. DUTCH When it hit, the older people either died outright or went to the third stage pretty fast. You know: blindness in light, albinism, psychotic delusions, occasional stages of torpor: like Matthias and his gang. NEVILLE And you? DUTCH Some of the younger people had a kind of resistance. We...hold out. One or two of us are a little bit light sensitive, but otherwise all right. But Richie's going. He's advanced secondary. GROUP SHOT - AT DOOR OF BEDROOM A girl comes out. LISA How is he? GIRL (shaking head) No better. The color is gone from his skin, Lisa. Hesalmost white. Lisa shakes her head. LISA If he wasn't out of his head already, thatd really blow his mind. Dutch laughs without humor, lights a candle. They step INTO darkened room, close to bed. They look down to see a BOY lying on bed, tossing. His skin Is light- not dead white, but very light--though his features are African. His hair is natural, but also light His eyes, when he opens them, are white, but only iris is missing. Pupil is still visible. Neville leans down over him, studying him. This is our first chance to see Neville as Doctor. LISA Well...? NEVILLE Shut up. SERIES OF SHOT - NEVILLE AND RICHIE He goes over Richie carefully, checking vital signs, blood pressure, reflexes, etc. DUTCH (O.S.) He could hold here for weeks and then come up one of Matthias' monsters--or he could go over in ten minutes. NEVILLE (still examining Richie) So they go through fever and delirium passing from your state to Matthias'? And then, At Matthias, they hold again. Indefinitely. CLOSE SHOT - DUTCH DUTCH I've seen them go over before. I almost got killed last summer by a friend. He went over without any warning. When I looked away. he was kind of pale and: his hair was going.

I killed the son of a bitch. LISA (insistently) Listen, if the Masonic rites are over, how about Richie? Neville rises and they walk INTO NEXT ROOM. Other KIDS sit around reading, playing guitar, eating. NEVILLE We'll take him to my place. I've got most of what I need there. LISA (scornfully) Is there anything you can do, Doctor? Youve lost 200 million patients already. Neville studies her a moment. NEVILLE I don't have it. LISA Have what? Time, a care? NEVILLE I don't have the plague. I'm immune. REACTION SHOT - GROUP OF YOUNGSTERS Even Lisa looks awed. Dutch frowns, confused. DUTCH Everybody...has it NEVILLE (quietly) Everybody but me. There was a vaccine. Only an experimental batch.

As Neville INJECTS him again, the creature breaks loose, smashes a flask over Nevilles head, RUNS toward elevator, falls, clutching throat, dies. NEVILLE (continuing) I caught one of.

We thought we were alone... MED. TWO SHOT Neville shakes his head. NEVILLE There were weapons, ears, food Lisa shakes her head almost angrily.

LISA They noticed how different we were. They hated our skin, our eyes, They resented us because we could still walk in the sunlight, enjoy the breeze and the flowers and the clouds rolling in from the oceans. CLOSE SHOT - LISA LISA And one night, when they were awake and we slept, Matthias and the rest tried to kill all of us ... some of us got away And hid out.

LISA (O.S.) It's different now, for me... MED. SHOT - INT. APARTMENT, LISA AND NEVILLE As Lisa speaks, we HEAR the GENERATOR, which is a constant sub-sound in all scenes in Neville's apartment, SPUTTER and FAIL, then START again, MUSIC LOSES SPEED, WHINES, COMES BACK to proper pitch, then power fails completely.

ZOOM SHOT FROM VERY LONG TO CLOSE - ZACHARY As SHOT CLOSES on him, Zachary, pulling hood close, is just tossing grapple to fifth floor balcony. He is well under floodlights which are spaced every thirty feet or so above him and pointing oat. It is only the reflected and diffused light he must contend with. CLOSE - LISA She HEARS grapple land, reacts. Where did the sound come from? Was it close or distant? She stands now facing elevator, head turned.

We SEE a small FIGURE on a bicycle pedaling across the far side of the open space. It is the child we met in the house with Al and Richie and the Others. She conceals her bicycle at the edge of the plaza and scurries fearfully across the open space to the fountain. On the edge of its lowest basin, she lays out a pitiful array of flowers and an apple or two from a paper shopping bag she carries. She crouches, kneeling with her hands clasped, hardly daring to look up at Neville's tower. GIRL Please...I brought you this stuff. Don't let them take me either, and put me in a bag. Please. She HEARS the SOUND of an ENGINE roaring closer and races terror-struck, for her bicycle. As she DISAPPEARS, Neville's car crosses the plaza at speed, slowing only enough for the garage doors to open and ENTER. The girl's offering lies unheeded on the fountain.

They were a dandy bunch weren't they? LISA They did the best they could. Who the hell are you to put down the human race? NEVILLE Me? I'm nobody, baby ... but at least I know it. I was just part of the crowd, and I didn't think much of it. LISA Well I do! They made the world...that's what it was all about. NEVILLE No, honey...they RUINED it ... we're living in what they made of it, and God help us. Pretty soon those sick animals out there'll be gone, and then we will be too and all that'll be left is this (points to his collection of cultural artifacts) That one Rembrandt's worth more than everyone left alive in this stinking city! Maybe in a hundred years or so Godll get around to kicking through the ashes down here and read Shakespeare and say, "Well ... maybe it was worth it." LISA I've heard that kind of talk before, you uppity, honky pig...and I HATE IT! NEVILLE Ohhh, lovely! Yeah ...

It .is not the sound of an animal, but a human sound, She whirls, a copy of Neville, the sten gun she is carrying ready to fire. She cocks it as she turns, and her face is hard. She sees nothing. MED. LONG SHOT - CRYPT LISAS POV Perhaps some thirty meters away through the weeds and grass, she sees a crypt. It, too, is overgrown with moss, ivy, and has not been cared for.

She wears sunglasses and a scarf though it is not bright. Her hair has a few subtle streaks in it and her skin has lightened also.

SEQUENCE OF SHOTS - NEVILLE WALKING ACROSS PLAZA We see fleetingly the profile of one of Matthias CREATURES IN THE SHADOWS, thus suggesting that there are many watching his progress. He stops in front of garage, presses button on his remote control. MED. SHOT - NEVILLE WALKING INTO ELEVATOR CLOSE SHOT - NEVILLE IN ELEVATOR exhausted downhearted from Richie's foolish death. His eyes are closed. MED. SHOT - ELEVATOR DOOR SHOT is across int. of apt. It is dark. One candle is lit on chess table. This candle is in left F.G., VERY CLOSE FOCUS on candle as SHOT OPENS. As elevator door opens, FOCUS SHIFTS TO DOOR. Neville steps out. CAMERA CLOSES TO CLOSE SHOT. He frowns. Why is the apartment dark, bathed by glow of floodlights and a single candle? NEVILLE Lisa ... Lisa... Lisas voice is strange and distant, and odd quality in It as if it were being heard through water. LISA (O.S.) Yes...Robert... Neville relaxes, puts down his gun. He walks a step or two toward the SOUND of her VOICE - by the draperies, now pulled to cover the balcony windows. NEVILLE Richie ... went to Matthias ... he's... MED. SHOT - SILHOUETTE OF LISA - NEVILLE'S POV We see her standing, three-quarter-rear view. She is illuminated by very weak, bluish light of outside floods coming through draperies. Her VOICE still has that peculiar mechanical SOUND. LISA Yes, Robert ... I...know... NEVILLE (O.S.) You know?...How...? CAMERA.MOVES IN FOR EXTREME CLOSE SHOT ON LISA. As CAMERA CLOSES, she turns so that her face is now illuminated by the -candle. When SHOT completes, Lisa stands revealed. Her hair is white, face deadly pale, eyes completely blank. As she turns, she speaks. When her turn is complete, so is the speech. LISA Matthias told me. It was ... necessary. ZOOM SHOT - NEVILLE LISAS POV Neville's reaction to Lisas change. WIDE ANGLE SHOT - LISA AND FAMILY SHOT is from behind Neville so that his back is the central POINT IN FRAME. Lisa moves closer to circle of light from candle, and from all sides, so do members of the Family. Matthias stands next to Lisa. MATTHIAS (mocking tone) Come In, Neville... (laughs) That sounds strange, doesnt it? Come In, Neville. He LAUGHS. Others grab Neville. MED. SHOT - NEVILLE He Is dragged to chair at chess table. MATTHIAS (O.S.) I thought we might arrange a little entertainment before time for...concluding our business. All right, brothers SEQUENCE OF SCENES - DESTRUCTION OF APARTMENT The Family, free at last to revenge itself, destroys Neville's treasures, SHOTS of books torn down, ripped apart, paintings SLASHED, sculpture SMASHSD, furniture BROKEN, wine-cabinet SMASHED -- his scientific equipment, his cabinets of food, his arsenal are WRECKED AND DESTROYED. It is as if the remote past has come forth to revenge itself on civilization. At the end of the sequence, se SEE some of the FAMILY setting FIRE to the draperies, the books, the kindling left of furniture. One of the creatures begins to SMASH the lense of the balcony floodlights. During this sequence, Matthias VOICE COMES OVER MATTHIAS (O.S.) We waited for you, Neville. So you could see this the end of everything youve done. You see? None of it was real. It was a dream. Your art, your scienceit was all a nightmare. And now its doneits finished. The SHOT SURVEYS ruined apartment, burned books, slashed paintings, wrecked scientific equipment -- the bust of Caesar smashed, deserves a CLOSE SHOT. CLOSE NEVILLES FACE - REACTION SHOT ACROSS CHESS.PIECES He has lost, In the space of a few hours, a surrogate son, a woman, and all the treasures he so painstakingly saved from the wreak of this civilization. Everything except the blood with which to make more serum. MED. CLOSE SHOT - MATTHIAS - PROFILE SHOT watching the conclusion of the destruction, smiling. Lisa stands in B.G., listless, paying no attention. He speaks to the family. MATTHIAS Brothers and sisters, our task is nearly complete He is the last of those who brought the Punishment to us. We have cleansed, rolled away his World. We go back now to a good time. We will build... CLOSE - NEVILLE cuts in loudly. NEVILLE Coffins Matthias. Build coffins. That's all you're going to need CLOSE - MATTHIAS pauses, stung. MATTHIAS Bring Mr. Neville along. MED. CLOSE - NEVILLE As the creatures start to walk toward elevator, he breaks free, dives away from them into what is left of his arsenal section of apartment. He clubs first creature with the butt of a broken rifle, throws it at the next. He grabs up a Pistol, fires point blank at two more. Matthias comes at him, a knife raised. The pistol is empty. Neville dodges Matthias, skirts toward center of room. Matthias following. Neville reaches down, lifts the head of the broken bust of Caesar, throws it at Matthias, knocks him down and out. NEVILLE Lisa... He grabs her am. She does not respond. He pulls her along he opens the refrigerator takes out the pint bottle of blood and stuffs it into his coveralls. Lisa neither resists, or helps. Neville grabs up the broken rifle. MED.SHOT - INT. - GARAGE NEVILLE S POINT OF VIEW Lisa tries to speak in her peculiar new voice. LISA Robert... NEVILLE Shhh CAMERA PULLS BACK to reveal Neville and Lisa in F.G. in darkness of garage. In B.G. we SEE, up the ramp, brightly-lighted plaza area. Neville holds broken rifle, is studying the situation. He looks at his watch, NEVILLE Half an hour till sunup. We'll have to try it. CLOSE SHOT - NEVILLE Behind him, he hears the elevator starting-up again. NEVILLE Hell, I should have wrecked it. LISA (O.S.) Robert... CLOSE TWO SHOT - NEVILLE AND LISA In the B.G., beyond the lights of the plaza, we see the sky Is beginning to lighten. It is dawn, In the distance the silence is broken by the faint sound of a track motor coming through the streets. Neville makes sure the blood is secure, prepares himself to run. As he bolts forward, he pulls Lisa along with him. NEVILLE Now, Lisa, now! MED. LONG SHOT - EXT. PLAZA - LISA AND NEVILLE RUNNING As Neville and Lisa come up out of the garage we SEE the Family beginning to drift away at the edges of the floodlights as the first signs of dawn begin to show. Sound of truck, previously very faint almost subaural, now becomes a little louder. Neville Is obviously pulling Lisa, while she does not resist him, does not cooperate. They slow down in middle of the Plaza, near the fountain, awaiting truck. MATTHIAS (O.S.) Lisa. His voice is soft, almost caressing. It is the same voice in which he addressed Richie before stabbing him. MED. CLOSE SHOT - LISA AND NEVILLE They look back and up--toward balcony of Neville's apartment. VERY CLOSE SHOT LISA She recognizes Matthias voice. Her face, expressionless, wrapt, gazes upward, seeing him. We hear sound of truck in distance. CLOSE SHOT - NEVILLE He stares up, trying to spot Matthias. His hands work bolt of broken rifle. REVRSE UP ANGLE SHOT - MATTHIAS ON BALCONY - NEVILLE'S POV This Is a SLOW ZOOM SHOT. Matthias stands on balcony In area between floodlights broken out earlier as Family member Wrecked apartment. He leans over balcony outlined against lurid red glow of fire in apartment behind. MATTHIAS Lisa... REVERSE DOWN ANGLE SHOT - LISA BELOW Again, SLOW ZOOM to Lisa who stands looking up, shaking off Nevilles hands. MED. SHOT - NEVILLE He stands before fountains hands outstretched to Lisa. NEVILLE Lisa... CLOSE SHOT - LISA Her head turns from side to side as the voices call to her. CLOSEUP SHOT - NEVILLE NEVILLE Lisa, for Gods sake, come on MED. SHOT - LISA She shakes her head, looking at Neville and turning to look once more up at Matthias. MED. SHOT - UP ANGLE - MATTHIAS Matthias looks about, discovers the ZULU SPEAR, cast aside on balcony by Zachary earlier. He picks it up, raises It above his head, his face twisted with hatred. CLOSE SHOT - MATTHIAS FROM BEHIND This is down angle shot from behind Matthias with Lisa, Neville below. Matthias, In F.G. throws spear with all his strength. CLOSE SHOT - SPEAR INTO CAMERA CLOSE SHOT - NEVILLE The spear strikes him In chest. He falls backward into fountain, the bottle of plasma falling from his coverall. CLOSE SHOT - TOP OF FOUNTAIN We see Matthias across jet of water at top of fountain. As Matthias speaks, the water at top of jet turns red, MATTHIAS The bad dream is over, Neville. Now we can sleep in peace. MED. CLOSE - NEVILLE He has fallen against pillar In center of fountain, bleeding profusely, but still alive. Then he HEARS A VOICE O.S. LISA (O.S.) Robert...Robert... NEVILLE Lisa, where are you? Her voice is odd, quacky. It is not the voice we know. She Lurks at the edge of the FRAME. LISA I came to Matthias, he knows... MED. LONG SHOT - LISA IN SHADOW The SUN Is now beginning to come ONTO PLAZAI Lisa must retreat as It gradually narrows the area of the plaza still In shadow. LISA to see that you were... NEVILLE Yes? LISA evil, that Brother Matthias was right... NEVILLE I... love you. LISA I have to be part of something else the Family, I have to have... CLOSE - NEVILLE His head Is back as the sun strikes the fountain. His eyes are open. When the sun reaches his face, his eyes do not blink. He is dead still, we HEAR Lisas voice going on and on. LISA (O.S.) have to have The Family, Robert, do you understand? You understand, don't you, Robert? We HEAR SOUND of GENERATOR, which has been In B.G. all during this sequence. It COUGHS, CUTS OUT, COMES.BACK ON. LONG SHOT - DOWN ANGLE - PLAZA WITH FOUNTAIN CENTERED Neville is motionless In center. Lisa flits along the edge of the receding shadow as the sun eats away the area. She retreats back toward the smoking building. LISA (O.S.) The Family is everything, Robert ...I came back to the ... Family... Her voice gets more and more distant as It FADES completely. CLOSE SHOT - TOP OF FOUNTAIN Again we HEAR GENERATOR CUT OUTO COUGH, COME ON, AND STOP. Water In fountain matches this rhythm, stopping at last, lights go out. CAMERA MOVES IN SLOWLY ON NEVILLE - HOLDS In SOUND TRACK WE HEAR LOUDLY the SOUND of the MOTOR. It becomes quite LOUD. While CAMERA DRIFTS AROUND FOMUTAIN SLOWLY. We HEAR SOUNDS of people getting out of the truck. We HEAR VOICES. CAMERA COMPLETES ITS CIRCUIT OF FOUNTAIN. In B.G. beyond fountain and Nevilles body, we SEE the YOUNG PEOPLE HE HAS FREED. They wear protective clothing, sunglasses. They see him, walk slowly toward the fountain. MED. SHOT - YOUNG PEOPLE IN GROUP They stand in mourning around him. Then Dutch steps forward, sees something in fountain. CLOSE SHOT - HANDS REACHING INTO FOUNTAIN Dutch reaches down into the red waters of the fountain, lifts from it the bottle of blood, holds it up so that the sun stands just behind it. MED. SHOT - GROUP OF YOUNGSTERS They look at the bottle. CLOSE - DUTCH He is obviously the leader now. He turns to the others. SLOW ZOOM SHOT - LISA She sits huddled in the shadows next to the garagesomewhere at the edge of the plaza. She looks helpless and very old. Broken. She tries to cover her eyes and face. GROUP SHOT DUTCH IN B.G. NEVILLES BODY IN F.G. Nevilles body is OUT OF FOCUS. DUTCH It's Lisa! Go get her! Several of the youngsters go to her while the test move to the silent fountain and untie Nevilles body. CAMERA MOVES to SHOOT OVER Dutchs-shoulder. CLOSE SHOT - DUTCH We see In Dutch's face the same confidence and determination we knew in Neville. He watches impassively as they take Nevilles body to the shadowed area and arrange it. CAMERA BEGINS SLOW RISING SHOT Dutch in F.G. One of the youngsters has driven the old truck up into the plaza. Lisa kneels beside Nevilles body, touching his face, arranging his hands, mumbling confusedly, recalling the tomb scene of mother with stillborn baby. Nevilles body is carefully wrapped in a blanket. Lisa CRIES OUT. DUTCH All right, lets moveWeve got a long way to go. CAMERA RISES TO LONG SHOT DOWN ANGLE OF PLAZA as Neville and Lisa are put in back of truck with youngsters all-around them. Dutch takes one final look around, climbs in truck. CAMERA NOW COVERS ENTIRE PLAZA AREA. Truck STARTS, PULLS AWAY. Plaza is now empty. We HEAR trucks MOTOR FADING in distance. HOLD SHOT.

                                Travis Milloy


                         

                         

                         DEEP SPACE

          A darkness like no other, a silence that is unsettling.
          Sharp pinholes of light show a sea of distant stars across
          the void of outer space. Our own motion is only realized as
          an enormous object slowly moves towards us, taking shape.
          A SPACE SHIP of unimaginable size, a tubular freighter easily
          ten times larger then any aircraft carrier. At first glance
          it appears lifeless and adrift, but slowly the small glow of
          cockpit windows come into view as we move closer.
          Moonlight cuts across the hull, displaying the name; EDEN.

          BOWER (V.0.)
          Where were you... when Eden was lost?
          Like every other kid on my block, I was
          in the middle of a dream, envious of
          those who were chosen to be part of
          mankind's greatest quest. Dreaming of
          the unknown and trying to imagine what
          only the lucky few would encounter.
           We PUSH IN towards the cockpit windows and...

                          DISSOLVE THRU:

          INT. COCKPIT (EDEN) - CONT.

          Inside the flight deck it's ghostly vacant, rows of empty
          flight chairs and numerous guidance computers gently
          blinking. With half filled coffee-cups and jackets hung over
          the seat backs... it appears the control deck has been
          suddenly evacuated.
          Muffled SCREAMS are heard somewhere deeper inside the ship.

          BOWER.(V.0.)
          As the entire world watched in wonder,
          there were only a few, skeptical of the
          journey's success.

                         (BEAT)
          Only a few... who would be right.
          The further we move into the ship... signs of violence
          appear, smears of dark blood sharply standing out on the
          bright white paneling and several broken computer screens.
          The muffled SCREAMS grow louder and clearer... an argument
          between men, panicked rage over-lapping.

                         (CONTINUED)

                         

                         

                         

                         

          2.

                         CONTINUED:
          CAMERA slowly moves past a corner to see the middle-of a
          violent confrontation. One OFFICER is locked inside a sleep
          chamber, banging on the glass and pleading with panic.
          Another OFFICER is on the floor, mortally wounded, his body
          still twitching with his head bashed in. The INSANE OFFICER,
          a young corporal is moving from terminal to terminal, typing
          in commands with a casual and emotionless nature.
          Blood streams have run down his face from both ears and nose
          as he continues to type commands into the flight computer...
          heightening the trapped OFFICER'S muffled,. screams.

                         TRAPPED OFFICER

                         (IN FRENCH)

          STOP IT! STOP FOR GOD'S SAKES! PLEASE!

          GOD NO!
          The INSANE OFFICER hits the final command key and warning
          buzzers ignite with flashing lights. He closes his eyes,
          taking a breath of relief.

                         TRAPPED OFFCIER

                         (IN FRENCH)

          STOP IT! YOU DON'T KNOW WHAT THIS WILL

          DO TO- YOU'RE NOT- STOP! YOU'RE GOING

          TO FUCKING KILL US ALL!
          The trapped OFFICER begins pounding on the glass with a
          crazed panic as the INSANE OFFICER calmly goes to his own
          sleep-pod and climbs inside, sealing the hatch.

          TRAPPED OFFCIER (CONT-D)

                         (IN FRENCH)

          PLEASE GOD! NO! NO GOD DAMMIT!
          Control panels flash and hydraulics ignite. Like a row of
          tumbling dominos, each of the sleep-chamber pods shift
          positions with a SHUSH of hydraulics and then... they are
          launched with a ROAR of micro-jets.

                         CUT TO:

          EXT. SHIP "EDEN" - CONT.

          We're suddenly back into the unsettling silence as... like a
          bee hive that's exploded, thousands of coffin-sized sleep
          pods are ejected from the ship in unison. They are sent
          tumbling into open space in every direction as the ship
          slowly continues its unaffected course.

                         (CONTINUED)

                         

                         

                         

                         

          3.

                         CONTINUED:
          The trapped OFFICER is seen SCREAMING in silence inside his
          own pod.

                         DISSOLVE TO:

          EXT. OUTER SPACE

          We slowly float towards an astroid field. As we grow closer
          it's the sea of sleep pods slowly floating through space.

          BOWER (P.O.)
          Where was I... when I heard we'd lost
          Eden? Just like every other kid on my
          block... I was dreaming... of being one
          who would be chosen to follow.
          As we move closer to the asteroid field of sleep pods, it's
          obvious that time has passed, a single skeleton inside each
          of the pods, hands in a clawing position towards the glass.
          We PUSH IN towards one pod, moving towards the SKULL, still
          locked in a SCREAMING position, wide mouthed and...

                         CUT TO:

          M. HYPER-SLEEP CHAMBER
          A RUMBLE passes... EYELIDS TWITCH... A GASP.
          Inside a coffin-size chamber, a dim glow of light seeps
          through a small glass porthole. A MAN is asleep, a mask
          attached to his face, tubes of liquid feeding into his arms.
          CORPORAL BOWER, military physique, chiseled features. His
          chest lightly expanding, blood pulsating through his veins.
          Lights FLICKER PAST and his body comes to life, muscles
          flinching, breath quickening. He squirms with discomfort,
          ripping away the mask. He gasps, trying to SCREAM.

                         CUT TO:

          INT. SLEEP CHAMBER COMPARTMENT - CONT.

          His scream is muffled under three inches of glass. The hatch
          door is hit with a THUD and white gases erupt from the edges.
          THUD, THUD... THUD! The door bursts open and BOWER scampers
          out, struggling to rip away the feeding tubes. He HITS the
          floor, naked and gasping. His pores ignite, dripping sweat.
          He tries to get to his feet, but his legs wobble underneath
          him, collapsing. He yells at the floor.

                         (CONTINUED)

                         

                         

                         

                         

          4.

                         CONTINUED:

                         BOWER
          Burns are red! Bruises... blue-
          His voice echoes into the dark, alone in a cavernous room as
          he pauses, struggling for orientation. He gets to his feet,
          muscles twitching. His short-cropped hair is... pure white.

                         BOWER (CONT'D)
          Hey...? HEY!!? Someone?
          A constant low RUMBLE is present, joined by the occasional
          MOAN and CREAK of a large ship. A SHUDDER travels through
          the room with a random FLICKER of LIGHTS to reveal...
          A massive steel compartment, tangled with technology. It's
          cold and institutional. High-tech computer terminals slope
          out of the floor. The FLICKER passes, taking us into black.
          We hear him: fumbling through the room, switches are thrown
          with no result and compartments are pulled opened and...
          SNAP! A glow stick comes to life.
          He squints at his darkened surroundings with confusion. A
          drip of liquid catches his eye and he staggers back to his
          sleep pod. He grabs the dangling tubes that were ripped from
          his arm and he sucks on the tube, pulling as much liquid into
          his mouth as possible.
          After a few heavy gulps, he suddenly heaves towards the
          floor. He painfully forces himself to drink, gasping.
          He looks up to notice two sleep chambers next to his own. He
          leans closer with the glow stick to see the first one, the
          name plate reading; 2nd Lt. Cooper. It's EMPTY.
          The third pod's name plate reads; LT. PAYTON. Deep inside
          there is the figure of a man, asleep under a mask.

                         BOWER (CONT'D)
          Payton? Lieutenant... Payton?
          He turns back to his own pod, seeing the name plate that
          reads; CORPORAL BOWER. Even this name doesn't seem familiar.

                         BOWER (CONT'D)
          Bower? Bower...?
          The loss of memory heightens his fear even more as a shiver
          travels through his body while he staggers towards a nearby
          computer terminal. He taps the keys on a computer terminal.
          Nothing. He frowns, leaning closer.

                         (CONTINUED)

                         

                         

                         

                         

          5.

                         CONTINUED: (2)
          As he taps the keyboard, powder blooms out from under his
          fingers. He wipes the surface of the panel to see a thick
          layer of dust. Under the smear is...
          Elysium - Flight Systems - Operation Terminal #87153-D.
          He pulls focus to see... his FINGERS are trembling
          uncontrollably, an odd vibration of nerves. He slowly makes
          a fist with concern.

                         CUT TO:

          INT. STORAGE LOCKER ROOM - MOMENTS LATER

          BOWER walks along a row of storage lockers reading each name
          plate. He stops at the locker labelled; Corp. Bower. He
          pauses, mumbling the name once again with no recognition.

                         BOWER
          Bower.
          He opens the locker to see an assortment of personalized
          belongings, uniform and gear, none of it seeming familiar.
          He uses a towel to wipe off the layer of sweat and oily
          substance coating his body, pausing to see an identification
          tattoo on his forearm that reads: FLT>>005Â»015.
          He pulls on a black flight suit, emblems and military
          markings of rank on the chest. He pulls on shoes and a tool
          belt with a high powered pen-lamp.
          On the inside of the locker is a emergency manual card with
          block figures displaying breathing and stretching exercises,
          labelled; Hyper-Sleep Disorientation Recovery Procedures.

                         BOWER (CONT'D)
          (reading to himself)
          .in the event of mild memory loss...
          resulting from extended-
          He freezes on... A PHOTO tucked inside the door. EVALON, a
          beautiful young woman smiling towards camera. He stares at
          the-photo, his frown deepening with confusion. He checks the
          back for a name, but nothing. He tucks the photo into a
          pocket and exits.

          INT. SLEEP CHAMBER COMPARTMENT - LATER

          BOWER waves his hand over a sensor... no power. He steps in
          front of a heavy set of steel doors, flipping several
          switches and... nothing.

                         CUT TO:
          BOWER breaks open a storage bin, pulling out beverage packets
          and a cup, taking a seat at the control desk. With Evalon's
          photograph leaned against the console, he becomes lost in a
          gaze as he gulps down nutrient pills and stirs an instant
          coffee as we...

                         PUSH IN
          There is a conflict in his eyes, memories trying to return.

                         FLASH CUT
          An image FLASHES past, EVALON smiling as BOWER kneels next to
          her, gripping her hands.
          BOWER'S gaze remains hollow, frown deepening as he sips the
          cup and... winces with disgust.

                         BOWER
          Faa-uck!
          Distant THUMPS. He pans the pen-lamp across the ceiling and
          toward the sounds... PAYTON'S sleep chamber.
          THUMP, THUMP, THUMP: Muffled and desperate. CRACK! Bower
          jumps back as someone kicks their way out from inside, the
          hatch bursting open. Out climbs...
          PAYTON, a man in his forties, but the rugged physique of a
          man half his age, lean and agile. His military-style hair
          cut is also pure white. Gasping for breath, he hits the
          floor as BOWER tries to help him. PAYTON jerks with shock.

                         BOWER (CONT'D)
          Whoa! Hey... easy! Lt. Payton? You're-
          Sir... whoa!
          PAYTON chokes and gasps, then glances up, giving Bower a once
          over with a frown and a sobering tone.

                         PAYTON
          Who are you?

                         BOWER

                         BOWER
          Sorry... sir.
          PAYTON rubs his face with a frown.

                         PAYTON
          Where... are we?

                         BOWER
          We're aboard the Elysium. From what I've

          Elysium...? Where are we?

          I don't... really know. There's no power
          in the com and I can't even-

          Where's the... rest of the crew? It's

                         BOWER
          Sir... I don't know where anyone is.
          PAYTON takes breaths, trying to regain his senses, glancing
          around at their darkened surroundings.

                         PAYTON
          Hit the lights, will ya?

                         BOWER
          Ah... we're having some power problems-

                         PAYTON
          Who woke you up?

                         BOWER
          Umm, not sure. It had to have been the
          flight computer. There's no one here...
          (off his look)
          .except us.

                         PAYTON
          Cold in here.
          BOWER grabs him a towel and water container, turning back to
          see PAYTON doesn't waste any time, stretching his limbs.

                         BOWER
          There's no power coming off the main
          grid. Can't fire any of the...
          (searching for word)
          Dynos. Can't even open the doors.
          PAYTON glances to the other empty sleep-chamber with a frown.

                         BOWER (CONT'D)
          (off his look)
          Our 2nd Lieutenant? I don't know where
          he is. It was empty when I woke up.
          None of the systems are on-line.
          Mainframe is down, so I don't know how or

          let's just idle here for a bit.

                         BOWER
          Sorry. I just- Just glad to see you
          awake. i was... a little concerned. I
          didn't know what to do if-
          PAYTON gets to his feet, stumbling. BOWER catches him under
          the arm as they stagger into the wall.

          BOWER (CONT`D)
          Easy... Lieutenant. Easy.

                         PAYTON
          Coffee?

                         BOWER
          I'm on it.

                         PAYTON
          Good man.
          BOWER helps him to the locker room as LIGHTS FLICKER past.

                         CUT TO:

          INT. STORAGE LOCKER ROOM - MOMENTS LATER

          PAYTON staggers along the row of storage lockers as BOWER
          helps guide him with the flashlight beam. PAYTON pauses with
          a frown as he glances across the name-plates, none of them
          seeming familiar. BOWER gestures toward the locker, the name-
          plate reads: LT. PAYTON.

                         BOWER
          This is you, sir.

                         PAYTON
          How do you know that?

                         BOWER
          1 It's... the name on your sleep pod, sir.
          PAYTON opens the door to see his belongings inside, a photo
          of WIFE (MARIANNE) inside the door. He stares at it with
          utter confusion. BOWER takes this in, looking to the memory
          recovery card inside the locker.

          it says that the memory loss is only
          suppose to be a momentary loss that's-

                         PAYTON
          Very reassuring. I guess when you gamma
          the brain into extended REM, sometimes it
          can take a while to get it back.
          PAYTON pulls on his flight uniform and squeezes his feet into
          his shoes. BOWER notices the identification tattoo on his
          forearm, partially obscured from view;
          FLT>>00... (obscured by grime, hair and angle). Unlike his
          own, PAYTON'S tattoo is faded with age.

                         BOWER
          I've been awake for at least an hour and
          I still can't remember my... anything.

                         PAYTON
          Listen, the last time I crawled out of a
          hyper bunk, it took me... quite a while
          to get it all back.
          BOWER holds his frown as PAYTON squeezes his finger into a
          wedding ring.

                         BOWER
          What was... your last flight, sir?

                         PAYTON

                         (BEAT)
          Don't recall. The Kuiper Belt odyssey?
          Don't worry, it'll come back, eventually.
          PAYTON kisses the photo of his wife.

                         PAYTON (CONT'D)
          I've gone through this before. I just
          can't remember why I would agree to do it
          again.
          PAYTON goes to close his locker and BOWER motions with a
          serious tone.

                         BOWER
          Sir? I know this is going to sound
          strange, but do you even know where we're
          going? I can remember the training,
          but... not the mission. Know the
          procedures, not the... destination.

          Didn't even know the ship's name until I
          saw it-on the console. For all I know
          this was another damn training exercise-

          Trust me, it's not. if this is a
          simulation...
          PAYTON notices both of their reflections off the mirrored
          panel inside the locker... revealing their WHITE HAIR.

                         PAYTON (CONT'D)
          Someone is taking the joke a little far.
          He shuts the locker and they exit, the flashlight's beam
          panning away, taking us into darkness.

                         CUT TO:

          INT. SLEEP CHAMBER COMPARTMENT/CONTROL DESK - LATER

          BOWER and PAYTON are standing at the control console, the
          screens flickering with distortion. BOWER hands him a coffee
          and PAYTON takes a sip... with a wince of disgust.

                         BOWER
          None of the activators are working.

                         PAYTON
          Figures. We can ride two hundred
          thousand tons of space freighter across
          the galaxy without a dent in the hood,
          but can't get one good cup of coffee.
          PAYTON flips a few switches with no result of power.

                         BOWER
          Without the mainframe, we can't connect.
          I don't know how we'll ever be able to-
          PAYTON is in his element at the control desk, flipping open
          an emergency auxiliary-power panel. He snaps open a handle
          and he forcefully gives it several rotations with a MOAN of
          whirling magnetos. The hand-crank allows a dim glow of
          electricity to the light panels.

                         BOWER (CONT'D)
          Oh, I- didn't even think of that.

          Fucking teamsters. Maybe they couldn't
          get to us.
          BOWER eyes the third empty sleep-chamber.

                         BOWER
          Where could he have gone?
          PAYTON gazes off blankly. A RUMBLE of FLICKERING LIGHTS pass
          and the computer screens slowly fade, going black.

                         PAYTON
          The power systems must be free-floating
          off blown circuits or something. The
          over-ride grid won't even lock in.

          Whatta ya think?

                         PAYTON
          I think we need to find a deck of cards
          and call the union.
          Distant THUMPS are heard overhead and they freeze... watching

          Hmm. Ventilation... maybe. Systems keep
          re-booting after each surge. That could
          be anything.
          THUMPS fade as the ship eerily MOANS and CREAKS.

                         PAYTON (CONT'D)
          I say we get out of here. I'd rather be
          up and out then stuck in the trunk.
          The room is blocked by the two heavy steel doors on either
          end, security doors ten feet wide. PAYTON leads the way
          towards one end, gesturing towards the doors.

                         PAYTON (CONT'D)
          We're not far from the bridge but without
          the circuits locked in... I don't know
          how we could ever get this thing open.
          As they approach, their flashlight beams pan across the door
          to see jagged chips and scratches all along the edges. Tools
          are scattered on the floor, the control panel ripped open.

                         BOWER
          Jesus. Somebody was trying to get out.

                         PAYTON
          Ironic. I think it was built to protect
          us.

                         BOWER
          (gesturing to the third pod)
          Well, he got out... some how.
          A RUMBLE approaches... another SHUDDER that FLICKERS the
          lights. They watch the ceiling as BOWER counts in his head
          as it fades.

                         BOWER (CONT'D)

          It's not circuitry. Reactor timing is
          off-set in the core. Seems sporadic, but
          it's not. Each revolution decreasing
          before starting over from the beginning.

          I dunno. I can't remember my own- but I
          know everything there is to know about
          that damn reactor.

          That's twelve revolutions, before
          recycling. And this one will only last-
          As they watch the ceiling, their flashlight beams stop on a
          small ventilation shaft that's been ripped open. They
          exchange a look and...

          BOWER tucks it into a zipper pocket and his photograph falls

          as PAYTON peeks inside behind him. With one last look, BOWER
          holds the pen-lamp in his teeth and begins to crawl, pushing
          himself forward on his stomach, only several inches at a time
          in a rhythmic motion.

          shaft... silently into nothing.

          He begins to remove his shoes and the radio on his belt
          suddenly CRACKLES with activity.

          Bower? You there-?
          BOWER lunges and they go into a violent spin, crashing over a
          table. Dishes clatter, gasps and grunts... only glimpses of
          the fight through the flicker of light.
          CRACK! BOWER'S hit, sent flying and he looks up to see her
          silhouette approaching, edged weapon in her hand.

                         BOWER
          Stop! Stop it! Listen to me! Hold it!
          she attacks and he frantically throws dishes and chairs to
          fend her off. She throws the blade, the blunt end deflecting
          off his forearm.

                         BOWER (CONT'D)
          You crazy fucking bitch-
          He wields the only weapon he can find... his shoe. And her
          attack abruptly halts, slowly back pedalling with fright.
          BOWER is confused, realizing her eyes are looking past him.
          A BLUISH GLOW seeps in from the doorway, approaching from the
          corridor. He looks back to see NADIA is running for the
          kitchen... gone.

          He ducks below the tables as a FIGURE slowly enters the room,
          carrying a long steel spear-like device with a splinter of
          blinding BLUE FIRE on the tip, fueled with a chemical sprayer
          like a welder's torch.
          His obstructed view reveals the FIGURE as a tribal warrior,
          scantily clad, elongated muscular frames, pale skin coated in
          hydraulic fluid. Bald head with clumps of tangled hair. It
          moves smoothly and silently, jabbing the tip of the flaming
          device into each corner and crevasse, as if flushing out
          anything hidden.

                         BOWER (CONT-D)
          (under his breath)
          What the hell is-
          The FIGURE quickly spins his direction and SNAPS a lever on
          the spear-device, killing the blue flame and taking us
          instantly into darkness.
          BOWER holds his breath with fright, back pedalling on his
          knees as his eyes try to adjust to the dark. He takes an
          uneasy breath to realize... there is more then one.
          Slowly moving out of the shadows, four more HUNTERS slowly
          emerge, like a unified pack on the prowl. They carry an
          assortment of crudely made weapons, spears and blades of
          sharpened metal.
          The apparent leader of the pack is HEFLIN, the largest and
          strongest of the group and he directs the pack with an
          assortment of odd vocal sounds, deep HISSES from the throat
          and gargled CACKLES.
          On command, the one HUNTER flips a lever and the BLUE FLAME
          crackles back to life with a burst of flammable liquid. The
          hunt continues, the pack weaving through the debris,
          following NADIA'S path.
          As the BLUISH GLOW fades, BOWER is left bewildered and
          terrified. Suddenly, his radio sounds...

          PAYTON (ON RADIO)
          Is that you!? Bower--
          BOWER frantically flips it off as one of the HUNTERS suddenly
          turns back.

          WEASEL, a small framed hunter searches the area like a

          On closer examination, WEASEL is coated with war paint and
          decorative scars marking his skin.

                         BOWER POV
          The only clear view is off an overturned bowl that shows
          WEASEL'S face, oddly contorted in the rounded reflection.
          WEASEL is headed directly for BOWER until.., a HISS from
          HEFLIN calls him back. WEASEL takes one last look before
          turning back, the torch fades from view, taking us into
          black.
          We hear... BOWER'S breath, heightened gasps of fear as he
          begins to crawl away.

          occasional FLICKER of LIGHT. A whispered conversation
          between BOWER and the radio slowly comes into ear-shot as we
          find him, hidden beneath a console.

          If they're in there... why haven't they

          He pulls out a silver flask, bone dry. He reaches further,

          Yes. If I can... we can take control of
          the ship. Open the doors, lights, get on

          SOUNDS are heard in the walls... THUMP, THUMP, THUMP.

          BOWER backs to the wall, nervously scanning the corridor,
          struggling for breath.
          In the background a SHADOW moves at the end of the corridor.

          infirmary, slash marks and battle scars from bladed weapons.
          Through the wreckage he spots... what appears to be a WINDOW.
          The haze of outer space and an odd-colored MOON are visible.

          BOWER climbs through the debris towards the apparent window,
          but it's pretty far up a slanted wall and he begins to climb.

                         BOWER
          I'm just thinking, maybe there's
          something we haven't considered. Eden
          failed... because of ODS syndrome. The
          one officer who was suffering from
          Pandorum. Cabin Fever. Maybe there was
          something similar with one of the earlier

                         TEAMS-

                         PAYTON
          No, no, no. You're talking about- Eden
          was lost because of a mechanical failure,

                         I
          simple as that. A systems malfunction.
          BOWER pauses his climb, looking up towards the "apparent
          window", inside what appears to be a bluish moon, dotted with
          craters. He eagerly continues his climb, growing closer.

          That was the report... but don't you
          remember the story of the one flight
          officer... the real story? They say he
          went lunar, launched the entire ship,
          five thousand people killed with the flip
          of a switch. All from a bad case of
          cabin fever-?

                         PAYTON
          spook story, along with a million others.
          Eden was mechanical failure, not human
          error. A. glitch... that was remedied way
          before we ever-

                         BOWER
          And why did they switch the rotation
          shifts from three years to two? And they
          eliminated the manual over-ride-

                         PAYTON
          They did that for obvious reasons, not
          because of Eden.
          BOWER pauses... within reach of the window only to realize it
          was an illusion. A glass compartment door left slightly ajar
          was reflecting a circular light panel, smeared with oil to
          give the illusion of craters. His shoulders drop in defeat.

                         BOWER
          Well, at least we didn't wake up...
          floating away in a coffin.

                         BOWER
          Something happened to the other team?
          Maybe there was... Pandorum.
          BOWER looks to his own hand, cradling the weapon... his
          FINGERS gently TREMBLING. He makes a fist and shakes his
          hand, firmly grabbing the weapon.

          THUMP, SCRAPE... RATTLE.
          He turns his light towards the ceiling and wall, which almost
          seems to silence the sounds. The crackle of the radio snaps
          him from his thoughts...

          wire snare. It appears to be the same dead body he witnessed
          before, but as he steps closer, it's different. This body
          has ripped clothing and isn't gutted.
          It's... SHEPARD, a thin-framed man in a torn crew uniform,
          tangled in a wire snare wrapped tightly under his arm and
          around his neck.

          AAAAEEEE IH !
          His SCREAMS echo down the corridor, desperately fighting
          back, like an animal caught in a trap.

          BOWER hits him in the gut, knocking the air from his lungs.
          SHEPARD crumbles, wheezing for air, going silent.

          SHEPARD'S gaze is hollow and disturbed, deeply traumatized.
          BOWER pulls on the wire that's rigged to the hydraulics of a
          nearby doorway, SHEPARD moans.

          floor gasping. BOWER kneels over him to help, but SHEPARD
          erupts with a shriek, like a hyper-sensitive rape victim.

          BOWER'S clean uniform and the radio boom on his chin. He

          That's not going to help you.
          SHEPARD runs as BOWER hesitates, holding the gun towards the
          GLOW that grows brighter, HISSES and CACKLES approaching.

          BOWER turns and runs, trying to follow SHEPARD as SHADOWED
          HUNTERS move past the end of the corridor.

                         CUT TO:

          INT. FILTRATION COMPARTMENT - MOMENTS LATER

          BOWER has a difficult time trying to keep up as SHEPARD
          weaves through a compartment filled with filtration units and
          a maze of piping.
          BOWER spots a clear path but BUMPS into glass. He realizes
          the compartment is separated by thick glass dividers. He
          changes directions and sees SHEPARD crawling through a vent.
          He tries to follow as... a BLUE TORCH moves past the doorway,
          bare feet running across steel. A collection of HISS and
          CACKLES grow louder.
          BOWER crawls under piping to hide. He notices the activation
          lights on his weapon fading... and he quietly tries to give
          the energy lever a few turns... but the WHINE seems too loud.
          He spots SHEPARD twenty feet away, hidden behind a console.
          I They exchange a look and SHEPARD angrily waves him away.

                         SHEPARD

                         (MOUTHING)
          Don't follow me! I can't help you-
          SHANK! A wire noose SNAPS tight around SHEPARD'S neck. Much
          like a pole and wire rig used to wrangle alligators, the wire
          is released from the rig and SHEPARD bursts into a wild
          frenzy, trying to run while on a thirty foot long leash. The
          wire loops and tangles around the piping as...
          HUNTERS move in from every direction, blades whirling.
          SHEPARD'S SCREAM intensifies as the HUNTERS huddle over him.
          BOWER viciously cranks the energy lever on the weapon and
          climbs out of his hiding place as... SCREAMS intensify
          within the brutal attack as the HUNTERS begin to feed.
          SEEPARD'S neck is twisted far enough to SNAP!

                         BOWER

                         FUCKING BASTARDS-
          I BOWER raises the gun towards the back of the lead hunter,
          only fifteen feet away. He pulls the trigger and rusted
          metal SCREECHES! Jammed.

                         CONTINUED:
          He panics, grabbing the gun with both hands, checking for a
          safety switch and... KA-WHAP! The weapon discharges a
          tremendous BLAST of energy off to the side.
          -The weapon is designed to destroy biological and organic
          material, but for safety precautions, it's unable to
          penetrate man-made materials like lead, glass or steel. It's
          unable to puncture the ship's hull.
          The energy blast is an electrical discharge that CRACKS like
          lightening and echoes like thunder. The blast HITS the side
          of the wall with a deafening RIPPLE of aftershocks,
          shattering anything fragile and knocking over anything not
          fastened down within a thirty foot radius. This little thing
          packs a punch.
          The HUNTERS turn towards BOWER, the lead hunter turning to
          reveal itself as...
          } HEFLIN, a muscular-frame larger then the rest, skin
          glistening with a layer of hydraulic fluid along with tribal
          I scars and distorted war paint. His eyes hidden under shadow.
          He slowly lifts his shoulders while lowering his head, much
          like the fluid motions of a reptilian predator.
          BOWER frantically cranks the energy lever and raises it
          toward HEFLIN, completely unaffected by the threat. He
          squeezes the trigger and...
          KA-WHAP! The gunshot is THUNDEROUS, HITTING the unseen glass
          divider between them. The safety glass absorbs the blast,
          sending a SHUDDER through the hull.
          HEFLIN barely flinches, stepping closer with a HISS. Off his
          command, the HUNTERS take chase, swarming in every direction,
          searching for a route around the glass divider.
          BOWER runs for his life.

          BOWER is running like a madman, ricochetting off doorways and
          tripping over pipes in the darkness.

                         BOWER
          They got him! They fucking ripped him
          apart! They're-

          PAYTON (ON RADIO)
          Don't look back! Hear me? Just go! GO!
          BOWER finds an open corridor and sprints as...
          Blades SCRAPE across metal, Blue.torches ROAR, HISSES echo.
          BOWER gasps heavily, hyper-ventilating as he catches glimpses
          of HUNTERS on his trail and running parallel in adjacent
          corridors, closing in with unnatural agility and speed.

          the booby-trap at full speed causes the wire to rip out of
          the door frame and...
          BOWER tumbles as the wire loops around his leg and he FALLS
          off the edge of a loading shaft, into an open elevator shaft
          that drops into darkness.
          The wire tightens and he's swung by the foot back into an
          open corridor, two floors below, like a demented base-jumper.
          He SLAMS into the ceiling and spins wildly over the open
          shaft as his transmitter falls all the way to the bottom
          exploding on IMPACT.

                         BOWER
          Aaaargh!
          Footsteps are heard approaching overhead. On the floor below
          him are his weapon and flashlight. He stretches for the
          gun... too far from his reach.
          The flashlight is "on", illuminating the area. He pushes off
          the wall and reaches for it... fingers touching, but unable
          to grab it.
          The GLOW of torches grows in the loading shaft and BOWER
          pushes off, reaching for the flashlight. Unable to retrieve
          it, instead he pushes it... into the open loading shaft. It
          drops all the way to the bottom as...

                         ANGLE ON
          HUNTERS step up to the edge of the shaft, looking down to see
          the flashlight fall from sight...

                         ANGLE ON
          BOWER swings back, grabs the wall and freezes.

                         ANGLE ON
          The HUNTERS hear the flashlight HIT the bottom of the shaft
          and then slowly double back. Torches fading.

          ANGLE ON/CLOSE UP
          BOWER'S face fills with blood as he hangs upside down, trying
          to catch his breath. His grip is weakening as he looks up to
          see... a shadowed FIGURE crouched with a spear in hand,
          leering at him from the shadows, approaching. With no time
          to defend himself and no where to go...

          SCREECH!
          The cable is violently tugged from above, jerking BOWER
          upward, pulling him away from the wall. He spins wildly
          trying to grab back onto the wall as...

          SCREECH!
          The cable yanks BOWER upwards with enough force to hit the
          ceiling and swing toward the open shaft. His fingers claw at
          the wall as he's literally being reeled in like a fish. He
          sees the FIGURE charging with a bladed spear. He's knows
          he's done for and...

          SNAP! The wire is slashed, BOWER breaks free hitting the
          floor as the cable is jerked up and out of sight.

                         ANGLE ON
          The silhouettes of the HUNTERS on the ledge, several levels
          above, inspect the loose cable and after a HISS, they turn
          back, fading into the shadows.
          BOWER lays on his back, squirming in the tangled wire as the
          FIGURE hovers over him, spinning a bladed weapon in his hand.

          BOWER (CONT' D )
          Please... don't- Please, listen-
          The FIGURE slashes BOWER'S sleeve, rips away the fabric and
          looks at his identification tattoo.
          BOWER quits squirming as the FIGURE leans closer into the
          light with a curious frown.
          TANAKA, a Japanese man in ripped and modified clothing.
          Unlike the awkward gauntness of the HUNTERS, he has a full-
          framed, hard-edged physique and soft brown eyes.

          A pin-point of light appears at the end of a circular tunnel.
          Slowly the light grows as BOWER approaches and cautiously
          steps through a doorway and into...
          A rec room with several rows of pool tables, video games and
          a ran-sacked bar. The floor is heavily littered with broken
          glass and BOWER wipes his finger across a wet surface on the
          bar, tasting it with an eye brow raised.

                         I BOWER

                          (TO HIMSELF)
           Open bar. Gotta be... E-deck?

                         I
          He climbs over the bar, checks numerous cabinets only to find
          more broken glass and emptied containers. About to give up,
          he pops open the last cabinet and...

                         CONTINUED :
          POW! A FIGURE lunges out, a direct HIT under his jaw sends
          him backwards over a table. The FIGURE jumps on top of him,
          jabbing a blade toward his neck. He grabs the wrist just as
          the tip begins to dig into his throat.

                         BOWER (CONT'D)

          AAAAARRRRGF! !
          A quick struggle ensues and just as BOWER is about to be
          sliced open... CRACK! The ATTACKER is HIT and sent flying.
          TANAKA has come to his rescue, twirling a pipe across his
          palms. The ATTACKER rolls to her feet to reveal... NADIA.
          She snatches a pool ball off the table and throws it directly
          into TANAKA'S chest.

                         TANAKA

          UUUGH!
          She rolls across the floor, grabbing her knife and... BOWER
          BLINDS her with his flashlight, raising the gun with a quick
          whirl of the energy lever, laser sights flaring brightly.

                         BOWER

          HOLD IT!
          BOWER ducks as a broken bottle WHIZZES past his face,
          smashing against the wall. He raises the gun and...
          KA-RAAAACK! A deliberate warning shot goes past NADIA and
          HITS the bar, SHATTERING every piece of glass that's near by
          and NADIA and TANAKA are both blown off their feet.

                         BOWER (CONT'D)
          Knock it off! Both of ya!
          TANAKA and NADIA slowly recover, both quickly try to find
          their weapons on the floor.

                         BOWER (CONT'D)
          Listen... nobody needs to get hurt here.
          Both of you just... cool out. And stop
          throwing that shit.
          Her eyes dart with uneasiness as she finds her knife.

                         BOWER (CONT'D)
          Let's all just... go easy here. I
          understand it's been every man for
          himself around here lately, but if we're
          going to get out of this- A little God
          damn solidarity wouldn't hurt.

          We can work together here. We all want
          the same thing... right?
          NADIA remains poised, ready to fight, knife raised. Sighing
          with defeat, BOWER gestures, hands raised as he motions for
          TANAKA and they slowly back towards the door.

                         BOWER (CONT'D)
          (motioning to Tanaka)
          Thanks... again.
          TANAKA motions toward the emblem on his uniform and gestures
          to himself.

                         BOWER (CONT'D)
          Yeah, yeah. I get it. We can work
          together on this, right?
          TANAKA grins.

                         BOWER (CONT'D)
          As long as we understand each other.
          They head out of the room as... NADIA watches from the
          shadows with a curious frown.

          INT. CORRIDOR - MOMENTS LATER

          BOWER and TANAKA head down the corridor, both of them
          checking their backs as they come to a sealed doorway.
          TANAKA is still wincing, rubbing his chest with pain.

                         TANAKA

          Yeah... well no sympathy here. She left
          me with a few sore spots too, pal.
          They both go to work, attempting to wedge the door open with
          pipes. BOWER looks back to see... NADIA. They back pedal
          with weapons in hand and NADIA is unaffected, watching them
          with a frown.

          I didn't think there was any flight crew
          left. What's happened to us?

                         BOWER
          That's what I'm trying to figure out.
          Malfunction of some sort-

                         NADIA
          Gee, you think? Where are you going?

                         BOWER
          I'm heading for the reactor bay.

          You just wake up?

                         BOWER
          Just joining the program already in
          progress, yeah.
          She eyes him over and TANAKA keeps the pipe raised.

          You'll never make it.

                         BOWER
          Oh yeah? And why is that?

                         NADIA
          You're going the wrong direction.
          She grimaces and turns, heading back up the corridor. BOWER
          and TANAKA exchange a look. BOWER chases after her.

                         BOWER
          Hey? Wait a second- HEY?

                         NADIR

          Wait- Can't join the team without a
          name.

                         NADIA
          Team? Why would I want to join?

                         BOWER
          Because I need you to show me the way.

                         NADIA
          To the reactor? No thanks. Don't like
          going that fax down. No one ever comes
          back.
          She continues up the corridor and BOWER grabs her arm. She
          yanks away from his touch, squaring off, weapon in hand.

                         BOWER
          Hold on. Please- There's not much time
          left before we lose everything onboard.
          You understand what I'm trying to-

                         I NADIA
          Do you know where this ship is headed?

                         BOWER
          I'm working on it.

                         NADIA
          Can you fly it?

          Sure.
          NADIA eyes him over, sizing him up.

          LIGHTS FLICKER past as...
          NADIA leads them down a long corridor that widens into an
          atrium of shafts going into the darkness in every direction.
          The further their lights pan across the shafts... a strange
          assortment of odd colored algae and moss is revealed growing
          up the walls of the shafts.
          TANAKA keeps a watchful eye as BOWER frowns at the
          surroundings.

                         BOLTER
          You know where you're going? This

          How long have you been awake?

          Don't know. There's no way to tell time
          in here. Two... maybe three months.

          MONTHS!?
          His voice echoes across the cavernous atrium and she glares-

          A SHUDDER is felt, a FLICKER of LIGHTS approaching. She goes
          to a control panel, holds down a switch and presses her palm

          As the power SURGE passes, the control panel activates,
          scanning her hand and the steel door activates with a MOAN of

          They're not- They can't be from this

          I something...
          He turns to follow her and pauses to see...
          The BIO-VAULT. A large lab storage compartment that has been
          "lived-in" for a long time. A bed has been created from
          assorted chair cushions and there is a collection of
          scavenged items. NADIA adds to the items, dumping the
          belongings of her bag onto the floor.
          BOWER is in awe as he approaches an entire wall of glass test
          tubes, a maze of micro-biological containers, glimmering with
          condensation.

          It' seems to be the only living thing left
          on this ship worth protecting.
          Regardless of the situation, we still
          have a mission. We've only lost about
          thirty percent of the specimens, mostly
          reptilian class. Never was big into
          snakes anyway.
          BOWER doesn't share the attempt at humor, wandering towards a
          darkened digital screen on the wall, displaying a charted
          graph of the new planet, TANIS.

          No, I- I didn't remember just how far
          away it is... until now. This was a
          hundred and twenty-three year flight.
          NADIA begins to gather a few items shoving them into a bag.
          TANAKKA leans closer to the glass display with fascination,
          tapping the tubes to see movement inside.

          How could I have forgotten that?

                         NADIA
          It comes only in pieces. Even after a
          few months. I know everything about this
          vault and its systems... but I still
          can't remember where I grew up. Or my
          brother's name. Only pieces... And the
          training comes back first. For good
          reason, I guess.
          BOWER eyes the darkened computer terminals, portions of the
          consoles coated in algae.

          only eight years?
          NADIA ponders the thought, rotating her jaw. She digs into
          her supplies and tosses him a small block of orange material.

                         BOWER (CONT'D)
          What is this?

                         NADIA
          Dehydrated meatloaf. House special. I
          save 'em for the weekends.
          BOWER sniffs it with a sneer and tries to break off a
          piece... hard as a rock.

                         NADIA (CONT'D)
          Do you know how long it would take to
          turn dehydrated meatloaf into that?

                         BOWER
          How long?

                         NADIA
          I don't know, but it takes more then a
          couple years to turn coal into fucking
          diamonds.

                         BOWER
          You think we've over slept?

          children's children... and any engineer
          could tell ya the warranty is running
          out. I think we've been asleep longer
          then you may think.
          BOWER tosses the orange brick. to TANAKA and he sniffs it with
          a grin, breaking off a piece. NADIA finishes gathering tools
          and she slings the bag over her shoulder, "ready to go".

          INT. SLEEP CHAMBER/CONTROL DESK - LATER

          PAYTON is asleep, seated on the floor, back to the wall. He
          is awoken by...

          RATTLE... THUMP, THUMP!
          He instantly grips the pipe and turns on the flashlight. The
          "SOUNDS" are closer then ever before as something is heard
          crawling towards the panel in the ventilation shaft.

          ANGLE ON/CLOSE UP
          A vent panel lightly RATTLES, the metal begins to bend.

                         PAYTON
          You want in? Come and get it you fu-
          The screwdriver SNAPS and the panel hits the floor. PAYTON
          raises the pipe, preparing to fight and... A desperate gasp
          is heard from inside the shaft.

          GALLO (O.S.)
          Help... me!
          PAYTON pauses, angling the light inside to see... GALLO, a
          young flight officer, boyish innocence, short-cropped hair,
          heavily coated in sweat, desperation in his eyes. His hair
          is dark brown, the only person without pure white hair.

                         PAYTON
          Who the hell... are you!?
          GALLO is tightly wedged inside the shaft, squirming to crawl
          out, trembling with fear and exhaustion.

                         GALLO
          Help me- I'm part- of the flight crew!
          I'm- Please- HELP ME!
          PAYTON oddly hesitates... before lowering the weapon. He
          digs into the shaft grabbing GALLO'S hand, pulling him out.
          GALLO collapses onto the floor, crumbling into a fetal
          position, naked. His hands are locked in claw-like grips,
          trembling uncontrollably. His gasps are rapid and unsteady.

          PAYTON runs to grab a towel and water. As he turns back he
          notices GALLO'S hip and legs are sprayed with dried blood.
          PAYTON kneels over him and GALLO spasms from his touch.

                         GALLO

          PAAARRRGH !

                         PAYTON

          PAYTON lifts the bottle to his lips, but the water runs down
          his face, GALLO is frozen in shock.

                         PAYTON (CONT'D)
          Com'on. Try to drink a little. Here.
          GALLO is unresponsive, wide eyes locked in a trance.

                         GALLO
          The... bridge.
          Saying the words seems to send him into a terrified trance.

                         PAYTON

          GALLO is hyper-ventilating, eyes wide with terror. A droplet
          of blood slowly builds in his nostril, refusing to drip. A
          low whine is heard in his throat as... LIGHTS FLICKER past.

          are collapsed, blocking passage. NADIA sighs with dread.

          We can't get through this way.

          chambers, stacked ten high on either side.
          They round a corner into the main atrium to see dishevelled
          equipment and smashed control consoles, scarred from battle.

          slide. The HISS grows stronger.
          They hold their position until... a SHUDDER approaches with
          FLICKERING LIGHTS. The power surge is enough to ignite a
          small landslide underneath them.

                         BOWER

                         SHIT-
          NADIA grabs his arm as bones snap and they slide helplessly
          to the bottom within a landslide of bones and flesh.
          The finally slide to a stop at the bottom of the slope and
          BOWER quickly raises his weapon towards the rafters to see...
          the HUNTER is gone.

                         NADIA

                         (WHISPER)
          Where... did it go-?
          He pans the light and... ROAR! The HUNTER lunges at them
          from five feet away. BOWER is STRUCK with enough force to
          send him flying, CRASHING into a pile of bones.
          NADIA spins around with a bladed pipe in her hands... but the
          HUNTER is already gone. She spins back and... THWAP! She's
          HIT from behind and sent with break-neck force into the
          floor. The HUNTER pounces onto her back and a claw-like hand
          grabs her hair... teeth opening towards her neck and...
          POW! BOWER charges into the HUNTER, tackling it and they
          spin into a brutal and distorted fight, seen under the
          FLICKERING LIGHT. Even though the HUNTER is a smaller one,of
          the pack, smaller then BOWER, its speed and strength is in-
          human. It grabs BOWER by the head with a GROWL and...

                         CONTINUED: (3)
          THWACK! TANAKA lunges out of the shadows, delivering a blow
          with his bladed pipe into the HUNTER'S face. It's a hit that
          would normally kill anything, nearly taking its head off.
          The HUNTER stumbles, staggers and... HIIIISSSSSST! It HITS
          TANAKA, sending him airborne, nearly knocking him out.
          Under the FLICKERING LIGHT, BOWER, NADIA and TANAKA all
          attack the lone HUNTER, taking all three of them to bring it
          to the floor. They viciously pound it with pipes and blades
          until it finally stops flinching beneath them.
          Its pale white skin seeps a thick black colored blood. The
          three of them back away, gasping and coated in its blood.

                         BOWER

                         (GASPING)
          Jesus... Christ- Jesus-
          Its face is smashed beyond recognition, but its facial
          features are horrifically distorted, no sign of eyes under
          the shredded tissue.

                         BOWER (CONT'D)
          What the... what the hell is it!?
          The HUNTER flinches and our gang back pedals with fright.
          NADIA continues back pedalling, looking towards the rafters
          to see... HEFLIN silhouetted, leering towards them.

                         NADIA

                         ANOTHER ONE-
          BOWER quickly finds his weapon on the floor and HEFLIN slowly
          begins to TAP his spear against the wall, echoing a continual
          clank through the hull.

                         BOWER
          What is he... doing?
          BOWER, NADIA and TANAKA quickly realize the effect as shadows
          begin to move.., the room is filling with HUNTERS, alerted by
          the tapping of metal.

                         NADIA
          Run.

                         BOWER
          They're... everywhere-

                         NADIA
          Run!

                         CONTINUED: (4)
          A low gargled HISS is heard from HEFLIN'S throat.
          NADIA is already gone. BOWER and TANAKA chase after her as
          the walls come to life, HUNTERS swarming onto their path like
          a pack of wild dogs.
          Before diving through the barricade, BOWER looks back to see
          HEFLIN and his pack have paused... to eat the fallen HUNTER.

                         CUT TO:

          INT. SLEEP CHAMBER/MAIN CORRIDOR - CONT.

          It's a panicked and mad dash through the dark as they crawl
          through the barricade and run back into the main corridor of
          sleep chambers. HUNTERS can be heard closing on their trail.
          They round a corner and NADIA jumps inside an empty sleep-
          chamber, frantically trying to pull the hatch closed. TANAKA
          follows suite, jumping inside another chamber and BOWER
          scrambles, in search of an open door as footsteps are heard
          quickly approaching.
          In a frenzied panic, BOWER dives into the chamber with NADIA,
          tugging the hatch closed.

                         FOLLOW THRU:

          INT. SLEEP CHAMBER - CONT.

          BOWER and NADIA are cheek to cheek in the cramped space, both
          gasping for breath and dripping sweat with terror.
          Through the porthole... silhouetted HUNTERS move past with
          weapons in hand, search and destroy style. One HUNTER steps
          up only a few feet from their porthole and they freeze,
          holding their breath. Slowly the HUNTERS continue past, the
          shadows slowly fading from sight.

                         BOWER
          What the hell happened to them!? What
          the hell are those things!?

                         NADIA
          Shut-up!
          They listen for a long moment... hearing nothing as BOWER
          looks at his hand, finger tips trembling.

                         CUT TO:

                         

                         

                         

                         

          72.

          INT. SLEEPING CHAMBER/MAIN CORRIDOR -- MOMENTS LATER

          The hatch door inches open and BOWER peeks out. He and NADIA
          crawl out quietly to see TANAKA waiting for them.

                         TANAKA
          Japanese - No subtitles.

                         BOWER
          I second that. Let's get the fuck out of
          here. Which way did we come from?

                         NADIA
          You want to go back?

                         BOWER
          No, I mean... let's just go!

                         NADIA
          We should go back. Find a different
          path. I don't think we can get through
          to the reactor bay from-

                         BOWER
          You said there was no other path.

                         NADIA
          I'm ready to explore other options-

                         BOWER
          Which way did they go-?

                         NADIA
          You really want to discuss it here!?
          A RUMBLE is heard approaching and they all crouch in unison.
          It's a power surge that sends FLICKERING LIGHTS across the
          massive corridor and a BLINKING LIGHT is activated on a
          nearby sleep-chamber. And then...
          BANG! The hatch door is KICKED from the inside, white gas
          erupting from the seam. Our gang quickly crawls toward the
          shadows, crouching behind equipment to watch as...
          Another KICK bursts open the hatch and a BIG PASSENGER crawls
          out, slamming onto the floor with a shiver of agony, gasping
          for breath, muscles twitching.

                         BIG PASSENGER

          AA.AAAA.RGH !

          73.

                         CONTINUED:
          The BIG PASSENGER tries to get to his feet, gasping and
          heaving, mumbling in Russian. BOWER tries to stand but NADIA
          pulls him back.

                         NADIA
          What are you doing-!?

                         BOWER
          They'll hear him- They'll- We've got to

                         HELP HIM-
          Footsteps thunder across the floor and... WHACK! The BIG
          PASSENGER is STRUCK by a single blow from HEFLIN. The
          HUNTERS have returned in full force and they come out of the
          shadows from every direction, bladed weapons spinning.
          BOWER pulls away from NADIA'S grip and prepares to intervene,
          but TANAKA suddenly grabs him, holding him back with force.
          With the BIG PASSENGER wounded and moaning on the floor, the
          HUNTERS gather in a circle in ceremonial fashion, praying
          thanks for the feast the ship has presented.
          They watch helplessly as the BIG PASSENGER is then brutally
          attacked and eaten alive. WEASEL leads other HUNTERS under
          the flickering light in a demented and twisted celebratory
          dance, a frenzy of pure evil.
          This attack is heard more then it is seen, under flickering
          lights, obscured view and most of the camera angles on Bower
          and the groups reactions.
          Frozen in horror, BOWER is tugged by TANAKA, following NADIA
          to the corner where she's lifted a grate in the floor. They
          climb into a shaft under the floor and into the dark as...
          The SCREAMS and HISSES echo through the hull.

          FADE THRU BLACK:

          INT. SLEEP CHAMBER/CONTROL DESK - LATER

          PAYTON is seated at the control desk, scrolling across radio
          frequencies, talking softly into the boom mic.

          PAYTON (INTO RADIO)
          Bower? Do you copy? You out there?
          Dead static. He sighs and glances toward GALLO, passed out
          on a nearby bunk. He hesitates, holding the pipe as a
          weapon, tucking it away and cautiously approached GALLO for a
          closer inspection.

          He feels his neck for a pulse. He notices the dried blood
          under his nose then gently pulls aside the blanket to see
          GALLO'S identification tattoo, reading; FLT>>004>>012.

          (frowning to himself)
          Team Four. Flight Team... Four?
          He glances up to see GALLO is now awake, staring at him.

                         GALLO
          What are you doing?

                         PAYTON
          Just... checking you.
          GALLO narrows his eyes, pulling the blanket tighter.

                         GALLO
          For what?

                         PAYTON
          To make sure you're... alright. You...
          passed out. You-

          Who the hell are you?

          Lieutenant? You're... a lieutenant?

                         PAYTON
          That's right. You're Team Four? You're
          suppose to be... my predecessor.
          GALLO deepens his frown, glancing around with disorientation.

                         PAYTON (CONT'D)
          You said... you came from the bridge?
          GALLO shifts his eyes back on him, a bad topic.

                         (LEERY)
          Yeah. So...?

                         PAYTON
          Where are we? I can't get guidance off
          this system and I have no idea where-

          Well, what did you see? How did--

                         GALLO
          Listen, I'm not a navigator. Stars all
          look alike. I don't know! How the hell
          would I know!?
          Sensing GALLO is about to break down again, PAYTON tries a
          calmer approach.

                         PAYTON
          Easy. I just want to make sure...
          GALLO'S hands are trembling, uncontrollably.

                         PAYTON (CONT'D)
          .you're okay-
          GALLO tucks his shaking hands under the blanket, defensively.

                         GALLO
          I'm fine.
          PAYTON lowers his stare, hesitating, glancing across the
          dried blood still splattered across his legs.

                         PAYTON
          Is this your blood... Corporal?

                         GALLO
          Some of it is... sir.

          They didn't give me any choice.

          Who didn't?

                         GALLO
          There was something wrong with them.

          It was... Pandorum.
          (off his look)
          Of the worst sort. They were- I
          couldn't even- I had to defend myself.

                         PAYTON
          Pandorum. Both of them-?

                         (UNCONVINCED)
          I believe you.
          PAYTON goes to a nearby compartment, popping open a First-Aid
          case; inside is a pistol-gripped syringe. He turns back and
          GALLO squares off, clenched fists.

                         GALLO
          What are you doing? What is that?

                         PAYTON
          It's just a sedative. Help you relax-
          GALLO lifts his fists with a threatening posture.

                         GALLO
          Then you take it... and relax.
          PAYTON backs off, setting the syringe aside.

                         PAYTON
          Take it easy. We're on the same team
          here. Alright?

          Sure, Lieutenant.
          PAYTON turns back to the control console and continues his
          search across the radio frequencies. He discreetly pulls the
          pipe weapon closer to his seat.

          LIGHTS FLICKER past...

          FLICKER CUT TO:

          INT. SUB-LEVEL SHAFT - LATER

          A FLICKER of LIGHT passes to reveal... BOWER crouched inside
          a three-foot high, narrow passageway, a crawl space beneath a
          steel grated floor. He follows the tunnel into a large silo
          lined with octagonal filters.
          TANAKA and NADIA are both looking for a way out, jabbing
          pipes into the grate overhead, unable to budge it.

                         BOWER
          Didn't we come through here already?

                         NADIA
          We gotta find a way out.

                         BOWER
          Out? Why did we come iii-?

                         NADIA
          I was trying to get us out of there alive-

                         BOWER
          I thought you knew where you were going.

                         NADIA
          I was trying to save our asses-

                         BOWER
          Could've mentioned that after the first
          mile. If I would have known we'd be
          doing laps down here-
          She angrily turns towards him, pipe in her hand.

                         NADIA
          I didn't need to help you at all! You
          and the Hong-Kong Express would still be
          playing ding-dong-ditch on level eight if
          it weren't for me!
          Their heightening confrontation is halted by...

                         TANAKA
          HIIISSST! ( .and whispered Japanese)

                         CONTINUED:
          They pause to hear... CLASSICAL MUSIC echoing from below.

                         BOWER
          What the hell is that?
          They climb down the shaft, jumping from filter to filter. At
          one level they follow the sound into a shaft opening and
          towards the soft, warm GLOW of YELLOW LIGHT.
          They reach an open hatch, peering inside to see...
          Inside an empty storage tank, a comfortable living space has
          been created; numerous chairs surround a make-shift dinner
          table made from storage crates with hand-made candles and
          various food containers. The tank appears empty.

                         BOWER (CONT'D)
          What is this!?
          BOWER and TANAKA begin to climb through and NADIA hesitates
          with uncertainty. They crawl through the hatch...

                         FOLLOW THRU:

          INT. TANK - CONT.

          They climb into the empty tank, lined with valves and
          filtration screens. The music is playing from crackling
          speakers hidden in the darkened circular catwalk overhead.
          TANAKA goes straight for the food and as soon as NADIA steps
          through the hatch... a wire SNAPS! Levers clank and a mouse-
          trap has triggered... SLAMMING the hatch closed. Trapped!
          They instantly turn back to the door, yanking and tugging in
          a panic. BOWER pans his light towards the catwalk only to
          see a FIGURE (LELAND) scampering through the shadows.
          Another lever is turned and... F00000SH! A stream of vapor
          shoots out of several vents along the wall. The colorless
          gas hits them and they instantly gag, choking for air.
          With the slanted walls of the tank, there seems to be no
          escape, but TANAKA runs up the wall, diving and grabbing onto
          a pipe, climbing upward toward the catwalk.
          The shadowed FIGURE (LELAND) quickly hobbles to the railing.

                         LELAND
          No, no, no. Back in der' big boy!

                         (CONTINUED)

                         

                         

                         

                         

          79.

                         CONTINUED:
          LELAND uses a spear to jab TANAKA'S hand. He loses his grip
          and tumbles back to the bottom of the tank. BOWER pulls
          NADIR out of the way of the hatch.

                         BOWER
          Get back! BACK!
          BOWER whirls the magneto lever on the weapon and he raises
          the barrel towards the hatch, nearly point blank.
          KA-CRAAAACK! The energy blast from the weapon hits the hatch
          like a lightening bolt sending a tremendous JOLT through the
          entire tank. A spark IGNITES the chemical gas and there's a
          BURST of flammable gas that rolls upward into the catwalks.
          LELAND is knocked off his feet and he GASPS with shock.

                         LELAND
          Whoa... WHOA! What the hell was that!?
          LELAND is exposed from his hiding place, waving the smoke
          from his face, bewildered. He's an older man who's lost all
          vanity over survival. A thin-framed, spidery little man with
          assorted clothing and a clutter of tools on his belt.

                         LELAND (CONT'D)
          What did you do!?
          BOWER whirls the lever on the weapon and points it at him.

                         BOWER
          Shut off the gas!

                         LELAND
          Where did you get that?
          BOWER angles the barrel towards a vent blowing out the
          chemical gas and LELAND jumps with fright.

                         LELAND (CONT'D)

          NO-NO! HO-HO!

                         BOWER

          SHUT IT OFF!
          LELAND scampers across the catwalk and quickly lifts levers
          and twists nozzles, shutting off the flow of chemical gas.
          His frown transforms to a grin, raising an eye brow as he
          stares into the barrel of BOWER'S weapon.

          INT. WATER PROCESSOR - MOMENTS LATER

          CLICKITY-CLICKITY-CLANK? LELAND cranks an energy lever that
          ignites a string of auxiliary lights around the tank,
          widening their view of the unusual living space. Several
          crates and an assortment of mechanical junk and supplies.

                         LELAND
          Com'in, com'in! Make yerselves at home.
          Just throw the coats on the bed and don't
          pet the rat, it's not mine. Just
          watching it for a friend.
          LELAND is excited to have guests as he runs along the
          catwalks, lighting candles and sealing valves. They watch
          him with leery suspicion, weapons still in hand.

                         BOWER
          You... live here?

                         LELAND
          Sublet. Got a roomier flat in the bow
          for the off season, but from here, ya
          just can't beat the commute.
          He grins, expecting a laugh, but doesn't get one. LELAND
          eyes BOWER over, admiring the uniform.

                         LELAND (CONT'D)
          You really a flyer, or did ya grab that
          off the rack? i didn't think there was
          any crew left.

                         BOWER
          Left? Have you seen any?

                         LELAND
          Well, only the captain. informally, mind
          you.

                         BOWER
          Captain? Where!?

                         LELAND
          Umm, up on B-Deck. Some on C. A few
          pieces on the promenade and I think his
          nuts are in the foose-ball game in the
          rec room.

          He smiles, revealing several missing teeth. No one laughs.

          Tough crowd. Com'in, com'in. Grab a
          bunk. Three singles or will a queen do?
          LELAND laughs to himself, digging through supplies. BOWER
          scans the walls, seeing no way up to the catwalks.

                         BOWER
          Why don't you come on down so we can meet
          properly?

                         LELAND
          Oh, no-no. No-can-do. I'm real touchy
          to the dust bug and who knows where yawl
          have been. No offense. There's
          something funky going around. But don't
          let that spoil the party. Here...
          LELAND lowers down a bin filled with assorted food items,
          using a wire to drop it to them. TANAKA sniffs it with
          suspicion.

          I LELAND (CONT'D)
          It's Kosher.
          BOWER peeks through one of the valves, turning to NADIA.

                         BOWER
          Where do you think we are?

                         NADIA
          I don't know. Gotta be somewhere below B-
          deck.

                         LELAND
          Why, where you gotta be?

                         BOWER
          The reactor bay. Know where it is?

                         LELAND
          Reactor? Now why would you want to go
          down there?

          INT. WATER PROCESSOR - LATER

          A small propane flame is lit. LELAND hovers over a make-
          shift stove, heating a can of water. He pours in some powder
          and stirs it up with the meticulous nature of a chef
          preparing fine cuisine.

                         LELAND
          It's tough to properly season with a
          motor oil base. But if you use your
          imagination, kinda tastes like...

                         (SIP)
          Herb and garlic dog shit.
          Below the catwalks, TANAKA has found a spot to rest, NADIR is
          using water to clean a wound and BOWER is peering through a
          slit in a vent.

                         BOWER
          How long have you been awake?

                         LELAND
          Mmmm. Lemme think. What's today,
          Tuesday? That would be about, mmm...
          He counts in his head and across his fingers, carefully
          calculating, then a grin.

                         LELAND (CONT'D)
          No idea.
          He turns back to his make-shift stove, chuckling to himself.

                         LELAND (CONT-D)
          I quit counting after the band broke up,
          ooooh twenty... thirty years ago.
          BOWER and NADIR exchange a look of uncertainty. The
          classical music begins to SKIP and without even looking
          LELAND kicks a piece of equipment, correcting the music.

                         LELAND (CONT-D)
          Then again, an hour in this place feels
          more like... one-fifteen, one-twenty.
          Know whatta I mean? HA-HP_W!

                         (SOBERLY)
          Not naming names but I'm writing a very
          strongly worded letter to the airline.
          LELAND chuckles, nodding to TANAKA. TANAKA glares.

          Christmas. Festive and violent. Let's
          eat; Shall we? Who needs a bib?
          LELAND sets several bowls of soup into the bin and lowers it
          to them with the cable. T_ANAKA is the only one interested,
          sniffing the soup with a glare. LELAND winks.
          BOWER takes a seat, showing exhaustion and defeat.

                         BOWER
          Those things out there. Could it have
          been something... that crawled out of
          your lab? Something that-

                         NADIA
          No. That's... not possible.

                         BOWER
          Then something got on board. Some kind
          of life form. Something that-

                         NADIA
          Or something that was already on board,
          with us in the hyper-bunks.

                         BOWER
          What does that mean?

                         NADIR
          it could have been the accelerator.

                         BOWER
          What?

                         NADIA
          It's the only theory I can come up with.
          The synthetic enzyme in our feeding
          tubes. The accelerator that would help
          our bodies adjust and adapt to the
          environmental conditions on Tanis. From
          what I've seen... these things have
          adapted... to the ship instead.

                         BOWER
          But, why would- You're saying we'll
          become like them? Why would they be
          affected like that and we're not-

                         NADIA
          I don't know. Like I said, it's the only
          theory I can think of- Unless...

          INT. SLEEP CHAMBER/CONTROL DESK

          GALLO'S gaze is hollow and translucent as he stares through
          the glass porthole in the empty sleep chamber, his mind is
          deeply pondering. Pupils dilated.

                         ANGLE ON
          GALLO is looking at the empty sleep chambers while PAYTON
          remains at the control console, determined not to give up on
          contacting BOWER.

                         GALLO
          Do you know the symptoms of Pandorum?

                         PAYTON
          What?

                         GALLO
          Orbital Dysfunctional Syndrome.
          Pandorum. Ever witnessed the symptoms of
          first-hand?

                         PAYTON
          I've seen it before. But nothing that-

                         GALLO
          It's not something you can easily detect.
          Starts with a shiver. An itch. A slow
          boil... and without being able to get off
          the ship... there's no shutting off the
          heat. It'll boil over, no matter what
          you do.
          GALLO is slowly pacing the room and PAYTON watches him with
          uneasiness out of the corner of his eye.

                         GALLO (CONT'D)
          You don't believe me.

                         PAYTON
          I didn't say that-

                         GALLO
          How could they both have had it? The
          odds are insurmountable.

                         PAYTON
          I wasn't about to question any of your

                         ACTIONS-

          But, we all know Pandorum is greatly
          affected by any substantial psychological
          It has an emotional trigger effect.

                         PAYTON
          (off his look)
          That's what they say.
          GALLO slowly rubs his temples, with hesitation.

                         GALLO
          How do you think you would react... if
          you knew the truth?

          LELAND flips on dim flood lights, illuminating the upper
          walls of the tank where... like ancient cave-drawings, a
          I story has been crudely sketched out along the wall of the
          tank. LELAND lurks through the shadows, telling the tale
          with a campfire, spook story, flare of dramatics.

          hobbles across to the crudely sketched image of three

          NADIA grabs him with rage, glaring him in the eye.

          DON'T DO THAT! DON'T GIVE UP ON ME!
          Off her look, BOWER holds his stare, slowly seduced by her
          will. They look is broken by... LELAND'S stereo system
          CRACKLES with static, power slowly returning after the power
          surge, music playing.
          BOWER snaps out of his daze, turning to LELAND.

          out of his daze. GALLO looks up with a frown.

          BOWER (ON RADIO)
          Payton? Do you copy? Can you hear me!?
          He grabs the receiver.

          Our group is now crowded on the catwalk above the tank,
          huddled around an assortment of patched together electronic
          equipment. BOWER is speaking into a receiver, bound together
          with wire while LELAND cranks the power lever.

          rotation. It's worse then we thought.
          PAYTON looks to GALLO, who is silently watching with a hollow
          glare from the corner.

          BOWER (ON RADIO) (CONT`D)
          The ship is dying and I think that's why
          it finally woke us up. The entire system
          is heading into permanent shutdown and
          there will be no return. This entire
          ship will float off into eternity with no
          way of stopping it. We need to reset it.
          Are you hearing me?
          PAYTON and GALLO share a silent stare.

                         PAYTON
          I hear you. How do we get you in there?

                         I BOWER
          I need you to give me a path.
          PAYTON and GALLO'S silent stare hangs in the air for a
          moment, the tension between them unclear. PAYTON turns to
          the console, quickly typing into the keyboard.

          INT. LADDER SHAFT/CORRIDOR - LATER

          A flashlight beams cut into a shaft. It appears as if the
          gang is crawling backwards toward us, until our perspective
          realizes they're crawling down a long ladder.
          They reach the bottom level where a distant RUMBLE has grown
          louder. They follow the sound through a field of debris to a
          clear path leading to an open hatchway.
          BOWER checks the marker over the door and leads them down the
          corridor, preparing to step through and TANAKA grabs him,
          pulling him back.

                         BOWER
          What?
          TANAKA motions toward the hatchway, shaking his head. He
          i gestures for them to follow and leads them over debris and
          through a hole, hidden in the paneling.

          As they head across a loading dock, the room gradually grows
          more disturbed and dishevelled. Battle scars and centuries
          of wear and tear grow more and more evident as they cross.
          The BLUE GLOW of light can be seen through the passageway and
          a low RUMBLE grows louder as they approach. They crouch
          behind a large industrial condensers to catch their breath.
          I BOWER glances up to the surface of the condenser with a frown
          and he touches it with his fingers to find an odd-colored
          algae. He looks up to see it's grown all the way to...
          Be freezes to see a small shadowed FIGURE in the rafters
          above them, a smaller gargoyle-type silhouette, possibly some
          type of guard outside the entrance to the reactor bay.

          They exchange silent gestures and TANAKA heads one direction
          as BOWER heads the other... to corner it. The FIGURE begins
          to move across the rafter as TANAKA flushes it out.
          The FIGURE is forced to climb down, hopping to the floor,
          BOWER waits with his gun raised. Out of the shadows steps...
          A ten-year-old CHILD HUNTER.
          BOWER flinches with shock. The CHILD is a younger version of
          the hunters, awkward physique, pale skin coated with
          hydraulic fluid, oblong shaped head, eyes hidden in shadow.
          NADIR lowers her weapon.

                         (DEVASTATED)
          Oh... my... God...
          The CHILD suddenly crouches in a fighting stance with a
          i gargled HISS from its throat, the light catching its eyes to
          reveal WHITE RETINAS deeply hidden under a thin membrane of
          I skin. Everyone is too stunned to react except for TANAKA,
           who instantly raises his weapon, preparing to kill it.

                          NADIA (CONT-D)
           stop it! STOP IT! Are you crazy? It's
           just a child!

          Child! ? That's no child! What the hell
          is it!?
          TANAKA lunges, but NADIA blocks his attack. The CHILD HUNTER
          erupts with a horrific SCREECH, HISSING at them before
          turning and leaping back up and over the rafters,
          disappearing into the shadows. They are speechless.

                         LELAND
          Not as cute when they're little, are
          they?
          TANAKA runs after it. It takes a moment for the rest to

          It appears the CHILD has alerted his group as the BLUISH GLOW
          of flame can be seen growing stronger in the corridor, the
          sounds of CACKLES and HISSES approaching.

          THAP... THAP... THAP.
          Droplets of blood hit the floor at GALLO'S feet as he paces
          back and forth near the sleep chambers.

                         GALLO
          He's right about one thing. Once that
          thing shuts down, we're as good as dead.
          Nothing on this ship will ever turn on
          again. Ever. Not the air, not the
          lights, the heat... not even the pod's
          escape launch systems.
          PAYTON refuses to look up from the computer.

                         3 PAYTON
          What are you saying?

                         GALLO
          I'mï¿½saying... once it's done. We're
          done. But, we still have a way out of
          this... before it's too late.

                         PAYTON
          What are you suggesting, Corporal?

                         GALLO
          We can still launch ourselves in the
          pods. Before the ignition systems are
          completely dead, sir.

                         PAYTON
          Launching ourselves... into deep space
          when we don't even know where we are? We
          wouldn't last more then a few days inside
          those things. That's suicide-

                         GALLO
          A few days is better then what we have
          left here. I'll take my chances. How
          long do you think that reactor has been
          sitting? That thing could melt-down when
          he tries to fire the core. This ship
          could be ripped in half-

          abandon anything and we're not going to
          leave them behind-

                         GALLO
          We can't stay on this ship. You know
          that as well as I do-

                         PAYTON
          I said stand down, Corporal! That's an
          order!
          GALLO steps up behind PAYTON, his face revealed with a thin
          stream of blood oozing from under his nose, dripping off his
          chin, eyes hollow and pale. PAYTON refuses to look at him,
          continuing to type.

                         CUT TO:

          INT. LOADING PLATFORM - CONT.

          The HUNTING party has faded from sight in the opposite
          direction, leaving the hatch open to the reactor bay.

                         BOWER
          This is our chance.
          BOWER leads the way out of the hiding place, heading quickly
          towards the open hatch where an eerie glow and rumble is
          felt. They crawl through the hatch and enter into...

                         FOLLOW THRU:

          INT. REACTOR BAY - CONT.

          They crawl out onto the top of a massive cylinder shaped
          shaft, numerous catwalks lining the walls with nothing but an
          abyss of darkness below them. An odor hits all of them in
          unison.

                         BOWER
          This is it. We've got to get down there
          before they come back.
          BOWER looks for a path downward along the tangled metal of
          catwalks, coated in algae. LELAND'S fear has instantly
          surfaced, unable to move.

          BOWER ignores his pleas, heading down a ladder into the
          darkness, TANAKA and NADIA follow, pushing past him.

                         LELAND (CONT'D)
          You're crazy... You can't-

                         NADLA
          Shut-up! Move!
          LELAND stays behind, watching as they begin a perilous
          descent down the walls of the reactor bay wall. Clinging
          onto the pipes and railings of the catwalks, the odd-colored
          algae grows more and more dense... a dim glow slowly coming
          into view from below.
          With a gap in the catwalk, BOWER leaps across, nearly losing
          his grip. He looks down to see an odd pattern of white
          shapes near the bottom.
          Squinting into the darkness, he's unable to make out what
          he's looking at and he manages to crawl down further,
          reaching a gangplank that crosses to the towering reactor.
          He motions for NADIA and TANAKA to stay put and begins
          crawling across... towards a darkened control panel.

                         1
          LELAND is nervously watching from above, leaning further over
          the railing and... a pen-lamp slips free from his belt.
          The pen-lamp CLANKS off one of the catwalks and tumbles past
          BOWER... dropping to the bottom... hitting the floor and
          illuminating the strange white objects covering the floor
          as... DOZENS of HUNTERS, all sleeping. Their pale white
          bodies are intertwined and over-lapped resembling an orgy of
          the living dead.

                         BOWER

                         CHRIST ALMIGHTY-
          The fall of the pen-lamp causes one HUNTER to instantly
          spring to its feet, lifting its nose towards the air like a
          guard dog checking the scent.
          BOWER remains frozen, gripping the gangplank that hangs
          twenty feet above the field of sleeping HUNTERS.
          I Slowly the HUNTER returns to sleep, slithering its way back
          into the folds of flesh and BOWER continues his crawl
          across... reaching the control panel.
          Upon seeing the sleeping HUNTERS, LELAND fearfully backs
          away, exiting the room. NADIA and TANAKA grip the ladders,
          watching BOWER, holding their breath in fright.

          BOWER grabs a vine, but it breaks away and he dangles over
          the side, losing his grip. NADIA jumps across the gap and
          climbs down, extending her weapon for him to grab. Together
          they cling to the side of the reactor and BOWER taps the
          control panel switches and... nothing.
          His eyes widen with horror, quickly searching for a solution.
          He slowly pumps a primer switch and... the light panel
          flickers gently under centuries of dust and vegetation...

          INT. SLEEP CHAMBER/CONTROL DESK

          A light gently blinks on the control console and PAYTON spots
          it with a frown, running back from the door.

                         PAYTON
          He's in! That's the reactor's activator
          panel. We're going to make it out of

          No response. GALLO'S shadow moves behind him, his voice
          taking on a slight raspier and "older" tone.

                         I

          Trust you? How can I trust someone who
          isn't even honest with himself. Tell me?
          PAYTON refuses to acknowledge him, continuing to monitor the
          control panel. He discreetly slides his hand closer to the
          pipe weapon as he senses GALLO'S presence behind him.

                         PAYTON
          Gallo... you have to listen to me...
          Carefully. You don't haveâ¢to-
          GALLO steps closer behind him, his shadowed outline showing
          an imposing posture, his voice is forced and unsteady.

                         GALLO
          Don't do that.
          TRAP... TRAP... THAP. Blood drops hit the floor heavily.

                         PAYTON

          PAYTON slides his hand further across the console, reaching
          for the pipe weapon, eyes on the screen.

          Take it easy-
          GALLO'S presence is felt behind him, his voice seeming to
          grow raspier and uneven with breath, anger simmering.

                         GALLO
          I know this ship and what she's capable
          of better then anyone. I know her... and
          I know what she can and can't do.

          PAYTON shoves himself out of his chair, reaching for the pipe
          weapon to find nothing! He spins to see GALLO holding the
          pipe and the pistol-gripped syringe, glaring down at him.
          The heavy streams of blood are oozing from his nose and ears,
          insanity shown in his hollow gaze.

          GALLO (CONT`D)
          Who's being irrational here, Lieutenant?
          Tell me? Who's being delusional!? Hmm?
          PAYTON raises his hands, calmly submitting.

          BOWER and NADIA cling to the side of the reactor, quietly
          flipping switches and entering codes as... the sea of HUNTERS
          sleep below them.
          BOWER unfolds the auxiliary power lever, each movement
          creating a CREAK of rusted metal. He grips the handle and
          slowly begins to turn the magneto crank. The CREAKS of
          rusted metal and the low WHINE of magnetos grows louder.
          HUNTERS begin to stir in their sleep as NADIA watches them
          with fright.

          GALLO is jabbing the pistol-gripped syringe towards PAYTON,

          PAYTON kneels at the panel... entering the code.

          GALLO jabs the syringe gun towards the back of PAYTON'S head

          GALLO EXPLODES with RAGE... POUNDING on the hatch with a jack-
          hammer of fists, bones shattering in his own hands. PAYTON
          ignores his screams, going back to the console and typing

          BOWER cranks the hand lever faster and faster, the MOAN of
          magnetos growing louder and louder. He gives one last spin
          and hits the primer switch. A split-second of nothing and
          then the panels brightly come to life. The digital panel
          reads: >> ROTATION SEQUENCE >> CODE INITIATE TO PROCEED >>
          BOWER takes a sigh of relief and glances to see NADIA is
          frozen with fright. He follows their eye-line to see the
          entire floor of HUNTERS are awake, heads turned towards them.
          HEFLIN steps closer in their direction with a HISS.
          BOWER gasps and the entire pack of HUNTERS moves toward them
          and... suddenly, TANAKA bangs his bladed weapon against the
          railing with a heavy CLANK! The HUNTERS instantly turn
          toward his direction and TANAKA throws his weapon, HITTING
          one of the HUNTERS directly in the head.
          TANAKA jumps to the neighboring catwalk and breaks through a
          hatch, coated with vines and vegetation. HEFLIN screeches a
          command and the HUNTERS ignite in a chain-reaction, grabbing
          their weapons and taking chase like a swarm of attack dogs.
          They climb the wall with inhuman speed and rush out the
          hatch, following TANAKA.

          TANAKA is running at full sprint, bounding over dishevelled
          equipment and weaving through debris as the pack of enraged
          HUNTERS emerge from every direction to follow his path.
          One HUNTER gains quickly at a sprinter's pace and TANAKA runs
          directly for the open hatchway. (The hatchway they detoured
          earlier.) He dives through as the sprinting HUNTER is almost
          upon him.
          A booby-trap is sprung, hydraulic pistons SNAP a razor-wire
          that "clotheslines" the HUNTER, nearly ripping him in half as
          TANAKA hits the floor, rolls to his feet and keeps running.
          HEFLIN and the HUNTERS slash the tangled snare with their
          weapons, trying to break through.

          INT. REACTOR BAY - CONT.

          BOWER types quickly, flipping numerous switches and... a
          SHUDDER is felt, the tower begins to TREMBLE with a low bass
          MOAN, like an engine trying to turn over.

                         BOWER
          Com'on...
          NADIA looks back to see there are still HUNTERS in the
          reactor bay, ones who didn't join the chase, slowly coming
          out of the shadows, crawling up the walls.

                         NADIA

                         WAIT-
          He hits the final key as NADIA grabs his shoulder. He turns
          to see... WEASEL and numerous HUNTERS have them surrounded,
          waiting to pounce. With nowhere to go, they are done for as
          WEASEL CACKLES a command, the HUNTERS moving in, just as...
          SHIIIISSSSH! High pressure steam erupts from the reactor's
          pressure relief valves. The HUNTERS back pedal in fear as
          the ventilation system ignites... fresh oxygen hits the blue
          torches... BURSTING into BRILLIANT ORANGE FIREBALLS..
          The HUNTER'S scatter in a panic as the BRIGHT FLAMES are
          blinding and a tremendous SHUDDER travels through the ship
          like an earthquake...

          The SHUDDER hits the control desk, rattling the monitors and

          power after centuries of laying dormant.

          GALLO is shocked, pressing his face against the glass,
          peering across the computer terminals that are igniting.

                         GALLO
          Let me out. I can... help.
          PAYTON ignores him, typing rapidly into the keyboard.

                         GALLO (CONT'D)
          I'll help you! Please- I can help!
          PAYTON runs over to the security door and hits a switch on
          the sensor. The door doesn't react.

                         GALLO (CONT'D)
          What are you doing? You can't- You're
          trying to get on the bridge?
          PAYTON runs back to the console, typing into the terminal.

                         GALLO (CONT'D)
          You don't want to go in there, Corporal.
          PAYTON throws him a glare, continuing to type in commands as
          the room erupts with activity.

          GALLO (CONTT' D )
          What are you going to tell them? Huh?
          How are you going to explain that?

                         PAYTON

          Other HUNTERS have retreated away from the reactor, cowering
          in fear with the exception of WEASEL, enraged by the temple's
          disturbance. He HISSES as he lunges for BOWER. Trying to
          duck, they SLAM into the reactor wall and CRASH to the
          catwalk below.

          WEASEL has incredibly quick reflexes as he springs back to
          his feet just as BOWER charges into him, slamming into a wall
          of burning algae. The fire quickly spreads across WEASEL'S
          skin, igniting the oil that's been rubbed across his body.
          With WEASEL SCREECHING wildly and engulfed in flame, BOWER
          viciously continues pummeling him, throwing a rage of blows
          until the body stops twitching. The flames begin to catch on
          BOWER'S arms and NADIA pulls him back.
          They look to see most of the HUNTERS fleeing the room, but
          others have grabbed weapons. BOWER grabs her arm, pulling
          her towards the hatch.

          Slowly, TANAKA emerges from a hiding place, dropping down
          from the rafters overhead. With a grin he turns to head back
          the other direction to see...
          HEFLIN waiting for him.
          They stare one another down, both raising their bladed
          weapons as LIGHTS shatter and implode around them from their
          own intensity.
          HEFLIN lunges with a HISS and blades CLASH!

          and bewildered passenger crawls out to find himself in the
          middle of CHAOS. Before he can get a breath he's attacked by

          HUNTERS.
          What was once a dark and haunting chamber of metal, is now a
          disco tech from hell as lights FLASH across the corridor in

          HEFLIN'S head with everything he's got, but he won't let go.
          TANAKA lifts HEFLIN'S feet and ROARS as he charges himself
          directly into the wall, neck bones SNAPPING! HEFLIN goes
          limp, dropping to the floor dead as TANAKA gasps... looking
          down to see the damage has been done, blood flowing heavily.
          He takes a breath, turns to exit FREEZING to see... the CHILD
          HUNTER standing alone, sensing the death of HEFLIN with
          almost an expression of sorrow. TANAKA lowers his weapon
          and... THWACK! The CHILD stabs TANAKA in the chest with a
          small bladed weapon.
          TANAKA gasps with shock, collapsing to his knees, eyes wide

          Half way up, LELAND looks back to see them coming with
          HUNTERS close behind. He gives them a look before closing

          jabs with the pistol-syringe, they lock hands, grabbing one
          anothers wrists... slamming into the wall.
          Upon IMPACT with the wall, GALLO suddenly appears slightly
          older, his voice lowering in level.

          Corporal...
          PAYTON slams him against the wall, making him older.

          PAYTON slams him again, a FLASH that reveals GALLO has aged
          almost matching PAYTON, their voices sounding the same...

          twisted... lining up both of their identification tattoos to
          be identical... FLT>>004>>012>>.
          The syringe is stabbed into skin. The trigger fires liquid,
          injecting the chemical into someone's arm as their voices
          converge, over-lapping at first and becoming one voice...

          PAYTON is ALONE. He's just injected the syringe into his own
          wrist. He's the only person in the room. Heavy blood
          streams are running from his nose and ears.
          Y77e will now refer to PAYTON by his real name, GALLO.
          LELAND and GALLO exchange a look... GALLO seeming to snap out
          of his trance. LELAND approaches, wheezing for air.

                         LELAND

          GALLO suddenly SLASHES his throat! LELAND reels back in
          shock, throttling his own neck in horror, blood gushing.
          GALLO casually turns back to the console, continuing to type
          as LELAND tries to cry out, his voice gargled with blood as
          he staggers, collapsing to the floor. GALLO hits a key and
          LIGHTS IGNITE, the last door finally engaging.
          GALLO sigh with relief as the doors slide open revealing a
          corridor of stairs leading to the bridge. A warm and gentle
          smile widens on his face.

          He heads toward the bridge, while flipping another switch
          that ignites the opposite doors just as...

                         ANGLE ON
          BOWER and NADIA angrily burst through the hatch in the floor,
          jamming it behind them and run up the corridor. They see the
          doors sliding shut.

                         BOWER
          That's it! GO! Go for it!
          With HUNTERS hot on their trail... they run full sprint
          towards the sliding doors. HUNTERS lunge out of side
          corridors with SCREECHING HISSES as BOWER and NADIA dive
          through the sliding doors...
          One HUNTER is crushed by the doors., split nearly in half with
          a heavy THUD of steel and a MOAN of hydraulics. The HUNTER
          spasms wildly, kicking and clawing as BOWER and NADIA back
          pedal into the room. HUNTERS gather at the gap, stabbing
          weapons between the doors, trying to crawl through with
          SCREECHES and HISSES of rage.

          BOWER and NADIA back further away, turning to see the room.
          The original room that BOWER woke up in now looks quite
          different with all the systems engaged, BLINDING LIGHT coming
          from the monitors and computer terminals.
          They move through the room, passing the empty sleep chambers
          and the control console, seeing the entire pathway of dripped
          blood across the floor.

                         NADIA
          Where's... your lieutenant?

                         BOWER
          He's not my lieutenant.
          She frowns off his look and turns to see... LELAND on the
          floor in a pool of blood, throat slashed, dead.
          BOWER pulls the gun and heads into the open doorway leading
          towards the bridge as NADIA follows behind.

          INT. COMMAND BRIDGE - CONT.

          A tunneled stairwell widens out into the main flight bridge.
          A stunning sight, a split-level glass control deck, rows of
          blinking control panels and flight chairs. It appears
          undisturbed, a thin layer of silt floats out from under their
          footsteps.
          BOWER leads the way, panning the weapon throughout the room
          with no sign of GALLO. On the far wall; cockpit windows
          coated with a black fungus that obscures the view, but hints
          to the illusion of outer space, a haze of cosmic dust without
          stars.

                         NADIA

                         (IN AWE)
          What's happened... to us? Where are we?
          BOWER goes to the nearest control console, tapping the
          keyboard. The computer instantly responds, data scrolling
          across the screen.

                         BOWER
          Flight log. It'll tell us how long we've
          I been out... and how far we've gone.
          BOWER types in a command and the computer begins to scroll
          through the flight computer's time-code. Starting with the
          launch date and time the numbers begin to roll faster and
          faster. BLIP... BLIP... BLIP.

                         CONTINUED:
          NADIA walks towards the windows and suddenly jumps back with
          fright to realize one of the flight control chairs has a
          FIGURE sitting in it. GALLO, motionless and gazing toward
          the windows.
          Off her gasp, BOWER grabs his gun and approaches as the
          computer time-code continues to roll even faster with no sign
          of slowing... months becoming years.
          BOWER approaches from behind GALLO... his identification
          tatto now clearly visible... FLT>>004>>012>>. He cranks the
          lever on the gun with a WHINE of magnetos and the laser
          sights flare brightly onto GALLO'S back.

                         BOWER (CONT'D)
          Seems my little memory lapse has finally
          worn off... "Lieutenant".
          BOWER slowly approaches, moving closer to his profile, the
          stream of blood from GALLO'S ear shown running down his neck.

                         GALLO

                         (DRYLY)
          Mine too.

                         BOWER
          Who the hell are you?
          GALLO keeps his gaze towards the windows, emotionless.

                         BOWER (CONT'D)
          You're team four. Why would you...
          switch bunks? Pretend to be someone
          else? What would you be wanting to hide?
          Who the hell are you?

                         GALLO
          I was younger then you when I first came
          on board. Funny, I can't even remember
          what it was like... before this flight
          began. It's all I know.

                         BOWER
          You were the one... who first received
          the final transmission. Who refused to
          go back to sleep. You stayed awake...
          for all those years. What were you
          doing... what crimes were you hiding from
          when you took Payton's bunk?
          The time-code display rolls faster, years rolling into
          decades... BLIP, BLIP, BLIP.

          How the hell would you know all that?

                         BOWER
          Is it true? What have you done to us?
          Where are we now?
          GALLO lazily nods towards the windows.

                         GALLO
          Go ahead. Take a peek. You tell me.
          BOWER hesitates, looking toward the darkened windows. He
          stays with the weapon on GALLO as NADIA wanders toward the
          front control console, towards the glass.
          With the lights fading on the weapon, BOWER gives the lever a
          quick whirl, motioning the barrel closer.

          GALLO (CONT ' D )
          What are. you gonna do, Bower? There's no
          one left to hand out merit badges. No
          one left at all.

                         BOWER
          And that makes it okay? To play God?

                         GALLO
          You think God survived? He's gone...
          with the rest. There's no one left to
          judge you, Bower.
          NADIA approaches the glass, squinting towards the heavily
          smudged glass. She frowns, trying to wipe away the layer of
          sludge.

                         BOWER
          Judgement will come for you. You think
          you could cover it? Your victims
          survived. Evolved. That's your creation
          out there. Your crime.
          BOWER jabs the gun into his back with force.

                         BOWER (CONT'D)
          And you thought you'd be able to hide it?
          Who would ever suspect that? Who would
          ever remember? I remember.
          NADIA rubs the glass with her hand, squinting into the
          darkness. The time-code display rolls faster, decades into
          centuries... BLIP, BLIP, BLIP.

          No world left. No law. No order. Only
          us. You the law now? You gonna be the
          one that brings order to what's left?
          Wanna take a shot at it? I did my best
          with what I was given. Wanna be King for
          a day? Give it a whirl, Corporal. I'd
          like to see how you fare.
          With the laser sights fading on the weapon, BOWER quickly
          cranks the power lever, keeping the gun raised-
          A slow grin spreads across GALLO'S face as he finally looks
          to him, revealing the thick streams of blood that have
          dripped from his nose, coating his chin and neck.

          GALLO (CONT`D)
          Try to imagine it. Imagine... yourself
          for five minutes without morality. I'll
          bet you'd surprise even yourself, kid-

                         BOWER
          Shut-up.

                         (TO NADIA)
          What's out there?
          NADIA shakes her head, rubbing away the sludge from the
          glass, squinting harder.

                         GALLO
          Imagine... us both. What's left to stop
          you? I offer you the kingdom and you-

                         BOWER

                         SHUT-UP-

                         GALLO
          There's still quite a few sleeping
          beauties down there... a thousand
          flavors. You up for a little window
          shopping?

                         BOWER
          Shut-up!

                         GALLO

          I wanna see it. I'll bet you'd be a

                         REEEEAL TIGER-
          BOWER suddenly shoves him out of the chair, slamming him to
          the floor, jabbing the barrel into the back of his neck.

          There will be law... in whatever world we
          create. And you'll pay for what you've
          done. Believe me.
          GALLO chuckles with his face pressed to the floor.

                         GALLO
          A real boy scout, is that it, kiddo?

                         BOWER

          HEAR ME ASSHOLE?!
          NADIA suddenly GASPS... flinching away from the cockpit
          windows, having just seen what's outside. Her expression is
          ghostly as she back pedals.

                         BOWER (CONT'D)
          What is it?
          GALLO looks up with a blood-soaked grin.

                         BOWER (CONT'D)
          What do you see!?

                         I

                         GALLO
          You ready for the new world, corporal?
          BOWER keeps the gun on him as he goes to the windows. NADIA
          has a ghostly expression, unable to speak. BOWER leans
          toward the glass, squinting into the darkness and...
          SWISH! An object moves past the outside of the glass. He
          leans closer, squinting to see... a school of ALIEN FISH dart
          past. The shin is underwater.
          BOWER staggers in shock, back pedalling as GALLO continues to
          chuckle.

                         BOWER

                         (DISBELIEF)

          The time-code display rolls centuries past, more then a
          thousand years accounted for as it finally slows to a stop.

          BLIP... BLIP... BLIP.

                         BOWER (CONT'D)

          BOWER staggers against the console in shock,. the weapon
          lowering to his side.

                         GALLO
          I guess this thing does land itself.
          Just doesn't float too well.
          BOWER lunges towards him and GALLO is ready for this one,
          quickly countering his move and SLAMMING BOWER into the
          console. He unleashes a vicious BLOW into BOWER'S throat.
          BOWER collapses, choking for air and GALLO kicks the gun
          away. He kneels over BOWER, slowly pulling out a blade.

          G_ALLO (CONT'D)
          And you thought you could be King!?
          He slides the blade under BOWER'S neck and... there's a WHIRL
          of magnetos.
          He looks up to see NADIA cranking the lever on the energy
          gun. She tries to turn the gun towards him and...

                         I
          GALLO lunges toward her just as she's able to FIRE! The
          BLA..ST of energy goes into the console with a CRACK of
          1 THUNDER, knocking everyone off their feet. Shattered glass
          and metal HIT the cockpit window like a spray of shrapnel...

                         CLOSE UP
          .sending a thin crack across the surface of the glass.
          She struggles to crank the lever again as GALLO charges,
          hitting the gun away. He SLAMS her over the console.

                         GALLO (CONT'D)
          My apologies. Ladies first... of course.

          ANGLE ON/CLOSE UP
          The crack on the window begins to spiderweb across...

                         ANGLE ON
          GALLO grabs her hair to expose her neck and angles the blade
          upward, forcing her to take a GASP as...
          BOSSSH! Water explodes through the windows, hitting the room
          like a hundred fire hoses. GALLO is hit directly and thrown
          across the room as NADIA and BOWER are engulfed by the blast
          of black water, sent tumbling.

          INT. SLEEP CHAMBER/CONTROL DESK - CONT.

          The tremendous ROAR of rushing water rolls them down the
          stairwell and into the sleep chamber compartment in a raging
          torrent, a tidal wave slams into the wall.
          BOWER grabs onto NADIA and they claw themselves along the
          wall as computer terminals SPARK and LIGHTS go black. He
          pulls her to a sleep-chamber and he jumps inside the open
          hatch, pulling her with.

                         NADIA
          NO!? Are you crazy-

                         BOWER

          GET IN!
          He pulls her inside and turns to the control panel. He hits
          the keypad to read: >>> DETACHMENT INITIATED >>>
          BOWER struggles to close the hatch as water rushes in,
          SLAMMING it shut on top of them.
          GALLO struggles to keep his head above water as the fast
          moving current SLAMS him into the edge of the doorway. His
          I fingers claw at the manual lever for the door, tugging and
          tugging with no effect as the water rises above his head.

                         CUT TO:

          BOWER and NADIA are squeezed together inside the pod as water

          Under the roar of the rushing water, hydraulics ignite.
          Micro-jets FIRE and WHOOSH! The pod launches, shooting down
          a tunnel until they're HIT with a tremendous JOLT.
          They are sent spinning into a wild tumble as bubbles and gas
          erupt across the outer surface. BOWER and NADIA slam into
          one another as the chamber turns end over end.
          Its roll seems to slow for a brief moment and BOWER squints
          toward the porthole to see...

          They are pulling away from the side of the ship. The
          exterior hull of the massive space ship slides past at a high
          rate of speed with a swirl of ocean water and bubbles.
          BAM! The pod SLAMS into something as SPARKS fly and seals
          are ruptured as WATER sprays in with a blinding BLAST. The
          chamber is sent into another violent roll as NADIA and BOWER
          tumble head over feet, as if caught within a washing machine.
          The chamber finally steadies as water washes across the
          control panel, one last burst of sparks knocks out the
          lights, taking them into BLACK.
          Only their gasps are heard as they squirm towards the upper
          corner... only a foot of air remaining.
          He grabs the mask connected to tubes in the side and pulls
          the straps over her head.

                         NADIA
          I What are you doing!?

          going to wake up and drowned-

                         BOWER

          PUT IT ON!
          He pulls it over her face as the water rises with only
          several inches of air inside the chamber. BOWER gasps
          desperately into the corner.
          NADIA gasps the air through the mask, making her eye-lids
          droop, slowly going unconscious. BOWER gasps one last breath
          and the water rises over his head.
          BOWER watches her body go limp and squirms for air as... a
          warm GLOW of WHITE LIGHT grows brighter through the porthole.
          As sunlight dances through the porthole, he kicks at the
          hatch and...

          BOWER kicks open the hatch, gasping for breath. A gentle
          breeze ripples across the water with a sunlight flickering
          across the surface of an ocean.
          He pulls NADIA out of the chamber, ripping the mask off her
          face. Her eye-lids slowly begin to flicker back to
          consciousness.

                         BOWER
          Hey...? Hey?
          She chokes on the air and struggles to orientate herself,
          looking up to see him gazing down at her, coated with bright
          sunlight.

          It's all right. It's safe to wake up
          this time.

                         I
          With eyes of disbelief, they turn to see...

                         WIDE ANGLE
          They sit on the edge of the sleep chamber as it lightly bobs
          within the ocean waves. They're just off shore from a
          stretch of mountainous tropical islands with waves crashing
          against the beaches. The unusual shape of the islands and
          their geography are nothing like we've ever seen on Earth.
          Several moons dot the sky and the sun is rising with a
          brilliant glow on the horizon.

          FADE TO BLACK:

          INT. COMMAND DECK

          Pitch black. A low CHURNING is heard, a motor that is
          pumping as the water lowers, allowing us to see across the
          dishevelled command platform, the walls dripping with water.
          The water is being drained through the grates in the floor as
          unseen bilge pumps are heard loudly WHIRLING. The pump
          motors whine down and shut off as...

                         CONTROL CONSOLE
          A hand flips off the switch for the ventilation ducts. It's

          GALLO...

          126.

                         CONTINUED:
          standing at the console, having changed clothes and recovered
          from the ordeal. He examines the empty tank where BOWER'S
          sleep chamber once sat. He eyes the other sleep-chambers,
          deeply contemplating.
          He goes back to the control console, scanning across the
          numerous surveillance monitors that reveal...
          PASSENGERS and HUNTERS engaged in a variety of activities all
          across the ship. Some are seen fighting, some searching for
          food, some searching for a way out, some alone weeping. A
          kingdom, for the taking.
          He pulls out a coffee packet and slowly begins mixing himself
          a cup, deeply contemplating as he looks across the screens.
          He glances over to see... YOUNG GALLO, the younger version of
          himself, who is seated nearby, watching with a grin. The
          blood is gone from his face, appearing clean-cut, clean
          uniform.

                         YOUNG GALLO
          Well, if you're gonna be captain... what
          are we gonna do now?
          Off his look...

                         CUT TO:

          INT. SLEEP CHAMBER COMPARTMENT - LATER

          SHUSH... THUD. Doors open to another sleep chamber
          compartment, completely undisturbed. Four undisturbed sleep-
          chambers are lined against the wall.
          GALLO enters, now wearing the CAPTAIN'S uniform, he
          straightens his collar and kneels next to one of the pods,
          typing into the panel. A grin appears as he removes the
          wedding ring (PAYTON'S ring) he'd forgotten he's still
          wearing.

                         GALLO
          What is a King... without his Queen.
          He hits the control panel switch and...

          INT. SLEEP CHAMBER

          A FEMALE CREW MEMBER, a beautiful young woman, deep in hyper--
          slumber suddenly twitches... her EYES opening wide with a
          GASP as she stares into CAMERA.

          CUT TO BLACK.

          Caption: Bethlehem Creek, Wyoming 10:19pm 28/07/47

          The air is filled with the sounds of a warm, summer night. A
          light comes on in a FARMHOUSE window. The door opens, a small
          dog and a young girl emerge.

                         GIRL
          Go on now Paul, don't be long.

          The dog trots out across the property. It stops to scratch.
          The sounds of night cease. The dog stops scratching, sniffing
          the air, cocking its head, sensing something. We hear a low
          humming sounds. The dog looks up. We see a soft orange glow
          reflected in its eyes. The dog whimpers
          Back at the farmhouse, a deep, dull thud shakes the ground,
          bringing the small girl back out onto the veranda. An orange
          glow pulsates somewhere out in the darkness.

                         GIRL
          Paul... Paul?
          The girl draws near, illuminated by the orange glow.

                         GIRL
          Paul?!
          The glow fades again.

          EXT. SAN DIEGO STREET. PRESENT - DAY

          GRAHAM WILLY (32) and CLIVE GOLLINGS (33) stand in the
          blazing San Diego sunshine, waiting to cross the road. GRAHAM
          is thin but his clothes seem too small. He has long greasy
          hair, buck teeth and thick glasses. CLIVE is bigger and wears
          a long black leather coat, Red Dwarf T-shirt and boots. His
          hair is densely curly and shaped like a pyramid.
          Four people dressed as BORG from Star Trek pass by. GRAHAM
          and CLIVE shrug derisively. The cross-walk beeps.
          As the music kicks in, GRAHAM and CLIVE set off across the
          road towards the San Diego Convention Centre. They make their
          way through a throng of costumed Comic-Con attendees.

          INT. CONVENTION CENTRE. CONVENTION FLOOR - LATER

          GRAHAM and CLIVE are at a fantasy weapons stand. CLIVE is
          brandishing a KATANA SWORD. He test the balance, the weight,
          the sharpness. He closes one eye and looks down the length of
          the blade. He nods appreciatively.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          2.

                         CLIVE
          Beautiful piece.

                         VENDER
          Damn straight. Practical
          performance. 100% Japanese, folded
          steel. Real hero shit.

                         CLIVE
          How much?

                         VENDER

          $1,349.99.
          CLIVE nods, puts the sword down and walks away.

                         GRAHAM
          Aren't you gonna get it?

                         CLIVE
          No, it's rubbish.

          INT. CONVENTION CENTRE. SIGNING PAVILLION - DAY

          We see them on an escalator, walking down a wide corridor,
          passing people in a variety of costumes. Finally, they join a
          line of people waiting to meet the actor, MICHAEL BIEHN.

                         GRAHAM
          What are you going to ask?

                         CLIVE
          Do you feel that the killing of
          Hicks and Newt in Alien 3,
          invalidates Ripley's struggle at
          the closed of the previous
          installment?

                         GRAHAM
          I was going to ask that!

                         CLIVE

                         (IN KLINGON)
          Tough tits four eyes.

                         SECURITY
          Alright, next!
          Suddenly nervous, GRAHAM approaches. MICHAEL BIEHN is signing
          pictures. He is pleasant, if business like.

                         MICHAEL BIEHN
          Hey there. Who's it to?

                         GRAHAM
          Graham.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          3.

                         MICHAEL BIEHN
          Graham.

                         GRAHAM
          Uh... are you... did you?

                         MICHAEL BIEHN
          There you go.
          SECURITY moves GRAHAM on. CLIVE approaches.

                         MICHAEL BIEHN
          Hey there. Who's it to?

                         CLIVE
          Clive.

                         MICHAEL BIEHN
          Clive.

                         CLIVE
          Uh... are you... did you?

                         MICHAEL BIEHN
          There you go.
          SECURITY moves CLIVE on. CLIVE scrambles for his camera.

                         CLIVE
          I... I need to photograph him.

                         SECURITY
          You can take it from there.
          CLIVE and GRAHAM huddle together and try to position
          themselves with MICHAEL BIEHN in the background. CLIVE takes
          the shot. We see a frozen image of CLIVE and GRAHAM, with
          MICHAEL BIEHN barely visible in the background. The pair move
          off, looking at their spoils.

                         GRAHAM/CLIVE

                         (HIGH FIVING)

          YES!

                         GRAHAM
          That was amazing. I was actually a
          bit nervous.

                         CLIVE
          Really? I wasn't.

                         GRAHAM
          Good egg, wasn't he?

                         CLIVE
          Yes, very unaffected. Damn, I
          forgot to give him my card.
          CLIVE points at SECURITY.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          4.

                         GRAHAM
          Give it to Colossus.

                         CLIVE
          Nah. Hey, Rosario Dawson's here!

                         GRAHAM
          She NEEDS to call me.

          INT. CONVENTION CENTRE. SIGNING PAVILLION - LATER

          GRAHAM and CLIVE sit at a table fiddling nervously with pens.
          On either side of them are stacks of their new book; JELVA -
          ALIEN QUEEN OF THE VARVAK. A banner hangs behind, displaying
          the tome's cover, a muscular green woman in a gold bikini
          rides a blue rhino. She lashes at the beast with a laser
          whip. She has three tits. A lanky publicist paces up and
          down, making sure everything is in order.

                         PUBLICIST
          Looks good, right?

                         CLIVE
          Yes, it's very impressive.

                         PUBLICIST
          It really does the image justice. I
          never noticed the third tit.

                         CLIVE
          That was Graham's idea.

                         PUBLICIST
          Ladies man, huh? You guys happy?
          You got enough pens? You wanna
          Snapple? You wanna a Diet Coke?

                         CLIVE
          I'll have a fat Coke please?

                         PUBLICIST
          A fat what?

                         CLIVE
          Coke.

                         PUBLICIST
          Oh you man a FAT Coke.

                         CLIVE
          A what?

                         PUBLICIST
          Fat coke.

                         CLIVE
          Yes please.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          5.

                         GRAHAM
          When do we start?

                         PUBLICIST
          Ten minutes ago.

                         CLIVE
          Why is it so quiet?

                         PUBLICIST
          Sylar's doing a Q and A in the main
          pavillion.

                         CLIVE
          Oh man! I wanted to go to that . I
          wanted to find out if he actually
          eats the brains.

                         PUBLICIST
          I can make a call.

                         CLIVE
          Please.

                         PUBLICIST
          It'll pick up when he's done.

                         GRAHAM
          I'm nervous.

                         CLIVE
          Don't be. The hard work's done, we
          have a great story and as usual
          your renderings jump from the page.

                         PUBLICIST
          Yeah man. Three tits. Awesome.

                         GRAHAM
          Thank you.

                         CLIVE
          All we have to do now is sit back
          and enjoy.
          A child approaches.

                         CLIVE
          Queen Jelva welcomes thee.

                         CHILD
          Do you know where Sylar's on?

                         CLIVE
          Main pavillion.

                         CHILD
          Thanks. Hey, three tits. Awesome.

          They are sat in exactly the same position as before. CLIVE
          looks a little downbeat, GRAHAM fidgets with his pens.

                         PUBLICIST
          Okay, that's the hour. How'd we do?

                         CLIVE
          Three copies.

                         PUBLICIST
          Hey, one for each tit. Maybe you
          should have given her four.

                         GRAHAM
          That's sick.

                         PUBLICIST
          Don't sweat it. It's a sleeper.

                         CLIVE
          Yeah, but three copies?

                         PUBLICIST
          Better than Carl Weathers.

                         CLIVE

          YES!

                         GRAHAM
          Would you like a copy?

                         PUBLICIST
          Are you nuts? My office is full of
          junk.
          The PUBLICIST walks away chuckling.

                         CLIVE
          Graham, I need a drink.

          INT. HOTEL. BAR - NIGHT

          GRAHAM and CLIVE are stood against the wall in a bar. GRAHAM
          drinks and elaborate blue cocktail through a straw. CLIVE
          sips from a Jack Daniels and Coke. Everyone else in the bar
          is dressed as a HOBBIT. CLIVE winks at a girl.

          INT. HOTEL. BEDROOM - NIGHT

          GRAHAM and CLIVE's hotel room is filled with bags of stuff
          from the convention, a laptop computer and a games console
          plugged into the TV. GRAHAM lies on his bed. He is looking at
          a map. Other maps are scattered about.

          CLIVE (O.S.)
          It was like the Prancing Pony in
          there.

                         GRAHAM
          Nasty Hobbitses.
          CLIVE emerges from the bathroom. He is naked but for a black
          towel wrapped around his waist. His hair is wet and suddenly
          incredibly long. Around his neck, a large animal tooth hangs
          on a black leather cord.

                         CLIVE
          They think they're so cool.

                         GRAHAM
          Hey, are you excited about going to
          Area 51?

                         CLIVE
          Hell yes.

                         GRAHAM
          06.30 check out?

                         CLIVE
          A-ffirmative.
          GRAHAM and CLIVE both look at their watches.

                         CLIVE
          Three, two, one...

                         GRAHAM CLIVE
          Beep. Beep.

                         CLIVE
          Good night, Graham.

                         GRAHAM
          Good night, Clive.
          They switch off their respective bedside lights. The room is
          plunged into pitch darkness. A few seconds pass.

                         GRAHAM
          Are you asleep?

                         CLIVE
          No.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          8.

                         GRAHAM
          Shall we try and storm the Citadel
          before we nod off?

                         CLIVE
          Couldn't hurt could it?
          We hear some movement then the room is illuminated by the TV.
          The boys lie on their beds holding games controllers.

                         CLIVE
          Cover me.

          INT. HOTEL. RECEPTION - MORNING

          GRAHAM and CLIVE stand at reception. Both look extremely
          sleepy. CLIVE's eyes close. GRAHAM lolls forward onto the
          reception desk. His head hits the bell.

          DING!

          EXT. HOTEL - MORNING

          The boys stand, waiting for their transport. We see them from
          across the road. A tiny old car splutters up to the curb. A
          valet gets out and hands the keys to CLIVE.

                         VALET
          There you go.

                         GRAHAM
          That's not ours.

                         VALET
          No?

                         CLIVE
          No, that's ours.
          A large RV pulls up. A 1985 Holiday Rambler, Imperial. Top of
          the range in its day. Still looks good.

                         VALET
          Oh.
          GRAHAM and CLIVE run off toward the RV. The four BORG from
          the previous day approach the VALET and exchange the key to
          the car for some small change. The BORG drive off.

                         VALET
          Fucking Borg.
          (giving the finger)
          Assimilate this!
          The RV speeds past the disgruntled VALET. GRAHAM and CLIVE
          can be heard whooping within.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          9.

          INT. RV - MORNING

          CLIVE is seated behind the wheel of their RV, he now wears
          black wrap-around shades. In the back of the RV, GRAHAM
          fusses with maps and provisions.

                         GRAHAM
          Breakfast?

                         CLIVE
          Java. Straight up.

                         GRAHAM
          Any solids?

                         CLIVE
          No, let's punch through. Miles make
          the eggs taste sweeter.

                         GRAHAM
          I love eggs!

                         CLIVE
          I hear that. Now, get that "Joe' on
          the go and jump in the Chewie seat.
          I need your map skills.

                         GRAHAM
          Good job I pre-pared.
          GRAHAM flicks on the coffee and jumps into the co-pilot's
          (Chewie) seat.

                         GRAHAM
          It's a shame I don't have some
          controls on this side. That way, I
          could take over if you needed the
          loo.

                         CLIVE
          Yeah, I could say "take the helm."

                         GRAHAM
          "Take the helm, number one."

                         CLIVE
          Yeah, "take the helm, number one, I
          need a number two."
          They laugh heartily. Through this, GRAHAM has been taking out
          his laptop and setting it up on the dash board.

                         GRAHAM
          "Least I've got Cerebro, eh?

                         

                         

                         

                         

          10.

                         CLIVE
          Absolutely. Real-time sat-nav multi
          map and advanced geo-tagging with
          continual info stream?

                         GRAHAM
          Impressive.

                         CLIVE
          Most impressive.

                         GRAHAM
          And let's not forget, we've always
          got Analogue.
          GRAHAM pulls a map down. Obscuring the entire windshield.

                         CLIVE
          Not when we're driving Graham.

                         GRAHAM
          Sorry.
          GRAHAM sends the map back up into the roller. The coffee
          percolator gurgles in the galley.

                         GRAHAM
          Sounds like coffee o'clock.

                         CLIVE
          Thank god. I'm a wreck until I've
          had my first cup of J.
          GRAHAM high fives CLIVE and heads back into the kitchen.

          INT. DINER - DAY

          GRAHAM and CLIVE eat lunch. GRAHAM has finished a plate of
          prawns. He inspects the shells.

                         GRAHAM
          Looks like a pile of dead droids.
          A perky waitress approaches. GRAHAM and CLIVE become shy and
          awkward.

                         WAITRESS
          You boys all set? Can I get you
          anything else?
          GRAHAM spills his drink. CLIVE appears very uneasy.

          INT/EXT. RV - DAY

          They drive in silence, surveying the landscape.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          11.

                         CLIVE
          Amazing, isn't it? There are
          295,734,134 people in this country
          and we haven't seen a soul for a
          hundred miles. Where is everybody?

                         GRAHAM
          What about that old woman on
          crutches we saw hitchhiking?

                         CLIVE
          Apart from her. I suppose that's
          why they established the Dreamland
          facility out here.

                         GRAHAM
          Far from prying eyes.

                         CLIVE
          Did you know the site was selected
          in the mid-1950s for testing of the
          U-2 spyplane, due to its
          remoteness, proximity to existing
          facilities and presence of a dry
          lake bad for landings?

                         GRAHAM
          Yes.

                         CLIVE
          Oh.

                         GRAHAM
          Shall we have a bite before or
          after we hit the Black Mailbox?

                         CLIVE
          Before.

          INT. THE LITTLE A'LE'INN. BAR - EVENING

          GRAHAM and CLIVE tuck into burgers. They are the only
          customers. The interior is replete with various Area 51
          related memorabilia. PAT, (female, 50s) the proprietor,
          speaks to them from behind the counter. She holds up two
          bumper stickers.

                         PAT
          "Watch The Skies" or "Alien
          Onboard?"
          GRAHAM and CLIVE look at each other for a few seconds before
          looking back at PAT.

                         GRAHAM/CLIVE
          "Alien Onboard."

                         

                         

                         

                         

          12.

                         PAT
          Nice choice. So, where have you
          boys come from?

                         GRAHAM

                         (MUMBLY)
          San Diego.

                         PAT
          Comic-Con?

                         CLIVE
          How could you tell?
          We see GRAHAM and CLIVE looking back at PAT. They look like
          the most painfully obvious Comic-Con attendees ever.

                         PAT
          Just a guess. My nephew launched a
          comic down there a couple of years
          ago. Sort of dramatized the
          accounts of some of the folk we've
          had in here.

                         CLIVE
          Encounter Briefs?

                         PAT
          That's it. You heard of it, huh?

                         CLIVE
          I've got all six.

                         PAT
          Well whaddya know? Small world.

                         CLIVE
          Do you get a lot of UFO types round
          here?
          We see PAT looking back at CLIVE, surrounded by UFO and alien
          paraphernalia, a slight smile on her face.

                         PAT
          Some.

                         GRAHAM
          Have you ever seen one?

                         PAT
          A UFO? Oh, I've seen plenty.

                         GRAHAM
          Really?! You've seen more than one
          UFOs?

                         

                         

                         

                         

          13.

                         PAT
          Well, I don't know what they were.
          So as far as I'm concerned they're
          unidentified and they were
          definitely flying.

                         CLIVE
          And objects.

                         PAT
          Damn straight. Whether or not they
          were spaceships, I can't say.
          Probably not, but I'd like to think
          they were. Be a shame if we were
          the only souls in the universe.

                         CLIVE
          Did you now, it's estimated that
          there are as many as 200 billion
          galaxies in the observable universe
          and each of those has approximately
          40 billion starts, around which
          orbit countless planets and moons?

                         PAT
          Yes.

                         CLIVE
          Oh.

                         PAT
          Makes you think though, don't it?

                         CLIVE
          What?

                         PAT
          Where is everybody?
          GRAHAM and CLIVE ponder this.

                         PAT
          You boys all set?

                         CLIVE
          I'd like a cup of coffee please.

                         PAT
          Sure thing. How about you, sugar?

                         GRAHAM
          Can I have an E.T. malt please?

                         PAT
          You wanna sparkler in that?
          GRAHAM smiles coyly.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          14.

                         PAT
          I'll take that as a yes.
          She beams at the boys and disappears into the kitchen. GRAHAM
          and CLIVE are left alone. They take it all in.

                         CLIVE
          It's nice here, isn't it?

                         GRAHAM
          Absolutely.

                         CLIVE
          I think I might use the loo.
          CLIVE walks through a door marked "Maliens'. The adjacent
          toilet door (GUS and JAKE) enter. GRAHAM becomes uneasy.

                         PAT
          Yes dear, what can I get you?

                         JAKE
          Two beers.

                         PAT
          Coming right up.

          INT. THE LITTLE A'LE'INN. TOILET - EVENING

          CLIVE washes his hands. He pumps soap from a dispenser which
          is shaped like an alien's head, the soap squirts out of its
          mouth. CLIVE is quite taken with this.

                         CLIVE
          That is absolutely amazing!

          INT. THE LITTLE A'LE'INN. BAR - EVENING

          CLIVE appears out of the toilet with his hands in the air.

                         CLIVE
          Hey Graham, an alien just sicked up
          into my palms.
          CLIVE doesn't see the two men sat up at the counter. He
          strides over to GRAHAM, full of excitement.

                         CLIVE
          I'm joking, of course. They have a
          soap dispenser, shaped like an
          alien's head. When you pump his
          jaw, soap comes out of his mouth.

                         GRAHAM

                         (MUMBLING)
          Clive...

                         

                         

                         

                         

          15.

                         CLIVE
          It's hilarious.
          GRAHAM flicks his eyes to the counter.

                         CLIVE
          What?
          CLIVE looks over and sees the two men. They are glaring back.
          CLIVE immediately loses his confident air.

          PAT (O.S.)
          Here it comes!
          GRAHAM closes his yes, remembering what he ordered. The two
          men turn to see PAT emerge from the kitchen with a tray of
          drinks. Two bottles of beer, one cup of coffee and an absurd
          looking milkshake in a tall glass with a sparkler.

                         PAT
          Okay then, beers for you gentleman.
          A cup of Joe and a extra thick malt
          with a sparkler for the boys from
          outer space.
          The man snigger derisively. PAT senses the tension.

                         PAT
          So, where you boys headed?

                         JAKE
          We're heading into Utah. Do
          ourselves some hunting.

                         GUS
          Deer, coon, beaver, whatever steps
          in front of the bangstick, right
          Jake?
          They throw a look back at GRAHAM and CLIVE.

                         JAKE
          You got that right, Gus.

                         PAT
          Well now, I heard Utah beaver puts
          up quite a fight.

                         GUS
          That's what we're counting on.
          They nudge each other and laugh.

                         PAT
          I better make you something good
          and hot. Long way to The Beehive.
          PAT give GRAHAM and CLIVE a look. CLIVE understands and
          fumbles for hi wallet.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          16.
          He places a number of bills on the table. They leave. GRAHAM
          comes back in and retrieves the bumper sticker. PAT gives him
          a wink. He leaves.

          INT/EXT. RV - EVENING

          GRAHAM boards the RV. CLIVE is in the driver's seat. The
          engine is running.

                         CLIVE
          What took you so long?

                         GRAHAM
          I was putting the sticker on.

                         CLIVE
          They were an odd pair, weren't
          they?

                         GRAHAM
          Definitely didn't speak Bocci.
          CLIVE fires up the engine and jams it into reverse. CRUNCH.

          GRAHAM (CONT'D)
          That wasn't their truck was it?

                         CLIVE
          No.

          EXT. THE LITTLE A'LE'INN - EVENING

          The RV roars off, leaving the car park and the black Lincoln
          Escalade, shiny, mean, dented.

          INT/EXT. RV - NIGHT

          GRAHAM looks at a map. CLIVE drives, continually checking his
          rear view.

                         GRAHAM
          What's the matter?

                         CLIVE
          Nothing. How we doing?

                         GRAHAM
          We should be just about there.
          They scan the roadside for a few seconds.

                         CLIVE
          I've found it.

                         GRAHAM
          Where?

                         

                         

                         

                         

          17.

                         CLIVE

          THERE!!!

          EXT. THE EXTRA TERRESTRIAL HIGHWAY - NIGHT

          The RV comes to a screeching halt. It sits in the road for a
          moment, before it trundles onto the hard shoulder. The door
          opens, GRAHAM and CLIVE appear wearing head mounted torches.
          They wander over to a WHITE mailbox.

                         GRAHAM/CLIVE

                         (REVERENTIALLY)
          The Black Mailbox.
          GRAHAM and CLIVE marvel at it. The silence of the night and
          the size of the landscape dawns on them. They look up.

                         CLIVE
          It's amazing, isn't it? We're
          actually here.

                         GRAHAM
          Area 51.

                         CLIVE
          Dreamland.

                         GRAHAM
          The Groom Lake Military Test
          Facility.

                         CLIVE
          MacArthur's Black Mile.

                         GRAHAM
          Is that a real one?

                         CLIVE
          No, I made it up myself.

                         GRAHAM
          I like it.

                         CLIVE
          Be great if we saw something.

                         GRAHAM
          Yes, imagine if we got buzzed up by
          a craft.

                         CLIVE
          That would be incredible. It just
          sort of stops in the air and hovers
          then just goes up really fast.
          Whoosh.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          18.

                         GRAHAM
          What would you do if they actually
          landed?

                         CLIVE
          Keep it together. First contact is
          a big responsibility. They come in
          peace, we go to pieces? That's not
          how I roll.
          CLIVE looks at GRAHAM who is staring off, wide eyed.

                         CLIVE
          What's wrong?
          GRAHAM points off into the distance. HEADLIGHTS.

                         GRAHAM
          It's them. They found us. I don't
          know how but they found us.

                         CLIVE
          Who? Who's found us?

                         GRAHAM
          The Libyans!

                         CLIVE
          Run for it Marty!
          GRAHAM and CLIVE scramble for the RV.

          INT. RV - NIGHT

          CLIVE drives, GRAHAM looks nervous. In the dashboard of the
          RV is a rear view monitor. They look at it intently.

                         GRAHAM
          Perhaps it's not them. Perhaps
          whoever it was turned doff.

                         CLIVE
          Of course it's them. We're dead.
          It's like Deliverance. They're
          going to rape us and break our
          arms.

                         GRAHAM
          I don't want my arms broken!

                         CLIVE
          There's only one thing for it.

                         GRAHAM
          What?

                         CLIVE
          I'm gonna have to fly blind.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          19.
          CLIVE kills the headlights. They are plunged into darkness,
          still travelling at 65mph. The headlights come back on.

                         CLIVE
          Probably best not to do that. I
          couldn't really see anything.
          They stare at the monitor. Suddenly, creeping up the rear of
          the RV, headlights. The front of a car becomes visible.

                         CLIVE
          Oh God, oh God, oh God.

                         GRAHAM
          I need the toilet.

                         CLIVE
          Me too.
          The vehicle behind pulls out to overtake.

                         CLIVE
          They're trying to overtake.

                         GRAHAM
          Don't let them get past.

                         CLIVE
          Should I ram them?

                         GRAHAM
          What about the deposit?
          CLIVE gingerly jerks the wheel, causing the RV to swerve. A
          BLACK SEDAN car appears next to them, manoeuvering wildly to
          avoid the RV. GRAHAM and CLIVE stare in horror, their eyes
          widen as the car flips over and tumbles several times,
          bouncing across the asphalt and sliding to a smoking stop on
          its roof. GRAHAM's mouth hangs open. CLIVE blinks.

                         CLIVE
          It wasn't them.
          The RV pulls up to the crashed vehicle and stops. GRAHAM and
          CLIVE peer out of the window.

                         CLIVE
          We should see if they're okay.

                         GRAHAM
          I still need a wee.

                         CLIVE
          I can hold mine.
          GRAHAM goes to the back of the RV and into the toilet. CLIVE
          remains int he driving seat, staring out at the mangled
          Sedan. The toilet flushes and GRAHAM reappears.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          20.

                         GRAHAM
          The bulb's gone in there.

          EXT. THE EXTRA TERRESTRIAL HIGHWAY - NIGHT

          GRAHAM and CLIVE step out of the RV and approach the car.
          Inside are three unconscious men. One door is open.

                         CLIVE
          Hello?
          They wait for a few seconds. Nothing.

                         GRAHAM
          Maybe you should call for help.
          GRAHAM pulls out a cell phone and starts to dial.

          VOICE (O.S.)
          I wouldn't do that if I were you.
          GRAHAM and CLIVE spin round to see an indistinct figure
          sitting on a rock in the nearby darkness. The glow of a
          cigarette briefly lights up what appear to be two large,
          black eyes. GRAHAM and CLIVE gawp.

                         CLIVE
          I rather think these men need help.
          Graham, give me the phone.
          GRAHAM passes the phone over.

                         VOICE
          Seriously, I wouldn't do that.
          GRAHAM's mouth falls open, CLIVE continues to hold the phone
          to his ear. We hear the operator.

                         OPERATOR
          911 Emergency. How may I direct
          your call? Hello? Hello?
          GRAHAM and CLIVE continue to gawp. The shape stand and steps
          into the light. GRAHAM and CLIVE go slack. Standing in front
          of them, clad only in cut-off short and flip-flops... is an

          ALIEN.

                         ALIEN
          Put - the phone - down.
          Without the slightest change of expression CLIVE rocks
          backwards in a dead faint. He hits the ground with a bump.
          GRAHAM looks at CLIVE then back at the ALIEN. When GRAHAM
          speaks his voice quivers with hysterical panic.

                         GRAHAM
          What have you done to him?

                         

                         

                         

                         

          21.

                         ALIEN
          I didn't do anything. He fainted.

                         GRAHAM
          Yes but you made him faint.

                         ALIEN
          I did not. Okay I did, but it's not
          like i set my phaser to "Faint'.

                         GRAHAM
          You've got a phaser!?

                         ALIEN
          No! Look, I need you to help. Can
          you get this guy back onto your
          wagon?

                         GRAHAM
          Are you going to probe us?

                         ALIEN
          No! Where does that come from? Why
          do people always assume we want to
          stick something up their ass?

                         GRAHAM
          Don't you?

                         ALIEN
          No. There's certainly nothing about
          it in the encounter manual. As a
          rule, we don't even abduct. Maybe
          people find it easier to deal with
          earthly transgressions if they
          suppress it with absurd fantasies
          about alien probing.

                         GRAHAM
          What?

                         ALIEN
          It's just a theory. Listen, focus
          okay? I promise you I won't hurt
          you, I just need your help.

                         GRAHAM
          You need my help?

                         ALIEN
          Yes.

                         GRAHAM
          How come I can understand you? Are
          you using some sort of neural
          language router?

                         

                         

                         

                         

          22.

                         ALIEN
          No, I'm speaking English you prick.
          (off GRAHAM's expression)
          Sorry, I'm tense. Look, what's your
          name?

                         GRAHAM
          Graham Willy.

                         ALIEN
          What about him?

                         GRAHAM
          That's the writer, Clive Gollings.

                         ALIEN
          Well, let's get Clive into the RV
          and get going. I'll explain
          everything on the way. Please.

                         GRAHAM
          Where are we going?

                         ALIEN
          North.

                         GRAHAM
          The RV's gotta be back in 2 days.

                         ALIEN
          Well, then we're gonna have to
          hustle, aren't we?

                         GRAHAM

                         BUT-

                         ALIEN
          Look Graham, you're just gonna have
          to trust me, okay?
          GRAHAM looks at the ALIEN. It stands at roughly 3 feet tall.
          His black almond shaped eye glint. His large head tilts to
          one side, his small mouth opens slightly, his long fingers
          clasp together, pleading.

                         ALIEN
          Please man, I need you.
          GRAHAM considers the ALIEN for a moment.

                         GRAHAM
          Okay then.

                         ALIEN
          Great. Thank you.

                         GRAHAM
          What's your name?

                         

                         

                         

                         

          23.

                         ALIEN
          I'm Paul.

                         GRAHAM
          Paul?

                         PAUL
          Yeah. Now let's get Cloverfield
          onto the recreational vehicle and
          get the fuck off MacArthur's Black
          Mile.
          They attempt to move CLIVE. PAUL senses something.

          PAUL (CONT'D)
          Oh man, has he...?

                         GRAHAM
          I told him he should have gone.

                         PAUL
          Could have been worse. Know what
          I'm saying?
          They drag him into the RV. The door shuts, a few seconds
          later, GRAHAM appears and runs round to the back of the RV.
          He rips the bumper sticker off and gets back on board. The RV
          starts up and drives off.

          INT/EXT. RV - NIGHT

          GRAHAM drives, agitated. He looks behind him a couple of
          times. PAUL is hunting around in the fridge.

                         PAUL
          Can I have this ham?

                         GRAHAM
          Uh... yes.

                         PAUL
          Great!
          PAUL starts to dangle strips of sandwich ham into his mouth,
          wolfing it down hungrily.

                         GRAHAM
          Paul? Where am I going again?

                         PAUL
          I told you, North. Do you have a
          map?
          GRAHAM pulls the map. It obscures the wind shield.

                         PAUL
          Not when we're driving, Graham.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          24.
          The map disappears back up into the roller.

                         GRAHAM
          Sorry.

                         PAUL
          Just head North. We need to get as
          much distance as we can between us
          and them.

                         GRAHAM
          Them? Who's them?

          EXT. THE EXTRA TERRESTRIAL HIGHWAY - NIGHT

          We hear the noise of engines, then boots on concrete as a
          dozen soldiers rush the area, attending the crash. A suited
          man gets out of a Sedan car. We don't see his face at first.
          The shot remains at his hip. He reaches into his pocket and
          pulls out a Twinkie. He unwraps it and brings it up to his
          mouth. We follow and see his face for the first time.
          Chiselled, focused, confident. This is SPECIAL AGENT ZOIL. A
          SOLDIER approaches.

                         CAPTAIN
          Sir?

                         ZOIL
          Talk to me.

                         CAPTAIN
          Three survivors, company men, hurt
          but alive.

                         ZOIL
          Anyone else?

                         CAPTAIN
          No sir.
          ZOIL looks into the sky and breathes in the night air.

                         CAPTAIN
          What's this?
          The CAPTAIN motions to a patch of moisture near his feet.
          ZOIL touches the wet patch and licks his finger.

                         CAPTAIN
          What is it sir? Brake fluid? Gas?

                         ZOIL
          No. It's neither of those things.
          He looks around, then notices tire tracks in the dust by the
          side of the road. ZOIL stands, full of purpose. He returns to
          his car and hits a button on the dash.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          25.

                         VOICE
          What's the situation?

                         ZOIL
          We have a guest who's left the
          hotel without paying, sir.

                         VOICE
          Damn it! Do you think he's "left'
          left?

                         ZOIL
          Doubtful. NORAD would have picked
          up a bogie. Those guys can track
          Santa. No sir, he's still here.
          Question is, for how long?

                         VOICE
          Don't you think this is all a bit
          of a coincidence?

                         ZOIL
          How so?

                         VOICE
          I signed the red document this
          morning, Zoil. Don't you think it's
          odd that he chooses today to go
          AWOL? How did he know?

                         ZOIL
          Are you suggesting he has someone
          on the inside.

                         VOICE
          Maybe.

                         ZOIL
          Well he's definitely got someone on
          the outside.

                         VOICE
          What?

                         ZOIL
          Tire tracks, sir. Tire tracks...
          among other things. I'd bet my left
          nut that little bastard's hitched a
          ride.

                         VOICE
          Lock down the area. Road blocks,
          spot checks, the whole nine yards.
          You're going to handle this
          personally, Zoil. I want this
          wrapped up before Letterman.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          26.

          EXT/INT. RV. NIGHT - A FEW HOURS LATER

          Close on the wheel. Pull out to reveal the RV.
          Inside, CLIVE's eyes open. From the bathroom, CLIVE can hear
          the sound of someone noisily emptying their bladder. He
          notices his jeans have been pegged up to dry. He leans out to
          see GRAHAM in the driving seat, then looks back at the
          bathroom door. The toilet flushes.
          CLIVE pretends to be asleep as the door opens. A pair of
          skinny grey legs in cut-off shorts pass the bunk.

                         PAUL
          The bulb's gone in there.
          CLIVE gets up silently and wraps his black towel around his
          middle. He creeps toward the front of the RV. GRAHAM drives,
          PAUL sits in the Chewie seat eating pistachios.

                         PAUL
          I hate it when you get the closed
          ones, right?

                         GRAHAM
          I usually bite them open.

                         PAUL
          Are you fucking insane? You gotta
          tap "em and if they don't open you
          throw them away.

                         GRAHAM
          That's molluscs.

                         PAUL
          Shut up.

                         GRAHAM
          It's true.

                         (NOTICES CLIVE)
          Hello Clive! How are you feeling?

                         CLIVE
          I'm feeling like I've gone MENTAL
          MAD, Graham. If that is your name?
          You're happily sitting there
          chatting to... to... that, like
          it's the most natural thing in the
          world. The two of you laughing away
          like you haven't seen each other
          since 1990.
          PAUL spits a shell out into a cup.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          27.

          CLIVE (CONT'D)
          So forgive me if I seem a little
          rattled but from where I'm standing
          it would appear you are trading nut
          knowledge with an alien life form.

                         GRAHAM
          His name is Paul.

                         CLIVE
          Oh, Paul is it? Paul what? Paul
          Verhoven? Paul Freeman? Paul
          Reiser?

                         PAUL
          Just Paul. You know, like Madonna
          or Dracula.

                         GRAHAM
          Paul's from a small planet in the
          northern spiral arm of the
          Andromeda Galaxy.

                         CLIVE
          No he is not!

                         PAUL
          I am man, seriously.

                         CLIVE
          How could he possibly have
          travelled that distance?

                         PAUL
          Wormhole.

                         CLIVE
          Balls! Graham, this isn't what it
          seems. What about Ocham's Razor?

                         GRAHAM
          The hairdressers?

                         CLIVE
          Yes, the old man who owns it told
          me that, in unbelievable
          circumstances, the most plausible
          explanation is usually the truth.

                         PAUL
          And what's the most plausible
          explanation, Clive?

                         CLIVE
          That you're a thin midget in an
          alien costume.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          28.

                         PAUL
          There's no such thing as a thin
          midget? Those guys are built. Have
          you not seen The Station Agent?

                         GRAHAM
          He's right. I think that's less
          believable than Paul being form a
          planet in the norther spiral arm of
          the Andromeda Galaxy.

          CLIVE (CONT'D)
          Oh really?
          With this CLIVE grabs at PAUL. He pulls at the alien's skin,
          trying to gain a hold of a mask.

                         PAUL
          Ow! Get off me!

                         CLIVE
          You're not real. You're not real!

                         GRAHAM
          Excuse me.

                         PAUL
          Get off me, you fucking psycho!

                         GRAHAM

          EXCUSE ME!
          CLIVE releases PAUL and looks out of the RV to see the
          flashing lights of a road block. GRAHAM slows down.

                         CLIVE
          Oh shit!
          CLIVE looks round to discover that PAUL has vanished. GRAHAM
          pulls the RV onto the hard shoulder.

                         CLIVE
          Where's he gone?

                         GRAHAM
          Maybe he beamed up.

                         CLIVE
          As if. We would have seen the
          classic shimmer and hum.

                         GRAHAM
          Good point.

          BANG, BANG, BANG!
          GRAHAM and CLIVE look to the door. Both terrified.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          29.

          EXT. DESERT ROAD - NIGHT

          GRAHAM and CLIVE stand outside the RV being questioned by an
          AGENT dressed like ZOIL. We can hear noise and activity from
          the RV. Another AGENT is aboard the RV.

                         AGENT 1
          Where you boys from? Australia?

                         CLIVE
          Britain.

                         AGENT 1
          Ah. G'day mate.
          The AGENT smiles. GRAHAM and CLIVE look terrified.

                         AGENT 1
          Whatcha doin' in the US fellas?

                         CLIVE/GRAHAM
          Comic-con.

                         AGENT 1
          You're a long way from San Diego.

                         CLIVE
          We were having a little drive.

                         AGENT 1
          Is that right?

          AGENT 2 (O.S.)
          Hey Haggard?!

                         HAGGARD
          Yeah?
          O'REILLY appears at the door waving a 10x8" photograph.

                         O'REILLY
          These guys have met Michael Biehn.

                         HAGGARD
          No shit! How was he?

                         CLIVE
          He was a good egg.

                         GRAHAM
          Very unaffected.

                         HAGGARD
          That's nice to hear.

                         (TO AGENT 2)
          O'Reilly? Anything else?

                         

                         

                         

                         

          30.

                         O'REILLY
          Just some pissy jeans.
          HAGGARD looks down at the towel wrapped around CLIVE's waits.
          CLIVE look embarrassed.

                         HAGGARD
          Okay, you guys can go.

                         CLIVE
          Thank you. May I ask what you're
          searching for?

                         HAGGARD
          Of course you may.
          There is a slight pause. GRAHAM and CLIVE board the RV.

          INT/EXT. RV - NIGHT

          GRAHAM and CLIVE pull away in silence. They are both confused
          and shaken.

                         CLIVE
          Well, it's pretty obvious what
          happened there, isn't it?

                         GRAHAM
          Is it?

                         CLIVE
          Yes, the government used some sort
          of neurotoxic paint on the Black
          Mailbox, which was white by the
          way, and it caused us to suffer a
          shared hallucination about an
          alien. I mean, it's what we've
          always wanted, isn't it?

                         GRAHAM
          I suppose so.

                         CLIVE
          Than that's what happened.
          PAUL materializes from thin air behind them.

                         PAUL

          WRONG!

          EXT. DESERT ROAD - NIGHT

          The sound of screeching tires draws the attention of the two
          AGENTS. They see the RV swerve across the road in the
          distance before righting itself and continuing on its way.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          31.

          INT. RV - NIGHT


                         CLIVE
          Where the hell did you go?

                         PAUL
          Nowhere.

                         GRAHAM
          What, you went invisible?

                         PAUL
          It's not invisibility per so. It's
          more like what a chameleon does
          with a little light blending thrown
          in for good measure.

                         GRAHAM
          Like Predator?

                         PAUL
          Exactly.

                         GRAHAM
          Can you do it whenever you want?

                         PAUL

                         (PREDATOR VOICE)
          Anytime...

          EXT. ROAD - NIGHT

          We hear GRAHAM squeal with delight. The RV guns up the road
          into the night.

          INT. RV - DAYBREAK

          CLIVE drives in silence. PAUL sits in the passenger seat
          eating nuts. Day is breaking over the horizon. GRAHAM snoozes
          on the sofa. PAUL offers CLIVE a nut.

                         CLIVE
          No thank you.

                         PAUL
          You sure? How about a cup of
          coffee?
          (sees he's tempted)
          Come on Hulk, I'll get you a nice
          cuppa J.
          PAUL goes back to the galley, flicking GRAHAM on the nose as
          he passes. GRAHAM wakes up with a start.

                         PAUL
          Hey, look who's up!

                         

                         

                         

                         

          32.

                         GRAHAM
          Hello Paul.
          GRAHAM approaches CLIVE who ignores him.

                         GRAHAM
          What's the matter?

                         CLIVE
          Graham, there is a Grey in the
          galley, making me coffee.

                         GRAHAM
          Did you want tea?

                         CLIVE
          No, I don't want tea.

                         GRAHAM
          Tea's a bit weird in America, isn't
          it?

                         CLIVE
          No, what's wried, Graham, is that
          we have picked up an extra
          terrestrial hitch hiker and you
          seem completely fine with it!

                         GRAHAM
          He needs our help, Clive.
          PAUL returns with the coffee. GRAHAM and CLIVE curtail their
          conversation. PAUL hand CLIVE his coffee.

                         PAUL CLIVE
          You got it? Yes I've got it.

                         PAUL CLIVE
          It's hot. (slightly testy)
          Thank you.
          GRAHAM looks at Paul and nods toward CLIVE. PAUL sighs and
          sits in the Chewie seat. GRAHAM hangs back...

                         PAUL
          Look Clive, I'm gonna go out on a
          limb and say this is probably the
          weirdest thing that's ever happened
          to you. Am i right?
          CLIVE doesn't deny it.

                         PAUL
          And I appreciate the fact that I
          have somewhat gate-crashed the
          party here but, truth be told, I'm
          in a hell of a pickle. I really
          need your help.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          33.

                         CLIVE
          Why us?

                         PAUL
          Why not?
          CLIVE glances back at an expectant GRAHAM.

                         CLIVE
          What about the RV? It has to be
          back in two days.

                         GRAHAM
          Clive, he's an alien. A living,
          breathing, alien.
          CLIVE look at PAUL who makes a sad face and does the hand
          gesture from Close Encounters. CLIVE wilts.

                         CLIVE
          I suppose we could phone the hire
          company and get an extension.
          PAUL looks super-pleased.

                         CLIVE
          How did you get here?

                         PAUL
          Crashed in "47. Anti-grav failure.

                         GRAHAM
          Happens to the best of us.

                         PAUL
          Also, I'm a shit driver.

                         CLIVE
          Oh my God! Roswell?! That was you?!

                         PAUL
          Roswell was a smoke-screen man,
          designed to distract from the
          truth.

                         CLIVE
          They invented a fake alien crash to
          distract from an actual alien
          crash?

                         PAUL
          I know, fucking stupid, isn't it?

                         CLIVE
          What have you been doing here all
          this time?

                         

                         

                         

                         

          34.

                         PAUL
          Oh you know, kickin' back, shooting
          the shit. Advising the government.

                         GRAHAM
          Not just the government.

          INT. ROOM - DAY


                         CAPTION: 1980
          A room lit by a single bulb, furnished with a table and
          chair. PAUL sits with his back to us, he is smoking a
          cigarette, whilst talking on the phone. We hear the voice on
          the other end of the line. It is strangely familiar.

                         STEVEN SPIELBERG
          ...I want him to have some kind of
          special power, you know? Something
          sort of messianic...

                         PAUL
          How about molecular revivification.

                         STEVEN SPIELBERG
          I don't know what that is.

                         PAUL
          Restoration of damaged tissue
          through telepathic manipulation of
          cellular intrinsic field memory.

                         STEVEN SPIELBERG
          I...uh...

                         PAUL
          Healing, Steven.

                         STEVEN SPIELBERG
          Oh right yeah. Like by touch sort
          of thing? His little finger could
          light up at the end and-

                         PAUL
          You know what? Sometimes, less is
          more.
          The line beeps.

                         STEVEN SPIELBERG
          You got another call?

                         PAUL
          Yeah I gotta take this man. It's
          the fucking V guys again.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          35.

          INT. RV - DAY


                         PAUL
          Right.

                         GRAHAM
          You'd be surprised how much he's
          influenced popular culture
          generally over the last 60 years.

                         CLIVE

                         (TO GRAHAM)
          How come you know so much?

                         GRAHAM
          We had quite a long chat while you
          were unconscious.
          CLIVE looks miffed.

                         GRAHAM
          ...while you were asleep.

                         PAUL
          You want a bagel Clive?

                         CLIVE
          No thanks.

                         PAUL
          Graham?

                         GRAHAM
          Yes please.

                         CLIVE
          Go on then, I'll have half.

          PAUL (O.S.)
          You want anything on it?

                         CLIVE
          Jam.

          PAUL (O.S.)
          What?

                         CLIVE
          Jelly.

                         PAUL
          Gotcha.
          PAUL heads to the kitchen. The boys drive in silence.

                         GRAHAM
          I gave your jeans a swill and hung
          them up.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          36.

                         CLIVE
          Thank you. So, do you know where
          we're going?

                         GRAHAM
          Just North. He said we had to make
          a right at Utah.

                         CLIVE
          Why can't he tell us?

                         GRAHAM
          He said it was a surprise.

                         CLIVE
          Do you trust him, Graham? I mean,
          is he Strider or Black Rider?

                         GRAHAM
          Strider, definitely.

                         CLIVE
          You'd better be right. I don't want
          to wake up and find him inserting a
          probe into my anus.

                         GRAHAM
          It's okay, he doesn't do that.
          PAUL returns with three bagels on one long finger.

                         PAUL
          Bagel time!
          The dashboard beeps. PAUL jumps throwing them into the air.

                         GRAHAM
          Fuel level's critical.

                         PAUL
          Sorry, I had a warning light just
          like that on my ship.

                         GRAHAM
          For fuel?

                         PAUL
          Anti-grav failure.
          CLIVE is looking at the sat-nav on the computer.

                         CLIVE
          There's a place called Ely five
          miles from here. It's small but
          there should be a gas station.

                         GRAHAM
          Roger that, number one.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          37.
          CLIVE smiles at GRAHAM and flashes PAUL a triumphant look.
          PAUL coughs loudly, barely disguising the word "Geeks".

          INT. RV - MORNING

          GRAHAM and CLIVE peer out at the gas station. It appears
          deserted. PAUL has his head in the fridge, he cracks open a
          V8, strolls to the front of the RV and honks the horn. An OLD
          MAN peers out of the gas station window and waves.

                         CLIVE
          Paul, don't do that!

                         PAUL
          Here's what I need. Some organic
          beef mince, organic pork, some
          veal, red onions, pine nuts,
          pecorino cheese, plum tomatoes, a
          fistful of fresh basil and 3 war
          ciabattas.

                         CLIVE
          You know this is a gas station?
          PAUL looks disappointed.

          EXT. GAS STATION - DAY

          The door to the RV opens, CLIVE and GRAHAM step out onto the
          forecourt, trying to look as casual as they can.

                         CLIVE
          Ready?

                         GRAHAM
          Ready.
          HOOOONNNNNKKKK! GRAHAM and CLIVE jump.

          PAUL (O.S.)
          Get me some more peanut M&Ms.
          GRAHAM goes into the store, CLIVE to the pumps. A POLICE
          CRUISER pulls onto the forecourt. CLIVE goes pale and fumbles
          the nozzle back into the pump. He walks toward the checkout
          as a STATE TROOPER exits his car. No matter how hard he
          tries, CLIVE cannot avoid reaching the door at the same time
          as the STATE TROOPER. He is tall, wide and bald.

                         STATE TROOPER
          After you.

                         CLIVE
          Thanks.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          38.

          EXT. DESERT ROAD - MORNING

          Close up on O'REILLY. He covers his face with his hands.

                         O'REILLY
          Coming... ready or not!
          O'REILLY uncovers his eyes and comes face to face with ZOIL.
          ZOIL is eating an orange, he offers a segment to O'REILLY.

                         ZOIL
          Orange?

                         O'REILLY
          No thanks.

                         ZOIL
          Nice and juicy.

                         O'REILLY
          I don't want to spoil breakfast.

                         ZOIL
          Do you mind telling me what's going
          on, Agent?

                         O'REILLY
          Just keeping ourselves occupied
          sir. Things are pretty slow.

                         ZOIL
          Where's the other one?

                         O'REILLY
          I don't know, let's see. Haggard?
          HAGGARD steps out from behind the only man shaped cactus on
          the entire desert plain. O'REILLY can't help but let out a
          snort of delighted surprise. HAGGARD hurries over.

                         HAGGARD
          Sorry, I was just... hiding.

                         ZOIL
          I see. You fellas had much traffic
          through here?

                         HAGGARD
          Just a big RV driven by a couple of
          nerds.

                         ZOIL
          Nerds, huh?

                         HAGGARD
          Yeah, they'd been to Comic-Con and
          met Michael Biehn.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          39.

                         ZOIL
          I've heard he's nice.

                         HAGGARD
          Good egg.

                         O'REILLY
          Very unaffected.

                         ZOIL
          Did you search the vehicle
          thoroughly?

                         O'REILLY
          Yes sir.

                         ZOIL
          Find anything?

                         O'REILLY
          Not really. Just Michael Biehn's
          autograph and some pissy jeans.
          Close in on ZOIL. He seems suddenly motivated.

                         ZOIL
          Did you get the license plate?
          HAGGARD and O'REILLY look sheepish.

                         ZOIL
          Make?
          More sheepishness.

                         HAGGARD
          It was big.

                         ZOIL
          I want everything you can remember.
          Descriptions of the occupants,
          height, hair, distinguishing
          features. We can do it on the way.

                         HAGGARD
          On the way?

                         ZOIL
          You're coming with me.

                         O'REILLY
          What about the road block sir?

                         ZOIL
          It didn't work.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          40.

          INT. GAS STATION - MORNING

          GRAHAM joins CLIVE at the check out, clutching a bag of
          jerky, a bottle of chocolate milk, a burrito, a Coke, some
          mini doughnuts and a massive bag of peanut M&Ms.

                         CLIVE
          Don't you think that's a bit much?
          Put it all back. Except the
          burrito... and the doughnuts... and
          the chocolate milk. Let's just pay
          for it and leave.

                         GRAHAM
          We need bulb for the toilet.

                         CLIVE
          Essential only, Graham!
          They head to the counter. So does the STATE TROOPER.

                         STATE TROOPER
          Morning Chris!

                         CHRIS
          Hey Dean.

                         STATE TROOPER
          Who do you think I had in my office
          this morning?

                         CHRIS
          Jeremy Piven?

                         STATE TROOPER
          No. The Secret Service.
          GRAHAM bumps into a display of sunglasses and just stops it
          tumbling. CHRIS and the STATE TROOPER glance over.

                         CHRIS
          They find out how you can afford a
          Dodge Viper on troopers pay?

                         STATE TROOPER
          Not yet. They're all over this
          crash on the road up to Rachel.

                         CHRIS
          What you think's going on?

                         STATE TROOPER
          Don't know, could be Muslims.

                         CHRIS
          Jesus Cheeerist!
          CLIVE and GRAHAM sidle up to the check-out.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          41.

                         STATE TROOPER
          You go right ahead.

                         CLIVE
          Thank you very much, officer.

                         STATE TROOPER
          Where're you guys from?

                         GRAHAM
          Britain.

                         STATE TROOPER
          Britain, huh? Nice place. No guns!

                         CHRIS
          No guns? Jesus Cheeerist.
          CHRIS take the money and the boys leave. The STATE TROOPER
          and CHRIS watch them go.

          EXT. GAS STATION - MORNING

          The boys hurry across the forecourt past the cop car, we hear
          the radio spring to life as they pass.

                         POLICE CONTROLLER
          All units, be on the lookout for a
          cream and brown Recreational
          Vehicle, no plate number at this
          time. Officers are advised to
          contain but not board. Dean, if you
          still at Gas and Go, bring back a
          quart a milk and a box of doughnut
          holes? Dean?
          GRAHAM and CLIVE stop and stare, listening intently.

          HOOOOOOONNNNNNKKKKK!

          INT. RV - SOMETIME LATER

          PAUL sit on the sofa catching M&Ms in his mouth. GRAHAM
          drives, CLIVE sits in the Chewie seat.

                         CLIVE
          It's find for you. You'll get
          whisked back to whatever lab they
          kept you in and we'll be arrested
          for harbouring a fugitive and sent
          to Guantanamo Bay.
          PAUL laughs.

                         CLIVE
          Why's everything so funny? They
          think we're Muslims.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          42.

                         PAUL
          That's their excuse for everything.
          There are worse things you can be.
          We had a Muslim guy at the base.
          Systems analyst called Yusef. We
          used to do karaoke on Tuesday
          nights. You should'a heard him do
          Matthew and Son. Shame I didn't get
          a chance to say salam alaikum.

                         CLIVE
          Paul, the authorities know we're in
          an TV.

                         PAUL
          We're hardly the only RV on the
          road. Trust me, if we stay off the
          highways, keep to the back routes,
          we'll have a nice uneventful
          journey.
          BANG!!! Something strikes the windshield. Everyone jumps.
          GRAHAM bring the RV to a halt. Silence.

          EXT. DESERT ROAD - DAY

          The door to the RV swings open, CLIVE and GRAHAM step out.
          The desert road is silent. We can see for miles. On the road
          lies a yellow and black bird, it is very dead.

                         PAUL
          Fuck, that made me jump.

                         CLIVE
          Ah yes, the waspish markings of a
          Scott's Oriole. Unmistakable.

                         PAUL
          What a waste.

                         GRAHAM
          Poor thing.

                         CLIVE
          Nothing anyone could've done.
          PAUL looks at them, then scoops the bird up in his hands.

                         GRAHAM
          What are you doing?
          PAUL closes his eyes. His skin ripples with color as he sways
          slightly. The bird's eyes flicker, its head lifts, it opens
          its beak and tweets. GRAHAM and CLIVE are astounded by what
          they are seeing.

                         GRAHAM
          It's a miracle!

                         

                         

                         

                         

          43.
          PAUL stuff the bird in his mouth with a grotesque crunch.

                         PAUL
          I'll miss these.

                         CLIVE
          Why would you do that?

                         PAUL
          I'm not gonna eat a dead bird, am

          I?

          EXT. GAS STATION - DAY

          ZOIL and his men are parked on the forecourt of the gas
          station. ZOIL is talking to the STATE TROOPER and CHRIS.

                         STATE TROOPER
          By the time I got the bulletin,
          they were long gone. Seemed like
          nice fellas to me.

                         CHRIS
          Is it true they was Muslims?

                         STATE TROOPER
          They said they were British.

                         ZOIL
          I think you can be both.

                         CHRIS
          Jesus Cheeeeerist!

                         HAGGARD
          Agent Zoil?

                         ZOIL
          Excuse me gentlemen.
          ZOIL leaves with the two men and returns to his vehicle. The
          voice of ZOIL's superior cuts the air.

                         VOICE
          Report.

                         ZOIL
          We've tracked them down to a gas
          station in Ely.

                         VOICE
          So why am I not witting with my
          feet up, smoking a jay, watching
          Erin Brockovich?

                         ZOIL
          We think he may be travelling in an
          RV with two British men sir.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          44.

                         VOICE
          Goddamnit, I knew we should have
          gone ahead with invasion in "44.
          What are they, MI6?

                         ZOIL
          No, sir. Just a couple of nerds on
          the lamb from Comic-Con.

                         VOICE
          Shit. My sister's kid went to that.
          Little Manga faggot.

                         ZOIL
          I still think this stinks, sir.

                         VOICE
          Like fat man doo-doo. It's too much
          of a coincidence. He sits tight for
          60 years and then suddenly now he
          decides to take off. If he wanted
          to go home so bad, he could've just
          given us the slip when he was
          playing golf with J. Edgar Hoover.

                         ZOIL
          Someone must have told him. We need
          to find the rat.

                         VOICE
          Leave that to me. In the meantime,
          if E.T. is still M.I.A. in the P.M.
          then F.Y.I. I'm tearing someone a
          new A. O.K.?

                         ZOIL
          Yes sir.

          INT. RV - DUSK

          GRAHAM is sat in the Chewie seat, PAUL is reading Jelva,
          Queen Of The Varvak. CLIVE drives.

                         GRAHAM
          What do you think?

                         PAUL
          Ask me when I've finished it.
          CLIDE rubs his yes.

                         GRAHAM
          You tired, Sausage?

                         CLIVE

                         (WHISPERING)
          Don't call me Sausage in front of
          him.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          45.

                         GRAHAM
          Sorry. Are you tired though?

                         CLIVE
          Mummy, I am bushed.

                         GRAHAM
          What do you need?

                         CLIVE
          Best case, I'd like a cold flannel
          on my neck and an honest meal.

                         GRAHAM
          I hear that, Big-Rig. I can still
          call you Big-Rig can't I?

                         CLIVE
          Sure. Just not Sausage. Any luck
          with an RV park? We need somewhere
          off the beaten track, n'est pas?

                         GRAHAM
          Roger that. Cup of Joe?

                         CLIVE
          You read my mind.
          GRAHAM head to the galley, ignoring PAUL, who jumps into the
          Chewie seat and stares at CLIVE.

                         CLIVE
          Can I help you?

                         PAUL
          You want a cigarette?

                         CLIVE
          No, thank you. I don't smoke.
          PAUL lights a cigarette, the smoke wafts into CLIVE's face.

                         PAUL
          Look, I'm sorry okay? About eating
          the bird.
          CLIVE continues to ignore PAUL. GRAHAM arrives with the
          coffee and a Honey Bun cake.

                         GRAHAM
          Honey Bun?

                         CLIVE
          Could you unwrap it for me?

                         GRAHAM
          By your command.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          46.
          GRAHAM unwraps the cake and pops it into CLIVE's gob. PAUL
          watches. GRAHAM disappears to the back of the RV.

                         PAUL
          Let me ask you something. Are you
          to...?

                         CLIVE
          What?

                         PAUL
          You know...
          PAUL does a very weird, very long charade, demonstrating
          various "group' and "one on one' homosexual practices.

                         CLIVE
          No!

                         PAUL
          Okay, that's great. I just
          wondered. I'm cool with it.
          Everyone's "bi' where I'm from.
          It's all about the pleasure thing,
          you know? We've evolved beyond
          paranoid notions of gender
          identity. I mean, procreation is
          only the functional aspect of
          sexual congress right? The human
          race is fairly advanced but most
          males still act like a cornered
          tiger if you imply the like
          "smoking the bone' and let's face
          it they probably do. Look at single
          sex, empirical institutions,
          boarding schools, prisons, pirate
          ships, places where the choice has
          been removed, everyone's banging
          everyone else and there isn't a
          whiff of socio-cultural angst. Get
          out into the real world and guys
          are getting smacked int he chops
          for wearing pink socks. You think
          you're so sophisticated because you
          can distinguish yourself from your
          own reflection but ultimately
          you're part of a deeply neurotic
          species and you'd all be a lot
          better off if you stopped worrying
          and learned to love the bum.

                         CLIVE
          What are you trying to say?

                         PAUL
          Maybe you should start smoking.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          47.

          INT. RV - EVENING

          Later, the RV pulls up to gate at the front of an RV park.
          GRAHAM is now in the Chewie seat, PAUL stands behind,
          steadying himself on the backs of their chairs.

                         CLIVE
          Great find, Graham.

                         GRAHAM
          I sourced a website listing off the
          beaten track, North American RV
          parks.

                         PAUL
          I really lucked out with you nerds,
          didn't I?
          GRAHAM and CLIVE look proud. CLIVE drives the RV over a speed
          hump into the park. PAUL loses his balance and falls over.
          GRAHAM and CLIVE laugh. They pull up to a gate.

                         GRAHAM
          It's awfully quiet.

                         CLIVE
          Just the way we like it.
          PAUL scrambles to his feet, reaches across CLIVE and rest on
          the horn.

          HOOOOOOONNNNK!

                         CLIVE
          Stop doing that!

                         GRAHAM
          Someone's coming.
          PAUL shimmers and disappears. GRAHAM and CLIVE yelp.

                         VOICE
          Hello?

                         CLIVE
          (quietly to Graham)
          We're just a couple of regular guys
          on a tour of the less touristy side
          of the American midwest.

                         GRAHAM
          I don't think she heard you.

                         CLIVE
          I was talking to you.

                         GRAHAM
          Oh, sorry.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          48.

                         VOICE
          Hello?
          GRAHAM opens the door. RUTH BEHE, a young woman in her mid-
          twenties stands outside. She is pretty but has no idea. She
          wears glasses, one eye of which is blacked out. GRAHAM stares
          at her. We hear the slide guitar moment from Olivia Newton
          John's "Hopelessly Devoted To You".

                         RUTH
          Good evening, I'm Ruth Behe.

                         CLIVE
          Hello Ruth. Do you mind if we come
          in?

                         RUTH
          Sure. Park in Bay 9. The charge is
          $50 for the night, plus $10 for
          hook ups an I'll need to hang onto
          an ID too.
          CLIVE disappears, leaving GRAHAM and RUTH alone.

                         GRAHAM
          We're just a couple of regular guys
          on tour of the less touristy side
          of the American midwest.

                         RUTH
          Where you heading next?

                         GRAHAM
          Uh, east... apparently.
          CLIVE returns with his passport. RUTH looks at it.

                         RUTH
          England?

                         CLIVE
          Yes. London.

                         RUTH
          I love London.

                         CLIVE
          Have you been?

                         RUTH
          No. Did you know it was founded by
          the Romans in AD 43 as Londinium?

                         GRAHAM/CLIVE
          Yes.

                         RUTH
          Oh. I'd love to go someday.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          49.

                         GRAHAM
          You should.

                         RUTH
          There's lots a places I wanna go.
          Europe. Asia. The Antipodes. The
          world's a big place. I need one of
          these though.

                         CLIVE
          You don't have a passport?
          RUTH shakes her head forlornly. GRAHAM and CLIVE stare.

          MALE VOICE (O.S.)
          RUTH! RUTH! Get in here! I'm hungry

                         RUTH
          That's my father. I'll come over
          and take your money in the morning.
          Have a pleasant night now, won't
          you?
          RUTH opens the gate to allow CLIVE to drive through. GRAHAM
          watches RUTH intently as they pass.

                         CLIVE
          Doors to manual and cross check.
          Graham? Graham?

                         GRAHAM
          Hmmm?
          PAUL re-materializes next to GRAHAM and CLIVE.

                         PAUL

          BOO!

          EXT. RV PARK - NIGHT

          RUTH is walking back to a static mobile home. From the RV we
          hear GRAHAM and CLIVE yelp. RUTH furrows her brow, turns
          back, and goes inside.

          INT. BEHE RESIDENCE - NIGHT

          RUTH enters a static mobile home and heads for kitchenette.
          From the ad-joining room we hear the sound of someone using a
          police radio scanner. Garbled reports fade in and out. We
          perhaps even hear ZOIL's voice briefly amid the static.

          MOSES BEHE (O.S.)
          What took you so long?

                         RUTH
          I was just talking.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          50.
          RUTH stirs a pot on the stove. She surreptitiously retrieves
          an atlas from a drawer an starts to read.

          MOSES BEHE (O.S.)
          You talk to much.

                         RUTH
          Sorry Papa.

          MOSES BEHE (O.S.)
          How long they staying?

                         RUTH
          Just the night I think

          MOSES BEHE (O.S.)
          Hook ups?

                         RUTH
          Uh-huh.

          MOSES BEHE (O.S.)
          Where they headed?

                         RUTH
          East.

          MOSES BEHE (O.S.)
          Them California plates I saw?

                         RUTH
          Yes, but they're from London.

          MOSES BEHE (O.S.)
          London, Ohio?

                         RUTH
          No, London, England.

          MOSES BEHE (O.S.)
          Where?!

                         RUTH
          England, Papa. It's in North
          Western Europe.
          The atlas is snatched out of RUTH's hands. Behind her stands
          the towering figure of MOSES BEHE. Almost as wide as he is
          tall, his eyes glitter with fury and menace.

                         MOSES BEHE
          Europe? I'll give you Europe,
          missy. Now, get and make my supper.
          MOSES lumbers off with the atlas. RUTH looks dejected.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          51.

          EXT. RV PARK - LATER

          QUICK CUTS as GRAHAM and CLIVE hook up power and water to the
          RV and prepare a small BBQ.

          INT. RV - MOMENTS LATER

          The door to the RV opens, GRAHAM and CLIVE jump in. PAUL
          lowers his book and is blinded by their headlamps.

                         PAUL
          Arrghh, what the fuck?!

                         GRAHAM
          Hungry?

                         PAUL
          I ate already.
          GRAHAM and CLIVE look suddenly sad.

                         PAUL
          Too soon?
          They nod.

                         PAUL
          Hey, I'm sorry. I'd love to break
          bread with you guys. What are we
          having?
          GRAHAM waves a foot long hot dog around.

                         GRAHAM
          Willies!
          PAUL gives CLIVE a "see what I mean?' look.

                         CLIVE
          I'll flame up the BBQ pit. Fire's
          my forte.
          CLIVE sparks up his lighter and waves it around looking
          mysterious. He then turns and jumps down all three steps and
          slams the door of the RV behind him.

          EXT. RV PARK - NIGHT

          CLIVE is squirting lighter fluid over a fire. He flicks his
          tongue out, summoning the flames higher. PAUL materializes
          nearby, making CLIVE jump. He composes himself.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          52.

                         PAUL
          Hello Clive. From the squirting of
          the gas and the flicking of the
          tongue, am I do assume you're a
          Hendrix fan?

                         CLIVE
          I am actually, yes.

                         PAUL
          I met him once.

                         CLIVE
          Really?

                         PAUL
          Yeah. Nice man, really soft, He
          thought I was a hallucination.
          Shame what happened to him.

                         CLIVE
          All the good ones die.

                         PAUL
          Meanwhile Bryan Adams releases
          album seventeen.
          PAUL and CLIVE share a laugh.

                         CLIVE
          So you've been here for 60 years?

                         PAUL
          I know, right? Time flies when
          you're confined to a U.S. military
          installation.

                         CLIVE
          Why did you come to earth?

                         PAUL
          I'm the vanguard of a highly
          aggressive invading force.

                         CLIVE
          What?!

                         PAUL
          I'm fucking with you, man. I was on
          a science mission actually.
          Meteorological reconnaissance. We
          were surveying atmospheric
          conditions on CO2 spiking, M-Class
          planets. My specialist subject is
          tornadoes right? So I'm buzzing
          around the mid-west, looking for
          twisters and all of a sudden my
          A.G.G. goes offline and I crash in
          the middle of some field.

                         (MORE)

                         

                         

                         

                         

          53.

                         PAUL (CONT'D)
          Next thing I know, this little girl
          is pulling me out of the wreck and
          then a bunch of army guys come
          along and cart me off to Area 52.

                         CLIVE

          51.

                         PAUL
          No, it's 52. Area 51 is just full
          of old Pan Am jets and mini disc
          players and shit. It's another
          "clever subterfuge."
          GRAHAM joins them with the food.

                         PAUL
          Just telling him about Area 52.

                         GRAHAM
          Ha ha yeah.

                         PAUL
          So, with my cover blown and the
          natives cautious but friendly, I
          figured we might as well indulge in
          a little file sharing.

                         CLIVE
          Mulder was right!

                         PAUL
          Mulder was my idea.
          They chuckle. CLIVE gives PAUL the bottle of gas.

                         CLIVE
          Would you like a go?
          PAUL takes the bottle and squirts it on the fire, making the
          Hendrix face. They laugh loudly.

          EXT. BEHE RESIDENCE - NIGHT

          RUTH watches through her window. GRAHAM, CLIVE and PAUL are
          on the other side of the RV. Nevertheless, RUTH can see three
          pairs of dancing legs underneath the vehicle, silhouetted
          against the campfire. She frowns.

          MOSES BEHE (O.S.)

          RUTH!
          RUTH backs away into the shadows.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          54.

          INT. RV - MORNING

          It is very early in the morning. PAUL is asleep on the sofa.
          There is a knock at the door. PAUL vanishes. GRAHAM and CLIVE
          emerge from the bedroom in dressing gowns.

                         CLIVE
          Who is it?

          RUTH (O.S.)
          It's Ruth.
          GRAHAM and CLIVE look at each other nervously. CLIVE opens
          the door, as GRAHAM straightens his hair.

                         RUTH
          Good morning.

                         CLIVE
          Good morning.

                         RUTH
          May I come in?

                         GRAHAM
          Yes.
          CLIVE give GRAHAM a "what the hell are you thinking?' Look as
          RUTH comes aboard. RUTH surveys the interior of the RV.

                         RUTH
          Was everything to your liking?

                         CLIVE
          Yes, thank you.

                         RUTH
          Where's the other one?

                         CLIVE
          The other one?

                         RUTH
          It's okay, we don't charge by the
          person. That was three pairs of
          legs I saw last night cavorting
          round the camp fire, right?

                         CLIVE
          Oh the other one. Um...

                         PAUL
          I'm in the can. I ate a closed
          mollusc.
          PAUL blows a massive raspberry to prove his point. GRAHAM and
          CLIVE look embarrassed. GRAHAM changes the subject.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          55.

                         GRAHAM
          I like your shirt.
          The shirt has a picture of Jesus shooting Charles Darwin in
          the head. Underneath it reads, "Evolve this!"

                         RUTH
          Thanks. I got it at my church.

                         GRAHAM
          Why would Jesus want to shoot
          Charles Darwin?

                         RUTH

                         (BRIGHTLY)
          Because of his theories. Are you
          men of God?

                         GRAHAM
          Would you like a coffee?

                         CLIVE
          I suppose we're men of science.

                         GRAHAM

                         CLIVE-
          RUTH narrow her eye.

                         CLIVE
          If we believe in anything it would
          be macro evolution. Cause and
          effect. The establishment of a
          biological order from the maelstrom
          of physical and chemical chaos.
          RUTH looks scandalized.

                         GRAHAM
          Or it could be God. You just don't
          know do you?

                         RUTH
          God created the earth in six days
          and on the seventh he rested.
          PAUL emits another huge raspberry from the toilet.

                         CLIVE
          Did you know that the universe has
          been dated as being 13.5 billion
          years old an that the release of
          neutral hydrogen at the moment of
          the big bang has enabled scientists
          to do this with categorical
          accuracy?

                         GRAHAM
          Yes.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          56.

                         CLIVE
          Not you!

                         RUTH
          The world is 4000 years old.

          PAUL (O.S.)
          Oh come on!

                         GRAHAM

                         PAUL-

          PAUL (O.S.)
          Horseshit!
          RUTH approaches the toilet door, taking up her fight with the
          unseen third passenger. She bangs on the door. GRAHAM and
          CLIVE are bewildered by this sudden turn of events.

                         RUTH
          Explain to me how something as
          complicated as the human eye simply
          comes into being.

          PAUL (O.S.)
          Oh, don't give me that old
          irreducible complexity crap-

                         RUTH
          They eye is comprised of three
          interacting parts. Remove any one
          of them and it ceases to exist. It
          has the precision and delicacy of a
          pocket watch and, when the good
          Lord permits, it works in perfect
          harmony with its environment.
          Something as functionally perfect
          as that doesn't just occur without
          the intervention of a guiding hand.

          PAUL (O.S.)
          But it didn't just occur did it? It
          is the culmination of millions of
          years of development across
          countless species.

                         RUTH
          What are you talking about?

          PAUL (O.S.)
          Evolution baby.
          RUTH screams and bangs the door.

                         RUTH
          It'd design!

                         

                         

                         

                         

          57.

          PAUL (O.S.)
          If He designed it, why didn't He
          just make it one part and take the
          whole weekend off?

                         RUTH
          Nothing you can so or do can shake
          my belief, or faith in the sure and
          certain knowledge that God made
          Heaven and earth and created us all
          in His own image.

                         PAUL
          Oh yeah?
          (stepping out of the toilet)
          Well then how do you explain me?
          RUTH's mouth hangs agape in a soundless scream, her eye rolls
          up, her hair turns white. She collapses.

                         PAUL
          And that's Jenga.

                         CLIVE
          What did you do that for?

                         PAUL
          I didn't do anything, she fainted.

                         CLIVE
          She saw you!

                         PAUL
          Oh come on. Who's gonna believe
          anything she says?

                         CLIVE
          The authorities will be on the look
          out for exactly this sort of thing.

                         PAUL
          What, a delusional, one-eyed God
          botherer?

                         CLIVE
          Paul, right now they're going to
          follow any lead they can get.

                         PAUL
          I didn't think of that.

                         GRAHAM
          We could take her with us.

                         PAUL/CLIVE
          What?

                         

                         

                         

                         

          58.

                         GRAHAM
          We're only going to be a couple of
          days. We could let her go once
          Paul's gone home. I'm sure she'll
          be fine once she gets to know us.
          PAUL and CLIVE consider this.

                         CLIVE
          How am I going to get my passport
          back?
          PAUL vanishes.

          PAUL (O.S.)
          Leave it to me.

          INT. BEHE RESIDENCE - DAY

          The door opens, seemingly by itself. PAUL materializes in the
          kitchenette and starts looking around for CLIVE's passport.
          He roots around noisily in drawers and cupboards, until he
          spies his quarry on the work-top. He checks the passport and
          finds CLIVE's absurd picture. He laughs.

                         PAUL
          Hallelujah.

          MOSES BEHE (O.S.)
          Ruth, what in the Lord's name-
          MOSES and PAUL come face to face. They regard each other for
          a second.

                         PAUL
          Boo?

          EXT. RV PARK - DAY

          PAUL burst out of the BEHE RESIDENCE, pursued by MOSES who is
          loading a shotgun.

                         PAUL

          GO! GO! GO!
          The RV start to move forward. The door swings open and GRAHAM
          appears, beckoning to PAUL. PAUL reaches the door, just as
          MOSES levels the gun at his target. PAUL leaps into GRAHAM's
          arms, disappearing inside the RV, as MOSES fires off a
          booming shot. The BEHE mailbox explodes into pieces, as the
          RV careens off out of the trailer park.

          INT. RV - DAY

          Blackness. RUTH wakes up. Panic in her eyes. CLIVE drives,
          GRAHAM sits on the sofa, biting his nails.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          59.

                         GRAHAM
          Hi.

                         RUTH
          Where am I?
          PAUL leans round from the Chewie seat and smile.

                         PAUL
          Hey, look who's up.

                         RUTH

          DEMON!

                         GRAHAM
          Would you like a cup of tea?
          RUTH starts to pray furiously.

                         GRAHAM
          I'm so sorry it had to be this way
          Ruth. We're definitely not going to
          hurt you and we'll let you go as
          son as we can. We were just a
          little concerned that you might
          call the police.

                         RUTH
          You have been deceived. Deceived by
          an agent of Satan himself.

          PAUL (O.S.)
          You know I'm sitting right here?

                         GRAHAM
          He's not a demon Ruth, he's from
          another world and we're helping him
          get home. He's not evil. He's just
          very rude.

                         RUTH
          How can he be from another world?
          There is only one world. Our world,
          created by God the Father.
          PAUL sits down next to GRAHAM. RUTH whimpers.

                         PAUL
          Look, if it makes you feel any
          better, my existence only disproves
          the notion of the Abrahamic, Judeo-
          Christian God, as well as all
          single earth theologies. Science
          still hasn't categorically rule out
          the notion of divinity, even though
          evolutionary biology suggest the
          non-existence of a creator by
          probability alone.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          60.

                         RUTH
          How could that possibly make me
          feel any better?

                         PAUL
          Jesus Christ, I was just trying to
          be nice!

                         GRAHAM
          I think what Paul's trying to say
          is, just because there are other
          inhabited planets, it's not the end
          of the world.

                         RUTH
          This isn't happening! You're a
          hallucination. You're not real.
          You're a test. A test from God.

                         PAUL
          You can't win can you?
          RUTH starts to pray furiously, speaking in tongues, making an
          awful noise.

                         CLIVE
          I can't drive like this. We'll have
          to drop her off and take our
          chances.

                         GRAHAM
          No!

                         PAUL
          Oh, for God's sake.
          PAUL walks over to RUTH and places his and across her
          forehead. He appear to go into a trance. RUTH's eyes roll up
          into her head. We see a lightening montage of images. The
          cosmos, the surface of a planet, others like PAUL, PAUL's
          ship crashing into the ground. The images speed up as PAUL
          telepathically send his knowledge into RUTH's mind. They
          collapse in a heap on the floor. PAUL sparks up a cigarette.

                         GRAHAM
          What did you do to her?!

                         PAUL
          I broadened her horizons.

                         GRAHAM
          Can you broaden mine?

                         PAUL
          No, it's tiring.
          GRAHAM goes over to where PAUL is lying.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          61.

                         GRAHAM
          Oh please.

                         PAUL
          Come here then.
          PAUL puts his hand on GRAHAM's head. GRAHAM's eyes go all
          fluttery. We don't see the images this time. GRAHAM falls.

                         CLIVE
          Oh great! Everyone knows the
          secrets of the universe apart from
          me. He always knew what was going
          on in Buffy before me because his
          mum had cable.

                         PAUL
          Can't I just tell you?

                         CLIVE
          No spoilers!
          PAUL sighs, then with enormous effort, reaches up and zaps
          CLIVE who falls to the floor. Everyone lays inert.

                         GRAHAM

                         (WEAKLY)
          Maybe I should make that tea?

          EXT. RV PARK - DAY

          THREE BLACK SEDANS are parked in the BEHE RV park.

          MOSES BEHE (O.S.)
          I didn't call the government. I
          called the po-lice.

          INT. BEHE RESIDENCE - DAY


                         ZOIL
          Given your description of the
          intruder, the police felt your call
          was perhaps better directed to us.

                         MOSES BEHE
          And who are you?

                         ZOIL
          Secret Service, sir.

                         MOSES BEHE
          I knew it. You know that devil took
          my Ruth.

                         ZOIL
          And Ruth's your daughter?

                         

                         

                         

                         

          62.

                         MOSES BEHE
          That's right. Her Mama died when
          she was born. I good as brought her
          up by myself. Wasn't easy either.
          Two mouths to feed and this place
          to run.

                         ZOIL
          I understand. Do you have a
          photography of Ruth, Mr. Behe?
          MOSES retrieves an old cigar box and produces a tattered
          photograph of Ruth. She appears younger, with both eyes
          intact and with dark hair.

                         ZOIL
          She's pretty.
          MOSES snorts.

                         ZOIL
          Do you have a phone Mr. Behe? In
          case she tries to contact you.

                         MOSES BEHE
          I do...
          ZOIL nods at HAGGARD who immediately starts dialling on his
          satellite phone, moving into a different room.

                         MOSES BEHE
          ...and she'll call me if she can.
          Ruth's never really been outta
          Carbon County.

                         ZOIL
          You say they went East?

                         MOSES BEHE
          Uh-huh. They'll have to get off the
          191 after Flaming Gorge if they
          ain't using the interstate, there's
          been a rig spill just South of
          Dutch John.

                         ZOIL
          So?

                         MOSES BEHE
          So that means they'll be on the 44.
          Only way to go.
          ZOIL looks at O'REILLY.

                         ZOIL
          Let's go. Haggard!

                         

                         

                         

                         

          63.

                         MOSES BEHE
          Tell me you're gonna kill that
          thing, Mr. Zoil. Kill it for what
          it is.

                         ZOIL
          We'll do our best, Mr. Behe.

                         MOSES BEHE
          Watch yourself now. I seen its
          eyes. It's evil.
          ZOIL, HAGGARD and O'REILLY leave. MOSES watches them.

                         MOSES BEHE
          God's speed, Mr. Zoil.

          EXT. RV PARK - DAY

          ZOIL's radio crackles to life.

          HAGGARD (O.S.)
          Man, that way was one fat freak!

          O'REILLY (O.S.)
          If I was that girl, I think I'd
          rather take my chances with the
          alien.
          HAGGARD and O'REILLY hoot with laughter.

                         ZOIL
          Can it, you two! How many times do
          I have to tell you?

          INT. BEHE RESIDENCE - DAY

          MOSES is sat at his kitchen table listening to his police
          scanner. HAGGARD and O'REILLY's laughter rattles loudly over
          the radio.

          ZOIL (O.S.)
          We do not refer to the target as
          "The Alien'.
          MOSES's expression is mixture of fury and disbelief. He
          glances at something nearby. Pull focus to the shotgun, lying
          in the foreground on the kitchen table.
          We hear an engine splutter into life, revving furiously.

          EXT. BEHE RESIDENCE - DAY

          MOSES in his pick up truck, screams off in pursuit.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          64.

          INT. RV - DAY

          CLOSE on PAUL. He is staring at something in wonder.

                         PAUL
          Wow.
          Pull out to reveal him sitting next to GRAHAM and CLIVE,
          looking out through the RV's windshield.
          We see their POV. A breathtaking panorama of natural beauty.
          They are parked up at the summit of a mountain road, looking
          out across the vista.

                         PAUL
          There it is, boys. Wyoming.

                         CLIVE
          Is that where we're going?

                         PAUL
          Maybe. I gotta tell ya. It's at
          times like these you winder if the
          intelligent design crowd aren't
          onto something. I mean look at it.
          Hey Ruth, get up here.
          They look round, the door of the RV is open, RUTH is gone.

                         PAUL
          Ruth!?

                         CLIVE
          Someone should go after her.
          Graham?
          CLIVE looks round to see GRAHAM gone.

                         CLIVE
          Graham!?

          EXT. HIGHWAY - DAY

          RUTH is storming up the road.

                         GRAHAM
          Ruth!

                         RUTH
          Leave me alone!

                         GRAHAM
          Ruth, please stop, I've got shin
          splints.
          RUTH stops. GRAHAM catches up to her.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          65.

                         GRAHAM
          Are you alright?

                         RUTH
          He can't be from space. It's not
          possible.

                         GRAHAM
          Ruth, you saw for yourself. It's
          not just possible, it's probably.
          There's probably millions of
          intelligent civilizations.

                         RUTH
          So, where is everybody?

                         GRAHAM
          Well, one of them is right there.
          RUTH and GRAHAM look back at the RV. PAUL is stood on the
          dashboard with his bare buttocks pressed against the window.
          CLIVE is trying not to laugh.

                         RUTH
          Everything I've ever been told is a
          lie. My purpose. My truth. All
          false. DO you know how that feels?
          To suddenly have nothing?

                         GRAHAM
          Just because your truth wasn't the
          truth, it doesn't mean there is no
          truth, Ruth.

                         RUTH
          Huh?

                         GRAHAM
          I understand you're probably
          feeling very confused right now.
          Religious belief systems are
          devised to give us context and
          security. To stop us feeling lonely
          and unimportant.

                         RUTH
          I do feel lonely and unimportant!
          How can this all be an accident? It
          doesn't make sense. Did you know
          the reason we have solar eclipses
          is because the sun is exactly 400
          times bigger than the moon and the
          moon is exactly 400 times closer to
          the earth?
          GRAHAM considers saying "yes' but decides against it.

                         RUTH
          How can that be an accident.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          66.

                         GRAHAM
          It isn't, it's a coincidence. Or it
          probably is. That's the beauty of
          the universe.

                         RUTH
          But what's the point? If there's
          nothing afterwards, what's the
          point in living?

                         GRAHAM
          This is the point, Ruth. Right now.
          This conversation. That tree, your
          next cheeseburger. Life is a
          miracle. People spend so much time
          focusing on rescuing the princess,
          they forget how much fun it is to
          fight the dragon.

                         RUTH
          Huh?

                         GRAHAM
          Carl Sagan said "A religion, old or
          new, that stressed the magnificence
          of the universe as revealed by
          modern science might be able to
          draw forth reserves of reverence
          and awe hardly tapped by the
          conventional faiths.'

                         RUTH
          Huh?

                         GRAHAM
          It's okay not to know, Ruth. It's
          wonderful because it means we still
          have things to learn. We still have
          life to live.

                         RUTH
          I'm frightened.

                         GRAHAM
          So am I, but it passes, sort of.
          Ruth, we're on an amazing adventure
          and I think you should come with
          us. I know you feel confused and
          lost but if you get back on board
          that RV, you might just find the
          very thing you're looking for.

                         RUTH
          I... I'm not sure.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          67.

                         GRAHAM
          I'm sure Ruth. I'm sure because I
          can honestly say, I have never
          talked to a woman for this long
          without blushing.

                         RUTH
          That's so sweet.
          GRAHAM blushes, deep, dark, red.

          INT. RV - DAY

          GRAHAM and RUTH get back onto the RV. GRAHAM looks pleased
          with himself.

                         GRAHAM
          She's going to be fine. I think
          your hair looks good by the way.
          You look like Storm.

                         RUTH
          Who's Storm?

                         PAUL
          From X-Men.

                         GRAHAM
          Exactly.
          RUTH goes to the bathroom.

          RUTH (O.S.)

          AAARRRRGGGHHHHH! MY FREAKIN' HAIR!

          EXT/INT. RV - DAY

          The RV drives across the rugged countryside. GRAHAM, CLIVE,
          RUTH and PAUL appear in various combinations.
          GRAHAM drives with PAUL in the Chewie seat, CLIVE sleeps on
          the sofa, RUTH can be seen sitting on the bed at the back.
          CLIVE drives with GRAHAM in the Chewie seat. PAUL just
          behind, RUTH on the sofa. She is staring at PAUL. PAUL turns
          round, she looks away.
          PAUL drives, CLIVE sits in the Chewie seat, GRAHAM and RUTH
          just behind. The RV weaves from side to side.

                         CLIVE
          Small corrections! Small
          corrections!
          RUTH drives. Everyone else is asleep.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          68.

          EXT/INT. ZOIL'S CAR/HAGGARD'S CAR/O'REILLY'S CAR - DAY

          We see ZOIL's convoy. ZOIL drives, his eyes intent on the
          road, searching. He reaches down out of shot, then brings a
          taco to hi mouth and takes a bit. A truck passes. We see
          HAGGARD in his car, talking animatedly on his cell phone. The
          truck passes. We see O'REILLY in his car, he is asleep at the
          wheel. The truck passes, horn blaring. O'REILLY wakes up
          suddenly, looking rattled.

          EXT. DESERT HIGHWAY - DAY

          The RV is parked up. It is a little speck on an enormous
          landscape. Next to the highway is a sign which reads "YOU ARE
          NOW LEAVING UTAH.' Underneath this a separate sign reads

          "LEAVING PACIFIC TIME ZONE ENTERING MOUNTAIN TIME ZONE.' PAUL
          leaps back and forth over the line.

                         PAUL
          11 o'clock, 12 o'clock, 11 o'clock,
          12 o'clock, 11 o'clock. Come on!
          It's fun.
          We see CLIVE, GRAHAM and RUTH standing in the middle of the
          road watching PAUL.

                         RUTH
          This is the furthest I've ever
          been.

          EXT. HIGHWAY - DAY

          ZOIL's convoy pulls into an Arby's. The three AGENTS leap out
          of their cars and run in. After a short pause MOSES BEHE's
          pick up truck passes through shout; "Onward Christian
          Soldiers' blares from the radio.

          INT. RV - NIGHT

          GRAHAM drives, CLIVE sits in the Chewie seat. PAUL hangs
          back. RUTH emerges from the bedroom. She has swapped her
          Darwin T-shirt for one of GRAHAM's. It's an X-files T-shirt
          emblazoned with a UFO and the legend, I WANT TO BELIEVE.

                         RUTH
          You don't mind, do you, Graham?

                         GRAHAM
          It looks nice.

                         PAUL
          Hey, we should stop for something
          to eat. Are you hungry, Ruth?

                         

                         

                         

                         

          69.

                         RUTH
          What?

                         CLIVE
          I'm hungry.

                         PAUL
          What's new, fatty?

                         CLIVE
          Hey, it's not fat, it's power. I
          happen to be very strong.
          PAUL summons a phlegm ball with a grotesque snort and spits
          it onto the floor of the RV.

                         PAUL
          Pick that up then.

                         CLIVE
          So childish.

                         RUTH
          Maybe I should call Papa.

          PAUL/GRAHAM/CLIVE
          What?!

                         RUTH
          Look, I've been missing for a whole
          day. If he's called the police,
          they'll be looking for us and if
          they find us, this "amazing
          adventure' is going to come to an
          end real quick. I just need to tell
          him I'm fine and that I'll be back
          soon, okay?
          PAUL offers up a high five to RUTH.

                         PAUL
          Right up top!
          RUTH yelps, terrified that PAUL is going to zap her again.

                         PAUL
          Too soon?
          CLIVE reaches down and picks up PAUL's phlegm ball.

                         CLIVE
          I did it!

          EXT. BAR. PARKING LOT - NIGHT

          GRAHAM, CLIVE and RUTH step out of the RV.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          70.

                         CLIVE
          Okay, in and out, yes? Don't talk
          to anyone unless you have to and
          try to look inconspicuous.
          Angle on the most conspicuous threesome in America.

          HOOOOOOOONNNK.

                         CLIVE
          I wish he'd stop doing that!
          They enter the bar. Parked nearby, is a black Lincoln
          Escalade, shiny, mean, dented.

          INT. BAR - NIGHT

          The bar is very busy. Scantily clad waitresses serve a
          variety of customers. People play pool, other people dance to
          a small band. RUTH spies a pay phone at the back.

                         RUTH
          I won't be long.

                         CLIVE
          We'll order food and wait for you
          at the bar.

                         RUTH
          Okay.

                         CLIVE
          Be careful.
          RUTH walks through to the back, past the toilets. As she
          passes, MOSES BEHE steps out of the Men's, they miss each
          other by moments. He walks up to the bar, next to GRAHAM and
          CLIVE who are looking at a menu. MOSES orders.

                         MOSES BEHE
          Tap water.

          INT. BAR. PAY PHONE - MOMENTS LATER

          RUTH dials. She listens nervously. Click.

          OPERATOR (O.S.)
          Ruth Behe?

                         RUTH
          Yes?

          OPERATOR (O.S.)
          Please hold, your call is being
          diverted.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          71.

                         RUTH
          Wait, I...

          ZOIL (O.S.)
          Ruth Behe?

                         RUTH
          Yes?

          ZOIL (O.S.)
          Agent Zoil, Secret Service. Listen
          very carefully. You're in great
          danger.

                         RUTH
          How did you...?

          ZOIL (O.S.)
          We know who you're travelling with
          Ruth. I need you and your friend to
          turn yourselves in.

                         RUTH
          What if we don't want to turn
          ourselves in?

          INT. HIGHWAY. ROADSIDE - NIGHT

          ZOIL talks on a satellite phone. HAGGARD works on a laptop
          nearby. O'REILLY listens in.

                         ZOIL
          Where are you? Where are you
          headed?

          RUTH (O.S.)
          I don't know.

                         ZOIL
          Look, I know you think you're doing
          the right thing but I promise you,
          I'm only thinking about you. And
          Paul. You care about Paul, don't
          you?

          RUTH (O.S.)
          I don't know how I feel about him.
          He's weird and also, rude.

                         ZOIL
          Yes he is.

          RUTH (O.S.)
          I asked him why he wore shorts and
          he said if he didn't I'd see his
          big spaceman balls.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          72.

          INT. BAR. PAY PHONE - NIGHT

          Loud giggles, followed by angry shushing from ZOIL.

                         RUTH
          Who's there with you?

          ZOIL (O.S.)
          Ruth, please listen to me. Your
          father is worried about you. We
          want to get you home. I need you to
          tell me where you are.

                         RUTH
          He showed me things.

                         ZOIL
          You're not still talking about his
          balls, are you?

                         RUTH
          I... i just want to know what's
          real. I'm confused. I... I...
          RUTH struggles. Her expression shows great conflict.

          HAGGARD (O.S.)

          WE GOT HER!

          ZOIL (O.S.)
          Damnit, Haggard!
          RUTH panics and slams down the phone. She realizes what she
          may have done and rushes back toward the bar, slamming into
          two men. The MEATHEADS, drunk, look down at her, amused.

                         JAKE
          Hey, slow down there cyclops.

                         RUTH
          I need to get to my friends.

                         GUS
          Why the hurry? You know I got a
          friend with one eye who'd love to
          meet you.

                         RUTH
          I happen to have two eyes actually.
          I just have a severe stigmatism.

                         JAKE
          You should get that fixed up.
          Reckon you'd be kinda pretty in the
          right light.

                         GUS
          Yeah, the dark.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          73.

                         RUTH
          Papa said the Lord would fix it.

                         GUS
          The Lord ain't gonna fix nothing
          sweetheart.

                         RUTH
          No shit.
          RUTH plants her knee firmly into the groin of GUS. He doubles
          up knocking his friend over. RUTH bolts.

          INT. BAR - MOMENTS LATER

          GRAHAM and CLIVE are clutching brown paper bags full of food,
          RUTH returns from the Phone.

                         GRAHAM
          How's your dad?

                         RUTH
          We need to leave now.

                         CLIVE
          We're still waiting on a wet fries.
          The two MEATHEADS emerge from the pay phone. Angry.

                         JAKE
          Holy shit! It's the space faggots
          that dinged the fuck-mobile!

                         CLIVE
          Look, I'm terribly sorry. Perhaps
          we can exchange insurance details?

                         JAKE
          I'm sorry I don't speak "nerd'.
          GRAHAM and CLIVE look terribly offended.

                         GUS
          These the "friends' you told us
          about, baby?

                         RUTH
          Yes, they are.

                         JAKE
          Well whaddya know? Small world.

                         RUTH
          We were just leaving.

                         GUS
          I don't think so.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          74.
          JAKE grabs RUTH. GRAHAM pushes him hard in the chest.

                         GRAHAM
          Leave her alone!

                         JAKE
          What did you say?

                         CLIVE
          (timid but resolute)
          He said, leave her alone.
          At this, JAKE pulls his fist back to hit CLIVE, knocking a
          tray of drinks all over a table full of men. They immediately
          spring up and lunge after the MEATHEADS who turn their
          attention to the attack. The fight spreads like fire. GRAHAM
          grabs RUTH's hand and follows CLIVE as he scrambles through
          the fracas. As they reach the door RUTH is yanked back and
          comes face to face with her father.

                         MOSES BEHE

          RUTH?!

                         RUTH

          PAPA?!

                         CLIVE
          Graham?

                         MOSES BEHE
          I'm taking you home.

                         RUTH
          I... I can't.

                         MOSES BEHE
          Don't talk back to me, girl!

                         RUTH

                         PAPA I-
          A chair smashes across MOSES's head, knocking him out. Behind
          him, bloodied and angry are the two MEATHEADS.

          EXT. BAR. PARKING LOT - NIGHT

          CLIVE, GRAHAM and RUTH explode out of the bar and run toward
          the RV. The MEATHEADS crash out after them.

                         RUTH
          What about Papa?!

                         JAKE
          Hey, we ain't finished with you.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          75.

                         CLIVE
          Graham, take Ruth into the RV and
          lock the door. I don't want either
          of you to see this.
          CLIVE turns back to the MEATHEADS. BANG! CLIVE is struck in
          the face, he falls, nose bleeding.
          They turn to RUTH and GRAHAM, who back up against the RV. The
          MEATHEADS approach ominously. The RV door bursts open. PAUL
          stands silhouetted against the interior lights.

                         PAUL
          Yo fucknuts!
          The MEATHEADS freeze. PAUL vanishes, then reappears a few
          feet from them, their eyes bulge.

                         PAUL
          So, who wants to get probed first?
          The MEATHEADS swoon and simultaneously hit the deck.

                         GRAHAM
          Ha! Only one of us fainted!

                         PAUL
          Tell me you got the food?
          CLIVE gets up and opens his coat revealing bags of food.
          Sirens wail in distance. RUTH turns white.

                         RUTH
          It's them.

                         GRAHAM
          Who?

                         RUTH
          It wasn't my fault. They answered
          the phone. He knew all about us.

                         CLIVE
          Who? Who are you talking about?

                         PAUL
          Get in the RV!
          SMASH CUT. The RV roars to life, backing up at speed into the
          MEATHEAD's vehicle. MOSES BEHE bursts out of the bar, just as
          the RV passes. RUTH sees him out of the window. MOSES locks
          eye with his daughter. He runs to his pick up but realises he
          doesn't have his keys. The RV tears off into the night,
          leaving MOSES BEHE bellowing with anger and the Lincoln
          Escalade, shiny, mean, fucked.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          76.

          INT. RV - NIGHT

          The RV pulls off the road into a secluded lay-by. The gang
          sit in silence for a while.

                         GRAHAM
          Was that your dad, Ruth?
          RUTH nods.

                         CLIVE
          He was so angry.

                         RUTH
          He's always angry.
          GRAHAM, CLIVE and PAUL all exchange looks.

                         GRAHAM
          Are you alright, Ruth?
          RUTH nods, still distant.

                         PAUL
          I'm feeling pretty amped up. Anyone
          wanna take a walk?

                         CLIVE
          I'm game.

                         GRAHAM
          You want to come for a walk, Ruth?

                         RUTH
          Thanks, but I think I'm going to
          turn in. It's been a long day what
          with meeting you guys, being
          abducted by and alien and having my
          whole belief system called into
          question.

                         PAUL
          Sorry about that.

                         GRAHAM
          It was amazing though, wasn't it?
          Remember when Paul said "Yo
          fucknuts'? That was brilliant.

                         PAUL
          You gotta talk the talk, right?

                         CLIVE
          What about when I got smacked in
          the nose?

                         

                         

                         

                         

          77.

                         PAUL
          Yeah yeah Snorlax, you're a real
          hero. Come on. Let's skedaddle. You
          want anything Ruth?

                         RUTH
          No, you go, I'll be fine. Here
          Clive.
          RUTH hands CLIVE her handkerchief. It is embroidered with the
          words "JESUS SAVES'.

                         CLIVE
          Thank you.
          He mops his nose as they leave the RV. GRAHAM lingers.

                         GRAHAM
          You can sleep in my bunk if you'd
          like.
          She smiles at him. He goes to leave but turns back.

                         GRAHAM
          I'd use a pen to push the tissues
          off the bed. I've had a cold.

          EXT. DESERTED TOWN - NIGHT

          GRAHAM and PAUL stand outside a liquor store on the main drag
          of a quiet town. Next door is a Western themed clothing
          store. PAUL looks in the window.

                         PAUL
          Hey Graham. Check this out. What
          d'ya think?
          PAUL indicates to a small cowboy outfit, big enough for a
          child, displayed in the window.

                         PAUL
          I'd look pretty hot, right?

                         GRAHAM
          Space cowboy.

                         PAUL
          Steve Miller Band. I love that
          song. Speaking of midnight tokers,
          I got a littler herbal refreshment
          in my pants. Do you guys partake?

                         GRAHAM
          No.

                         PAUL
          Shame. I get it from the military.
          This is the shit that killed Dylan.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          78.

                         GRAHAM
          Bob Dylan's still alive.

                         PAUL
          Is he?
          CLIVE comes out of the liquor store clutching bags of beer.

                         CLIVE
          Let's party!

          EXT. WOODS - NIGHT

          GRAHAM, CLIVE and PAUL have made a camp fire in a woodland
          clearing on the other side of town. They sit round drinking
          beers and chatting. PAUL rolls a joint.

                         GRAHAM
          So why "Paul'? It's not very, you
          know, alien.

                         CLIVE
          Is it spelt like, P-'-a-w-l-l or
          something?

                         PAUL
          No.

                         GRAHAM
          P-o-o-u-r-l?

                         PAUL
          No, it's Paul. Like Paul Newman or
          the little guy from Simon and
          Garfunkel.

                         CLIVE
          Paul Simon.

                         PAUL
          Paul Simon. Paul's not my real
          name. It's a name I got given.

                         GRAHAM
          What's your real name?

                         PAUL
          You won't be able to pronounce it.

                         CLIVE
          I can speak Klingon.

                         PAUL
          What a geek.

                         CLIVE
          Hey!

                         

                         

                         

                         

          79.

                         GRAHAM
          Come on, what's your real name.
          PAUL opens his mouth and screeches.

                         PAUL
          Roooooootttchaaaaaaaaaaa.

                         CLIVE
          Roooooootttttttccchhaaaa.

                         PAUL
          That's pretty good.

                         GRAHAM
          Rootchaa? That sounds like Roger.

                         PAUL
          Fuck you!

                         CLIVE
          Calm down, Rog.
          More laughter. Even PAUL. He lights his joint.

                         GRAHAM
          You look like a poster on a
          student's wall.

                         PAUL
          That was my gag! "Take me to your
          dealer' right? Yeah, that was mine.
          Never saw a dime.

                         GRAHAM
          You never answered my question. Why
          Paul? Who called you Paul?

                         PAUL
          The little girl who found me when I
          crashed. It was terrible actually.
          I killed her dog. I didn't mean to!
          My ship sort of landed on it. When
          the military arrived I was
          delirious; I kept saying "Paul?
          Paul?" It was the only English I
          knew, because I'd heard the little
          girl saying it over and over.
          Spooks thought it was my name.

                         CLIVE
          She called her dog Paul?

                         PAUL
          Least it wasn't Mr. Muggles.

                         GRAHAM
          What happened to the little girl?

                         

                         

                         

                         

          80.

                         PAUL
          Who knows? Never saw her again.
          Think about her everyday though.
          PAUL offers the joint round. CLIVE and GRAHAM decline. PAUL
          takes a deep drag. During the following exchange, GRAHAM,
          CLIVE and PAUL start to move simultaneously as though
          governed by some kind of psychic link.

                         CLIVE
          It's strange, isn't it? Ordinarily
          in this situation Graham and I
          would be looking up at the stars,
          wondering about life on other
          planets but we know now, don't we?
          It's a bit of an anti-climax.

                         PAUL
          Thanks a bunch, Hurley.

                         CLIVE
          I don't mean that in a bad way.
          They all scratch their noses.

                         GRAHAM
          Paul, can I ask you something?

                         PAUL
          Shoot.

                         GRAHAM
          Why are you in such a hurry to
          leave?

                         PAUL
          I've outlived my usefulness.

                         CLIVE
          How so?

                         PAUL
          There's only so much knowledge I
          can share about the universe and
          quantum theory and how to make a
          really nice meatball sandwich. The
          only thing I have to offer them now
          are my abilities.

                         GRAHAM
          So?

                         PAUL
          So the only way they're going to
          get hold of them is by obtaining
          some of somatic stem cells.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          81.

                         GRAHAM
          So what, do they take a swab from
          your cheek?

                         PAUL
          Negative.

                         CLIVE
          Stool?

                         PAUL
          Sadly, not that simple.

                         GRAHAM
          Blood?! Oh my god, I hate needles.

                         PAUL
          Believe me, a needle would be a
          picnic compared to what they had in
          store for me.

                         CLIVE
          I don't follow.

                         PAUL
          Stem cells are multipotent.
          GRAHAM and CLIVE look blank.

                         PAUL
          Lineage defined?
          GRAHAM and CLIVE still look blank.

          PAUL (CONT'D)
          The camouflage response, the memory
          transfer, the revivification, they
          all originate in my cerebellum. In
          order to cultivate them in a
          laboratory they would have to...

                         GRAHAM/CLIVE
          Cut your brain out.

                         PAUL
          Bingo! Fortunately, someone was
          kind enough to give me the heads
          up, if you'll pardon the pun. So,
          when they were transferring me to
          the medical facility and I noticed
          the bumper sticker on your RV, I
          figured you might be sympathetic
          types. I zapped the spooks, grabbed
          the wheel and took my chance.

                         CLIVE
          I thought the crash was our fault.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          82.

                         PAUL
          Well it was, kinda.

                         GRAHAM
          So, you're saying if they catch
          you...
          PAUL draws his thumb across his neck. GRAHAM and CLIVE look
          at PAUL in horror. All three scratch their heads.

                         PAUL
          So tell me, are you guys virgins or
          what?

                         GRAHAM/CLIVE
          No.
          They all cough.

                         PAUL
          Alright then, Clive, when was the
          last time you got laid.

                         CLIVE
          Comic-Con 2005. Ewok chick.

                         PAUL
          Three years ago you had sex with a
          midget?

                         CLIVE
          She was an Ewok!
          Sniff.

                         PAUL
          There are only two types of person
          small enough to fit inside an Ewok
          costume.

                         CLIVE
          She was a midget.

                         PAUL
          I can't believe you thought boning
          a space bear sounded less
          embarrassing than a person of short
          stature.

                         CLIVE
          I know. I'm sorry.

                         PAUL
          Was it nice?

                         CLIVE

                         WONDERFUL

                         

                         

                         

                         

          83.

                         PAUL
          You sly dog!
          PAUL rolls onto his back, clapping. GRAHAM snorts into his
          beer, laughing. CLIVE joins in. Before long, the three
          friends are rolling around in hysterics, utterly out of
          control. After about thirty seconds of this, they pass out.

          EXT. WOODS - MORNING

          The sun has just risen. GRAHAM, CLIVE and PAUL lie round the
          smoldering camp fire sleeping soundly. PAUL is very white.
          His eyes open. He looks around.

                         PAUL
          Oh shit! Hey, wake up. Wake up. We
          fell asleep.

                         CLIVE
          How did that happen?

                         PAUL
          Sorry, I get this thing when I get
          high. It's called "projective
          empathy'. You feel what I feel.

                         GRAHAM
          Like in E.T.?

                         PAUL
          Exactly.

                         CLIVE
          Oh, thank God. For a second there I
          thought I'd got drunk on Lite beer.
          The guys gather their stuff and walk to the edge of the wood.
          Looking through the tree line they realize that the quiet
          town of last night has become very busy indeed.

                         GRAHAM
          Oh dear!

                         PAUL
          I can't walk through there.

                         CLIVE
          How are we going to get back?
          Close in on GRAHAM having the best idea of his life.

          EXT. TOWN - DAY

          GRAHAM and CLIVE walk down the busy main street, between them
          is PAUL. He is dressed in the little cowboy suit from the
          shop window, his hat pulled down low over his face.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          84.

                         GRAHAM
          Maybe we should hold hands, so that
          we look like a family.

                         PAUL
          That's great! Two grown men who
          look like sex offenders holding
          hands with a child cowboy.

                         CLIVE
          You could be a midget.

                         PAUL
          You're obsessed with midgets!
          They continue on, trying to look as if nothing is strange.

                         GRAHAM
          Seem to be working, Clive. Clive?
          GRAHAM notices that CLIVE is no longer with them. He looks
          back to see CLIVE, gawping thought the window of a COMIC
          SHOP, at a sword resembling the one they saw at Comic-Con.
          The tag reads "Genuine "BLADE' Katana'. $299.99.

                         GRAHAM
          Clive, no.
          CLIVE walks into the shop. GRAHAM and PAUL follow quickly
          behind. As they enter the COMIC SHOP, MOSES BEHE emerges from
          the adjacent Drug Store. He takes a couple of pain killers
          and flexes his sore shoulders. He wanders up the road,
          scanning the passers by.

          INT. COMIC SHOP - DAY

          GRAHAM approaches CLIVE who is at the counter.

                         GRAHAM
          Now's not really the time, Sausage.

                         CLIVE
          I must have it.

                         GRAHAM
          It's very cheap. Are you sure you
          don't want to save up and get a
          proper on?

                         CLIVE
          Oh, come on, we've got time.

          INT/EXT. RV - DAY

          Close on RUTH's watch. She paces, worried.

          KNOCK KNOCK.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          85.

                         RUTH
          Where have you been? I was worried.
          She opens the door. AGENT ZOIL flashes his badge.

                         ZOIL
          Good morning, Ma'am. Sorry to
          trouble you. Agent Zoil, Secret
          Service. Your wagon here matches
          the description of a recreational
          vehicle we're currently looking
          for. May I ask, are you alone?
          RUTH pauses a second.

                         RUTH
          Yes, I'm alone.

                         ZOIL
          Do you mind taking a look at these
          pictures?
          ZOIL pulls out three pictures and hands them to RUTH. CCTV
          shots of GRAHAM and CLIVE at the gas station and MOSES's pic
          of RUTH, looking younger, with dark hair and no glasses.

                         ZOIL
          Do you recognise any of these
          people, Miss?
          She lingers on the picture of herself.

                         ZOIL
          Miss?

                         RUTH
          No, sorry I don't.

                         ZOIL
          Where are you coming from, Ma'am?

                         RUTH
          Christian ministry in Seattle. I've
          been driving for 5 days.

                         ZOIL
          Going far?

                         RUTH
          Austin.

                         ZOIL
          Great town.

                         RUTH
          Oh yes. It has an impressive bat
          population you know?

                         (MORE)

                         

                         

                         

                         

          86.

                         RUTH (CONT'D)
          Folks gather by the rive in the
          evening to watch them fly out. Turn
          the sky black. Quite a sight.

                         ZOIL
          Is that so?

                         RUTH
          Uh-huh. Well, I really should be
          getting along.

                         ZOIL
          Of course. Thanks for your time,
          Miss...?
          Beat.

                         RUTH
          Darwin, Charlotte Darwin.
          ZOIL smiles and nods. He laves.

          INT. COMIC SHOP - MOMENTS LATER

          GRAHAM and CLIVE are at the counter. CLIVE is trying out the
          blade. PAUL, in cowboy guise browses the racks of comics. He
          picks one up. The cover features an alien that looks a lot
          like him. The comic is called "Encounter Briefs: Tales From
          the Dreamland'. PAUL smiles and shakes his head. He suddenly
          realises he is being watched. Next to him is a child, (8)
          small enough to see under PAUL's hat. He is looking at the
          cover of the comic and back at PAUL.

                         PAUL
          How's it going?

                         CHILD
          Is that you?

                         PAUL
          No.

                         CHILD
          It looks like you.

                         PAUL
          Suppose it does. What's your name?

                         CHILD
          Keith Nash.

                         PAUL
          I'm Paul. Pleased to meet you.
          They shake hands.

                         PAUL
          You on your own here, Keith Nash?

                         

                         

                         

                         

          87.

                         KEITH NASH
          My Mom's shopping for some new
          jeans. She lets me wait in here.

                         PAUL
          Sounds like a good Mum.

                         KEITH NASH
          Yes and no. What're you doing here?

                         PAUL
          My friend's buying a sword. He's a
          grown man.

                         KEITH NASH
          What a nerd.
          PAUL laughs. So does KEITH NASH.

                         PAUL
          You an M&Ms man, Keith?
          PAUL produces his M&Ms. He offers one to KEITH.

                         KEITH NASH
          I am but I shouldn't.

                         PAUL
          Strangers with candy, right?

                         KEITH NASH
          Right.

                         PAUL
          Well, we've got a lot in common. We
          both like comics and M&Ms. Guess
          that makes us pals.

                         KEITH NASH
          Guess so.
          KEITH beams at PAUL and takes a few M&Ms. They turn their
          attention back to the racks of comics. PAUL pulls one out
          called "G-Men'. On the cover it shows an agent, not unlike
          ZOIL, shooting an alien not unlike PAUL.

                         PAUL
          You read this one?

                         KEITH NASH
          No.

                         PAUL
          It's a good one. Take it. Go on.
          It's a gift.

                         KEITH NASH
          Thanks Paul.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          88.
          KEITH stuffs it down his trousers. PAUL laughs. We hear MRS.
          NASH calling from the street.

                         KEITH NASH
          I gotta go.

                         PAUL
          Catch you later, Keith Nash.
          GRAHAM and CLIVE approach. CLIVE has a long sword shaped box
          under his arm and a big grin on his face.

                         CLIVE
          Who was that?

                         PAUL
          Keith Nash. How much was that?

                         CLIVE
          $299.99. It's made of a low grade
          Turkish alloy.

                         PAUL
          What did you get, speccy?

                         GRAHAM
          X-Men action figure.

                         PAUL
          Jesus Cheeeerist.

          EXT. COMIC SHOP - DAY

          GRAHAM, CLIVE and PAUL exit the comic shop. PAUL waves to
          KEITH NASH, who now sits outside, on a bench, with his
          MOTHER. The boys walk up the street, seconds later, HAGGARD
          and O'REILLY step out of a store, eating bags of candy.

          MRS. NASH
          Don't lie, Keith.

                         KEITH NASH
          I'm not lying.

          MRS. NASH
          Oh, come on now, Keith. If you
          carry on like this, you'll have to
          come with me to Dress Barn.

                         KEITH NASH
          Honestly Mommy, he was an alien and
          his name was Paul!

          MRS. NASH
          Whoever hard of an alien called
          Paul?

                         

                         

                         

                         

          89.
          HAGGARD is suddenly kneeling at KEITH NASH's side. O'REILLY
          stands nearby.

                         HAGGARD
          What did you say, kid?

          MRS. NASH
          Excuse me. Who are you?

                         HAGGARD
          Agent Haggard Ma'am, Secret
          Service.

          MRS. NASH
          Secret Service?!

                         HAGGARD
          Kid?

                         KEITH NASH
          He was in the shop.

                         HAGGARD
          Is he still in there?
          KEITH shakes his head.

                         O'REILLY
          Did he say where he was going?
          KEITH looks at his comic. The ZOIL style agent, shooting the
          PAUL style alien. He looks back at HAGGARD and points him in
          the entirely wrong direction.

                         HAGGARD
          South. Toward New Mexico, huh?
          KEITH nods. HAGGARD stands, his mind racing. He looks
          meaningfully at O'REILLY not noticing the RV rumbling up the
          street behind him with CLIVE at the wheel.

                         O'REILLY
          We've got him man! We're going to
          get a fucking promotion.

                         HAGGARD
          You did good kid. Want a candy?

                         KEITH NASH
          No thanks.

                         HAGGARD
          Let's go.
          The two agents rush off.

                         O'REILLY
          What about Zoil?

                         

                         

                         

                         

          90.

                         HAGGARD
          Screw Zoil!

          EXT. WOODS - DAY

          MOSES BEHE kicks at the remains of the campfire. He bends
          down and picks something up. It is Ruth's handkerchief, now
          stained with dirt and blood. He screws it into his shaking
          hand. An engine roars. He looks up to see the RV rumbling up
          the road. It turns onto the Eastbound Highway. MOSES' pick up
          is parked about 200 yards away. MOSES starts to lumber
          towards it as fast as he can, which isn't very fast.

          EXT. STREET - DAY

          HAGGARD and O'REILLY sprint up to their vehicles.

          ZOIL (O.S.)
          Where the hell do you think you're
          going?
          HAGGARD can't hide his frustration.

                         HAGGARD
          We picked up a lead, sir. Little
          kid in the town said he saw an
          alien. Said he was heading toward
          New Mexico.

                         ZOIL
          And you were just gonna take off?

                         HAGGARD
          Thought it best to take the
          initiative, sir. We were going to
          radio you.

                         ZOIL
          Well now, that's mighty civil of
          you. We have a chain of command. I
          expect you to abide by it. Where
          d'you say he was headed?

                         HAGGARD
          New Mexico sir.

                         ZOIL
          Well, then let's move it.
          They scramble.

                         ZOIL
          Oh, and Haggard? Don't go getting
          ideas about your station again.
          ZOIL gets into his car leaving HAGGARD looking pissed.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          91.

          INT. MOSES'S PICK UP - DAY

          MOSES drives, Ruth's bloody handkerchief gripped between his
          hands and the wheel. He listens to his police scanner.

          VOICE (O.S.)
          Zoil, what the hell's going on?

          ZOIL (O.S.)
          They've double back sir. They're
          heading toward New Mexico.

          VOICE (O.S.)
          You better be right about this,
          Zoil. I'm getting a little tired of
          this shit. I want that little
          fucker's brain in a jar by sundown.
          MOSES smiles darkly.

                         MOSES BEHE
          Looks like you're going the wrong
          way, Agent Zoil. That's what
          happens when you don't got the Lord
          on your side.

          EXT. HIGHWAY - DAY

          MOSES BEHE's pick up roars through shot, revealing a large
          roadside sign proclaiming LUCIFER'S CUT PRICE FIREWORK
          WAREHOUSE. Creep in on the sign.

          INT. RV - DAYBREAK

          The RV is parked outside the firework warehouse. RUTH and
          PAUL sit opposite each other at the dining table. RUTH is
          holding the X-Men action figure, Storm. PAUL watches her.

                         PAUL
          He likes you, y'know?

                         RUTH
          Graham? D'you think?

                         PAUL
          What are you, blind?
          Beat.

          PAUL (CONT'D)
          Sorry.
          Beat.

                         PAUL
          What you got there, a stigmatism?

                         

                         

                         

                         

          92.
          RUTH nods.

                         PAUL
          You know you can get on operation
          for that, right?

                         RUTH
          Papa said the Lord would fix it.
          Guess that's not gonna happen,
          seeing as we're living in a
          gigantic godless universe, with no
          hope of salvation.

                         PAUL
          Hey, I don't know categorically
          that it's godless. I just said
          "probably'.

                         RUTH
          Oh, that's a relief.

                         PAUL
          Look, the way you're feeling now,
          that's why religion appeared in the
          first place. It's like existential
          Prozac. Imagine being five year
          sold and having no adults around to
          tell you why it snows or what trees
          are for. That's how it is for much
          of humanity. Faith is a night-
          light. It illuminates the scary
          corners, fills the gaps, makes the
          universe easier to comprehend.
          Thing is, it's okay not to know
          everything. I mean, who knows
          what's really out there? Did you
          know astrophysicists recently
          identified the equation for the
          creation of matter?

                         RUTH
          Yes.

                         PAUL
          Oh. Well, then you get it, right?
          If they have the theory, who's to
          say at some point in the future
          they won't put it into practice and
          who's to say someone else didn't do
          that 13.5 Billion years ago and
          that's how the universe came to be?
          Course, then we get the eternal
          problem of who created the creator
          but that's a whole other car park.
          I think Shakespeare said it best.
          "There's more in Heaven and earth
          than is dreamt of in your
          philosophy Horatio".

                         

                         

                         

                         

          93.

                         RUTH
          What did you call me?

                         PAUL
          Horatio. It's from Hamlet. You
          know, the Prince of Denmark?

                         RUTH
          Denmark has a municipal population
          of 508,691.
          PAUL blinks.

                         PAUL
          Anyway, if there is a God, didn't
          he create doctors and hospitals and
          scalpels and shit, so he wouldn't
          have to go round fixing people's
          lazy eyeballs?

                         RUTH
          I suppose so.

                         PAUL
          The eye is a delicate and complex
          thing, Ruth. You should get it
          taken care of.
          RUTH smiles. PAUL smiles back. RUTH looks out of the window,
          just as PAUL reaches out to touch her face.

                         RUTH
          They're back.
          PAUL withdraws his hand. GRAHAM and CLIVE are approaching the
          RV clutching a large firework. They climb aboard.

                         PAUL
          Perfect.

                         CLIVE
          What are you going to do with this?

                         PAUL
          Phone home.

          INT. ZOIL'S CAR - DAY


                         VOICE

          ZOIL!
          ZOIL jumps but gathers his composure quickly.

                         ZOIL
          Yes, sir?

          analysis on all the traffic coming
          out of Prospect in the last 5
          hours. There was only one RV, and
          guess what, nimrod?

                         ZOIL
          It wasn't going to New Mexico?

                         VOICE
          That's a three pointer Agent Zoil.
          You better spin your ass around.
          You got some serious catching up to
          do. Don't make me come out there.

                         ZOIL
          No, sir. Where are they headed? If
          we gun it, maybe we can get the
          drop on their destination.

                         VOICE
          They're on the 50, heading towards
          Gillette.

                         ZOIL
          What else is around there?

                         VOICE
          Not much. Thunder Basis, Bethlehem
          Creek.

                         ZOIL
          Bethlehem Creek?

                         VOICE
          Holy shit!

          EXT. HIGHWAY - DAY

          ZOIL's motorcade pulls a spectacular U-turn and heads back up
          the highway in the opposite direction.

          INT. MOSES'S PICK UP - DAYBREAK

          MOSES listens intently to his scanner.

          VOICE (O.S.)
          You don't think she's sill there,
          do you?
          MOSES smiles.

          MOSES BEHE's pick-up truck pulls a similarly spectacular turn
          and heads in a different direction.

          EXT. FARMHOUSE - EVENING

          Caption: Bethlehem Creek, Wyoming
          GRAHAM, CLIVE, RUTH and PAUL stare through the window of the
          RV at the farmhouse glimpsed in the first scene.

                         GRAHAM
          You don't think she's still there
          do you?

                         PAUL
          That's what you're going to find
          out for me.

                         CLIVE
          Us?

                         PAUL
          I can't just knock can I? What if
          she's moved on and someone else
          answers? I'm sick of people
          fainting on me. I'll hang back with
          my buddy Ruth, you two make first
          contact. Just enjoy it.

                         CLIVE
          What shall we say if it's her?
          We're here with the alien that
          killed your dog sixty years ago?

                         PAUL
          Yes. Hurry up, there's going to be
          a really big storm in exactly 34
          minutes.

                         RUTH
          How do you know?

                         PAUL
          It's my job to know.

          Hello?

                         CLIVE

          Tara Walton?

          VOICE (O.S.)
          Leave me alone!

                         GRAHAM
          Okay.
          GRAHAM goes to leave. CLIVE stops him.

                         CLIVE
          Miss Walton, I'm the writer, Clive
          Gollings and this is my friend and
          colleague, Graham Willy. We're from
          England and we're here with the
          alien that killed your dog 60 years
          ago.
          Silence. The sound of multiple locks. The door opens to
          reveal a woman (68). Grey, dishevelled but with fire in her
          eyes. She scowls at GRAHAM and CLIVE.

                         TARA
          What is this, some kind of joke?

                         CLIVE
          It's no joke.
          PAUL materializes between GRAHAM and CLIVE.

                         PAUL
          Hello Tara.
          TARA's faces sickens. She falls backwards into the house.

                         PAUL
          Aw nuts.

          INT. TARA'S FARMHOUSE. FRONT ROOM - DAY

          GRAHAM, CLIVE, RUTH and PAUL all sit on a sofa. TARA sits
          opposite, staring at PAUL.

                         RUTH
          Maybe I should make some tea.

                         TARA
          Where are my manners? I never
          really have guests. Nobody comes up
          here. I go whole weeks without
          seeing a soul.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          97.
          TARA goes to the kitchen. She can be seen from where they are
          sitting. She turns the gas on and strikes a cooking match.
          PAUL looks pained, struggling for something to say.

                         PAUL
          Can I do anything to help?
          TARA stand in the kitchen doorway, the lit match in her hand.
          PAUL stands and walks toward her, she watches him.

                         TARA
          I've only just stopped believing in
          you, y'know? Spent a very long time
          trying to convince folk about what
          happened that night. My parents, my
          friends. Everyone thought I was
          mad. They told me it was a meteor
          that squashed little Paul. Took me
          away and did tests they did, said
          it was for cosmic radiation. They
          said I was concussed,
          hallucinating, but I knew you were
          real. I pulled you from that
          spaceship myself. Sat with you till
          the men came and took you away. If
          Pop hadn't had to go to Casper, he
          would have seen you too. They kept
          telling me I'd imagined it but I
          knew different. Pop tried to
          understand but they filled his head
          with "delayed this' and "post-
          traumatic that'. He just used to
          smile and say "there, there Tara'.
          He got sick when I was seventeen
          and died a few years later. I
          inherited this place. Word got out
          about my story not long after it
          happened, so I didn't really have
          any friends. Kids used to throw
          stones at the house and call me
          names. I just kinda retreated into
          myself. I'd spend whole nights up
          on the roof, staring at the sky,
          hoping to catch a glimpse of you
          again. I always believed that one
          day you"d come back and here you
          are.
          The match flame reaches her fingers, she shakes it out.

                         TARA
          Listen to me gabbing. Milk and
          sugar?

                         PAUL
          I'm so sorry.

                         TARA
          What for?

                         

                         

                         

                         

          98.

                         PAUL
          For killing your dog and ruining
          your life.

                         TARA
          That doesn't matter. Don't you see?
          You're real. I was right and all
          those folk that said I was crazy?
          Well, they can all go fuck
          themselves.

                         PAUL
          It's good to see you, Tara.
          The tinkle of glass. Something hits the floor. A tear gas
          canister spins at their feet, spewing thick fog.

                         TARA
          Now, where do you suppose that came
          from?

                         PAUL
          Fuck a duck! Get out!

                         GRAHAM/CLIVE
          Shit!

                         PAUL
          Tara, where's the back door?

                         TARA
          In back.
          The gang bustle out of the room just as the front door
          splinters inward, revealing O'REILLY in a gas mask.

          INT. TARA'S FARMHOUSE. BACK ROOM - DAY

          The gang quickly barricade the door of the next room and
          continue on toward the back of the house. They find the back
          door, just as it is opened by ZOIL. The gang freeze. PAUL
          vanishes, then reappears right next to ZOIL, putting his hand
          across ZOIL's forehead.

                         ZOIL
          Paul, wait-
          A burst of psychic images explode into ZOIL's head. The agent
          and the alien fall on the ground in an exhausted heap.

                         PAUL
          Clive?

                         CLIVE
          Yes?

                         PAUL
          A little help?

                         

                         

                         

                         

          99.
          CLIVE picks PAUL up. HAGGARD approaches, gun drawn.

                         HAGGARD
          Freeze, space monkey!

                         GRAHAM
          We're cut off.

                         TARA
          Storm cellar!
          TARA opens a nearby door and motions them down some stairs,
          as HAGGARD fires wildly. Crockery explodes around them.

                         ZOIL
          Godammit Haggard!

          INT. TARA'S FARMHOUSE. CELLAR - DAY

          The gang descend into a dim room. It is full of UFO
          paraphernalia. Models, toys, books, souvenirs from every UFO
          hot spot in the land. One the wall is the "Take Me To Your
          Dealer' poster. PAUL sees it.

                         PAUL
          Not a fucking cent.

          INT. TARA'S FARMHOUSE. BACK ROOM - DAY

          ZOIL comes to. He sees HAGGARD at the cellar door. Screeching
          brakes draw his attention as MOSES BEHE's truck skids up. He
          gets out, shotgun in hand.

                         ZOIL
          Oh great!

          EXT. TARA'S FARMHOUSE - DAY

          TEAM PAUL climb out of the cellar and start to run towards
          the RV, PAUL still in CLIVE's arms. It starts to rain.

                         PAUL
          Come on!

                         GRAHAM
          Ow, my shins!

          INT. TARA'S FARMHOUSE. BACK ROOM - DAY

          ZOIL sees MOSES run round to the front of the farmhouse.

                         ZOIL
          Help me up!

                         

                         

                         

                         

          100.

          INT. TARA'S FARMHOUSE. FRONT ROOM - DAY

          O'REILLY sees TEAM PAUL running toward the RV from the front
          room. He levels his pistol at PAUL and squints.

          EXT. TARA'S FARMHOUSE - DAY

          TEAM PAUL reach the RV and start to board, just as MOSES BEHE
          lumbers into view.

                         MOSES BEHE

          RUTH!

                         RUTH
          Papa?
          PAUL grabs RUTH's hand.

                         PAUL
          Come on.

                         MOSES BEHE
          (levelling his shotgun)
          Take your hands off her, devil!

          INT. TARA'S FARMHOUSE. FRONT ROOM - DAY

          O'REILLY find his mark. Pull back to reveal he is stood by
          the kitchen door, through which we see the cooker, the simmer
          of gas in the air.

                         O'REILLY
          Ready or not.
          He fires.

          KA-BOOM!!!
          O'REILLY is vaporized in a ball of orange fire.

          EXT. TARA'S FARMHOUSE - DAY

          The farmhouse explodes. ZOIL and HAGGARD who are only just
          clear, hit the deck, covering their heads. MOSES is knocked
          off his feet as flaming wood and debris rain down.

          INT. RV - DAY


                         CLIVE
          I'll drive!

                         GRAHAM
          Punch it!

                         

                         

                         

                         

          101.
          The RV roars into life, reversing out onto the road. CLIVE
          pulls a spectacular U-turn, sending the passengers flying.
          GRAHAM lands in TARA's arms, RUTH in PAUL's. RUTH and GRAHAM
          exchange glances. Dumb luck. TARA straightens herself and
          looks out of the RV at her destroyed home.

                         TARA
          My weed!

          EXT. TARA'S FARMHOUSE - DAY

          ZOIL is blackened and dazed, draped over HAGGARD's shoulder.
          His eyes focus on a figure in the near distance. MOSES BEHE
          picks himself up and lumbers off towards his truck. HAGGARD
          drops ZOIL and runs to his car.

                         ZOIL
          Damnit Haggard, wait!
          HAGGARD takes off. ZOIL staggers to his car and with great
          difficulty, takes off in pursuit, narrowly avoiding MOSES
          BEHE's truck. Lightening flashes. Loud thunder.

          INT. RV - DAY

          CLIVE floors it. RAIN lashes down. The sky is almost black.

                         GRAHAM
          Your dad's persistent, isn't he?

                         RUTH
          You have no idea.
          CLIVE sees their pursuers in his wing mirror.

                         CLIVE
          I think we have a problem.

                         GRAHAM
          What do we do?

                         PAUL
          Go left.

                         CLIVE
          What?

                         PAUL

          GO LEFT!
          CLIVE hauls the wheel left. The RV leaves the road and
          bounces across the scrub. TEAM PAUL hang on for dear life.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          102.

          EXT. DESERT ROAD - DAY

          HAGGARD, ZOIL and MOSES follow the RV across the scrub.

          INT. ZOIL'S CAR - EVENING


                         ZOIL

                         (TO HIMSELF)
          What the hell is he doing?!

          VOICE (O.S.)
          Zoil. Progress report!

          INT. HAGGARD'S CAR - EVENING


                         HAGGARD
          In pursuit, sir.

                         VOICE
          Who the hell is this?

                         HAGGARD
          Haggard, sir. Agent Zoil has been
          compromised. I'm assuming command.

          ZOIL (O.S.)
          Now wait a goddamn minute!

                         VOICE
          I don't give a shit who's in
          command. Where' my fucking
          mooncoon?!

                         HAGGARD
          Just ahead of me sir. We're heading
          East across scrubland just North of
          Mitchell Creek.

                         VOICE
          I don't wanna hear from either of
          you jokers until that little mother
          fucker is under glass.

                         HAGGARD
          Yes sir!
          HAGGARD floors it. He is manic and wild eyed.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          103.

          EXT. DESERT ROAD - DAY

          We see the chase from above, the RV is in the lead, gaining
          behind them, is HAGGARD, followed by ZOIL, then MOSES.
          HAGGARD draws level. He looks up into CLIVE's eyes.

          INT. RV - DAY


                         CLIVE
          They're trying to overtake.

                         PAUL
          Don't let him get past.

                         CLIVE
          Shall I ram him?

          RUTH/TARA/GRAHAM/PAUL

          YES!
          CLIVE wrenches the wheel hard to the left.

          EXT. SCRUB - EVENING

          The RV nudges the BLACK SEDAN which spins out of control and
          skids to a stop, ZOIL and MOSES scream past. HAGGARD turns
          the engine over. Nothing. He yells. Lightening explodes
          overhead, hail pings and bounces off the hood.

          INT. RV - EVENING


                         CLIVE
          What are we doing exactly?

                         PAUL

                         (TO HIMSELF)
          Immense pressure and temperature
          drop. High winds, circulating in
          the troposphere, two opposed fronts
          clashing. Oh, this is going to be a
          good one.

                         CLIVE

          A GOOD WHAT?!
          RUTH stares out of the window.

                         RUTH
          Oh my God.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          104.

          EXT. SCRUB - EVENING

          A massive black funnel extends from the sky about half a mile
          ahead of the chase. It rakes the ground, reducing a small
          farm building to a million splinters.

          INT. MOSES'S PICK UP - EVENING

          -Shit!

          INT. RV - EVENING

          CLIVE swerves to avoid a grain silo, which comes bouncing
          across the ground toward them.

                         CLIVE
          Are you sure you know what you're
          doing?!

                         PAUL
          Twenty seconds.

                         TARA
          Paul, we'll get sucked right up.

                         PAUL
          Stay on target.
          A branch smacks on the windshield, cracking it.

                         CLIVE
          Paul!

                         PAUL
          Stay on target.

          EXT. SCRUB - EVENING

          The grain silo bounces close to ZOIL's car, he swerves to
          avoid it and stops. MOSES pulls up just ahead. MOSES and ZOIL
          get out of the vehicles, almost unable to stand against the
          wind and debris. They watch the RV, now a good distance in
          front, heading for the heart of the tornado.

          He's insane!

                         MOSES BEHE

          RUTH!
          HAGGARD's car screams past. ZOIL grabs his radio.

                         ZOIL
          Haggard, stand down. Stand down!

          HAGGARD (O.S.)
          He's mine. I can do this!

                         ZOIL
          Haggard, it's suicide.

          PAUL?

                         PAUL

          NOW!
          The funnel suddenly evaporates into the sky, leaving the path
          ahead clear and oddly calm.

                         GRAHAM
          It's gone!

                         CLIVE
          Where did it go?

          EXT. SCRUB - EVENING

          ZOIL watches amazed. He almost smiles.

                         ZOIL
          Son of a bitch!
          ZOIL looks at the sky. His face drops.

                         ZOIL
          Haggard. Wait a minute!
          An engine revs nearby. ZOIL turns to see MOSES BEHE pull off
          in pursuit.

                         ZOIL

          MR. BEHE!
          (into is radio)
          Damnit, hang back, hang back!

                         

                         

                         

                         

          106.

          HAGGARD (O.S.)
          You're not running this show any
          more Zoil. You had your chance.

                         ZOIL
          Haggard, he knows what he's doing.

          HAGGARD (O.S.)
          So do I.

                         ZOIL
          It's a trap!

          Back where I'm from, tornadoes are
          part of our daily life. We've

          We've learnt to anticipate their
          behavior, know their personalities,
          know when they're playing games.

                         RUTH

                         GRAHAM
          What games?

                         RUTH

          2...

                         PAUL
          Hide and seek?

                         RUTH

          1...

                         

                         

                         

                         

          107.
          CLIVE looks into his wing mirror, just as the tornado snakes
          down out of the sky between them and HAGGARD.

                         CLIVE
          Great Caesar's ghost!

                         RUTH
          How did you do that? How did you
          know?

                         PAUL
          Evolution baby.

          EXT. SCRUB - EVENING

          The tornado touches down hear HAGGARD's car. He barely has
          time to scream before his is lifted into the vortex.

          INT. MOSES'S PICK UP - EVENING

          A wide eyed MOSES yanks hard on the wheel, spinning the truck
          round, heading back in the opposite direction.

          EXT. SCRUB - EVENING

          MOSES's truck hurtles past ZOIL's car.

          MOSES BEHE (O.S.)
          Oh Jesus! Oh Jesus! Oh Jesus!
          ZOIL looks back toward the no unreachable RV.

          INT. RV - DAY


                         CLIVE
          We've lost them.
          TEAM PAUL erupt into cheers. PAUL jumps in the air and
          whoops. He high five GRAHAM and pats CLIVE on the back.
          GRAHAM embraces RUTH and tries to kiss her, she pulls away.

                         GRAHAM
          Sorry.

                         RUTH
          Wait, what about Papa?

                         CLIVE
          I only saw one car following us.

                         PAUL
          Where's Tara?
          TARA comes out of the toilet.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          108.

                         TARA
          The bulb's gone in there.

                         GRAHAM
          That was just awesome. Amazing
          driving Clive. It was like G.T.A.
          but potentially fatal. Wasn't it,
          Clive? Clive?
          A knocking and a gurgling sound is coming from the engine.

                         CLIVE
          Oh no.

          EXT. SMALL ROAD - EVENING

          The RV splutters to a halt. Steam rises from the radiator. It
          whines, coughs and dies. Cut to TEAM PAUL stood around
          surveying their fallen companion. A single bullet hold in the
          grill, reveals the cause of her downfall.

                         GRAHAM
          There goes the deposit.

                         CLIVE
          Fare thee well friend. You were a
          faithful and mighty steed.

                         TARA
          She rode that storm with a bullet
          in her heart and didn't stop until
          we we're safe.

                         RUTH
          If there is a benevolent creator
          watching over everything then may
          he, she or it bless the 1985
          Holiday Rambler, Imperial.
          Everyone looks to PAUL for his comment but he is not there.

                         GRAHAM
          Paul?

          PAUL (O.S.)
          We're here.
          PAUL is stood away from the RV at the foot of a small hill.
          He starts to climb. The others follow. Crane up as TEAM PAUL
          climb the hill to reveal a sight familiar to anyone who has
          seen Close Encounters Of The Third Kind...
          DEVIL's TOWER

                         GRAHAM/CLIVE
          Of course!

                         

                         

                         

                         

          109.

          INT. ZOIL'S CAR - EVENING

          ZOIL drives. Scanning the landscape. Searching.

                         VOICE
          Zoil! What the hell is going on?

                         ZOIL
          We got hit by a twister, sir.
          Haggard's dead.

                         VOICE
          What about the other one?

                         ZOIL
          I lost him when the ranch exploded.

                         VOICE
          Jesus Christ, Zoil, this has been
          one fuck up after another. I should
          have handled it myself. I want that
          little bastard dead by midnight
          tonight or you'll be working
          security in a convention centre.
          Now where's that RV?
          ZOIL's eyes widen. Parked on the roadside is the RV.

                         VOICE
          Zoil? ZOIL?
          ZOIL is staring at DEVIL'S TOWER.

          EXT. DEVIL'S TOWER - DAY

          TEAM PAUL hike towards the tower.

                         RUTH
          What you may not know is on the
          outside of the tower they bolted a
          series of ladders, all the way to
          the top, put there by William
          Rogers in 1893. He was the first
          man to climb the tower.

                         TARA
          I climbed up there in 1976. Thought
          it would make a good site for some
          UFO spotting. Turns out I wasn't
          the only one.

                         PAUL
          We call them IFOs.

                         TARA
          Cute.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          110.

                         PAUL
          I-thank-you.

          EXT. SMALL ROAD - DUSK

          ZOIL opens the trunk of his car. He pulls out a large piston,
          spare ammo and a webbing pack which he slings around his
          shoulder. He sets off up the hill.

          EXT. DEVIL'S TOWER. CLEARING - NIGHT

          TEAM PAUL are walking round the tower. As they round the
          corner the landscape changes, the trees give way to a piece
          of open pasture flanked by pine forest, the tower opens
          itself up slightly, a perfect natural amphitheatre.

                         PAUL
          This is it.
          PAUL takes out the firework, Zippo and cigarettes from his
          back pack. He lights his last cigarette and takes a drag.

                         PAUL
          I'll miss these.
          PAUL takes the firework a little way off and sticks it in the
          ground. He crouches down and lights the touch paper with the
          cigarette, then scampers back to the gang. Beat. The firework
          rises into the sky. It explodes. The star-burst is massive
          and bright red, it illuminates the tower.

                         TARA
          Pretty.

                         GRAHAM
          What now?

                         PAUL
          We wait.
          A light appears in the sky some way off.

          PAUL (CONT'D)

                         (FROWNING)
          That was quick.

          EXT. DEVIL'S TOWER. FOREST - NIGHT

          ZOIL runs through the bush, fast, like a wild animal. His
          face fixed with serious intent, gun in one hand, torch in the
          other.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          111.

          EXT. DEVIL'S TOWER. CLEARING - NIGHT

          TEAM PAUL watch as the ethereal light draws nearer.
          Spotlights cut through the night, searching beneath.

          EXT. DEVIL'S TOWER. FOREST - NIGHT

          ZOIL leaps a fallen tree. Ahead, through the trees, he sees
          an ethereal glow. He pulls the slide back on his pistol.

          EXT. DEVIL'S TOWER. CLEARING - NIGHT

          The lights are really close now. They are accompanied by a
          deep rumble. A very earthly sound. Rotor blades.

                         PAUL
          Wait a minute...
          A HELICOPTER swoops in to land, kicking dust and debris into
          the air. TEAM PAUL turn back to the woods but are stopped by
          the sight of a torch getting nearer.

          PAUL (CONT'D)
          Oh shit.
          Behind them, the HELICOPTER powers down. The door opens.

                         VOICE
          Well, whaddya know? Small world.
          VOICE appears flanked by two faceless, heavily armed
          SOLDIERS. They level their weapons, just as ZOIL bursts
          through the trees behind them.

                         ZOIL

          PAUL!

                         PAUL
          Lorenzo?!
          PAUL spins round. We go into slow motion. ZOIL fires. The
          bullet explodes from the gun, straight at us. Angle on the
          bullet as it passes in ECU. The shot moves round behind the
          bullet to reveal PAUL, looking shocked. The bullet whizzes
          past him, slamming into one of the soldiers.
          ZOIL rolls, coming to rest on one knee. He fires a second
          shot into the leg of the other soldier who collapses. He
          leaves his gun at VOICE just as the PILOT bursts from the
          cockpit. The PILOT fires but misses ZOIL. ZOIL takes out his
          shoulder, spinning him off his feet. VOICE steps forward,
          holding a smoking gun.

                         VOICE
          It was you! You told him. I
          should've known.

                         (MORE)

                         

                         

                         

                         

          112.

                         VOICE (CONT'D)
          You've never made a mistake in your
          life. That's why I put you in
          charge of this fucking mission.

                         ZOIL
          He's my friend! I've known him for
          twenty years. He introduced me to
          my wife damnit!

                         VOICE
          You stupid son of a bitch. In five
          years, you could have been where I
          am.

                         ZOIL
          I don't want to be where you are.

                         VOICE
          Too bad, seeing as I'm the one
          hold'ng all the cards and when I
          say "cards", I of course mean big
          fucking gun.
          VOICE points his gun at PAUL.

                         PAUL
          How'd you find me?

                         VOICE
          It was pretty easy once we got a
          fix on the geek-mobile. Wasn't hard
          to figure out where you were
          headed. You always did have a flare
          for the dramatic.
          PAUL nods, a sad smile creeping across his mouth.

                         VOICE
          Let's go.
          TARA stands in front of PAUL, then RUTH, then GRAHAM then
          CLIVE, who summons every ounce of bravery in his body.

                         CLIVE
          He's not going anywhere.

                         VOICE
          Be honest with yourself, two
          scoops. What is it that you think
          you can possibly bring to the table
          at this stage in the game?
          CLIVE reaches beyond his back and produces his KATANA SWORD,
          he holds it like a proud Samurai.

                         CLIVE
          Blind fury.
          The blade falls off.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          113.

                         CLIVE
          Bloody low grade Turkish alloy.

                         VOICE
          Step aside, you fat nerd.

                         CLIVE

                         (IN KLINGON)
          Graham, his this man.
          CLIVE steps aside. GRAHAM slams his fist into the face of the
          unsuspecting VOICE. He staggers back but rallies quickly,
          blocking GRAHAM's second blow and delivering a heavy rebuke.
          RUTH leaps onto VOICE's back and starts pummeling his head.

                         RUTH
          Leave him alone!
          VOICE hits out at RUTH. GRAHAM renews his attack.

                         GRAHAM
          Leave her alone!
          VOICE throws them off and comes face to face with TARA.

                         TARA
          Leave them alone.
          WHAM! She whacks VOICE across the face with a large stick.

                         TARA
          You're not taking him away again.
          He staggers backwards and falls to the ground, unconscious.

                         PAUL
          Thank you, Tara.

                         TARA
          Don't mention it.
          PAUL rushes to ZOIL who lies on the ground, wounded.

                         ZOIL
          The things I do for you, huh?

                         PAUL
          You know I appreciate it.

                         ZOIL
          Do you have any idea how difficult
          it was to catch you guys?

                         PAUL

                         (LAUGHS)
          Let me take a look at that. Ruth,
          shine the torch down here?
          RUTH grabs a torch and steps in behind PAUL.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          114.
          BLAM! RUTH lurches forward, suddenly limp. Everyone turns to
          see MOSES BEHE, shotgun smoking in his and. His face white,
          his eyes wide.

                         MOSES BEHE
          Oh Lord, Ruth. My little Ruth.

                         GRAHAM
          Noooooooooo!
          GRAHAM gathers RUTH up in his arms. She coughs, flecks of
          blood around her mouth.

                         MOSES BEHE
          I...I never meant to shoot her. I
          was aiming for the goblin.

                         CLIVE
          He's not a goblin he's from another
          planet.

                         MOSES BEHE
          But he can't be. He... he...

                         GRAHAM
          He's an alien you stupid man! Oh
          Ruth, Ruth I'm sorry, I'm so sorry.
          I should have never persuaded you
          to come with us.
          RUTH focuses on GRAHAM. She smiles, weakly.

                         RUTH
          What, and miss all this? Graham,
          I've lived more in the last 48
          hours that I ever did in that
          trailer park. Isn't that what you
          said living was all about? Right
          now? This conversation? That tree?
          My next cheeseburger? I'm not
          afraid anymore Graham. I'm cold
          though. Hey, where is everybody?
          RUTH shudders and dies. TARA and ZOIL look aghast. GRAHAM
          buries his head in RUTH's hair. CLIVE, his eyes are filled
          with tears, puts his and on GRAHAM's shoulder.

                         MOSES BEHE
          What have I done? I'm sorry. I'm so
          sorry.
          A shadow is cast across RUTH. Everyone looks up to see PAUL,
          silhouetted against the moon. His eyes glint.

                         PAUL
          There is no way this thing isn't
          gonna end happy.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          115.
          PAUL drops to his knee and places his hands on RUTH's chest.
          MOSES drops his shotgun and lumbers over, distraught.

                         MOSES BEHE
          Get away from her! Don't you touch
          my little girl.
          CLIVE holds out a hand to stop MOSES. He obeys. The air hums,
          charged with static. PAUL's skin ripples with color. Everyone
          watches transfixed. RUTH's eye flickers and opens. With some
          difficulty, she sits up and takes off her glasses. She blinks
          both shining, healthy eyes.

                         GRAHAM
          Ruth, are you okay?

                         RUTH
          I think so. Is anyone hungry? I
          really feel like a cheese burger.
          Relief and joy spreads through group. MOSES falls to his
          knees and sobs. He feels a hand on his shoulder and looks up
          to see PAUL.

                         MOSES BEHE
          Thank you.
          RUTH and GRAHAM hug. She smiles at him.

                         RUTH
          You can kiss me now.
          They kiss with awkward passion. Everyone smiles then after a
          bit become uncomfortable and a bit grossed out.

                         PAUL
          Looks like the geek shall inherit
          the earth.

          CLICK CLICK.
          The group turn to see VOICE, upright, pointing his gun.

                         VOICE
          I wouldn't say-

          SPLAT.
          A large spaceship lands hard on top of VOICE. Everyone looks
          shocked. PAUL, GRAHAM and CLIVE exchange a look.

                         PAUL
          Happens to the best of us.

          EXT. DEVIL'S TOWER. CLEARING - NIGHT

          Some time has passed, a number of PAUL style aliens are now
          present.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          116.
          One of them uses a big hose to clean the remains of VOICE
          from the hull of the ship. Another two help the now healed
          soldier to their feet, patting them on the back and shaking
          their hands. The atmosphere is amiable.
          TEAM PAUL look at one another. ZOIL and MOSES have joined
          them. PAUL kisses and hugs RUTH.

                         PAUL
          I'm sorry I frightened you so much
          your hair turned white.

                         RUTH
          You didn't frighten me. You freed
          me. You helped me see the light.

                         PAUL

                         (TO MOSES)
          Take care of her big man.

                         MOSES BEHE
          I will sir. God be with you.

                         PAUL
          Whatever dude.
          They high five. PAUL turns to ZOIL, whose arm is in a
          makeshift sling and shakes his hand.

          PAUL (CONT'D)
          Lorenzo Zoil, you're a good man.
          Say bye to Karen for me.

                         ZOIL
          Safe trip Short Round.
          PAUL turns to GRAHAM and CLIVE. He pulls JELVA - ALIEN QUEEN
          OF THE VARVAK from his pocket and hands it to them.

                         CLIVE
          You can keep it.

                         PAUL
          Cool. Okay.

                         GRAHAM
          What did you think?

                         PAUL
          Yeah. Three tits, awesome. Although
          you know what? Sometimes, less is
          more.
          The boys nod.

          PAUL (CONT'D)
          Thank you.

                         GRAHAM
          No, thank you.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          117.

                         CLIVE
          You are, and always will be, our
          friend.

                         PAUL
          Come here you fucking geeks.
          They hug. He takes in incandescent orb from his pocket.

          PAUL (CONT'D)
          This is a self-sustaining light
          orb. Might come in handy, you know,
          if a bulb goes.
          TARA is waiting for her goodbye but PAUL ignores her. He face
          drops as he walks to his ship. He turns to her.

          PAUL (CONT'D)
          You coming?

                         TARA
          What?

                         PAUL
          I ruined your life Tara. Think I
          owe you a new one.
          TARA takes PAUL's hand.

                         TARA
          I don't have my toothbrush.

                         PAUL
          Baby, where we're going, you won't
          need teeth.
          TARA frowns then follows PAUL aboard. PAUL and TARA stand in
          the doorway. One of the other ALIENS comes out of a small
          room behind them, speaking in a strange tongue.
          Subtitle: THE BULB'S GONE IN THERE.
          As the door slowly closes, GRAHAM and CLIVE give PAUL the
          CE3K salute. PAUL gives them the finger. The boys laugh,
          tears in their eyes. The ship lifts off into the sky. GRAHAM,
          CLIVE, RUTH, MOSES and ZOIL watch them go. The light form the
          ship gradually fades, leaving them in darkness. Pause.

                         GRAHAM
          That was good, wasn't it?

          INT. CONVENTION CENTRE. SIGNING PAVILLION - DAY

          We are at Comic-Con the following year. We come to rest on a
          long line of people. Sat behind a table are GRAHAM and CLIVE.
          They look more confident, cooler. CLIVE is talking to a short
          woman in an EWOK costume. He pats her on the ass as she walks
          away. All around them are stacks of their new novel: PAUL.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          118.
          A banner hangs behind, displaying the cover, GRAHAM's own
          rendering of their alien friend. They sign copies. The
          PUBLICIST mills around, looking very pleased.

                         PUBLICIST
          Just one item per person please.
          He winks at the boys. RUTH rushes up to GRAHAM, she is
          dressed as Storm from X-Men and pushes a customized buggy, in
          which sits a baby dressed as Professor X.

                         RUTH
          Hey.

                         GRAHAM
          Hey babe. You okay?

                         RUTH
          I'm just taking Tara over to the
          autograph pavilion. Michael Biehn's
          here!

                         CLIVE
          Oh, say hi from us, won't you?
          RUTH kisses GRAHAM. Two nerds approach.

                         MAJOR NERD 1
          Uh... were you... did you?

                         GRAHAM/CLIVE
          There you go.

          SECURITY MAN (O.S.)
          Next in line please.

                         MAJOR NERD 2
          Uh... were you... did you?

                         GRAHAM/CLIVE
          There you go.

                         SECURITY MAN
          Guys, if you've had your book
          signed please move on.
          Tilt up to reveal the security man. It is none other than
          former Special Agent LORENZO ZOIL. CRANE up to reveal the
          whole convention floor.

                        SHOOTING SCRIPT

                         14 May 2004






 1A EXT: PROLOGUE ON BLACK - NIGHT

 The screen is black, music evoking religion and danger begins.

                                LILLY
                    For three hundred years the great plagues have
                    swept the earth. Diseases created from the
                    experiments of the Alchemists.

 We see death tolls appear through this graphically.

 The plague - 5 million souls. Virulent Small Pox - 10 million.
 Mutated Influenza 30 Million Souls...

                                Lilly
                    Thinking they had discovered Gods secret code for
                    life, the Alchemists experimented with genetic
                    science. They had no idea what they had
                    unleashed.

  We begin to see a strange medallion sweeping through smoke, slowly
  revealing itself.

                                LILLY (CONT'D)
                         (continuing)
                    ...but there was also a miracle. One of these
                    plagues helped nature create a new kind of being.
                    At first they were called Nosferatu, or Vampire
                    and were feared. But they were not supernatural
                    monsters, just a better version of ourselves.
                    They were the Brothers, and their religion and
                    science helped sustain us against the plagues and
                    influenzas that have ravaged Europe and the rest
                    of the colonies. For 300 years our two races have
                    lived in harmony. Until now...


                                          FADE UP:

2 INT: DOCTORS SURGERY - DAY                                2

 We are very close on a bespectacled eye. It stares at us and
 then looks down.

                     GENETIC DOCTOR
                  (off)
           See here. This is what you need to
           look for.

 Cut to the object in the Genetic Doctors hand; it is like an
 x-ray, yet the image looks remarkably like a DNA profile.

                     GENETIC DOCTOR
                  (continuing; off)
           A genetic mutation, we all carry
           it. But we now know a virus
           activates it.
                                                                3

We reveal the genetic Doctor, sitting at his desk, smoking a
cigarette. The surgery and the clothes suggest the year, yet
there are small things that are different, not what you'd
expect to be around at this time. Standing next to him in the
dusty haze of the room is a younger doctor; an apprentice who
looks attentive.

                   GENETIC DOCTOR
                (continuing)
         This Virus plays some unknown role
         in the birth the Brothers. Of
         course the mutation occurs very
         rarely these days. And only in
         males.

The apprentice nods and then looks up. There is someone else
in the room. A woman - who we now see is pregnant. There is
something about her that suggests more a prisoner or
psychiatric patient than a normal pregnant mother.

                   GENETIC DOCTOR
                (continuing)
         Strange isn't?

                    Apprentice   DOCTOR
         Strange?

                   GENETIC DOCTOR
         That God would choose such humble
         vehicle for a miracle. The mothers
         invariably come from the slums, we
         don't know why.
                (to the woman)
         This is your 7th isn't it?
                                                                 4




We see the woman; she's like a hollow person, hardly aware of
where she is. The Doctor shuffles papers. Finds what he wants.

                   GENETIC DOCTOR
                (continuing)
         Yes, her first was successful, a
         Brother was born. Thereafter
         variously malformed offspring. We
         can only hope this one will be
         different.
                (to woman)
         You'll have to try harder this
         time.

The woman now looks up. And tentatively speaks.

                     WOMAN IN THE SURGURY
         Please...

                   GENETIC DOCTOR
         What is it?

                   WOMAN IN THE SURGURY
         Please... I want to keep my baby.
         They always take my babies away.

                   GENETIC DOCTOR
         Don't be stupid woman!

The woman drops her eyes. We see the Apprentice Doctor,
almost pitying the poor woman.

                   Apprentice DOCTOR
                (to woman)
         You won't have to worry. The
         Brotherhood will take him...

We are closer on the woman now. Tears begin to glisten in her
eyes as we drift closer to her.

                   Apprentice DOCTOR
                (continuing; off)
         ...raise him in the church, teach
         him. He's special. You should be
         proud. It's a blessing really,
         he'll want for nothing. Not like
         the rest of us?

We track in closer, closer, to the woman, then continue,
right into her eye, through the fluid, to see the room
reflected upside down at the back of the retina. This
dissolves to an upside view of...
                                                                  5




3 INT: HOSPITAL, OPERATION ROOM - DAY                         3

 POV, baby's view, in an operating theatre.

 Cut to

 The woman we saw earlier with the Genetic Doctor; she has
 just given birth. The baby is placed on linen blankets and
 cleaned by a nurse.

 A man now enters the operating theatre; we can tell the
 Doctor is uneasy. The man is dressed in a perfectly cut suit.
 He does not wear a surgical mask. His eyes are a piercingly
 clear light gray. He enters with two other men who look
 similar to him. By his side there is also a pristine boy;
 perhaps 8 years old, the same piercing eyes. They both
 approach the baby. The man stares serenely at the baby, all
 bloody, lying on blankets.

                     AUGUSTUS
           This is your brother Silus. You
           will teach him.

 The little boy then shares a glance with the woman who has
 just given birth. She seems to recognize the boy.

                     SILUS AS A BOY
           Is that my mother?

                     AUGUSTUS
           No, not any more.

 Augustus then leans forward and gently opens the baby's mouth.

 We see the baby close. In the otherwise baby-like mouth we
 see something strange. There are two tiny fangs protruding
 from the otherwise smooth gums.

 We see Augustus smile. In his mouth too, we see two perfectly
 pointed teeth.

                     AUGUSTUS
                  (continuing)
           Welcome to the world little
           Brother.

 Cut to

 We end close on the baby; its piercing eyes.

                                         DISSOLVE TO:
                                                                   6

  The title fades. Then another title appears.


               Queen's Imperial Winter Residence,

                        The Pacific Colony

                        100 years later

                                             DISSOLVE TO:


4A EXT: CITYSCAPE - NIGHT                                     4A

  We see a city, seething with smoke from coal fires, steam
  from engines, alien distorted Victorian spires are
  silhouetted against the moody, moonlit sky which is literally
  filled with dirigibles and strange flying machines that seem
  Victorian, of the industrial revolution, but that are also
  strangely futuristic. It is 1969, but not our 1969.


5 EXT: STREET - NIGHT                                         5

  A street. The look - of the film and the night - is silver,
  almost metallic moonlit skies. A hazy mist hangs in the air.
  Wet, steel pools of water on the dark footpath where a man
  stands. He stares up at a zeppelin passing overhead, its
  shadow obscuring him briefly until it passes away. Then we
  see him.

  The man is handsome, in a perfectly cut long wool jacket;
  dark gray. He wears perfectly shiny black shoes and we can
  see the surrounding street reflected in them; Victorian,
  Gothic buildings. This man is Silus. He surveys the street.
  While the houses are beautiful, they're run down.

  Silus - his eyes are the purest light gray you have ever
  seen - takes a long long inhale through his nose, his eyes
  closing briefly as if trying to sense/smell something. He
  stops the breath and opens his eyes. They are clear, full of
  purpose.

  He bends down to the footpath, runs his hand along its
  surface, almost caressing it. He closes his eyes. The camera
  moves in, to end close on Silus' ear. As this happens the
  soundtrack - all the noises in the night - become amplified.
  We see Silus' face, see him concentrating intently. We hear
  several individual noises. First a very quiet pitter patter.

Silus again; concentrating even more. Now the distant sound
of trickling water.

Cut to

A drain pipe, leaking.

Cut to

Silus once more. This time we can hear "plop, plop, plop."

Cut to

A pool of water. Then "plop" as a drop hits it. The drop is
not water. The drop is a red liquid, thick, now dispersing in
the water. And another drop, "plop." High speed CRANE UP from

this pool, up up the side of a building to end on a FACE in
the shadows. We can see reflective, gleaming eyes. And a
mouth, with blood dripping from it.

Cut to

Silus again. His eyes flicking open; we see the footpath
reflected in those perfect light gray eyes.

Music - brooding, ancient - begins to hum as Silus slowly
rises, as if his limbs have the power to make him float, so
perfect and powerful are they. A small smile has appeared on
his lips; it is the smile of a man who knows that something
very dark, something very dangerous, is close by.

Slowly his hand slips into his jacket. He holds it there,
watching, surveying the street immediately ahead of him for
the slightest movement. He sees it. On the wall of an old
Georgian Mansion across the road, a shape on the side of the
wall, almost imperceptible, hidden in the shadows and
brickwork. A CREATURE on the side of the wall.

Silus begins to move forward now, everything in perfect
shining silver slow motion. As he moves forward he pulls a
gun from his jacket - it is silver, organic and glass, art
nouveaux styling - and points it ahead of him as he glides
forward.

The creature on the wall senses the movement coming towards
it, moves a little and then, like a spider, scrambles along
the side of the wall, heading away from us.

Silus fires. A bullet of silver explodes from the gun, seems
almost to hang in the air for a moment, reflecting the moon
above, before hurtling at high speed towards its target.

The shell explodes the wall next to the creature, who stops
suddenly in the light so that we can see it.
                                                                 8



 A man. With reflective animal eyes and blood on his purple
 lips. And teeth; the teeth of a vampire. This creature
 immediately dives from the wall to the ground, just avoiding
 another two bullets that crash into the wall.

 LA as the man falls directly towards the camera.

 Silus now rushes forward, holding his gun out in front of
 him; he moves forward gracefully. He can see the man
 skillfully climbing up an adjacent derelict building. Silus
 tries to follow but his way is blocked by wire and fencing.
 He raises his gun towards the man once more, but he is gone.

 Close on Silus' enigmatic face. Those eyes. And in his mouth,
 two perfectly pointed fangs.

6 EXT: CAFE - NIGHT                                          6

 We are outside a cafe; the cafe is a warm glow against the
 cold night. We see past the fine falling rain - through the
 large glass window that has swirling silver art nouveaux
 designs lacing across it - to a table inside, by the window,
 where two pristinely dressed men sit.

 Cut to


7 INT: CAFE - NIGHT                                          7

 We are inside. Closer on the two men. One is SILUS. The other
 man is AUGUSTUS; the man we saw in the operation theatre
 before. Augustus has hardly aged at all.

                       AUGUSTUS
           The girl?

 We see Silus. He remembers.

8 INT: ROOM, FLASHBACK - NIGHT                               8

 Flashback from Silus' memory; a dead girl on a bed, blood
 splattered across her pillow.

 Cut to
                                                                  9




9 INT: CAFE - NIGHT                                           9

 Silus' face. Pull out to reveal we're back in the café.

                      SILUS

           It is taken care of.

                     AUGUSTUS
           This is good.

                     SILUS
           Augustus. We failed this girl. We
           asked her to help us catch him,
           and then we failed her.

                     AUGUSTUS
           Yes. But her death served a
           greater good. Every trap needs
           bait.

 Augustus lifts a beautifully designed glass and silver pipe
 from the onyx table at which they sit, then settles back into
 a fine hardwood chair. The chair's swirling, delicate back
 creeks as he takes a puff on the pipe.

                     AUGUSTUS
                  (continuing)
           Are you sure you won't join me?

 Silus shakes his head, no. The opium in the pipe crackles.

                     SILUS
           Perhaps this is beyond us. Perhaps
           we should inform the authorities.
           The human beings.

 Augustus places the pipe down, blows a smoke ring as a
 Chinese woman, dressed in a sarong, brings over two finely
 cut crystal glasses and sets them before the men, then
 leaves. Silus now lifts the glass and we see what it
 contains. Blood; dark and red and viscous. Silus takes a sip,
 then looks over to the bar.

 There is a young woman there, sitting at the bar, being
 treated with great care by several of the elegantly dressed
 patrons; the young woman laughs, enjoying the attention.
 Tubes run from the young woman's arms. These tubes carry her
 blood into a conch shaped glass bowl. We see the Chinese
 waitress fill another glass from the bowl.

 Silus watches, blood slightly present on his ashen lips. And
 we see two perfectly pointed fangs hanging in his mouth.

                     AUGUSTUS
           For now the Brothers feel we
           should deal with this ourselves.
                                                                  10




                      SILUS
            If they find out we are covering
            up these deaths...

                      AUGUSTUS
            Which is why you must find him.
            Silus.

  Silus now turns to Augustus, still looking unconvinced.

                      AUGUSTUS
                   (continuing)
            For centuries we Brothers have
            served mankind and them us. The
            great union. But remember your
            history. 300 years ago when our
            kind were first born into this
            world they burnt our children as
            monsters. They had no notion of
            evolution. In another world we
            might all have been slaughtered,
            only to be remembered in myth,
            monsters to frighten the young or
            a puzzle for anthropologists. We
            must refuse to let one aberrant
            individual destroy the balance
            between the two races. The old
            prejudices are still there. Human
            beings are paranoid creatures by
            nature.

                      SILUS
            Perhaps they have good reason.

                      AUGUSTUS
            Silus. Simply concern yourself
            with finding Edgar. Find your
            Brother so that we can help him.
            Before he kills again.

10 EXT: JAMESTOWN SLUM, STREET - DAY                        10

  Close up of a NEWSPAPER. On it we see a banner headline.
  "Influenza Vaccine Shortages lead to Black Market Trade." We
  pull out to reveal the paper is lying on a foot path. Wind
  blows the newspaper out of shot and we tilt up to the street.

  The street is wet, glistening. The rain, rain rain rain. The
  Edwardian and Victorian buildings of the street might seem
  beautiful, but they are not. They are largely derelict. We
  see a woman standing in a doorway out of the rain.
                                                                    11




  She is wrapped in a black plastic jacket that she pulls about
  her. A man approaches her.

                      JONES
            Everyone's ready Lilly.

                      LILLY
            About time.

  They both move to one of the tall buildings; a four story,
  ancient tenement that looks empty, almost derelict.

  They quietly move up the steps of the place and then pause.
  There is the bleep from a strange looking valve powered
  Walkie Talkie; hereafter called an RT.

                      LILLY
                   (continuing)
            On three gents. One, two...


11 INT: JAMESTOWN SLUM, TENEMENT, HALLWAY - DAY                11

  CRASH CUT to the door of the building swinging open wildly,
  a hand held camera on the shoulder of Lilly and Jones.

  A large, grubby looking woman stands in a long, grim hallway,
  mop in hand. At the far end of the hall another door
  disconnects from its hinges and collapses inwards, two men
  appearing out of the rain.

                      JONES
                   (to the woman)
            Don't you move!

  We see a gun in Jones' hand as he moves towards the woman,
  who has her hands up and is getting down on her knees.

  The camera then pans wildly, left and right. Then Lilly's
  foot kicks in a door to our right, revealing a dank office
  and a man, half naked, reaching for a gun. A woman is lying
  on a cot and she's screaming. She is instantly recognizable
  as a prostitute.

                      LILLY
                   (to the slum landlord)
            Don't you dare.

  From this POV we see Lilly's hand pointing a gun at the SLUM
  LANDLORD, who is now slowly easing back into the scummy
  office.

                        LILLY
                     (continuing)
            Jones!
                                                                   12




  We now finally cut to see Lilly. She is around 25; an
  intelligent, handsome 25. The man Jones appears at her
  shoulder, leering. Jones is the type of guy you just know
  will go to seed at 40. But that's still 10 years away. Jones
  stares at the Slum Landlord who is trying to cover himself.

                      JONES
            God help us. What an appalling
            sight.


12 INT: JAMESTOWN SLUM, TENEMENT, HALLWAY - LATER             12

  The hallway again. The other two men we saw entering at the
  beginning are talking to the woman with the mop. One of the
  men is taking notes.

  We pan to the office, to see Lilly and Jones standing before
  the Slum Landlord, who is now wrapped in a towel and sitting
  in a chair.

                      SLUM LANDLORD
            I don't know nothing about it. I
            give 'em out. Make sure everyone
            gets 'em.

                      JONES
            That's a lie! We know you've been
            trading influenza vaccine in the
            workhouses!

  Another man now approaches Lilly.

                      FRANK
            Lil'. I think you should see this.


13 INT: JAMESTOWN SLUM, TENEMENT, HALLWAY - CONTINUING        13

  Halfway down the hall there is a door, Frank opens it
  displaying a set of stairs leading down.

                      FRANK
            I'd use the mask if I were you.

  Lilly pulls a dark surgical-type mask over her face, then
  slowly moves down the steps into the oblivion below.


14 INT: JAMESTOWN SLUM, TENEMENT BASEMENT - CONTINUING        14

  Cut between Lilly's POV and her face, her eyes glimmering in
  the sub-light as she moves down the stairs very carefully.
                                                                    13




  And finally the horror is revealed. In this basement there
  are 10 or 12 people, lying on the floor. Most of them are
  silent, but a couple moan. One, a woman, pleads to Lilly.

                      WOMAN IN THE BASEMENT
            Help me. Please help.

  The woman extends her arm. It is covered in sweat; grimy. The
  glands at the side of the woman's neck are distended and
  swollen, her eyes bloodshot.

                      WOMAN IN THE BASEMENT
                   (continuing)
            Please. I'm sick. Please.

  The room is a version of hell. Lilly's eyes glisten.

15 INT: JAMESTOWN SLUM, TENEMENT OFFICE - CONTINUING           15

  Jones has the Slum Landlord by the throat.

                      JONES
            You're a fucking liar!

                      SLUM LANDLORD
            No, no, I swear it, I gave 'em
            their boosters, both of 'em. I'm
            a responsible landlord, I swear to
            god. There must've been something
            wrong with them vaccines.

  Lilly stares at the Slum Landlord; shock in her face, and
  anger.

                      JONES
            This is a civil health violation!
            You're going to the hell house for
            this. You can forget lovely Doris
            here where you're going.

  We see the woman who was screaming before, the prostitute;
  she makes an obscene gesture at Jones. As this is going on
  Frank and the other man we've seen are tearing the place
  apart, looking for something. They don't find it and Frank's
  look tells Lilly so.

  Lilly's face is a mask. She is watching the Slum Landlord
  very carefully. He keeps looking down; strangely, nervously.
                                                                14




                   SLUM LANDLORD
         I don't know what you're on about.
         I've done nothing, I swear to god,
         I've done nothing.

Lilly lets her eyes drift down, all the way down to the chair
legs, which rock unevenly on the floor. Lilly is staring at
the scratched, worn floor boards which MOVE.

Cut to

Frank, prizing back the floor boards. Jones restrains the
Slum Landlord. Lilly watches. Frank pulls the floor boards
away easily. We see that hidden in the floor cavity are
packets of something. Frank pulls them out.

Rips one of the plastic bags open. In it are packets with the
words "Jamestown Borough - Civilian Influenza Vaccination."
Frank holds it up for Lilly to see.

The Slum Landlord is now looking three ways at once.

Lilly slowly begins to approach the Slum Landlord.

                   LILLY
         It is my pleasure to inform you
         that you are under arrest for
         trafficking influenza vaccine.

                   SLUM LANDLORD
         I want my lawyer.

                   LILLY
         This is a violation of the 12/10
         health act, whereby you have
         withheld borough sponsored
         vaccines from your tenants.

                   SLUM LANDLORD
         I want a lawyer!

                   LILLY
         Anything you say will be held
         against you as evidence and, by
         endangering the public good, you
         are not entitled to a lawyer.

The Slum Landlord just stares at her.

                   SLUM LANDLORD
         Fuck you then.

Lilly smiles grimly.
                                                                    15




                       LILLY
             There's only one other thing.

  Lilly gives the Slum Landlord one almighty slap across the
  face that stuns him. Then Jones grabs the Slum Landlord and
  drags him off, but we stay on Lilly. Her face. She stoops and
  lifts something from the landlords desk. A public health
  flier saying "Fight Influenza. Ask your landlord for your
  free vaccine now." Then from the corner of the room, the
  prostitute pipes up, impatiently waving a cigarette at Lilly.

                       PROSTITUTE
             Oi! How about me? He promised me
             some of that. I earned it.

17 INT: POLICE CAR - TWILIGHT                                  17

  Jones is in front, Frank is driving. The car has come to a
  lurching halt. Some kind of cart is blocking the road.

                       FRANK
                    (hitting the horn)
             Come one!

  Jones is eating some kind of pie that is an affront to
  culinary art.

                       JONES
             Lil', you want some?

  Ensconced in the back Lilly shakes her head, no.

                       LILLY
             Smells terrible.

  She is watching the patterns of street lights that play and
  flow over the wet windows of the car. Jones shrugs.

                       JONES
             I'm not letting that scum put me
             off my food. That'd be like a
             moral victory.

                       LILLY
             I'll get out here.

                         FRANK
             You sure?

                    (continuing)
             What's up with her?

   Jones watches Lilly move off; something like compassion
   crosses his features.

                       FRANK
                    (continuing)
             Jones? Is she alright?

                       JONES
             Yeah. Lilly's kid. It died of the
             influenza, didn't it.

                       FRANK
             She's never said anything about a
             kid.

                       JONES
             No. She never says anything.

   Jones stares after Lilly, then starts chomping into his food.


18 EXT: SUBWAY STATION - CONTINUING                             18

   The police car pulls out leaving Lilly outside the subway
   station. Lilly looks exhausted, breathes in deeply. Above,
   power lines blow in the wind and rain and make a clacking
   sound. She moves off and we crane up to see the seething
   smoky city beyond.

20 INT: LILLY'S APARTMENT - NIGHT                               20

   Lilly enters her apartment. It's nice; not opulent, but a
   haven of sorts.

   She stands for a moment in the empty hallway. We see a hall,
   several doors run off it.


20A INT: LILLY'S APARTMENT, CHILDS BEDROOM - CONTINUING         20A

   Lilly approaches a room and we see inside it. It is empty
   apart from a stripped bed and some boxes.

   Lilly flips the lid on one of the boxes. She picks up a toy;
   a pink fairy princess with wings, the paint on its face worn.
                                                                    17




  Lilly winds a key and the wings of the doll flutter,
  accompanied by the whining sound of the internal mechanics.

  We see Lilly's face as she stares at the doll. Emotion fights
  to claw its way out from under her skin, but she doesn't let
  it.

  Then in the distance we hear a child's cries. It almost
  sounds like memories wafting through the air, but the
  stamping of feet from the apartment above makes it plain that
  the noises come from there; the sound of children playing.

21 INT: LILLY'S APARTMENT, BEDROOM - NIGHT                     21

  Lilly enters her bedroom. The place is a mess. She sits on
  the bed. She picks up a framed photo which sits on a
  sideboard next to the bed. It shows Lilly, a man - Lilly's
  age - and a child of 5 years who looks a lot like Lilly. She
  stares at the child. We hear the sound of rain pounding
  against the window of the bedroom.


22 EXT: LILLY'S APARTMENT, BEDROOM - NIGHT                     22

  Pull out to reveal the exterior window. We can see through
  the window into Lilly's apartment again, see Lilly lying
  down, hugging the photo. The rain has become a light mist.


23 EXT: JAMESTOWN SLUM, STREET - NIGHT                         23

  We are close on a poster. It shows a perfect face, serenely
  beaming out; it could be Silus or Augustus, except this man
  is dressed in religious regalia, like a priest. The poster
  says "The Brotherhood loves you. You are divine." We begin to
  crane off the poster which is revealed to be stuck on a lamp
  post. The street is seething, the slums of Jamestown.

  A young boy, perhaps seven; spiked up hair, face
  covered in grime, grime from dragging himself up in this
  hellish place. He carries a bag filled with the detritus he's
  picked from the rubbish bins of the rich. He wears a
  distinctive red t-shirt that is several sizes too big. He
  moves along the street, avoiding a disinterested passersby.
  As he passes an alley he hears something. An animal-like
  growl. He stops.

  Down the alley he can see two figures. One is a male. He is
  clutching another clothed figure; female.

                      KID
            Hey?! Hey!
                                                                    18




  At that instant the man turns to the boy. There, half seen in
  the slick shadows, the most piercing eyes, a bloody mouth,
  with fangs, hissing. The creature drops the woman and scales
  the sheer wall of the alleyway; clutching various handholds,
  up four flights, then gone.

  The kid, frightened, now makes to run off but bangs into a
  passerby. The man grabs the kid roughly.

                      MAN IN THE STREET
            Where are you going in such a
            hurry my little ruffian? Pilfering
            by the look of you?

  The kid struggles and the Man now sees the shape of the woman
  in the alleyway, slumped to the ground.

                      MAN IN THE STREET
                   (continuing)
            What's going on here? What'd you
            do to her?

                      KID
            Don't, I didn't do nothing. It was
            a Brother. It was a Brother did it.

  The man moves forward, dragging the kid. And he sees the
  woman there, deathly white in the alley. Dead eyes staring.

                      MAN IN THE STREET
            Oh dear god...

24 INT: NATURAL HISTORY MUSEUM - DAY                           24

  We track past a sign that says "Museum of Spiritual Selection
  and Alchemistry." In the distance we can see a group of
  people in the hazy light.

  Cut to

  Augustus - the man we saw with Silus earlier - sitting on a
  chair surrounded by various objects. At his feet are a gaggle
  of school children, aged around ten; affluent looking, human.
  Augustus points to a strange, ancient looking glass apparatus.

                      AUGUSTUS
            300 years ago, with these simple
            instruments, the alchemist
            Guiseppi De Angelo discovered what
            we today call genetic science.
                                                                 19




                      AUGUSTUS
                   (continuing)
            He deciphered that the Brothers
            were a new race of beings, sent by
            god, to serve and protect you.

  We see the faces of the children, rapt.

                      AUGUSTUS
                   (continuing)
            De Angelo formed the church of the
            Brotherhood. He was a great great
            man, but there were others, bad
            men, who took what De Angelo had
            discovered and experimented
            without concern for the results.
            The science of genetics and all
            its power has been banned ever
            since. Who can tell me what came
            from these bad experiments?

  One child puts his hand up. Behind the child, in the
  distance, Augustus now sees Silus approaching; Silus
  obviously wants to talk to Augustus. Augustus points to the
  child while looking at Silus.

                      AUGUSTUS
                   (continuing)
            Yes.

                      CHILD
            All the bad things. Like bad germs
            and flu.

  Augustus nods, watching Silus' ominous expression.

                      AUGUSTUS
            Yes. That's right.

  Augustus looks at the child and tries to smile.

                      AUGUSTUS
                   (continuing)
            All the bad things.


25 EXT: SLUM, STREET - DAY                                  25

  The streets are wet. High above several large Zeppelins plod
  across the sky. We crane down to street level to find a
  police car pulling up through the steam. Lilly gets out,
  Jones beside her, wolfing down another bun.
                                                                    20




  There are cops everywhere. An alleyway is cordoned off. The
  dwellers of the slum have floated up and are baying like
  wolves, hassling the cops; some yell obscenities, generally
  along the lines of "where's the police when you need them?"
  Jones stares at the people.

                      JONES
            Someone should flatten this
            cesspool and start again.

  Lilly and Jones move towards the police cordon. Immediately
  a reporter accosts them.

                      STREET REPORTER
            Marm? The Tribune. Do you have any
            comments on the death?

                      LILLY
            No.

                      STREET REPORTER
            They're saying it was a Brother,
            is that true?

  Lilly stares at the reporter, pauses for thought. She
  whistles to one of the cops nearby, who then approaches.

                      LILLY
            Arrest her.

  Jones and Lilly push past as the reporter protests at being
  manhandled.

                      LILLY
                   (continuing; to Jones)
            Find any witnesses and shut them
            up.

  Jones nods and moves over to a policeman guarding the alley.
  Lilly ducks under the crime scene tape, moving into the alley.


26 INT: JAMESTOWN SLUM, ALLEYWAY - DAY                         26

  The alleyway is full of forensics personnel. Lilly moves
  deeper into the alleyway. We see her POV moving forward,
  finally revealing the body of the young woman who is
  surrounded by various forensics staff. Lilly talks to one.

                      LILLY
            Can I step in?

                      FORENSIC GUY
            With the traffic. What's it matter.
                                                               21




Lilly moves forward. She can now see the woman more clearly.
The woman is obviously dead; her pale white skin like wet
shining alabaster in the dark alley. Flashes from
photographic machines light the scene, almost blinding Lilly
and briefly revealing the true horror of the scene.

Lilly kneels and carefully begins to examine the body.

Another man now walks up and kneels next to Lilly; young,
good looking, obviously takes pride in himself.

                     DOMINIC
         Lil'.

                   LILLY
         Hello Dominic.

                   DOMINIC
         Have you seen it?

Dominic bends down and moves the dead woman's head,
displaying the side of her neck. A bite has torn the skin on
the side of her neck. The wound extends down, the carotid
artery sliced in two.

                   DOMINIC
                (continuing)
         It's a bite. If you know what I
         mean?

Lilly nods, then looks down at the woman's dead, cockeyed
stare. Lilly closes the woman's eyes.

                   LILLY
         Any identification?

She is passed a bloody ID. Lilly stares at it.

                   LILLY
                (continuing)
         Tanya Garfield.

Jones now arrives.

                   JONES
                (to forensics team)
         Where do you get a cup of tea
         around here?

No one answers. Jones shrugs.

                   JONES
                (continuing)
         There's a kid who saw it, down
         there.
                                                               22




Lilly sees the red shirted street urchin in the distance
being talked to by two uniformed policemen.

                   JONES
                (continuing)
         Says it was a Brother. And they've
         got another fellow, that's all who
         saw it.

Lilly nods.

                   LILLY
         Alright, we'll close this down
         gents. None of you are to say a
         word, not even to your old mother.

All the police officers stare at her; they know what she
means alright.

                   LILLY
                (continuing)
         Jones. Make sure.

Jones shrugs and nods. Lilly gets up and moves towards the
street kid who is being talked to by two burly, grumpy
policemen. The boy is shaking.

                   LILLY
                (continuing)
         He saw what happened?

                   POLICEMAN 1
         Now he wont talk. Didn't see
         anything.

Lilly looks at the boy. So young.

                   LILLY
         What's your name?

The kid doesn't answer and gets a whack around the ears from
one of the policemen.

                   LILLY
                (continuing; to the
                 policeman)
         Stop that.

Lilly stares at the kid, as if the way he looks has keyed a
memory in her. She squats and looks him straight in the eye.

                   LILLY
                (continuing)
         What's your name then?
                                                               23




                   KID
                (nervous)
         Albert.

                   LILLY
         You live around here?

The kid looks nervous. Lilly moves some of the bedraggled
hair out of the kid's eyes.

                   LILLY
                (continuing)
         I grew up 3 streets from here.
         Matheson Lane. The Skrummers
         Workhouse.

                   KID
                (surprised)
         You did?

                   LILLY
         Or should I say, I crawled out of
         here.

The kid smiles. Lilly focuses on him now.

                   LILLY
                (continuing)
         No one else will do anything about
         this, you know? They just think
         this is a slum. No one really
         cares what happens to the people
         here. Except for you. And me.

The kid stares at her; she's a magician and he's a believer.

                   LILLY
                (continuing)
         What did you see?

                   KID
         A man.

                   LILLY
         What kind of man?

                   KID
         A Brother.

                   LILLY
         You're sure it was a Brother?

                   KID
         He had teeth and everything.
                                                                    24




                      LILLY
            Where did he go?

  The kid turns and points to the shear wall of the alley.

                      KID
            He went straight up there.

  Lilly stares at the wall.

                      LILLY
            Alright, you go with these men,
            they'll look after you. I promise.

  She rises.

                      LILLY
                   (continuing; to the
                    Policemen)
            Get him to describe it all. And
            keep him away from everyone.

  The Policemen grunt and begin to lead the kid off.

                      LILLY
                   (continuing; to the
                    Policemen)
            And get him some food.

  Jones, now standing next to Lilly, moans.

                      JONES
            Now they'll all want feeding.

  Lilly looks at Jones's callous face; she's not amused.

  Cut to


27 EXT: JAMESTOWN SLUM, BUILDING ABOVE ALLEYWAY - CONTINUING   27

  High angle POV of Lilly and Jones moving off. Someone is
  watching them from the roof above. The POV belongs to Silus,
  who stares down at them. In particular he watches Lilly. We
  see Lilly pause and then look up as if feeling she's watched.

  We see Lilly's POV of the building above. There is no one
  there.

  HA of Lilly looking up.

28 INT: POLICE STATION, HOWARD ANDERSON'S OFFICE - LATER      28

  A device flies toward the camera, sharp needles eject from it
  slamming into skin.

  Seated at the desk is a harassed, balding man (ANDERSON)of
  about 55. He's just finished vaccinating himself, wincing at
  the needle jabs on the soft skin of his arm. There are many
  other needle marks on his skin.

                        LILLY
                     (off)
              I've quarantined the neighborhood.

  Lilly stands before the man's large desk, which is lit by
  only a desk lamp.

                        LILLY
                     (continuing)
              As far as anyone knows we have a
              new influenza outbreak.

                        ANDERSON
              What about the telephonic
              companies?

                        LILLY
              They're cooperating, closing all
              phone lines in and out except
              directly to us.

  Anderson nods.

                          ANDERSON
              Sit, sit.

  She does.

                        ANDERSON
                     (continuing)
              You've done well Lilly. The
              reporter is more of a problem. We
              have 2 days by law before we have
              to release her. Then it's out.

  Anderson lays down the medi kit and stares at it as he
  motions for her to sit. She does.

                        ANDERSON
                     (continuing)
              I hate these things. I'm like a
              pin cushion.

                        LILLY
              It's better than the alternative,
              sir.
                                                                  26




  Anderson stares at her; a moment of tension.

                      ANDERSON
            I need you to stay with this,
            Lilly. You know Jamestown better
            than anyone, how to handle the
            people.

  Lilly acknowledges the compliment.

                      ANDERSON
                   (continuing)
            The Brothers have requested to be
            involved with the investigation.

                      LILLY
            That's nice for them.

                      ANDERSON
            You have a problem with it?

                      LILLY
            Not particularly.

                      ANDERSON
            Good. I think they can help. And
            I don't want someone working on
            this whose got something against
            the Church.

                      LILLY
            How do you know I don't?

                      ANDERSON
            Lilly, you're the least prejudiced
            person I know. In fact, you're the
            only one I know. That's important.
            The church is powerful, but more
            than that, people's faith in the
            Brotherhood is about all they've
            got these days. And the government
            knows it. Even the Queen herself
            is involved. This is political.

29 INT: POLICE STATION, COMMUNAL OFFICE - DAY               29

  Lilly enters, drinking a coffee. She begins to top it up from
  the coffee stand when Jones comes up to her.

                      JONES
            Lil'. He's here.
                                                                    27




  Lilly's expression becomes taut. She peers towards her
  office. She can clearly see an exceptionally well dressed man
  in her office with his back to us. It is Silus. A young
  female cop - Steph - is in there and we can see her kissing
  a ring on Silus' hand and Silus placing his hand on her head
  as if blessing her.

  Steph then exits the office and approaches Lilly and Jones;
  her face is flushed with excitement.

                      STEPH
            Do you know who he is? That's
            Brother Silus. They say one day he
            will lead the Brotherhood. He's a
            great man.

                      JONES
            I think I hear choir music.

  Steph flashes Jones a resentful look.

                      STEPH
            Do you respect anything?

                      JONES
            Hey. My old mum goes to church
            four times a week and gives blood.
            She's happy as a lark. Just don't
            expect me to kiss him, that's all
            I'm telling you.

30 INT: POLICE STATION, LILLY'S OFFICE - CONTINUOUS            30

  Close on the enigmatic ring on Silus' finger.

  We see Lilly is seated on one side of her desk, Silus on the
  other. Lilly is staring at the ring, then she studies a
  Photostat in front of her. There is a picture of a man, a
  rather perfect looking man.

                      LILLY
            Senior Brother Edgar... How long
            have you known about this?

  Silus opposite Lilly, his perfect, serene appearance an
  anathema in the grunge of the Jamestown police station. He
  watches her very carefully, listens to the way her finger
  taps the sheet in front of her, the sound of her chair
  swiveling, all the sounds very acute to him; she has a
  physical ease about her.
                                                                28




                   SILUS
         A matter of weeks.

Lilly smiles.

                   SILUS
                (continuing)
         Is there something wrong?

Lilly stops smiling. For the first time she is still.

                   LILLY
         Yes. Withholding evidence.
         Covering up two murders. And no
         one's worried. If me or one of the
         people in Jamestown did that
         they'd be in the hell house with
         the key thrown away. It seems the
         church is able to do whatever it
         wants.

Silus nods.

                   SILUS
         You're right to not like it. It is
         political.

Lilly becomes more interested at this; at the bald honesty of
the statement.

                   SILUS
                (continuing)
         We thought we could find Brother
         Edgar ourselves. We were wrong.
         But now any debate is pointless.

Lilly stares at him. There is already something between them
even though they stand on opposite sides of a huge gulf. She
nods, accepting his point.

                   SILUS
                (continuing)
         The greatest danger is if this
         were to become public knowledge.

                   LILLY
         Wouldn't want anyone criticizing
         the church I suppose.

                   SILUS
         It's more than that Captain. This
         is about prejudice, or rather the
         nature of it. As a female surely
         you would understand.
                                                                 29




                      LILLY
            Really.

                      SILUS
            How many other Captains in this
            borough are female?

                      LILLY
            None?

                      SILUS
            How are your actions judged, the
            same or differently from the men.

  Lilly stares at Silus; he is an incredible being.

                      LILLY
            Differently.

                      SILUS
            Exactly. If a white man kills,
            then he is just a killer. If a
            black man kills, then all black
            men are suspect. That is the
            nature of prejudice. Those who are
            different are grouped together. If
            only one Brother does a bad thing
            then all Brothers are suspect,
            because we are different. And then
            what would this world be like, if
            there was no hope?

  Lilly nods, acknowledging the truth of it.

                      LILLY
            Alright then. So what do you
            suggest?

                      SILUS
            First, there is something you
            should hear.

  Cut to


31 INT: POLICE STATION, BRIEFING ROOM - LATER               31

  Scummy, large briefing room. There are seven cops in here,
  perched on desks and chairs. Jones, Dominic, Frank plus four
  others. Lilly is also there. So is Silus, sitting, perfectly
  still, calm. Several of the cops look at him suspiciously.
                                                                30




                   LILLY
         Ok, ok, quiet down.

Everyone nods and shuts up as Lilly stands in front of the
men.

                   LILLY
                (continuing)
         Gentlemen, there's no other way to
         put it. We have only 2 days to
         find the suspect.

There are guffaws from most of the policemen.

                   JONES
         There's no chance. Not a hope in
         hell.

                   FRANK
         He's right. We don't even know
         where to begin.

                   LILLY
         Quiet!

Lilly is angry. There is silence in the room. Lilly seems
more angry than she should be.

                   LILLY
                (continuing)
         What you are about to hear will
         not leave this room. Everyone
         understand? Jones?

Jones shrugs.

                   LILLY
                (continuing)
         I would suggest anyone with a weak
         stomach leave now.

No one moves. They all stare at Lilly.

                   LILLY
                (continuing)
         This is Brother Silus.

She motions to Silus, who rises, watching the glares from the
cops who eye him like a suspect.

                   SILUS
         Thank you Captain. Could we have
         the plate?
                                                                31




An old slide projector heats up as the main lights are turned
off. The projector sprays an image up on the wall. The face
of a killer, before he became one, the serene gaze of a
Brother.

                   SILUS
                (continuing)
         Senior Brother Edgar. Until 3
         weeks ago, he was a trusted and
         talented theologian and scientist.

                   DOMINIC
         What'd he do?

                   SILUS
         He was personally responsible for
         developing the most recent
         influenza antivirals. It is
         because of him that most of you
         are alive today. His behavior
         appeared normal. Next.

3 photos come up. The victims.

                   SILUS
                (continuing)
         The victims. John Anderson. Julie
         Danes. Tanya Garfield. All in
         their early 20's, but beyond that
         no obvious connection. Next.

A Map.

                   SILUS
                (continuing)
         There is no precedent for Brother
         Edgar's behavior. No Brother has
         ever taken a human life, not in
         the 300 years since we began. Not
         one. Our role has been to preserve
         and maintain the human life. Not
         take it.

                   JONES
         Next he'll be wanting an fucking
         medal.

Silus stares directly at Jones now. Their eyes lock. Silus
continues, perfectly calm.

                   SILUS
         What I am saying to you is that
         Brother Edgar's behavior is
         aberrant. We
                                                                32

                        SILUS
                        (cont)
         don't understand it. And therefore
         it's difficult to predict. The
         only thing we know is where he
         will strike next.

                   DOMINIC
         How do you know?

Silus moves to the desk next to him. He passes something to
another cop who now sits at the desk. We see Lilly now. The
look on her face tells us that she knows what is coming and
she's not looking forward to it.

We see what Silus gave the cop. An audio tape. The cop places
the tape in a tape deck. He then switches it on. He then
turns the volume knob on an amplifier which now directs
static hiss to two big speakers.

We see the faces of the cops, all listening in the dim light
coming from the slide projector.

Above the level of the hissing tape there is another noise.
It is a wet sound. Like a cat would make if it were lapping
up milk. An another sound. Like an animal, moaning with
pleasure.

We see the cops; some of them are beginning to twig. And
there is another noise. It is a man; moaning.

                   MAN ON THE TAPE
                (off)
         Please. Please don't hurt me.

We see Jones and Dominic. Their glares say it all. And then
another voice.

                     EDGAR
                  (off, like to a lover)
         Quiet.

                   MAN ON THE TAPE
                (off)
         Please...

                   EDGAR
                (off)
         I said shut up!

Then we hear a punch and then noises which can only be
described as sounding like a dog killing something.

Jones springs out of his seat.
                                                                33




                   JONES
         Fuck!

                   LILLY
         Jones, sit down.

                   JONES
         Why are we listening to this?!

                   LILLY
         Quiet!

Jones stands there enraged. Dominic pulls him down back into
his chair. All the cops are appalled by what they have heard.
And then a voice.

                   EDGAR
                (off)
         Good. Now you're quiet.

We can hear Edgar moving around.

                   EDGAR
                (continuing; off)
         Did you hear that Silus? I hope so.

We see Silus, listening as intently as everyone else.

                   EDGAR
                (continuing; off)
         The next one will be tomorrow.
         There is a square, Bridge Square
         it's called. I will take the next
         one from there. You should try
         harder this time. Please try
         harder...

More moving around, then the sound on the tape cuts out. We
are left with only tape hiss. Everyone stares at Silus.

                   FRANK
         He sent this to you. Specifically.

                   SILUS
         We share the same mother. There is
         a bond.

The cops all stare at Silus' emotionless response.

                   LILLY
         There will be two teams. Frank, I
         want you and Abernathy up in the
         buildings around Bridge Square.

Frank nods.
                                                                   34




                      LILLY
                   (continuing)
            I'll lead the other team with
            Dominic, Jones and Queen's
            Imperial Guard in support. No
            guns, batons only.

                        JONES
            What?

                      LILLY
            You heard me. He's to be taken
            alive.


32 EXT: JAMESTOWN, BRIDGE SQUARE - NIGHT                      32

  It has rained. The small square is dimly lit. At it's center
  is a small park with distorted trees. And a rundown
  playground. A rusty swing creaks. We see a figure there. It
  is Lilly. She watches the rusty swing creak. Then she looks
  up to the surrounding buildings.

  We tilt up to one of the buildings which is perhaps eight
  stories high; like the others around the square it is an
  apartment building. There is movement at the very top.

  Cut to


33 EXT: JAMESTOWN, BRIDGE SQUARE, ROOF - NIGHT                33

  POV from the top of the building, observing Lilly below enter
  a black, unmarked van. Then there is buzz from an RT. We
  reveal POV belongs to Silus.

                        SILUS
            Yes.


34 INT: POLICE VAN - NIGHT                                    34

  Lilly is in a police van. Jones and Dominic are there with
  her; both of them trying to come to grips with the strange
  stun weapons they've been given. And there are three huge,
  dark eyed soldiers there, dressed in the ominous black
  uniform of the Queen's Imperial Guard, cocking their electric
  batons; which fizz in the half light.

                        LILLY
            Anything?

  We cut between Lilly in the van and Silus on the roof.
                                                                 35




                      SILUS
            No.

  Silus surveys the scene. He can see an Imperial Guard sniper
  over the square on the roof of a building. Below, in the
  street, we can see the silhouettes of several Brothers;
  unmoving, watchful sentinels.

                      LILLY
            It's getting late.

                      SILUS
            He will come.

                      LILLY
            Ok. We'll sit tight.

  Lilly closes the com. Jones is staring at her.

                      JONES
            This is a dud.

  Lilly ignores Jones and talks into the RT again.

                      LILLY
            Frank?

  Cut to


35 INT: APARTMENT BUILDING, BRIDGE SQUARE - NIGHT           35

  Frank is inspecting a stairwell of the building. He has
  Abernathy with him. He talks into his RT.

                      FRANK
            Yeah Lil'.

                      LILLY
                   (off)
            Anything?

                      FRANK
            Not a thing.

                      LILLY
                   (off)
            Check each floor again.

  Frank motions to Abernathy, who is already sighing.
                                                                    36




                      FRANK
            You heard her. Once more for the
            empire.

  Low Angle from the floor of the two men beginning to climb
  the stairs, their guns out.

  The shot stays where it is. We can see the stairs and the
  wall. We pause. The soundtrack is almost dead quiet, apart
  from the buzzing flouro above us. And then the CAMERA begins
  to advance, like a POV, heading for the wall ahead. It
  reaches the corner and then advances along cables running up
  to the roof. As it climbs we can see a ventilation shaft in
  the corner with no grill. The camera approaches it and moves
  into the shaft, continuous.


36 INT: APARTMENT BUILDING, VENTILATION SHAFT - CONTINUOUS     36

  The shot continues to track through the man-sized shaft. As
  we move through the shaft - turning corners, going up
  floors - we pass grills. Some of them show light coming from
  the apartments within. We can hear an argument in one room.
  A crying child in the next. A TV blaring in another (playing
  porno). But mostly the rooms are dark. And as we move up and
  along, there is a scuttling NOISE, growing louder, as if we
  are approaching it.

  Then the NOISE stops.

  The camera halts, stares down the long ventilation shaft.
  Silence. Dead silence. The camera starts to move again and
  then turns a corner to run into the leering face of Edgar,
  the vampire, his teeth bared, his eyes reflecting in the half
  light. Then he smiles.

                      EDGAR
            Shoo.

  Cut to

  A rat, staring back at Edgar. The rat turns and streaks off
  back whence it came.

  A slight smile appears on Edgar's face; a smile that can
  chill the blood in your veins.

  Then he begins to move forward. We hear his breathing; low,
  but excited. He moves with the precision and strength of an
  insect. His eyes glisten and reflect light like an animal's.
  His skin is flesh white and milky in the metal shaft.

  Cut to
                                                                    37




  His POV approaching a grill. A subdued light comes through
  it. The POV approaches and sees into the apartment below.


37 INT: ROOM, SAME BUILDING - NIGHT                            37

  A woman, around 20, attractive, brushing her hair. She has
  just had a shower. She sits.

  Cut to

  The shaft. We see Edgar's hand enter shot. His hand grips the
  bottom of the grill and tries to open it. It doesn't budge.

  Cut to

  Inside the room, the woman turns and looks up at the grill.
  She thinks she's heard something. She stares; waits. She gets
  up and moves towards the grill high above on the wall. She
  places a chair under it, then gets up on it, standing on tip
  toes, trying to see if there's anything behind the grill. Her
  hand reaches out and tries the grill, to see if it's secure.

  Then she leans closer to it. Her face pressed right up
  against it. Closer. Closer.

  Cut to

  Edgar's white face, lurching into shot. Staring, staring.

  Cut to

  His POV. He is now looking through a different grill. This
  time there is a young man inside an apartment. Doing
  exercises.

  Edgar watches. And again that chilling smile.

  We see the man again, who gets up and preens himself in front
  of a mirror.

  Close on Edgar's eyes, devouring the sight of this pumped up
  flesh. The young man exits the room, going into a bathroom.

  We see Edgar's hand trying to open the grill. It moves.

  Cut to


38 INT: APARTMENT BUILDING, HALL - NIGHT                       38

  Frank and Abernathy are on fifth floor, finishing a sweep of
  it. As they move they hear a CRASH. They stop. Then another
  crash, coming from the floor up. Then a SCREAM.
                                                                      38




   They look at each other, then begin to run to the stairwell,
   as Frank talks into his RT.

                       FRANK
             Lil'! Lil'!

             Frank.

                       FRANK
                    (off)
             He's on the sixth floor! He's on
             the sixth floor!

                         LILLY
             Let's go.

   Everyone fires into action and begins to exit the van.


39 EXT: JAMESTOWN, BRIDGE SQUARE, ROOF - NIGHT                  39

   Silus watches from his vantage point. He can see Lilly and
   her team below rushing into the building adjacent to him. And
   then he sees, through one of the windows on the sixth floor,
   the flashes of gunfire.

   Cut to


40 INT: APARTMENT BUILDING, STAIR WELL - NIGHT                  40

   Handheld camera with Lilly and her crew rushing up the

42 INT: APARTMENT BUILDING, BRIDGE SQUARE, HALL - NIGHT         42

   Lilly and her crew entering the hall. They are confronted
   with a view of the long hall. Halfway down there is a door
   with blood smeared on it. We can see Abernathy, lying in a
   pool of blood outside the door.
                                                                    39




  The cops stop. A door opens close to them. A large greasy man
  pokes his head out the door and gets the cops guns on him
  immediately. Lilly motions with her hand.

                      LILLY
                   (whispering)
            Police. Get back inside. Get back.

  The man returns and closes the door. The Imperial Guards now
  swing into action. They move forward towards the room, to the
  closed door. Lilly and her crew follow. The Imperial Guards
  get ready outside the door batons ready. One of them motions
  for Lilly and her crew to wait. Jones is nearest them. He
  goes down on one knee. Dominic moves past them and positions
  himself on the other side.

  Lilly kneels where she is.

  Beat.

  Then the Imperial Guards kick open the door and enter.

  Lilly waits, watching. There's no sound. Dominic begins to
  move forward, then enter the door to the apartment, his baton
  raised. Jones now moves forward, keeping his eyes on the
  door. There is no sound coming from the room.

  Cut to

  Lilly, kneeling in the hall. Also staring at the door. Too
  late to realize the door next to her is opening. Before she
  can react, she's staring into the face of Edgar; the eyes,
  the bloody mouth. Edgar is on her in an instant, moving with
  ferocious speed, whipping her like a rag doll into the room.

  Meanwhile Jones is edging towards the room Dominic entered.

  Cut to


43 INT: APARTMENT BUILDING, BRIDGE SQUARE, ROOM - NIGHT        43

  Lilly, trapped, held by Edgar, who stares at her. Then, in
  one swift movement, he lurches down, tearing her neck with
  his teeth. She cries out.


44 INT: APARTMENT BUILDING, BRIDGE SQUARE, HALL - NIGHT        44

  In the hall, Jones is looking into the room Dominic went
  into. The lights come on. The room is empty. Just the cops
  and Frank's bloody corpse on the floor.

                      JONES
            Lil'.
                                                                   40




  Jones turns to see Lilly, but she's not there. The hallway is
  empty. He sees the door Lilly was pulled through. Then looks
  down. Blood is seeping from under the door.

                        JONES
                     (continuing)
            Fuck!

  Cut to


45 INT: APARTMENT BUILDING, BRIDGE SQUARE, ROOM - NIGHT       45

  Lilly being embraced by Edgar, she can't do anything. Then a
  loud crash on the door, as if someone is trying to break in.
  Edgar stops feeding, stares at Lilly.

  Beat.

                      EDGAR
            You're so strong.

  Then another crash on the door. Edgar drops Lilly. He propels
  himself towards a ventilation grill on the wall.

  Cut to

  Jones and the cops kicking the door in. It swings open to
  show Lilly on the floor. Jones stoops down.

                       JONES
            Lilly!

  Jones gets close to Lilly, starts squeezing the side of her
  neck, trying to stop the arterial blood from squirting her
  life away.

                      JONES
                   (continuing)
            Oh shit shit.

  Dominic enters and sees the scene. He yells into his RT.

                      DOMINIC
            Lilly's hurt. She's hurt!

  The other cops are now scanning the room. Meanwhile Dominic
  has found the ventilation shaft, blood smeared around the
  opening.

                      DOMINIC
                   (continuing)
            He's in the ventilation shaft!
                                                                  41




Jones then stares down at Lilly pressing one hand against the
wound. Close on Lilly, going into shock. She's shivering.

                   JONES
         She's dying! She's fucking dying!

At that moment SILUS appears at the door.

Silus stares at Lilly, bleeding to death in Jones' arms.
Silus immediately bends to her. With his free hand Jones
pulls out a vicious knife which he points at Silus.

                   JONES
                (continuing)
         Get away from her!

But Silus ignores the knife and moves closer to Lilly.

                   JONES
                (continuing)
         Get away or I'll stick you!

                   SILUS
         Do you want me to save her?

Jones wavers.

                   SILUS
                (continuing)
         She is dying.

Jones backs the knife away. Silus whips   his hand to the blade
of the knife, slashing his wrist, blood   immediately issuing
from the wound. He presses his bleeding   wrist to Lilly's
mouth. At first resistant, Lilly begins   to suck at the wrist.
Jones is appalled.

Silus then leans close to Lilly and whispers in her ear. All
the other noises in the soundtrack drop out.

                   SILUS
                (continuing)
         Lilly. Stop fighting now. Fall
         back, fall back...

Slowly she does. Silus removes his wrist from Lilly's mouth.
She is silent, comatose.

A medical team now scramble through the door, pushing past
Silus and the bloody Jones and begin to work on Lilly. For a
moment Silus and Jones stare at each other. Then Silus turns
to the ventilation shaft in the corner. He closes his eyes.
Listens.
                      42




          DOMINIC
He's getting away!!

         SILUS
Quiet.
                                                                      43




   The cops are silent. Stare at Silus who opens his eyes.

                       SILUS
                    (continuing)
             He's going up.

   We move in on Silus' ear. Closer, closer. Into his ear.

                                            DISSOLVE TO:


46 INT: APARTMENT BUILDING, VENTILATION SHAFT - NIGHT           46

   The long shaft and in the distance Edgar approaching, his
   eyes reflective, moving with the speed of an insect through
   the shaft, his bloody mouth.

   Cut to

   Silus, now also in the shaft, his gun out, moving forward. He
   turns a corner. The shaft is empty. He waits, watching,
   listening. He hears a scuffling.

   Cut to

   Edgar, the same, turning a corner to see Silus approaching
   him. Silus raises his gun. A puff emits from the end of his
   gun. The projectile hurtles towards Edgar, who just ducks out
   of the way in time.

   Edgar turns. There is a grill next to him. He smashes it with
   his foot.

   Cut to

   Silus approaching the junction, turning the corner, just in
   time to see Edgar's legs pass through the hole.


46A INT: APARTMENT BUILDING, HALL - CONTINUING                  46A

   We see Jones move into the hall, looking at the roof,
   searching. Then he looks at Lilly's blood which covers his
   hands. He pockets his stun weapon and pulls out his own
   dangerous looking gun.

   Cut to


47 INT: APARTMENT BUILDING, DIFFERENT FLOOR - NIGHT             47

   A door bursts open. Edgar - in slow motion - crashes through
   the door and into the hall. The sound track is a huge driving
   slab of choral orchestral music.
                                                                    44




  The camera tracks back as he starts to mount the wall, his
  momentum carrying him diving towards the camera.

  Cut to

  Silus enters the empty hall. No Edgar. Then he sees in the
  roof, a manhole cover, slightly ajar.

  Cut to


48 INT: APARTMENT BUILDING, CEILING CAVITY - NIGHT             48

  Silus' POV as he climbs into the crawl space, its ceiling
  following the pitch of the roof. It is dark and extends for
  a long way. Silus squats in the sub light like a beautifully
  dressed animal.

  What he can't see are two blinking eyes above him in the
  rafters of the dark roof. It is Edgar. Edgar drops, Silus
  turns too late as the weight of Edgar drives into him,
  sending both of them through the floor of the ceiling cavity
  and down...


49 INT: APARTMENT BUILDING, ANOTHER HALL - NIGHT               49

  ...to fall, a dead weight, crashing down onto the floor of
  the hall in a hail of debris. Edgar is on top of Silus and
  strangling him, and then he stops and turns.

  He moves just in time to avoid a bullet from Jones' gun which
  glances Edgar's cheek, sending off a wisp of burnt colored
  smoke.

  Cut to

  Jones. Gun smoking, standing at the other end of the hall.

  Edgar screams the scream of something from the animal
  kingdom. Then turns and runs.

  Cut to

  Silus rising, pulling out his gun. Jones points his gun, but
  Silus is obscuring his view.

  Cut to

  Edgar runs away down the hall.

  Then on Silus. Very still, very silent. Close on his finger
  pressing the trigger.
                                                                45




The camera zooms right into the interior of the gun to see
the projectile entering the gun's chamber and the hammer
igniting it.

The projectile explodes out the end of the gun.

High Angle of the projectile flying towards its target, the
ceiling lights above streaking past on its reflective
surface, cruel mechanical claws suddenly slide out from the
side of the capsule.

Then Edgar, camera tracking back at high speed.

Slow move in on Silus' cool gray eyes.

Then whack! The projectile stabs into Edgar's back, the claws
springing forward to hook onto Edgar's flesh, we see the
fluid within the transparent projectile flow into Edgar, see
Edgar's eyes widen, see his POV of the approaching window
then...

Crash. Edgar's head implants itself in the wall below the
window, the dust and debris from the wall board drifting over
Edgar's numb stare.

In the background Silus stands. Motionless.

We see Jones walking forward, gun still pointing, heading
towards Edgar. Silus turns and steps in front of him.

                   JONES
         Get out of my way.

                   SILUS
         No.

Jones stares at Silus and contemplates firing.

                   JONES
         He killed Lilly.

Silus doesn't move. He stares calmly at Jones.

Jones points the gun in Silus' face.

Beat.

                    JONES
                 (continuing)
         Bang.
                                                                     46




   Jones lowers his gun. We end close on Silus' serene face.

50A INT: SFX - CONTINUING                                      50A

   Black. Voices in the dark, quiet at first, then growing more
   frightening; then the hint of a face, in negative - Edgar -
   then screams, like the screams of an animal on the hunt. And
   another face, alternating with Edgar's. Silus.

51 INT: HOSPITAL, LILLY'S WARD - DAY                           51

   High Angle of Lilly asleep, lying on a hospital bed. We drift
   down. Again there is rain, pounding against the window. Her
   body flinches; she is in a dream, a nightmare. As we drift
   closer to her, her eyes open, staring straight up and then to
   the left. Then grim recognition.

   Cut to Low Angle on Silus standing above her, examining the
   tube that runs a clear fluid into her in a slow drip.

                       LILLY
             Antibiotics. They say it's like an
             animal bite.

   Silus nods. He slowly sits on the bed.

                       LILLY
                    (continuing)
             I want to thank you.

                       SILUS
             We all caught Edgar.

                       LILLY
             I don't mean that. The blood, they
             say it saved my life. Is it true
             that people who go to church are
             given your blood?

                       SILUS
             Sometimes the rituals call for it.
             Some say they have visions from
             it. That it restores their health.
                                                               47




Silus regards her and she him. She reaches out and touches
his hand, almost retracts at the smooth texture of the skin.

                   LILLY
         So smooth.

She turns over his hand to reveal the wrist; the scars are
almost gone from where Silus cut himself.

                   LILLY
                (continuing)
         Healed already.

                   SILUS
         In some ways my body is like a
         human embryo. The cells regenerate
         quickly. It is why we live so
         long. Will someone come for you?
         Your family?

She releases his hand.

                   LILLY
         I don't have one. Not any more.

                   SILUS
         I see.

                   LILLY
         Influenza. My husband was quick.
         But my daughter, Mary, her little
         body fought it for a long time. So
         I just waited. Hoped. But then you
         realize how cruel hope is. And you
         just want it to end. Not to stop
         her suffering, but to stop my own.

                   SILUS
         I am sorry.

                   LILLY
         Do we seem pathetic to you?

                   SILUS
         No. Fragile. Worn down by nature.
         But you fight back.
                                                                      48




                       LILLY
             Yes. We're good at that.

   Lilly stares up into Silus' serene face. Silus smiles. Then
   stands.

                       SILUS
             I think yours will be a good life
             to watch, Lilly. Goodbye.

   Lilly tries to smile as Silus turns and walks off down the
   ward.

   Close on Lilly who looks grim. Then she turns to the window.
   Rain again, blowing hard against the pane.


52 INT: HOSPITAL,LILLY'S WARD - CONTINUOUS                      52

   As Silus leaves the ward he passes Jones, who's been standing
   there as if he's been watching them. A beat. Then Jones
   shoves a newspaper into Silus' hands.

                       JONES
             Nicely done. You're more human
             than I thought.

   Jones unceremoniously pushes past Silus and moves into
   Lilly's room. Silus reads the newspaper. The story tells of
   the recent deaths in Jamestown, explaining that it was an
   insane man who thought he was a Brother. The man's picture is
   shown; it is actually one of the victims.

   Through the window in the doorway Silus watches Jones
   approach Lilly. We are close on his enigmatic face.

                                              DISSOLVE TO:


52A EXT: BROTHERHOOD BUILDING, FOYER - DAY- Establisher         52A

   We tilt down a grand building.
                                                                    49




53 INT: BROTHERHOOD BUILDING, FOYER - DAY                      53

  A huge foyer, shinning marble floors. All done in perfect
  taste. We see Silus cross the foyer and enter an elevator.
  The elevator doors close.


54 INT: BROTHERHOOD BUILDING, SECURITY CONTROL ROOM - DAY      54

  Silus enters the room. There are several technicians at work
  at a console; again the organic nouveaux stylings of the
  Brothers. Augustus is also there. Next to him, someone who is
  obviously human. His lack of perfection stands out; the
  balding hair, dark rings under his eyes. Silus joins them.

                      AUGUSTUS
            Silus. You know Professor Liepsky.

  Silus shakes the Professor's hand. We see the hands touching,
  then slide apart with a wisping sound that makes the
  Professor wince a little.

                      SILUS
            How is he?

                      PROFESSOR LIEPSKY
            See for yourself.

  He taps one of the men at the console on the shoulder. The
  man hits a button and we see that in front of the console
  there is a huge glass window and beyond it a room which is
  now lit.

  Edgar is in there. And Edgar is not pleased. Even from here
  his glowering stare penetrates everyone in the room. From
  this distance we can't make out much, beyond the fact that
  Edgar is seated in a chair, in an otherwise plain white room.
  Around his chair is a strange "brace" of sorts, that seems to
  be holding Edgar in place.

                      SILUS
            Is the brace necessary?

                      AUGUSTUS
            He decapitated a guard as they
            brought him in. Even though he was
            sedated. He said he will drink us
            all dry.

                      SILUS
            Insane then.
                                                                    50




                      PROFESSOR LIEPSKY
            Not quite.

  Silus now turns to the Professor.

                      PROFESSOR LIEPSKY
                   (continuing)
            He's become infected.

                      SILUS
            With what?

  The Professor looks to Augustus, as if worried he's said to
  much.

                      AUGUSTUS
            Go on, Brother Silus will soon be
            part of the inner circle of the
            Brotherhood. He should know this.

  Cut to

  POV approaching a curved, glass and metal door. On the door
  we see the words "Biological Containment Area."

56 INT: BROTHERHOOD BUILDING, BIO CONTAINMENT WARD -           56
   DAY- Establisher

  POV continues. There are 3 beds in here. In them, strapped
  down, 3 young woman. They are all insane, monstrous; the
  whites of their eyes are blood red.

  We see Silus observe them, but there is no horror in his
  eyes, just compassion. He moves to one of the woman and
  slowly grasps her hand. She lurches towards him.

                      PROFESSOR LIEPSKY
            If she wasn't restrained she would
            try to kill you. Don't worry, it's
            only transmissible through their
            blood. We designed it that way.

  Silus quietly turns to the Professor.

                        SILUS
            Designed?
                                                              51




                   PROFESSOR LIEPSKY
         Genetically designed. Edgar was
         experimenting with the virus that
         created you. It was sanctioned by
         the government.

                   SILUS
         Since when do they sanction such
         things?

                   PROFESSOR LIEPSKY
         Since not one Brother has been
         born in 70 years. And never a
         female of your kind from which we
         could breed. And we need to breed
         more Brothers. You give the world
         hope. To the people you're like
         gods walking the earth.

                   AUGUSTUS
         This is what Edgar was doing
         Silus. Trying to genetically
         control the birth of Brothers.

Silus is now turns back to the poor creature on the bed.

                   PROFESSOR LIEPSKY
         And Edgar was successful. Each of
         these women carried a Brother, for
         a time. But, the virus... changed.
         Most of them have died and these
         will die soon.

Silus places his hand on the poor creature's head, blessing
her.

                   PROFESSOR LIEPSKY
                (continuing)
         And Edgar may be the first Brother
         to ever die.
                                                                    52




                      PROFESSOR LIEPSKY
                   (continuing)
            Before that, his brain will wither
            like these women. Containment will
            be the issue.

57 INT: BROTHERHOOD BUILDING, CELL ANTEROOM - CONTINUING       57

  A door slamming behind Silus, he is in a strangely, eerily
  lit cubicle.

                      SILUS
                   (off)
            The police officer. Lilly. Did he
            infect her with this?

                      PROFESSOR LIEPSKY
                   (off)
            No. She was lucky. But it is in
            Edgar's blood. It always will be.

  ...and another door in front of Silus clicks, then slides
  open to reveal...


58 INT: BROTHERHOOD BUILDING, CELL - CONTINUING                58

  Edgar, sitting in the chair. He immediately turns to the
  door, his eyes burrowing straight into Silus.

  Silus moves forward. We track, Silus' POV, toward Edgar and
  the reality of his predicament is revealed.

  There are metal rods extending from the cage around him. Two
  at the sides. Two from the front. They strategically pointed
  at Edgar's chest and sides. If he was to try to get up, they
  would pierce him.

                      SILUS
            Hello my Brother.

  We can now see Edgar for the first time in something
  approaching a normal state. He looks similar to Silus,
  perhaps not quite so perfect. He radiates confident primeval
  power; less a man captured than an animal waiting. Edgar is
  smiles. He shifts a little, we see the rods piercing his
  flesh.
                                                             53




                   EDGAR
         Do you like what they've done for
         me Silus?

He moves again, as if enjoying it.

                   SILUS
         You are sick. We will help you if
         we can.

                   EDGAR
         Help me? I am being what I was
         meant to be. How can you help me
         from that? Or do you want to tame
         me? Brainwash me? Animal or
         vegetable, are those the two
         choices, Silus?

Edgar leans closer to Silus.

                   EDGAR
                (continuing)
         I want to share the feeling with
         you. To feel their blood flow
         until every last drop is yours,
         until that weak, pointless little
         pump finally stops.

They are staring at each other very intently now. Edgar
smiles gently.

                   EDGAR
                (continuing)
         The one I had, the police woman.
         She was so strong. I found it hard
         to leave her.

Edgar moves.

                   EDGAR
                (continuing)
         Is she dead?

                   SILUS
         She survived.

                   EDGAR
         Good. I will have her again.

For perhaps the first time, we see a real hint of anger on
Silus' face.

                   SILUS
         You won't touch her.
                                                                  54




  Edgar looks at his brother for a moment. Edgar's features are
  a paradox; almost sympathy for Silus followed by
  understanding. Then he smiles.

                       EDGAR
             You've chosen to watch over her.
             You want her don't you? I can see
             it in your eyes. You are like me.

  Silus' control has returned now.

                       SILUS
             I will pray for your cure, Brother.

  Silus then turns and leaves.

                       EDGAR
             I wont be able to forgive you for
             this you know? Not ever. In fact,
             when I get out of here...

  He moves violently, blood seeping from his wounds now.

                       EDGAR
                    (continuing)
             I will make you see. I will show
             you the way. I will see you drink
             your little police woman right
             through.

  By now frightening music has hummed into existence. Silus has
  paused at the door to the cell. Without looking back he
  passes through the door, leaving Edgar to his prison.

  Edgar, slowly turns back to the window in front of him. He
  sees himself reflected in it. The Camera moves into Edgar's
  eyes. The lights go out. All we are left with are his strange
  reflective eyes. Waiting. Waiting.

                                           FADE OUT:

60 INT: BROTHERHOOD BUILDING, CELL - NIGHT                      60

   A smooth, white walled cell. Flash edits of Edgar. Standing,
   posing, balancing literally on his fingertips, doing
   sensuous, slow gymnastic yoga. His hair has changed so we
   know time has passed. Finally he stands there; poised tensile
   steel. He slowly draws his finger nails against the shining
   floor of the cell, it almost looks like he's sharpening them.
   A tube comes from his arm for taking blood samples.

   Then Edgar begins to run directly at the glass window of the
   console room and then dives for it, smashing his head against
   it; blood and saliva left smeared there. Behind the glass
   window the console operators jump.

60B INT: BROTHERHOOD BUILDING, CELL - CONTINUING                60B

   We see Edgar, slowly pulling himself up, blood and bruising
   apparent on his face. He smiles.

   We zoom in close to the glass, see Edgar's infected blood run
   down it until it congeals a little, caught in a tiny, almost
   imperceptible, hairline fracture.


61 EXT: JAMESTOWN CLUBLAND, STREET - NIGHT                      61

   Rain on the streets. A man, covered in tattoos - an affluent
   hood, is in a doorway snorting snuff

   Dominic, Jones and several other cops emerge from hiding
   places, pointing their guns at the man who puts his hands up.
   Hand held cameras follow several other cops and Lilly as they
   move into the building, again catching various hoods unaware.

   Lilly moves forward quickly, down a hallway and finds what
   she is looking for. In a room she discovers a harem of
   prostitutes, none of them older than ten years old. She
   stares at their doll-like faces, then lowers her gun.
                                                                    56



  We see Lilly, the scars from Edgar's attack now healed but
  still apparent on her neck. Her hair is shorter; she seems
  more worn down.

  Jones appears on her shoulder.

                       LILLY
             Take them away from here.

  Jones nods as Lilly walks off.

                       JONES
             You don't feel like a drink?

  But Lilly doesn't respond, she just walks off. Jones watches
  her leave. Then he stares at the round faces of the children
  in front of him, something approaching compassion there.

                       JONES
                    (continuing)
             Now my girls, anyone hungry?


62 EXT: JAMESTOWN CLUBLAND, STREET - CONTINUING                62

  Lilly exits the building into the rain, wrapping herself up
  against it. Then she stops, feels she's being watched. She
  looks up at the surrounding buildings. But there's nothing
  there. She pulls out an amulet with the symbol of the
  Brotherhood on it from under her jacket, and then after a
  beat, kisses it, a little smile comes to warms her lips
  against the cold. She leaves.

   Edgar's cell   is very dimly lit. Edgar is in front of the
   glass window   to the console room. He is repeatedly banging is
   head against   it. And his fingernails slide across the shiny
   surface; has   he simply gone insane? A voice comes over the
   Tannoy.

65 INT: LILLY'S APARTMENT - DAY                                 65

   We track through Lilly's apartment, silently. We enter the
   lounge to see Lilly sitting on a couch watching a strange
   looking valve powered globular Television-like device. We
   track ominously up behind her. Then stop.
                                                                58




                   JONES
                (off)
         I knocked.

Lilly turns to Jones.

                   LILLY
         You nearly gave me a heart attack.

Steph now emerges from the kitchen, dressed in a t-shirt and
shorts and carrying some food. Jones looks at her coldly.

                   JONES
         What's this then?

Lilly and Steph smile at the inference Jones is beginning to
draw.

                   STEPH
         My apartment was condemned, keep
         your hair on, what's left of it.

Meanwhile Lilly shushes them and turns back to the murky gray
images emitting from the television.

                   TV PRESENTER
         ...the ascension through the ranks
         of the Church has been fast for
         Brother Silus. He will now be the
         highest ranking cardinal outside
         the ruling council of the
         Brotherhood. This is largely seen
         as a reward for his handling of
         the last influenza pandemic.

Jones and Lilly watch as Silus is seen on the television in
an interview. Steph stares at the screen with awe, she
involuntarily kisses the symbol that hangs from a chain
around her neck; it resembles a Brother's ring.

                   STEPH
         Isn't he amazing?

Jones sneers under his breath.

                    JONES
         A saint.

                    LILLY
         Quiet.

We move over their shoulders to track closer to the black and
white TV screen.
                                                                59




                   TV PRESENTER
         You have been an opponent of those
         who want an easing in the ban on
         genetic research.

                     SILUS
         Yes.

                   TV PRESENTER
         They would say you're denying
         legitimate research into a science
         that would change the world.

                   SILUS
         The church does not deny the
         potential. Only the motivations of
         those who want to exploit it. And
         the fact that we understand so
         little of its power.

                   TV PRESENTER
         With the elimination of influenza,
         are we approaching a new era where
         disease might be a thing of the
         past?

As she is saying this we are now close on the TV's speaker.
We then begin tracking out. We reveal the speaker is not part
of the TV, but the speaker in Edgar's cell. Edgar, smiling
coldly as he listens. As he listens he is gently gliding his
finger nails against a sharp edge of the chair; sharpening
them.

                   SILUS
         Disease is part of nature, it will
         always be a part of our lives.

Close on Edgar.

                     EDGAR
         How true.

         ceremony will be held today in the

         gather.

Edgar listens, smiles.
                                                                        60


 66 INT: CEREMONIAL CHAPEL - DAY                                 66

    An ornate door; ancient, with strange, beautiful dark symbols
    carved into the old wood, like something out of a castle in
    Prague. The doors open and we see a large chapel. And within
    the large dark interior, lit by great long candles, the
    Brotherhood have gathered. They all stare at the camera,
    which we reveal is Silus' POV.

    We see SILUS. Unchanged, still the perfect creature he has
    always been. But for now the suit has gone and instead he
    stands draped in fine ropes, robes that carry his life on
    them; achievements, his rank, which is now high.

    In the distance, at an alter, stands AUGUSTUS. He is also in
    his gowns. A gong sounds and the Brothers, in unison with the
    music, begin to chant; it is eerie, it sounds like Tibetan
    monks.

    Professor Liepsky, looking more aged, worn, enters the
    control room. Alarms are sounding. At the console is a human
    male who looks terrified.

                         CONSOLE OPERATOR
               I turned off the lights to try and
               calm him...

    Liepsky hits a button and it floods Edgar's cell with light.

    Edgar is right there, staring at them, his hands plastered
    over the glass window. He is covered in blood. In the
    background a bloody corpse on the floor. Edgar bangs his head
    against the glass, making Liepsky flinch. On Edgar's forehead
    we see scars from this kind of repeated banging.

                         CONSOLE OPERATOR
                      (continuing)
               We gassed him as usual. We waited
               10 minutes. He must have held his
               breath.

    The look on Liepsky's face says it all. We see Edgar. We had
    thought he was looking at the Professor. But he's not, his
    gaze is focused past the Professor to the dimly seen back
    wall of the control room.

    On it is a schematic, showing this room, other rooms on the
    level, the elevator shaft. Edgar is talking it all in.
                                                                   61




70A INT: CEREMONIAL CHAPEL - DAY                             70A

   Silus, on one knee before Augustus. Augustus now places a
   ceremonial sword at the back of Silus' neck, then draws it
   gently across the skin. Below, a Brother holds out a bowl to
   catch the drops of Silus' blood.

                       AUGUSTUS
             The blood flows, through them, to
             us and we preserve them, preserve
             the blood we are bound to protect.

   Silus raises his head. We see his face. He takes the bowl,
   drinks and then stands, holding it up to the other Brothers.

                       SILUS
             Let the blood be one and the two
             races join, as the Perfect
             Creature.

   Close on Edgar, smiling. Calm.

                       EDGAR
             Today my brother enters the
             history books, Professor.

                       PROFESSOR LIEPSKY
                    (over the tannoy)
             Move back!

   After a moment, Edgar slowly walks backward in perfectly
   smooth movements.

                       EDGAR
             Tonight all the Brothers will be
             with him. A perfect day for me to
             celebrate.

   From the far wall Edgar begins to glide forward, first in
   slow motion then ramping up to full speed, launching himself
   at the glass window. He bounces off it, leaving blood and
   saliva there.

   The Professor and the console operator share an unsettled
   glance.

   Edgar slowly stands. He stares very intently at the glass
   window in front of him. We zoom in on the glass. The small
   hair line fracture we saw previously now begins to lengthen
   before our eyes.

   Edgar's face. A smile. Then he is forward at high velocity
   before anything else can happen, smashing once more into the
   glass window, this time shattering it into a thousand tiny
   pieces.


71A INT: BROTHERHOOD BUILDING, SECURITY CONTROL ROOM - CONTINUI71A

   Horrified the console operator begins to make an escape. But
   Edgar is on him before they're a few paces towards the door.
   Edgar's long fingers sink into his neck like the flesh and
   bone were clay. He screams.

   The Professor makes it to the door, pulls himself through and
   shuts it, but on Edgar's hand. Edgar doesn't flinch, but
   kicks the door open.


72 INT: BROTHERHOOD BUILDING, HALL - DAY                       72

   The Professor is now scrambling, half falling in slow motion
   as Edgar advances. As normal motion returns he kicks Liepsky
   in the head; the sound of impact has a nasty fatality to it.
                                                                     63

   Edgar. A door further down the hall is being unbolted. Edgar
   immediately runs towards it, then launches himself at it, his
   fingers extended like knives which enter the eyes of a guard
   who's coming through the doorway. The guard falls back on
   another two guards behind him.

   A round from a shotgun goes off, taking a small chunk from
   Edgar's side, but it's nothing more than a bee sting to him.
   His speed and precision is that of a creature who knows he
   only has one chance. He kicks the second guard under the
   chin, instantly snapping his neck, while flicking the third
   in the eyes with his sharpened fingernails. This guard falls,
   his eyes leaking orbs.

   Beat.

   Edgar crouches like a dark god of destruction, a siren
   sounding, the lights all going off, then flicking to red
   emergency lights. Edgar's eyes reflect in the half-light.
   Then he bares his teeth. At the end of the hallway he can
   hear the elevator arriving on this floor. Edgar smiles.

75 INT: BROTHERHOOD BUILDING, FOYER - DAY                      75

   The gleaming surfaces of the ground floor of the Brotherhood
   building. We hear the elevator begin to arrive. We pan off
   this to a desk where a receptionist sits.

   Cut to

   The Receptionist; she's trying desperately to place a call.
   We see the shadow from a figure cast over her and she turns
   and looks up, fear making her shake now.

   Cut to

   Edgar, staring down at her.

                        EDGAR
              You won't be taking any more calls
              today.

76 INT: BROTHERHOOD BUILDING, HALL - LATER                    76

  Slow steadicam along the underground halls. We see the bodies
  of Edgar's victims being cleaned up by personnel. We stop. In
  the distance we see the door to Edgar's cell open.

  Cut to Silus, observing the scene. The lighting is
  intermittent, flickering. Augustus is standing next to Silus,
  the weird light of the hallway reflecting in his eyes.

                      AUGUSTUS
            Now he carries this thing out into
            the world. Can you imagine what
            will happen if he infects others?
            Or if the experiments were known.

  We are left with Silus' beautiful, reflective eyes.

                      SILUS
            The question becomes what will he
            do next? He said he would kill us
            all. But especially the police
            officer. Lilly.

  Cut to


77 INT: JAMESTOWN SUBWAY - SUNSET                             77

  Flashing lights of subway trains screaming through subway
  tunnels, wheels screeching as metal grinds on metal.


78 INT: JAMESTOWN SUBWAY EXIT - CONTINUING                    78

  The streets are flooding like Bangkok in the monsoon; rain
  pouring off awnings that hang out over the street. The
  streets are full; prostitutes, drug peddlers, apothecary
  shops, the industrial revolution low down and dirty. There is
  a fight breaking out between two men who are dressed like
  punk rockers.

  Several people are alighting from a subway exit; the exit has
  "Jamestown/Brougham" on a nouveaux styled sign that might
  remind you of a Paris or Barcelona metro, only dirtier.

  We see Lilly in the distance, in her dark jacket, emerge from
  the subway. She begins the short walk to her apartment. The
  streets are crowded and there are plenty of Maori people in
  this area, so there's plenty of food stalls; the air is
  filled with the sound of evening prayers. Lilly stops at one
  of the food stalls and starts picking up vegetables. A Maori
  man comes out and smiles and they start talking in the local
  dialect. She buys a live eel.

  Cut to
                                                                    65




  Across the street, in a doorway, we see a very weedy, sick
  looking guy - this is Freddy. Standing next to him is a
  Prostitute, swaying from the effects of laudanum.

                      PROSTITUTE
            Come on governor, you going to pay
            me or not?

                      FREDDY
            Soon enough my cherub. I've not
            finished with you yet.

  He sucks on something that looks like a ventaline inhaler,
  then pockets it, licks his lips and begins heading off down
  the street, the drunk Prostitute dragged along.

  Cut to

  Again, Lilly from a distance, walking along the street which
  is more deserted, now carrying a bag full of groceries. As
  she walks we begin to hear voices; violent, arguing. Lilly
  approaches an alleyway, the raised voices becoming louder.
  She slowly places her bag on the ground and then pulls out a
  revolver. She edges into the alleyway.


79 EXT: JAMESTOWN SLUM, ALLEYWAY - CONTINUING                  79

  Lilly's POV down the alleyway. It seems empty. The POV moves
  in a little and there in an offshoot of the alleyway we can
  see Freddy. He is standing over a woman who cowers; she's

  plainly a prostitute. Freddy points a gun at her head.

                      FREDDY
            You've been ripping me off! I
            should blow your dirty little
            brains out!

                      STEPH
                   (off)
            Police! Put the gun down now!

  And now we see, it's not Lilly we've been watching, but
  Steph. She points her gun at Freddy. Freddy turns to Steph.
  He slowly raises his arms.

                      FREDDY
            It's ok. I'm complying officer,
            see.

                      STEPH
            Put the gun on the ground and step
            away!
                                                                66




                   FREDDY
         I'm doing it.

Freddy puts the gun down. The Prostitute on the ground now
scrambles to her feet and heads towards Steph.

                   PROSTITUTE
         He's crazy! Fucking crazy!

She gives Freddy the finger then heads off.

                    STEPH
                 (to the prostitute)
         Wait!
                (to Freddy)
         Down! Right now, down on the
         ground!

Freddy gets down.

                   FREDDY
         I'm getting wet now.

Low Angle on Steph approaching. Behind her a FIGURE is
descending the wall behind him.

                    STEPH
         Shut up!

Steph is over Freddy now. He's staring up at her. He can see
that a shape has appeared behind Steph. EDGAR, his eyes
gleaming. Steph pulls out some handcuffs.

                   STEPH
                (continuing)
         Put your hands behind your back.

                   FREDDY
         Sure. Anything you say.

But before Steph can move forward, Edgar has her gun hand in
a vice-like grip. She cries out in pain as her wrist
disintegrates. As a reflex she stamps on Edgar's foot and
kicks him in the groin with her other.

He does not flinch. He smashes Steph into a down pipe on the
wall of the alley so that wet grit is ground into her face.
We then see Edgar's face at her shoulder.

                   EDGAR
         Nice to meet you again.

Edgar pulls back the jacket at Steph's neck to find no scars.
He pulls Steph's face towards him brutally, staring at her
profile.
                                                                67




He then smashes her head against the pipe so that she falls
unconscious to the ground.

                   FREDDY
         What's wrong?

                   EDGAR
         You brought me the wrong one.

                   FREDDY
         Does it matter, one's as good as
         the next?

Edgar's stare makes Freddy shut up and avert his eyes. Edgar
then turns on the tube on his arm so that blood drips into
the unconscious Steph's mouth; making her gag.

                   FREDDY
                (continuing)
         You promised me some of that.

Freddy's licking his lips.

Edgar studies Freddy, then raises his arm. Freddy just
stares. We see the tube on Edgar's arm that connects to his
veins. And in a moment Freddy has latched onto it and is
sucking like some kind of human leech.

                   EDGAR
         What do you see Freddy. Visions?
         Can you see your future?

For a moment Edgar strokes Freddy's hair, then rips the tube
away.

                   FREDDY
         Hey!

Freddy moves forward, but is pushed back by Edgar.

                   EDGAR
         Don't be a greedy little pig
         Freddy. You have to earn more.

Close on Edgar, his repellent features under the hood. He
looks up. Far above, through the falling rain, past the high-
rise slum around them; we see the moon hanging like a pearly
crescent in the sky. The moon is slowly obscured by clouds.

                   EDGAR
                (continuing)
         We have more to do.

Cut to
                                                                    68




80 EXT: JAMESTOWN CLUBLAND, STREET - NIGHT                     80

  We see a figure exiting the subway. This time it is Lilly,
  following the same path that Steph took.
                                                                 69




Making her way through the crowded street. The rain has given
way to a fine mist.

Then, as Lilly moves forward she senses something; that
feeling again, that she is being watched. She stands for a
moment as people push past, looks up at the gothic Victorian
buildings that loom out of the drifting mist. But there is
nothing.

Lilly begins to make her way through the drifting mist,
casting glances at the odd passerby.

Then, ahead of her, there is one pedestrian in particular,
taller than the rest, wearing a great hooded jacket, who
stands out. He is immediately suspicious to Lilly. He is
slowly moving through the crowd towards her. From under the
hooded jacket we see the glint of the approaching figure's
eyes; an intense stare hidden in the shadows. The man now
puts his hand in his pocket as if he's reaching for something.

Lilly now slowly slips her hand into her jacket, her gun a
cold hard presence in her hand. She stares ahead at the
approaching figure, who has now stopped, after bumping into
a pedestrian. Lilly continues forward, closer, closer. From
under the hooded jacket the glistening eyes of the man ahead
catches hers for a moment. The man now begins to approach
her, his hand pulling something from his jacket, going for
something. A gun.

Lilly immediately pulls her gun. The mist beads on the
shining barrel of her gun. The man is raising his hand
towards her.

                   LILLY
         Police. Put your hands where I can
         see them!

The man now lurches forward, his hand rising towards Lilly,
her finger begins to caress the trigger of her gun, as the
man looms closer. And then he is gone.

Cut to

The man slamming against the wet wall of a building, grasping
at the hands that now threaten to throttle him.

And we see Silus, his hands on the man's throat, and for only
the second time, we see anger in Silus' eyes.

People in the street scatter as more Brothers emerge with
guns pointed. And Lilly, shaking, pointing her gun at the man
Silus is holding. On the ground, next to the man, she sees
what he had in his hand. A pamphlet. Asking people to come to
church service; a picture of a Brother priest serenely
beaming out from it.
                                                                 70




Meanwhile the man that Silus has is gagging on the ground,
Silus' hand still on his throat. He's begging.

                    PARISHONER
          Holy brother, please...

Lilly grabs Silus' shoulder.

                    LILLY
          Let him go.

She shows Silus the pamphlet.

                    LILLY
                 (continuing)
          He's harmless. Let him go.

The man now pulls back his hood. He is black, his large,
watery eyes stare up in awe at Silus. He grabs Silus' hand
which now relaxes and draws Silus' ring to his lips, kissing
it, in tears.

                    PARISHONER
          Forgive me. I've offended you...

We see Silus' dark stare.

A beat.

Then Silus reaches out and places his hand on the man's head.

                    SILUS
          No. You are divine. It is the
          world that offends me.

Silus rises, the Parishioner just lays there in awe. Silus now
turns to Lilly who is on his shoulder. And now Lilly realizes
for the first time that it is Silus.

                    LILLY
          Brother Silus. What's going on?

We then hear a police siren and a car pulls up through the
rain. The door opens and Jones emerges, taking in both Lilly
and Silus. A grim smile of realization comes to Jones' face.
He pulls something from his jacket.

                                                                   71




81 INT: LILLY'S APARTMENT, LOUNGE - NIGHT                     81

  Steph's ID is tossed down on a table.

                      JONES
                   (off)
            A shopkeeper heard yelling. Went
            to see, found this. One witness.
            A prostitute.

  Jones tosses down a photo. It is Freddy, looking suitably
  scummy in a police identikit photo.

                      JONES
                   (continuing)
            She identified this lovely
            citizen. We thought maybe he had
            a grudge or was crazy. I guess we
            were wrong.

  Silus stands by the window; lights make patterns on his face.

                      SILUS
            It is Edgar.

                      LILLY
            And now he's got Steph. Why does
            he want her?

                      SILUS
            She is not what he was after.

  We see Lilly slowly getting it.

                      LILLY
            Steph was staying with me. She was
            wearing my coat. It was me he was
            after. Wasn't it?

  Silus now turns, slowly moves towards her,   coming out of the
  shadows. Lilly finds it hard to return his   gaze,
  involuntarily touches her neck where it is   scarred from
  Edgar's attack. Jones is watching all this   very carefully.

                      SILUS
            Yes. He will come for you Lilly.

                      JONES
            Right, then we put you somewhere
            safe and set up this place.
            Shooters on the roofs. And when he
            comes we blow his fucking brains
            out.

                      SILUS
            He will know. He will see and hear
            it.
                                                                  72




  Lilly is staring at Steph's ID.

                      LILLY
            It has to be me. That's what he
            wants. It's the only chance
            Steph's got.

                      JONES
            What are you talking about, she's
            probably dead already...

                      LILLY
            Jones! And we can't make it too
            hard. He has to be able to get in.
            He can't suspect anything.

  Jones is shaking his head. Silus just stares at Lilly.

                      LILLY
                   (continuing)
            That's the way it will be. I'm the
            bait.

  Close on Silus.


82 INT: JAMESTOWN SLUM, HIDEOUT - SUNSET                    82

  We are in a large, derelict warehouse; detritus and stacked
  and smashed wooden crates. Music is playing somewhere in the
  distance from a phonograph. We track through the space.
  Daylight comes through cracks in the blacked out windows high
  above, creating tiny shafts of laser light that flicker from
  the dust.

  We pass through the stacks of crates that are like a high
  walled maze. Music emits from a stereo, loud. We continue to
  move down a hall. Through the detritus, towards a door. A
  hand opens the door.


83 INT: JAMESTOWN SLUM, HIDEOUT, CELL - CONTINUING          83

  In the corner of the room, huddled, chained to the floor, is
  Steph. She does not look good. In fact she looks very sick.
  There are tubes coming off her arm.

  Freddy stoops down and begins to check the tubes running from
  her arm. There are small taps on the tubes. He turns them on.
  Blood begins to flow from her into a cup that is already
  stained red. As he turns it off Steph shivers, her eyes open.
  The whites of her eyes are blood red; she is sick. She
  speaks, weakly.
                                                                  73




                      STEPH
            Help me. Please, I'm sick. Help me.

  She reaches for Freddy, but he pulls away. Freddy's not
  looking too hot either.

                      FREDDY
            Don't fucking touch me.

  He picks up the half filled cup and leaves. Steph stares
  after him. Tears welling in her eyes, beginning to shake now,
  moving against the chains that bind her. But they stay fast.


84 INT: JAMESTOWN SLUM, HIDEOUT - CONTINUING                84

  Freddy moves into the large warehouse space, the music still
  echoing. Freddy looks around, searching for Edgar.

                       FREDDY
            Hey!

  His voice echoes through the empty space.

                      FREDDY
                   (continuing)
            Where've you gone now?


85 EXT: LILLY'S APARTMENT - NIGHT                           85

  A POV, wavering slightly, the hint of a whispering breath. We
  see Lilly's apartment. The shot zooms in at high velocity,
  searching the windows, zooming in here to check the lock on
  this window, then on that. Then the shot wildly pans and
  twists to the street below. Again it zooms in, to the
  entrance of the building, to a couple walking past in the
  night, as if searching for any sign of something out of the
  ordinary. We can hear the couples voices, talking about inane
  things.

  Cut to Edgar's face in the shadows. His eyes reflective, his
  whole being readied and concentrating. He closes his eyes. We
  move around to end close on his ear, the soundtrack becoming
  stark as the sounds of the night become eerily separated and
  distinct. One sound in particular, a kind of metal sound,
  scratching slightly, growing louder.

  Edgar's eyes open.

  Cut to

  A zoom speeding towards Lilly's bedroom window, then swooping
  at the last minute to end on an apartment one floor down.
                                                                    74




  And there, gently moving in the night air, a partially open
  window, the latch grinding in the breeze.

  Cut to


86 INT: LILLY'S APARTMENT - CONTINUING                         86

  A whiz pan POV, ending on the lounge of Lilly's apartment;
  as if we just caught the last part of someone turning their
  head, as if alerted. All the lights are out. We slowly begin
  to move forward, dipping and gliding silently, into the
  hallway. Slowly we approach a doorway and creep into...


87 INT: LILLY'S APARTMENT, BEDROOM - CONTINUING                87

  We can see Lilly lying on the bed, her skin alabaster in the
  moonlight that comes through the window blinds. Closer closer
  until we halt above her.

  Cut closer to see Lilly asleep; her hand grips her service
  revolver which protrudes from under her pillow.

  We see Silus standing above her, his eyes glisten in the
  sub light. As he watches, Lilly moves, as if she's having a
  dream, her hand grips the gun beneath her pillow.

  Silus slowly bends down, close to her. Watching. Then he
  reaches out, as if to gently wake her, then stops as Lilly
  stirs. She turns, curling up into the fetal position. Silus
  is confronted with the old scars from Edgar's attack.

  For a moment Silus stares at her. Stares. Then very quietly,
  smoothly, he moves his head down, very close to her arm. He
  sniffs it, as you would something very delicate, very
  complex. Then he closes his eyes.

  We see Lilly, her arm. Silus slowly enters frame, moves his
  face close to Lilly, moves along her arm as if taking in her
  scent. Slowly her arm raises, as his face moves up her body
  to her neck, her hand now embracing Silus' head. Closer as
  his face is near hers and still with eyes closed her face
  turns towards him, his dark lips and hers are close.

  Cut to

  Silus, back where he was, smelling her arm. His eyes open and
  he moves back a little, as if shocked by the daydream he has
  just indulged in.

  We see Lilly, as she was before, curled up in the fetal
  position. Then a sound.
                                                                    75




  Silus immediately pivots, his gun immediately pointed at the
  figure who stands silhouetted in the doorway. Jones.

                      JONES
            What are you doing?

  The camera immediately drops, through the floor of Lilly's
  apartment to the apartment below to find...


88 INT: APARTMENT BELOW LILLY'S - CONTINUING                   88

  ...Edgar, standing in the apartment below, immediately
  freezing. We zoom into his ear as he listens.

  Flash cuts of sound and image; a large man turning in his bed
  and groaning, a tap drips in an apartment, a fluorescent
  colored mosquito catcher vaporizing a mosquito with a zing,
  then a woman's lips; whispering...

                      LILLY
            What is it? Jones?

  Cut to


89 INT: LILLY'S APARTMENT, BEDROOM - CONTINUING                89

  Silus above Lilly, his hand up to silence her, Jones stock
  still in the doorway. Waiting, waiting...

  Bang, Silus rushes to the window of the apartment, ripping it
  open, pointing his gun below. But there is no one there. Then
  Silus spots it. On the floor below the window is open, a
  curtain gently wafts out of the window in the breeze. Silus
  turns to Jones and Lilly.

                      SILUS
            Stay here.

  Silus immediately drops out of the window.

  Cut to

  Lilly rushes to the window and looks out expecting to see
  Silus dead on the pavement below, but the street is empty.
  And then she sees it; the window below her apartment is open.


90 INT: LILLY'S APARTMENT, HALLWAY - CONTINUING                90

  Lilly, gun extended, moving forward towards her apartment
  door, Jones behind her, trying to grab her.
                                                              76




                   JONES
         Get back here, Lilly!

But Lilly shoves him off, opens the door and moves into the
hall and waits.
                                                                    77



  She hears more smashing from the other side of the building.
  She turns to Jones.

                        LILLY
            Cover me.

  And she's off, smashing the apartment door in front of her
  with her foot and moving into the apartment, towards the
  window beyond. Jones can only curse, lift his gun and move
  after her.


91 INT: APARTMENT ADJACENT TO LILLY'S - CONTINUING             91

  Lilly's POV crashing through the apartment and reaching the
  window, pulling it open to see...


92 EXT: LILLY'S APARTMENT, REAR - CONTINUING                   92

  ...Lilly's POV of the city below. We see her search with her
  eyes, and then she sees it.

  Cut to

  Lilly's POV, closer, looking down on Edgar running over a
  roof.

  Cut to

  Edgar running towards us as we track back, then he launches
  himself...

  Cut to

  Low angle, Edgar jumping from above us, to land almost on the
  camera, stopping himself by grabbing iron piping protruding
  from the side of the building.

  Edgar turns, smiles, thinking he's escaped; then shock comes
  across his face.

  Cut to

  Edgar's POV as Silus flies through the air and crashes
  straight into the camera. Silus' hands go straight for
  Edgar's throat, stopping Edgar from falling. The two
  Brothers eyes lock.

                      EDGAR
            You saved me...

  Then Edgar's smile. He pushes off the wall with his legs,
  sending both of them tumbling over the railing.
                                                                78




We see them fall, Silus hitting a railing which sends him
spinning out of control, whilst Edgar manages to clasp onto
it.

Cut to

Silus' POV, tumbling wildly out of control, heading for the
ground, finally coming to a jarring stop, the view of the
alleyway upside down.

We now reveal Silus, only just conscious, caught in wire
netting, hanging upside down in the alleyway.

And there, landing, is Edgar, poised, watching. Edgar slowly
approaches so that he is near. He bends down to Silus.

                   EDGAR
                (continuing)
         When will you admit it. You're
         just like me.

Edgar's nose is bleeding. He dabs some on his fingers, then
raises his hand to Silus.

                   EDGAR
                (continuing)
         Maybe you need some encouragement.

He brings the dripping blood closer to Silus, closer...

Then an explosion; the sound of bullets whistling through the
air. Then Edgar is gone.

Cut to

Lilly and Jones entering the alleyway to find Silus still
hanging from the railing.

                   LILLY
                (to Jones)
         Get him down.

Lilly then moves into the adjacent alleyway to search for
Edgar.

                   JONES
         Lilly, wait! Damn you. Lilly!

She turns and gives him a final quick look.

                   LILLY
         If he escapes then Steph is dead.
         Just follow me when you can, hurry!

Cut to
                                                                79




Lilly moving through a slick wet alleyway; water plops and
dribbles from leaking pipes. She swings her gun towards
movement; water crashing out of a pipe. Lilly's shaking,
terrified, but she keeps on going. And then another sound and
she swings her gun to find Edgar, standing in the shadows,
waiting.

                   EDGAR
         The little policewoman.

                   LILLY
         Don't move!

Edgar purposely raises his hand so that she fires; the bullet
going through the flesh of Edgar's arm; his arm now smoking.

                   LILLY
                (continuing)
         I said don't move. Where is she,
         where's the girl?

Edgar can only smile.

                   EDGAR
         Oh, I've killed her already.
         Essentially.

Then he moves, she fires, but he's too fast, spinning,
diving, in an instant he has the gun, twisting it and Lilly's
arm behind her back. She fires, once, twice, the bullets and
smoke rising up from Edgar's side. He twists harder, the gun
then falling to the ground. Edgar is now behind her. He moves
his face close to hers.

                   EDGAR
                (continuing)
         Has he tasted you yet, little
         policewoman?

Lilly tries to twist out of his grasp.

                   EDGAR
                (continuing)
         He's just the same as me, you know
         it, you can feel it too.

                   LILLY
         He's nothing like you.

Edgar's face twists into a smile.

                   EDGAR
         We will see. You will be my tool.

                                         JUMP CUT:
                                                                  80




  A cat, hissing, screeching.

  Cut to Silus and Jones entering the alleyway, the cat tearing
  away from them in fright. Jones moves forward and we tilt
  down to see Lilly's gun lying on the wet cobblestones, smoke
  wisping from the barrel. Jones stoops down and picks up the
  gun, then turns to Silus. After a beat, Jones throws the gun
  at Silus' head. Silus dodges it easily and it clacks onto the
  cobblestones.

                      JONES
            You happy now?

  Cut to


93 INT: JAMESTOWN SLUM, HIDEOUT, TOILET - DAY               93

  Close on Freddy's face, looking at himself in a mirror. He's
  pulling back his eyelid; his eyes are bloodshot and he's
  sweating. Freddy then pushes the mirror shut and we see
  Edgar, silhouetted in the bathroom doorway.

                      FREDDY
            You scared the shit out of me.
            Hey, the police woman. She's real
            sick. To tell the truth I don't
            feel so hot myself.

  Edgar approaches, still silhouetted.

                      EDGAR
            I want you to take her and put her
            where they'll find her.

                      FREDDY
            But I'm sick. She's given me
            something...

  Edgar moves incredibly fast, we can't quite see what he has
  done but we suspect he has just buried his hand in Freddy's
  chest. We see Freddy's face, stunned, deathly white.

                      EDGAR
            What have I said to you?

  Freddy falls, leaving Edgar's hand in mid air; we can't see
  clearly, but it likes frighteningly like he has one of
  Freddy's internal organs in his hand.

                      EDGAR
                   (continuing)
            I hate arguments.

94 EXT: JAMESTOWN SLUM, ALLEYWAY - DAY                         94

  Close on a pendant; the symbol of the Brothers.

  We pull out to reveal Steph, very sick now. Edgar is has her
  wrapped in a sheet and is half carrying her along a decrepit
  alley. Ahead of him is a street; we can see several passersby.

  Edgar sits Steph up against the wall of the alley, propped
  up. She really is sick. She coughs.

  Edgar looks at her for a moment. Then after consideration,
  takes her hands and crosses them, and places an envelope in
  her limp hands. Happy with the composition he moves off.

  Cut to

  A close High Angle on Steph looking up, her bloodshot, dazed
  eyes staring blankly. We drift up and away from her. Already
  the rats are beginning to come out and sniff her.


95 INT: HOSPITAL, HALLWAY - DAY                                95

  There are several nurses running towards us, they turn and
  move down a hallway. We reveal Jones and Dominic. They move
  to the nurses station and Jones flashes his ID.

                      JONES
            Stephanie Richards, you just
            brought her in.

  And then a scream. Blood curdling; the sound of someone
  insane, screaming their lungs out, hurling abuse. We see the
  faces of the cops and the terrified nurse in front of them
  who points down the hall where the noise is coming from. The
  Cops move off. The nurse then sees someone else arrive. She
  raises the pendant that hangs around her neck and kisses it.

                      NURSE
            Thank god you're here.

  We see who has entered. It is Silus. Near him there are
  several people sick. They look sick; like Steph and Freddy
  looked.

  Cut to


96 INT: HOSPITAL, ISOLATION WARD - CONTINUING                  96

  Jones and the Dominic move through an anteroom. Nursing staff
  and doctors are madly running about. The screaming we heard
  before punctuates the noisy clutter of medical procedures.

  Jones approaches a door; it has the words "level 4 isolation
  unit" on it. A large Guard blocks his way.
                                                                   82



  Jones shows his ID. A figure brushes past them and enters the
  door; the figure is fully decked out in something like a
  spacesuit.

  Jones and Dominic are ushered sideways, to another room. This
  room has a glass viewing window which looks into the adjacent
  room. A middle aged Doctor stands there, his thumb nail in
  his mouth, looking thoughtful. When he turns towards Jones,
  we can see there is fear in his eyes. Jones shows his ID.
  Screaming from within the adjacent room draws his attention
  and that of Jones.


97 INT: HOSPITAL, STEPH'S ROOM - CONTINUING                   97

  In the adjacent room two nurses are trying to put in a line
  to Steph's arms which are restrained by straps. Steph lies on
  a bed. She looks truly sick; her hair matted, her skin
  blotchy. Her eyes are also blood red, the tiny blood vessels
  hemorrhaging. And she is screaming abuse at the nurses and
  Doctors who work on her.

  Close of Jones, staring at the scene.

  Silus now enters the room. Almost immediately Steph stops
  screaming. She is staring directly at Silus; even this
  deranged, she is still in complete awe.

                      JONES
            Will she recover?

  The Doctor turns to Jones; the Doctor looks puzzled.

                      DOCTOR
            No. Containment is the issue now.
            She is... insane. And we've had
            more cases, 10 in the last hour.

  The Doctor leaves.

  Jones turns to Silus.

                      JONES
            What is this? What is it?

                      SILUS
            It comes from Edgar. He has shared
            his blood with them.

                      JONES
            You're telling me that he's out
            there spreading this around?

  Jones gets close to Silus, intimidating.
                                                                        83




                         JONES
                      (continuing)
               He'll give it to Lilly!

    Dominic gets in between.

                         DOMINIC
               Jones! Back off.

    Dominic pushes Jones back and then stares at Silus.

                         DOMINIC
                      (continuing)
               This is spreading.

    Silus doesn't speak, just stares at Steph.

                         DOMINIC
                      (continuing)
               Brother Silus?

                         JONES
               That's it, Lilly's dead.

                         SILUS
               No. He will keep her alive.

                        DOMINIC
               Why?

                         SILUS
               So that I will come for him.
               That's what he wants.

    Dominic pulls an envelope from his jacket and passes it to
    Silus, who opens it to discover a beautifully handwritten
    letter.

                         DOMINIC
               It says, "Everything flows from
               me. My blood will change the
               world." What does that mean?

    Silus stares at the two men. Then turns to Steph, her eyes,
    creepy, still locked on Silus.

103A EXT: JAMESTOWN SLUM BUILDING, ROOF - NIGHT                  103A

    Jamestown, from above. We drift down so that we see the
    buildings, see fires breaking out, hear screams echoing
    through the night. We continue down towards the rooftop of
    one building in particular. We see one of the infected
    citizens of Jamestown standing on the roof, screaming out
    into the night like some crazed animal.

    We continue past the creature, then travel through a
    ventilation shaft on the roof. We hurtle down this, down,
    down to the depths of the building and out the shaft into a
    subterranean basement. We drift through a doorway in the wet
    stone wall, down a tunnel, to finally enter a room.

    And we see Lilly. She is covered in grime, her hands bound
    above her head with chains to an ancient, ornate pipes that
    twist through the place. She looks up at us.

    Cut to


103B INT: JAMESTOWN SLUM, HIDEOUT, CELL - CONTINUING             103B

    Edgar, now standing above Lilly. He bends down, checking the
    chains that bind her. His face moves close to her so that he
    can smell her. Hear her heart pounding. See the scars from
    his previous attack. Then a noise, echoing through the
    tunnels. The sound of the mad infected denizens of the
    containment zone, screaming out into the night. Edgar smiles.

                        EDGAR
              It almost sounds like children
              playing, don't you think?

                        LILLY
              No.

                        EDGAR
              I looked at your body. You have
              borne a child.

    Lilly's features tense.

                        EDGAR
                     (continuing)
              Did you abandon it? Your kind are
              good at that.

    Even though her position is impossible, Lilly won't show
    Edgar fear.

                        LILLY
              Why don't you just kill me?

    Edgar just smiles. Lilly spits in his face and screams at him.
                                                               85



                   LILLY
                (continuing)
         Kill me!

Edgar grabs her by the throat, for a moment anger boils out
of Edgar, but he restrains himself.

                   EDGAR
         I can see why he likes you. But I
         have a better use for you. To save
         you, Silus will take my blood.
         Join me.

                   LILLY
         You're insane.

                   EDGAR
         The world is insane. I am better
         than you. But they force me to
         serve you. Does that happen in a
         sane world? Forced to watch you
         waste the most precious thing you
         have. Life.

Then Edgar's face changes; he stares at her with pity, for a
moment we see a hint of the noble creature he used to be.

                   EDGAR
                (continuing)
         Do you know what they do to us
         when we are born? They take us
         from our mothers. Force us into a
         life of loneliness, and denial.
         Can you imagine a life like that?

Lilly senses an opening.

                   LILLY
         You don't have to do this. You can
         change things.

Edgar places his head in his hands, he seems to be weeping.

                   EDGAR
         You have reminded me of something.

When he looks back up at her, he is terrifying to behold.

                   EDGAR
                (continuing)
         I must search out my mother, if
         she still lives. And kill her for
         what she did.
                                                                      86




   Edgar smiles quietly, rises and exits.

   We are left with Lilly bound to the rusty pipes. She strains,
   tries to pull her hands from the chains, but they won't move.
   Above her on the pipe there is a old rusty bracket. Lilly
   blinks through the sweat running into her eyes. She moves the

   chains that bind her hands closer to the bracket and begins
   rubbing the chains against the bracket in the vain hope that
   she may be able to cut her way through the chains. She
   strains harder and harder, fighting back the tears, the fear,
   she just grinds at the chain repetitively.

105 INT: HOSPITAL, VARIOUS - CONTINUING                         105

   We see Silus. Staring through a window into an office. In
   there we can see Jones. Jones is talking in a very animated
   manner to someone who is obviously a reporter. The reporter
   stares, like Jones, through the window towards Silus. Jones
   turns away, looking guilty.

   Cut to

   Bedlam in the hospital corridors. People screaming, being
   restrained. What is clear is that the virus Steph had has now
   broken out into a plague of biblical proportions. We see a
   DOCTOR standing in the middle of the hospital corridor, blood
   over his smock, in a state of pure shock.

   And we see Silus there. A perfect creature observing the
   chaos. As he stands there he can see a small child; a girl,
   maybe around five. Silus stares at the child. The girl is
   holding her mother's hand. Her mother lies on a cot, strapped
   down; there are many other cots filling the crowded hallway.
   Her mother is dead. The girl's dirty face is stained with
   tears. For a moment Silus wavers.

   Then he moves over to the girl. She    stares up at him with her
   tear stained grimy face. Silus goes    to place his hand on her
   forehead as blessing, but the child    cringes, then jumps up
   and escapes down the hallway. Silus    can only stare at the
   horror of it all.

    speaker, hearing an interview coming from it.

               Some say this plague is the result
               of genetic experimentation, by the

               Jamestown now under quarantine.

    Armed, gas masked guards stand with their guns at the ready.
    Beyond the blockade is Jamestown. Fires burn, bodies lie on
    the streets.

               They say the Queen has left the
               city... Is this martial law?

    A figure is stumbling towards us. One of the guards fires and
    the figure drops.

110 INT: BROTHERHOOD BUILDING, FOYER - DAY                     110

   There is an angry mob, banging on the locked doors of the
   brotherhood building. Their placards tell the tale. "Brothers
   have brought the plague." "No to Genetic experimentation."

                        EDGAR
                     (off)
              Do you like the world I am making
              for us, Silus? I haven't had your
              little policewoman yet. But I will
              soon. You'll just have to find me.
              You know where I am. Everything
              flows from me. Remember that...

   Human police stand ready with guns. It's a disaster. Silus is
   there. He watches the faces of the mob, baying for blood. He
   sees them burning the emblems of the brotherhood.

                                             DISSOLVE TO:


111 INT: BROTHERHOOD BUILDING, AUGUSTUS' OFFICE - CONTINUING   111

   We are in a beautifully ornate office. It is like a private
   chapel. We see Silus enter. He is grim. Augustus is kneeling
   in prayer. He senses Silus.

                        AUGUSTUS
              The infection is spreading. Each
              day he shares his blood with more
              of them. Even though they are
              locked in their homes.
                                                                89




                   SILUS
         He is somewhere in the quarantine
         zone. I will find him.

Augustus turns to Silus. Augustus moves closer to him, stares
into Silus' strange, pale eyes.

                   AUGUSTUS
         Clear. So very clear your eyes.
         The way they were when you were
         born. There will be no search.

Augustus moves off to his desk. Silus is shocked.

                   SILUS
         No search?

                   AUGUSTUS
         The Queen has instructed the
         government to evacuate the city
         around the quarantine zone. In
         another day they will take action.

                   SILUS
         What kind of action?

                   AUGUSTUS
         Eradication. Of everything within
         the area. They will burn it all.
         Including Edgar.

                   SILUS
         And the innocents there, who are
         not infected?

                   AUGUSTUS
         It is a necessary step. We cannot
         let this escape.

                   SILUS
         No!

Augustus looks up at Silus; this is perhaps the first time
Silus has refused anything that Augustus has decreed.
                                                                     90




                       AUGUSTUS
             Is it the policewoman? Is this
             affecting your thinking? There is
             no love for our kind Silus. Only
             service.

                       SILUS
             We have done this. Released this
             thing into the world. We have
             betrayed their trust in us, more
             than once. I won't do it again.

                       AUGUSTUS
             There is no debate. They will be
             sacrificed, so the rest will be
             pure.

   Silus shakes his head.

                       AUGUSTUS
                    (continuing)
             This policeman, Jones. He talked
             to the press. Told them this came
             from Edgar.

   Silus watches Augustus very carefully.

                       AUGUSTUS
                    (continuing)
             There are members of the inner
             circle who question the way you
             have handled this. Blame you for
             this man's actions. I have made it
             clear that you will fix this. That
             you will silence him.

   Augustus moves close to Silus now. Gently touches his face.

                       AUGUSTUS
                    (continuing)
             These are hard things we do. But
             you must think of the greater
             good. And of your own future.

112 INT: JONES APARTMENT, HALL - NIGHT                         112

   Jones exits an elevator. The light above him flickers and
   dies. He stands in the dark.
                                                                      91




                       JONES
             Great.

   Jones begins to stomp down the hall, towards the part of the
   hall that is lit. Then pop, that light goes out as well.

   Jones stops. He pulls out his big gun from his armpit
   holster. He checks over his shoulder, and then with the gun
   extended he moves slowly forward. He approaches an area that
   opens up a little. He pauses, then under his breath.

                       JONES
                    (continuing)
             Come on then...

   He launches himself around the corner and fires his gun. He's
   lucky that his misses his target.

   A small, dirty, cowering boy with his fingers on the bank of
   light switches. The wall next to the boy's head has exploded;
   dust and wall board now drift down like snow.

   Jones can only stare at the quivering child whose dirty face
   blank with fright.

   Then Jones turns. He can make out a figure in the dark hall.
   A patient, quiet sentinel.


113 INT: JONES APARTMENT - NIGHT                                113

   Jones opens the door to his apartment and enters. Silus
   follows. The place is a dump. Lounge and kitchen all one
   area, bedroom off to one side, dishes in the sink, clothes
   everywhere. Jones heads into the kitchen and turns on a
   coffee machine, then grabs a dirty glass, pours a drink.
   Silus watches him.

   Jones comes into the lounge. He still has his gun in his
   hand. He stares at Silus, whose perfect outline makes Jones'
   life seem even more abysmal.

                       JONES
             What do you want?

                       SILUS
             I want to help you. They know you
             talked to the press.

                       JONES
             They can fuck off. For that
             matter, so can you.

   Jones takes a slurp on his drink.
                                                                92



                   JONES
                (continuing)
         You'd be the last person I'd trust.

                   SILUS
         Why?

                   JONES
         I saw you. Remember. Watching
         Lilly, when she was asleep.

Silus doesn't answer now. Jones moves forward.

                   JONES
                (continuing)
         Maybe you're just like your
         Brother. Maybe you're helping him.
         Now there's a thought.

Jones prods Silus' shoulder with the gun.

                   JONES
                (continuing)
         Do you know where she is?

Jones prods again and finds Silus' elegant steel fingers
around his wrist. The two men face off.

                   JONES
                (continuing)
         You've changed. Not the outside.
         But inside. I know you. You know
         what, I can see myself?

Jones tries to wrench his wrist free, but Silus holds it
tight. Jones swings his free arm and smashes Silus on the
side of the face.

For a moment Silus doesn't move, then his hand is around
Jones' throat. Squeezing. Squeezing. His other hand wrenching
the gun from Jones' hand. There is silence in the room, apart
from Jones' choking gags. Then Silus pushes Jones back so
that he flies into a chair. Jones stares up at Silus now,
fear in his eyes. Silus watches him. Then a sound attracts
his attention.

Water hisses from Jones' coffee machine in the kitchen.

   Silus, turning, listening, focusing on the water dripping
   from the coffee machine. Silus is concentrating. Realization
   comes into his eyes.

   We zoom close to Silus' ear. The soundtrack becomes enhanced.

   Cut to

   The tap in Jones' festering sink, dripping; plop plop plop.
   We see the water in the bottom of the sink reflecting the
   room. We see Silus approaching; reflected there. His hand
   enters frame and touches the water. And we hear Edgar's
   voice, the words we heard him say in Augustus' office.

                       EDGAR
                    (off)
             You know where I am. Everything

   the figure is bleeding himself into the water. It is Edgar.

   We see a subterranean water system. We see Edgar at the edge
   of a pool, bleeding himself into the water supply. Edgar
   looks up. His eyes reflect at us, blinking like an animal's.

   Lilly in her cell, still grinding away at the chains that
   bind her hands. She stops, as if she's heard something,

   Jones laying out a map of the city on his kitchen table;
   empty booze bottles roll out of the way. Jones has a pen and
   he's marking off an area.

                       JONES
             There's the quarantine zone. It's
             a pit. Slums.

                       SILUS
             The water supply. Where is it?

   Jones searches and then pin points an area in the center of
   the quarantine zone.

                       JONES
             There, all the old suburbs are
             supplied by their own artesian
             wells. Mineral springs. That's why
             it hasn't broken out of Jamestown,
             it's the water. Jamestown's water.

   The two men stare at each other, both reaching the same
   conclusion.

                       SILUS
             He is there, with Lilly.

   We see the Map.

   Cut to a crane down to reveal Silus and Jones observing the
   guards at the blockade.

             You'll never get in, they've
             circled the whole borough.

   Silus turns to Jones.

                       SILUS
             I will get in. You must go to the
             press. Tell them about the water.
             Tell them what the government will
             do.

                       JONES
             You're dead after this. You know
             that? Whatever happens.

   Silus smiles.

                       SILUS
             Watch for me, Officer Jones.
                                                                     95




    Silus exits. Jones watches him leave, then Jones leaves too.


117 EXT: JAMESTOWN SLUM, QUARANTINE ZONE - CONTINUOUS         117

    We see Silus, close. It's as if he is meditating. We pull out
    to reveal he is kneeling on the roof of a building; he looks
    as if he's preparing himself for something.

    He then rises, all fluid concentration, and runs towards us
    and then the camera is on his shoulder as he jumps off the
    roof.

    Silus turns and is gone.

119 EXT: JAMESTOWN SLUM, QUARANTINE ZONE - CONTINUOUS         119

    The slums are wrapped in smoke and haze from fires that burn
    there; an eerie dead zone, made all the stranger by the
    gothic spires that climb out of the haze.

    Then Silus hears something. It is the wailing of a new born
    child. Silus moves towards the cries, then up ahead he sees
    a figure, kneeling on the ground. As Silus moves through the
    haze he sees what it is. It is a Brother Priest, kneeling
    beside someone. The Brother is holding the hand of the person
    on the ground who is in the last throws of death. When Silus
    is next to him the Priest looks up at him. Tears wet his
    cheeks. For a moment they just stare at each other.

                        PRIEST 2
              Who has done this, Brother?

                        SILUS
              We have. To our shame.
                                                                        96




    The Silus hears the babies cries again. Closer now. The
    Priest stares at the dying creature on the ground in front of
    him. Drops the limp hand he was holding. Then rises and turns
    squarely to Silus.

                        PRIEST 2
              I have something to show you.

    The Priest moves off towards a building and Silus follows.

119A INT: JAMESTOWN SLUM, QUARANTINE ZONE, HOVEL - CONTINUING    119A

    We see Silus and the Priest enter. The Priest leads Silus
    into the dark place. As he moves forward Silus can hear a
    strange gurgling sound; not of the sick or dying, this is a
    more innocent sound. The sounds of a newborn.

    We See Silus approach a filthy, roughly made crib. In it is
    a baby; it's eyes stare up at Silus with wisdom beyond their
    years.

                        PRIEST 2
              It is a miracle my Brother. She is
              a female, the first of our kind.

    Silus watches the baby carefully.

                        SILUS
              She must be protected.

    He then turns to the Priest.

                        SILUS
                     (continuing)
              I would ask for your help Brother.

    Edgar, atop the roof of the building that sits above the
    water treatment plant. He is watching his handiwork; the
    screams in the night, the burning fires, the haze rising up,
    cloaking the city. Then down below, he sees a figure
    approaching. He knows who it is. Silus is coming to him.

                                                                   97




120 INT: JAMESTOWN SLUM, HIDEOUT, CELL - CONTINUING          120

   Lilly, in her cell. She is working the chains that bind her
   hands against the pipe. She's rubbing them desperately,
   harder, harder. Then she stops. She can hear someone
   approaching.

   Edgar appears in the doorway; still and poised. Then he
   turns, listening. A creaking echoes through the tunnels as if
   an iron door, somewhere above, has been opened.

                       EDGAR
             He's coming little one. He's
             coming for you.

   Edgar takes one more blinking look at Lilly and then leaves,
   slamming the large iron door behind him.

   Lilly pulls at the chains, hoping against hope that they'll
   break. They don't.

                       LILLY
             No.

   She now looks above. The pipe her chains are connected to
   runs up towards the roof, then takes a bend to disappear into
   the wall near the door. She bangs on the pipe. There is a
   little movement where it goes into the wall. Just enough to
   give her some hope.

   Lilly struggles now to her feet. She slides the chains up. To
   get the chains over the bend she'll have to jump. She does,
   sliding the chain over the bend. Now she hangs from the pipe,
   the chains cutting into her wrists viciously, making her
   groan. She then gets her hands on the pipe and begins sliding
   along the pipe until she is near the door. She then reaches
   up with her feet and kicks at the wall, pushing, trying to
   dislodge the pipe. It moves, water leaks from it. But it does
   not give way.

   A desperate beat. Then she reaches down to the door with her
   foot. She tries to force down the door handle, her foot wet
   and slippery. Finally she gets the handle down, opens the
   door so that it clangs against the wall.

                       LILLY
                    (continuing)
             Hello! I'm down here. Silus...

   Her hands slip from the pipe and again the chains bite into
   her wrist. She cries out in pain.

   Cut to
                                                                     98


121 INT: JAMESTOWN SLUM, HIDEOUT - CONTINUING                 121

    Above we see Silus, stopping. Lilly's cries echo through the
    place. It is a wet maze of grease and rust, ornate twisting
    pipes built long ago and now decrepit. Silus waits, listens.
    Then something.

    Cut to

    Feet, moving fast, splashing in a pool of black water.

    Silus turns, just catching a movement, a flash of someone
    moving off through the distorted piping. He moves to where he
    saw the figure, to catch sight of a person moving to an open
    iron doorway.

                        SILUS
              Lilly?

    But when the woman turns it is not Lilly. It is one of the
    infected; the red eyes, mad and staring at him. And both he
    and the creature hear it. Cries, of someone in pain. Lilly.

    Cut to


121A INT: JAMESTOWN SLUM, HIDEOUT, STAIRWELL - CONTINUING     121A

    Lilly's cries echo up the stairwell, up towards the surface.

    Cut to


121B INT: JAMESTOWN SLUM, HIDEOUT, CELL - CONTINUING          121B

    Lilly twisting on the chains that bind her to the pipe,
    crying out in pain.

    Cut to


121C INT: JAMESTOWN SLUM, HIDEOUT                             121C

    The creature moving through the doorway towards the sounds of
    Lilly's cries. Silus now moves forward to get to the
    creature, flying towards the doorway. We see him approaching
    the doorway and then from nowhere Edgar slams into Silus,
    sending them both careening over a railing.


121D INT: JAMESTOWN SLUM, HIDEOUT, STAIRWELL - CONTINUING     121D

    Low Angle looking directly up at the two Brothers fall,
    bouncing and crashing off the rails on the way down.
                                                                       99




121E INT: JAMESTOWN SLUM, HIDEOUT, STEAMROOM - CONTINUING       121E

    They both hit the wet stone floor. They are in the pipe room
    where subterranean mineral springs rise up from deep in the
    earth and where the boroughs water supply is sterilized.

    Silus is stunned, rises, blood issuing from his mouth. Silus
    pulls his gun from his coat, but Edgar's kick is too fast,
    whipping the gun away so that the glass instrument smashes
    against some dripping pipes. Edgar then squares off against
    Silus.

                        EDGAR
              It is a maze down here. But given
              time, that thing will find her. Do
              things to her. I'll show you where
              she is, if you take some.

    Edgar stalks forward. He holds up his arm to Silus.

    Silus stares at the tube coming from Edgar's arm. Edgar moves
    towards Silus, twisting on the tube so that his infected
    blood drips onto the ground.

                        EDGAR
                     (continuing)
              You're almost there anyway.

    And then Silus' face, intense, a dark smile, his hand now
    gripping Edgar's hand; surprise in Edgar's eyes.

    He pulls Edgar toward him with all his might, his hand
    clamping onto Edgar's throat - the power of the entwined
    bodies immense - then Edgar whipping his body, breaking
    Silus' grip, smashing Silus on the side of the head, but then
    only to get a kick from Silus directly in the stomach that
    sends him smashing into several protruding pipes, ripping
    into his back. Edgar screams.
                                                                   100



122 INT: JAMESTOWN SLUM, HIDEOUT, CELL - CONTINUING          122

   Lilly. Half conscious now, hanging from the pipe above her,
   twisting. The sound of Edgar's screams makes her groan,
   awaken a little, dazed. Then there is a loud clang. She
   cranes her head to see down the tunnel that leads to her
   cell. She catches sight of a shadow, movement in the tunnel.

                        LILLY
             Silus...
                                                                101


Then the figure moves into the tunnel, shuffling, the legs
not completely following the brains instructions, but doing
enough to propel the person forward, then a stumble. And in
a shaft of light Lilly can see a hand slapping at the wet
wall. But it is less a hand than a claw. And the face that
follows the hand; the red, reflective eyes of one of the half
mad, the infected. The thing catches sight of Lilly, then
propels itself towards her.

We see it's POV, approaching faster, faster.

And Lilly reaching out with her foot, to the door, struggling
to hook it with her foot, trying to close it, almost catching
the door handle, but her foot is so slippery and the thing is
almost on her. Then she stretches out with her foot, just
catching the door and slams it in the face of the thing that
is about to attack her.

The thing on the other side of the door is now screaming
wildly and the door handle is jerking down as the creature
tries to activate it and Lilly has her feet on it, trying
desperately to keep the door shut, but her feet keep
slipping. And then she realizes that the pipe from which she
hangs is beginning to wobble - water is now coursing from the
hole in the wall, beginning to flow faster and faster. Her
feet slip more and more on the door.

Lilly tries to keep the door closed, but her feet are too
slippery and the thing is pushing through the door. In the
dark space only its eyes and slavering mouth are clear, hands
grasping for Lilly legs, scratching at them, Lilly twisting,
the creature's nails searching for purchase on her legs.
Lilly hauls herself up, wrapping her legs around the pipe
she's attached to. The thing below her is groaning
incoherently, reaching up, its hands grabbing at her, Lilly
pulling herself just out of reach, then seeing the eyes below
her, wanting her. Lilly tries to pull herself higher. And
then she feels it. The pipe she's attached to is shifting,
where it joins the wall. Water is now flooding from it, the
pipe jerks down, some of the old wall giving way.

The creature's fingers are now able to grasp Lilly's t-shirt,
drag at it, pull at her, screaming, the pipe grinding, water
flowing and then the whole thing comes down, the pipe
bursting out of the wall.

Lilly and the pipe falls, right on top of the creature.

For a moment neither of them move, then the creature is
grabbing at Lilly's hair, pulling her head back. In a flash
Lilly pulls the pipe to which she is attached right into the
face of the creature. This gives her time to stagger upright.

She's still chained around the pipe; she can see the end of
the pipe near the door.
                                                                        102




    She begins to slide the chains back as the creature begins to
    rise and advance towards her. Lilly desperately slides the
    chain along the pipe. It catches on a protrusion, while the
    creature advances. Lilly frees it just in time, falling
    backwards as the creature jumps at her, Lilly lifting the
    chain up to hold the creature back. The creature strains to
    get at Lilly. Lilly now has the chain at the creature's neck.
    She begins to tighten it around the creature's neck, her only
    hope now. The creature changes now, from frightening to
    pitiful as it realizes it can't breath, it's fingers
    desperately moving over Lilly's face, almost pleading. Tears
    form in Lilly's eyes as she tightens the stranglehold; there
    is no anger there, just desperation, and behind that, pity.

    The creature breathes it's last breath then collapses onto
    Lilly.


123 OMITTED                                                      123

124                                                              124


124A INT: JAMESTOWN SLUM, HIDEOUT, STEAMROOM - CONTINUING        124A

    Edgar and Silus stalk each other in the steam room. Edgar
    launches himself towards Silus, but Silus is now too quick.
    Silus slams Edgar sideways into a pipe, an imprint of Edgar's
    face left on the pipe.
                                                                103




Stunned Edgar releases his grip, stumbles back, Silus rising
now, he has him. Again, Silus slams Edgar's head into another
pipe. And now Silus has Edgar's throat in his fist and the
look on Silus' face tells Edgar he will not escape.

We see Edgar, beginning to lose consciousness now, dying.
Steam now rises all around them from broken pipes. Then
behind Silus, Edgar can make something out. An old, corroded
tank, steaming, with the words sterilizer on it. There are a
series of long shafts connected to the sterilizer via a tube
and held in position by clamps; they look like they're for
sterilizing bottles.

With a last effort Edgar propels Silus backwards onto one of
the shafts, making Silus grimace and clutch his back where
he's been pierced, then slide to the ground. The piercing has
operated some lever so that steam now also drifts from the
wound on Silus' back.

Cut to

Silus looking up, clutching his back with the pain of it.

And now Edgar above him. He removes one of the sterilizer
shafts from the bracket that holds it. He clutches a lever on
the side which makes viciously hot steam pulse from the end
of the shaft. Edgar moves slowly towards Silus.

We see Silus, unable to rise, crawling back, until bang, he's
stopped by more pipes behind him. Nowhere to go.

And Edgar ready to pounce. He does, driving the shaft towards
Silus' head. Silus manages to raise one hand to Edgar's wrist
to stop the shaft from piercing his skull. Now the shaft is
right in Silus' face, the lightly steaming hole staring back
at Silus. Edgar's finger moves to the lever on the side of
the shaft, ready to get some steam going.

                   EDGAR
         If I burn the skin from your face,
         I wonder how that would be. If you
         looked like a monster...

Cut to

Edgar's finger moving over the steaming lever. The steaming
end of the shaft right in Silus' face.

Then Edgar's face as he watches his brothers face for the
last time.

The blasting sound of steam and a steaming blast from the
shaft drifts into our frame.

Cut to Silus. His face is not scolded.
                                                                     104




   Cut back to Edgar, his expression getting tighter, his face
   redder, the whites of his eyes becoming bloodshot. Then he
   goes to speak, but now words come out, only a swirling puff
   of steam.

   And then he falls and we see behind him, standing there is
   Lilly, one of the other sterilizing shafts in her hand; steam
   still rising from the sharp end of it.

   Cut to Edgar, prone, on the wet floor of the pipe room; steam
   rises from both his mouth and the back of his head.

                                             DISSOLVE TO:


125 EXT: JAMESTOWN SLUM, QUARANTINE ZONE - NIGHT               125

   POV steadicaming through the streets of the Quarantine zone.

   The POV belongs to Lilly who moves down the street, half
   carrying Silus who limps. Lilly takes in the devastation.
   Then Silus pulls up.

                       LILLY
             What is it?

                         SILUS
             In there.

   Silus is pointing to a fallen down building through the haze
   and the rain.

                       LILLY
             Is there something wrong?

                         SILUS
             No.

   He gently touches her mud smeared face.

                       SILUS
                    (continuing)
             There is something very precious.
             You must take it, keep it secret.
             Don't let them touch it.

                       LILLY
             I don't understand.

                         SILUS
             You will.
                                                                      105




   And then they both hear it. A wail, distorted, echoing; it
   sounds like a hurt animal. Lilly looks at Silus.

                         SILUS
                      (continuing)
             Hurry.

   Lilly turns towards the building. She slowly moves towards
   it, into the doorway as Silus watches her go. Silus turns to
   the sunrise, it reflects in his eyes.

   Cut to


126 INT: JAMESTOWN SLUM, QUARANTINE ZONE, BUILDING, NIGHT       126

   Lilly moves through the derelict place, past fallen beams. It
   seems empty. Then Lilly hears it again. A wail. This time she
   knows what it is; we can tell from the way her eyes glisten.

   She moves forward, closer to the sound. And finally she sees
   the Brother Priest we saw before, who kneels in front of a
   crate. He looks up at her as she approaches.

   As Lilly moves forward she sees what lies with the crate.
   Wrapped in dirty sacking, there is a baby.

   In the corner Lilly can see a woman - the child's mother -
   dead from the infection.

   The baby cries and Lilly can see the tiny fangs of a Brother
   in the baby's mouth.

                       PRIEST 2
             The first female of her kind. The
             first daughter given to us.

   Lilly moves forward. Emotional music rises in the soundtrack;
   evoking memory, the circle completing. Lilly reaches out,
   letting the baby girl grip her hand. Lilly reaches into the
   crate, drawing the baby into her arms, staring down into the
   baby's face; a face somehow already wise, already serene.
   Broken tears run down Lilly's cheek as she presses the baby
   to herself, all the pain of the past flooding over her, the
   baby's tiny hands reaching out, clasping onto her.

                       PRIEST 2
                    (continuing)
             Come. Before they find her.

   Cut to
                                                                      106




127 EXT: JAMESTOWN SLUM, QUARANTINE ZONE - DAWN                 127

   Lilly exits the building. She looks around for Silus, but he
   has gone. She pauses. Through the mist and drifting smoke
   from the fires we can see that in the distance a tarnished
   sun is lighting the horizon.

                       PRIEST 2
             We must go.

   After a final pause Lilly moves off with the Priest, carrying
   the tiny bundle with her.

                         LILLY
                         (VO)
              For me, everything has changed now.
              Because of Silus I see the world
              through new eyes.

                                            FADE OUT:


128 EXT: LILLY'S APARTMENT - NIGHT                              128

   Silus, on a fire escape, in the shadows. Gone are the clothes
   of the Brotherhood, rather he is dressed as someone who does
   not want to be seen.

   Cut to his POV. We see Lilly's building. We see through the
   window, into her apartment; a beacon of warmth in the night.

   In Lilly's bed we can see the baby, its hands happily making
   patterns before its eyes.

                        LILLY
                        (VO)
              Now I see hope, and I see a child,
              the first female of her kind.



   Silus scans the apartment.

   He can see the lounge. Jones is there with Lilly. Lilly is
   dressed to go out; to leave. Jones and Lilly hug. Then Jones
   picks up two suitcases and moves towards the door.

   Silus watches as Lilly moves into the bedroom and reaches
   down for the tiny baby, its tiny arms clasping onto her as
   she lifts it.

                       LILLY
                       (VO)
              Perhaps Edgar got what he wanted
              after all, because it time this
              child will truly change our world.
                                                                107


We see Silus, closer, watching.

Cut to

Lilly, pausing, moving to the window of her apartment,
staring out into the night, almost directly toward Silus. She
raises her hand, as if in a gesture of goodbye and then she
leaves.

Cut to

Silus, close, nodding.

	September, 1996


	TITLES EXPLODE TO WHITE

	SLOW FADE TO:

	EXTREME CLOSE-UP of MAXIMILIAN COHEN'S eyes popping open.

	INT. MAX'S APARTMENT -CHINATOWN FLAT  NEW YORK CITY - NIGHT

	Max jolts his head from his desk and tries to orient him-self 
	in the darkness. He has intelligent eyes set in an exhausted, 
	good-looking face.

	Then he notices the blood dripping from his nose. Max wipes 
	it.

	Max's voiceover begins:

				MAX (V.O.)  
		Monday, September first. 
		Six-fifteen.

	INT. BATHROOM - DAWN

	A pull-string light flips on. Max examines his bloody nose in 
	the mirror.

				MAX (V.O.) 
		The alchemist awakes. 
			(Imitating) 
		"Turn lead into gold, Max, 
		lead into gold." Today, I find it.

	TIGHT ON

	Max's hand as three unmarked, circular pills hit his palm. 
	Then, he slams the pills into the back of his mouth.

	Max replaces the cap on a plastic bottle of unmarked 
	prescription drugs. He drinks from the sink and splashes a 
	generous amount of water onto his head and face, cleaning his 
	nose.

	He wipes his nose and examines the last remnants of blood on 
	his fingertip. Then, he dips his finger under the tap.

	INT. MAX'S APARTMENT - MAIN ROOM - DAY

	Max's room is constantly dark because the windows are blacked 
	out. He flips on his desk lamp.

	A tiny ANT crawls across his desk. He looks at it for a moment 
	before getting angry and squashing it.

	Sitting on the desk are three computer monitors, which Max 
	flips on.

	Then he pops on more lights and more switches. We pull back 
	revealing that Max's apartment looks more like the inside of a 
	computer than a human's home.

	The room is knee-high in computer parts of all shapes and 
	sizes. The walls are covered with circuit boards. Cables hang 
	from the ceiling like vines in a Brazilian rain forest. They 
	all seem to be wired together forming a monstrous homemade 
	computer.

	This is EUCLID, Max's creation. The computer is alive with 
	sounds and lights.

	Max works on Euclid with his solder and drill. He cares for 
	the machine as if it were his dream car

				MAX (V.O.) 
		Heat's been getting 
		to Euclid. Feel it most in 
		the afternoon when I run the 
		set. Have to keep the fans on 
		all night from now on. 
		Otherwise, everything is 
		running topnotch. The stack 
		of 286's is now faster than 
		Columbia's computer science 
		department. I spent a couple 
		hundred dollars. Columbia's 
		cost? Half a million? 
			(Small snicker) 
		Ha...
	
	Max checks the peephole on His front door. No one is there. He 
	unbolts the five lock and slides into the hall.

	INT. APARTMENJ HALLWAY - DAY

	As he secures his apartment, a Young girl named JENNA runs up 
	to him. Her MOM, down the hall, looks apologetic.

	Jenna's eyes light up and she pulls out her Fisher Price 
	calculator.

				JENNA 
		Max, Max! Can we do one?
	
				MOM 
			(Over and over again) 
		Jenna! Jenna!
	
				MAX 
		Oh, no.
	
				JENNA 
		What's three hundred 
		and twenty-two times four 
		hundred and ninety-one.
	
	Jenna types it into her calculator. Max finishes locking his 
	door.

				MAX 
			(instantly) 
		One hundred fifty-eight thousand, 
		a hundred two. Right?

				JENNA 
			(Eyes light up) 
		Right.
	
	Max heads down the staircase.

				MOM 
		Jenna...
	
	Jenna screams after him.

				JENNA 
		Okay, seventy-three 
		divided by twenty-two.

				MAX 
			(instantly again) 
		Three point three one eight one 
		eight one eight...

	EXT. CHINATOWN - DAY 
	Max watches people bustle through the busy intersections of 
	Chinatown. The streets are clogged with people.

				MAX (V.O.) 
		Somewhere in there. 
		Somewhere. I know it's right 
		in front of me. The pattern. 
		They say it's chaos, it can't 
		be understood, too much 
		complexity.

	EXT. ELECTRONIC MEGADUMP - DAY 
	Max scavenges electronic parts as he carefully navigates an 
	endless dump for old and rotting computers.

				MAX (V.O.) 
		History it's there. 
		Lurking, shaping. 
		structuring, hiding, right 
		beneath the surface.

	He unscrews a random IBM Board from a keyboard and slides it 
	into his pocket.

	EXT PLAYGROUND  DAY 
	MOVE IN
	on Max looking up at something as he reclines on a public 
	bench.

				MAX (V.0.) 
		The cycling of disease epidemics, 
		the wax and wane of Caribou populations 
		in the Arctic, sunspot cycles, 
		the rise and fall of the 
		Nile and yes! the New York Stock 
		Exchange, they are all the 
		same.
	
	MOVE IN
	on a tree branch - shaking gently in the wind.

	SLOW DISSOLVE TO EXTREME CLOSE-UP OF STOCK TICKER 
	Bright stock quotes drift across the screen.

				MAX (V.O.) 
		I'll find this structure, 
		this order, this perfection.

	INT. MAX'S APARTMENT - DAY 
	Max stares intensely at the ticker on the small TV that sits 
	next to his monitors.

				MAX (V.O.) 
		Turn lead into gold. 
		The first. Right here. Right 
		here. With math. The numbers 
		of the stock market are my 
		lead. When I find the 
		pattern, then I will find 
		gold.
	
	Max watches the right edge of the screen where the numbers 
	appear. He wants to see what's before that edge...

	Max slaps the RETURN button on his computer.

	The phone starts ringing.
	Max eyes it suspiciously.

	Just then, Euclid starts printing results on an old dot-
	matrix printer.

	Max suspiciously answers The phone.

				MAX 
		Hello?
	
				WOMAN'S VOICE 
		Maximilian Cohen, please.
	
				MAX 
		Yeah?
	
				WOMAN'S VOICE 
		Mr. Cohen?
	
				MAX 
		Who's this?
	
				WOMAN'S VOICE 
		Hi. my name is Marcy Dawson. 
		I'm a partner with the predictive 
		strategy firm Lancet-Percy. Can I 
		speak with Mr. Cohen, please?

				MAX 
		I told you...
	
	The printer finishes printing.

				MARCY DAWSON 
		Mr. Cohen! How 
		are you? It's been a long 
		time. Sorry I haven't been in 
		touch. But I was hoping you 
		would allow me to take you to 
		lunch tomorrow, say one 
		o'clock?
	
				MAX 
		Sorry, I can't.
	
				MARCY DAWSON 
		We're very anxious to talk 
		with you, sir

				MAX 
		I can't.
	
				MARCY DAWSON 
		I'm prepared to 
		make you a generous...

	Max hurries to wrap up the conversation.

				MAX 
		I don't take offers for 
		my research. You know that. 
		Sorry, I Couldn't help you.
	
				MARCY DAWSON 
		Mr. Cohen, give 
		me a moment...

	But before Marcy finishes, Max hangs up. He rips off the 
	printout and heads to the front door.

	He checks the peephole, His landlady. MRS. OVADIA, is sweeping 
	the hallway stairs humming a turn-of-the century (the last 
	one, not this one) tune.

	Max waits a moment. He tousles his hair. Then he checks again. 
	She's gone. He opens his locks and releases several bolts.

	INT.MAX'S BUILDING HALLWAY - DAY

	Max locks his front door. Meanwhile, his next-door neighbor, 
	DEVI MINSTRY, a sexy young Indian woman, is just getting home. 
	Max looks away and tries to get his door locked.

	She's weighted down by a bunch of bags filled with food.

				DEVI 
		Max, good! 
	
				MAX 
		Hi, Devi.
	
				DEV1 
		I grabbed you some 
		somosas. 
				MAX 
		Great.
	
	Devi heads over to Max with her bags of food. She looks up at 
	Max.

				DEVI 
		Your hair.
	
	Devi hands the bags to Max. Then she goes to pat down his 
	Hair. Max retreats.

				MAX 
		What are you doing?
	
				DEVI 
		Your hair, you can't go 
		out like that. Don't worry. 
				MAX 
		It's fine. It's fine.
	
	Devi pats down his hair. Max is humiliated. 
				DEVI 
		You need a mom.
	
	Max hands back the bags and heads quickly for the stairs. 
				MAX 
		I have to go.
	
				DEVI 
		Your somosas!
	
	An embarrassed Max takes the bag.

				MAX 
		Thanks.
	
	INT. COFFEE SHOP - DAY

	At the counter, Max stirs cream into his coffee. Then he takes 
	three pills from the plastic bottle and drops them in his 
	coffee.

	Max flips past a full-page ad in the paper that reads 
	LANCET-PERCY 86% ACCURACY (ONLY GOD IS PERFECT). 
	Max flips the page before he or we can absorb it. He compares 
	stock quotes in the Wall Street Journal against his printout.

				MAX (V.O.) 
		Sixteen, twenty-seven. Results: Euclid 
		shows tomorrow's Dow closing 
		up by four points. Anomalies 
		include PRONET at sixty-fire 
		and a quarter, a career high. 
		Possible explanations, either 
		A, an error in the June fifth 
		algorithm, or B, Euclid's 
		main processor is running a 
		recursion...

	Max marks up the paper with lines and diagrams as he ponders 
	his bits and misses.

	Then a puff of cigarette smoke drifts by and succeeds in 
	bothering Max. He fans it away when

				VOICE FROM OFFSCREEN 
		Oh sorry, am I bothering you?
	
	Max shrugs and looks over.

	The voice belongs to LENNY MEYERa bearded man in his late 20s 
	sucking on a cigarette.

	On closer inspection, something is off. It seems that Lenny is 
	an Orthodox Jew. His yarmulke sticks out Slightly from his 
	wide-brimmed hat and the fringes from his tsi-tsis hang out 
	from the bottom of his untucked shirt.

				LENNY MEYER 
		I'll put it out. 
			(Which he does) 
		The name's Lenny Meyer
	
	Lenny sticks out his hand. Max responds with a small nod. 
				LENNY MEYER 
		And you are?
	
				MAX 
		Max.
	
				LENNY MEYER 
		Max? 
	
				MAX 
		Max Cohen.
	
				LENNY MEYER 
		Cohen! 
			(Judging) 
		Jewish? 
	Max shrugs and turns back to his work.

				LENNY MEYER 
		It's okay. 
			(Joking) 
				I'm a Jew, too. 
			(Serious) 
				Do you practice?

				MAX 
		No, I'm not interested 
		in religion.

				LENNY MEYER 
		Have you ever 
		heard of Kabbalah?


				MAX 
		No.

				LENNY MEYER 
		Jewish mysticism.
	
				MAX 
		I'm sorry, I'm very busy.
	
				LENNY MEYER 
		I understand...it's just that 
		it's a very exciting time in 
		our history. Right now is a 
		critical moment in time.

				MAX 
			(Sarcastic) 
		Really?
	
				LENNY MEYER 
		Yes, it's very exciting. 
		Have you ever put on Tefillin?

	Max has no idea what Lenny's talking about. Lenny pulls a 
	leather box with black leather straps from his pocket.

				LENNY MEYER 
		Tefillin. You know Tefillin. 
		I know it looks strange. 
		But it's an amazing 
		tradition that has a 
		tremendous amount of power. 
		It's a mitzvah for all 
		Jewish men to do. Mitzvahs, 
		good deeds, are spiritual 
		food for our hearts and our 
		heads.

	And then Max notices that his thumb is twitching He grabs it 
	self-consciously.

				LENNY MEYER 
		They purify us and bring us 
		closer to God. You want to try it?

	Just then, Max pays his bill and prepares to leave.

				MAX 
		I gotta go...
	
				LENNY MEYER 
		Are you okay? Max? Max?
	
				MAX 
		I'm sorry, bye.
	
				LENNY MEYER 
		Well, maybe some other time.
	
	INT. MAX'S BATHROOM - NIGHT 
	Max splashes water on his face.

				MAX 
		Please God, Let it be a 
		small one.

	He pulls a metal vaccinating gun out of the medicine cabinet. 
	Then be loads it with a small bottle of medicine. He rolls up 
	his sleeve, dabs alcohol on his arm, and fires the gun into 
	his arm.

				MAX (V.O.) 
		Sixteen thirty-five. 
		Second headache in under 
		twenty-four hours. They're 
		getting more frequent 
		now...more painful, too. Drugs 
		don't work, just take the 
		edge off of it. Just gotta 
		wait for the nosebleed. 
		Relief comes from my nose.
	
	Next door, he hears Devi and her boyfriend talking.

				FARROUHK (O.S.) 
		So I gotta make this drop off 
		in Harlem and on the way down 
		there's these three kids 
		hailing me.

	Max slaps himself in the face a few times.

				DEVI (O.S.) 
		You stopped?
	
				FARROUHK (O.S.) 
		I was tight, so...
	
	Max watches his thumb twitch. And then pain shoots through 
	him. He grabs the right side of his head, massages it, and 
	pushes it in with his fingers.

	In the mirror, he examines the right side of his scalp. He 
	sees nothing

				MAX 
		Ahh...
	
	Max walks back into the 
	MAIN ROOM

	and sits down in a chair. The lamp is blinding so he
	snaps it off. Only the bathroom light lights the room. He 
	takes a few breaths.

				MAX 
		Leave me alone.
	
	His neighbors conversation begins to build in volume
	and distortion.

				FARROUHK (O.S.) 
		So I drop them off in the 
		Village and they dart.

				DEVI (O.S.) 
		Oh God...
	
	Max gags and rubs his head.

				FARROUHK (O.S.) 
		I get out, grab my bat and 
		start running. One of the kids, 
		maybe sixteen, I catch a block 
		later he's cursing at me, calling 
		me a Paki bastard. So I whacked him, 
		right in the head.

				DEVI (O.S.) 
		Farrouhk!
	
	The pain seems to disappear. Max looks at his hand that was 
	rubbing his bead.

	Then he looks at the front door. The doorknob seems to
	move. 
	Something begins knocking on Max's door. The knocking gets 
	louder and louder then the locks begin to unlock.

	FARROUHK's words begin to overpower Max.

				FARROUHK (O.S.) 
		I'm kicking the bastard in the 
		ribs banging his ass, knocking his 
		head against the curb, harder 
		and harder, I fucking lost 
		it. A hot dog guy starts 
		screaming "You're cracking his 
		skull, you're cracking his 
		skull." So they pulled me off 
		of him and calmed me down. 
		Cops said he had it coming to 
		him.
	
	Then something starts pounding the door. The doorknob quivers, 
	the locks unbolt. The chains are the only thing keeping out 
	the intruder. The door shakes and the chains are strained.

	MAX is paralyzed with terror.

				MAX 
		No! No!
	
	And then the door smashes open. Blinding light fills the room 
	and we crash into the

	BLINDING WHITE VOID

	A moment of silence, then we 
	CUT TO 
	INT. BATHROOM - DAWN 
	A phone rings incessantly. Max's eyes pop open. He's scrunched 
	up in a corner of the room, squashed beneath the sink.

	His nose is bleeding.

	Max, crawls into the 
	MAIN ROOM

	and picks up the phone. He pinches his nose and tilts his head 
	back.

				MARCY DAWSON 
		Mr. Cohen. Marcy 
		Dawson here again I was just 
		looking over my schedule and 
		I realized I'll be in your 
		neighborhood tomorrow around 
		three.

	Max heads to the 
	FRONT DOOR

	and checks the locks. He is barely listening to Marcy

				MAX 
			(Groggy) 
		Who is...
	
	The locks seem secure.

				MARCY DAWSON 
		Marcy Dawson from 
		Lancet-Percy I'm so anxious 
		to meet you. It will be worth 
		itfor both of us I promise. 
		See you at your house at 
		three, okay?

				MAX 
		My house...how do...
	
				MARCY DAWSON 
		Oh, don't worry, 
		I got your address from 
		Columbia. So three it is. 
		Looking forward to it.

	Max tries to stop her but, before he can Marcy hangs up.
	A bewildered Max slowly hangs up.

				MAX 
		Damn.
	
	Max checks the peephole - all clear.

	Then, he opens his -

	CLOSET

	which is filled with random computer parts and boxes.

	He pulls a thick neuroscience book from a shelf in the back of 
	the closet. He almost knocks over an old dusty brass 
	microscope on the shelf.

	Max flips through the book. It contains old plates 
	illustrating the brain. Max examines some of the diagrams.

	EXT. S0L'S HALLWAY - DAY Max rings the bell on an apartment 
	door.

	A few moments pass, and then SOL ROBESON opens the door.

	Sol is a wise-looking man in his early 70's. He walks with 
	difficulty, leaning out of breath on a wooden cane.

	His arms are covered with faded Russian prison tattoos and he 
	speaks with a thick Eastern European accent, He's happy to see 
	Max.

				S0L 
		Max! How are you7
	
	Max is happy to see Sol, but he's a bit bashful and 
	intimidated.

				MAX Okay.

	EXT. SOL'S STUDY - MOMENTS LATER 
	TIGHT ON the Japanese game of Go being played. Sol is white 
	and Max is black. Sol's moves are secure and controlled while 
	Max is hesitant.

				SOL 
		Stop thinking, Max, just 
		feel. Use your intuition. 
		It's the only way to get into 
		the flow. 
			(Beat) 
		What did you think of Hamlet?
	
				MAX 
		I didn't get to it.
	
				SOL 
		It's been a month. 
			(Knowingly) 
		You haven't taken 
		a single break.

				MAX 
		I'm so close, Sol. I'm 
		so close but I just can't 
		grab it.
	
	Sol changes the subject. He feeds his goldfish and points to 
	one of them.

				SOL 
		Have you met the new 
		fish my niece bought me? I 
		named her Icarus. After you. 
		My renegade pupil. You fly 
		too high, you'll get burned.
	
	Max looks up at Sol.

				SOL 
		The more I see you, the 
		more I see myself thirty 
		years ago. My greatest pupil. 
		Published at 16, Ph.D. at 20.

				MAX 
		We'll see.
	
				SOL 
		But life isn't just 
		mathematics. I spent forty 
		years looking for patterns in 
		Pi, I found nothing.

				MAX 
		You found things...
	
				SOL 
		I found things, but not a 
		pattern.

	INT. MOVING TRAIL - DAY

	Max sits in the corner of a rickety New York City subway car. 
	The train is almost completely deserted.

	Max looks down at his hand. He opens his palm and reveals a 
	black Go chip.

				MAX (V.O.) 
		Tuesday, September 
		second, eighteen twelve. If 
		Sol hadn't gotten sick who 
		knows where math would be. He 
		spent years in the numbers of 
		Pi. Searching for meaning, for 
		order.
	
	Max notices a SKINNY MAN in a business suit staring at him. 
	The man catches Max's eye and looks away, but then he quickly 
	looks back, making Max turn away.

	He looks down at his Wall Street journal and draws a circle 
	with its diameter then he writes "A=pir2" and "C=2pir." Next 
	he writes "pi=3.14159..."

				MAX (V.O.) 
		Three point one 
		four...off into infinity 
		and maybe insanity. Somewhere 
		in there he wanted sanity. 
		Sanity like he found in the 
		circles Pi represented. 
		Simple, sane circles. If only 
		the stock market had circles. 
		Some type of sanity. Some 
		type of form, of shape.

	Suddenly, Max hears someone singing. Max looks up. It is the 
	Skinny Man and he's singing with passion. It's all very 
	strange to Max, who nervously looks away.

	And then the singing stops
	mid-verse Max looks up and the man is gone. Vanished. Max 
	looks aroundno one in Sight.

	INT. APARTMENT STAIRCASE - DAY

	Max heads up the stairs to his apartment. Just then, a toy 
	SLINKY appears from nowhere marching down the stairs.

	Max stops and waits until the Slinky hits his foot. He picks 
	it up and looks at it.

	He looks around wondering what's going on. Then Jenna leans 
	out over a railing and starts laughing at Max.

	INT. COFFEE SHOP-DAY

	Max sits at the counter frantically looking at the Wall Street 
	Journal. He plops three pills into his coffee.

	He draws circles and other shapes across the page.

	Max is interrupted by a puff of smoke. At the same time, 
	someone touches his shoulder and says:

				LENNY MEYER 
		Hey, Max, how you doing?
	
				MAX 
		Oh, okay.
	
				LENNY MEYER 
		Lenny Meyer. 
			(Motioning to the cigarette) 
		I'll put it out. 
			(Which be does) 
		So, what do you do?
	
				MAX 
		Um, I work with computers 
		...math.

				LENNY MEYER 
		Really? What type of math?
	
				MAX 
		Number theory. Mostly 
		research.

				LENNY MEYER 
		Number theory? No 
		way, I work in theory, too. 
		Not traditional, though...
			(Points to his yarmulke) 
		I work with the Torah. 
			(Awed by the coincidence) 
		Amazing.
	
				MAX 
			(Passing it of as a coincidence) 
		Yeah...
	
				LENNY MEYER
		Yeah. You know Hebrew is 
		all numbers. It's all math.

				MAX 
		Hm.
	
	Lenny pulls out a worn' dog-eared Bible from his pocket. There 
	are paper slips marking what seems like every other page. When 
	he opens it up,
	Max sees that the pages are marked up by highlighter pens, 
	notes and diagrams.

	Lenny points to the text. EXTREME CLOSE-UP of Hebrew letters.

				LENNY MEYER 
		Here, look...the ancient 
		Jews used Hebrew as their 
		numerical system. Each 
		letter is a number.

	Lenny pulls out a pen and grabs Max's Journal. He writes on it 
	as he talks.

				LENNY MEYER
		You see...The Hebrew "A," the 
		number 1. The Hebrew "B," 
		Bet, is two. You can take any 
		Hebrew text and turn them into 
		a long string of numbers.
	
	The waitress refills Max's coffee.

				LENNY MEYER
		The Torah is just 
		a long string of numbers. 
		Some say that it's a long 
		code sent to us from God.

	Satisfied, Lenny lights up a cigarette and takes a drag.

				MAX 
			(Mildly impressed) 
		Kind of interesting.
	
				LENNY MEYER 
			(Proud of himself) 
		Yeah, like take the 
		Hebrew word for, say, the 
		Garden of Eden, Kadem. Kuf, 
		Dalei Mem...Kuf is a 
		hundred. Daled, four Mem, 
		forty. They equal one hundred 
		and forty-four. Then take the 
		tree of knowledge...in 
		the garden, Aat Ha Haim, it 
		equals two hundred and 
		thirty-three. Now you can take 
		that number and...

				MAX 
		They're Fibonacci numbers.
	
				LENNY MEYER 
		Huh?
	
				MAX 
		The Fibonacci sequence. 
		Italian mathematician, thirteenth
		century. If you divide 
		a hundred and forty-four into 
		two hundred and thirty-three, 
		it approaches theta.

				LENNY MEYER 
		Theta?
	
				MAX 
		The Greek symbol for the 
		golden ratio. The golden 
		spiral.
	
	Lenny exhales the smoke. Max quickly graphs the number on his 
	Wall Street Journal.

				LENNY MEYER 
		You're right, I never saw 
		that before. That's the series 
		you find in nature. Like the 
		face of a sunflower.

				MAX 
		Wherever there's spirals.
	
				LENNY MEYER 
		You see, there's math everywhere.
	
	Lenny's smoke drifts by Max's eyes.

	SLOW MOTION: MAX'S POV of smoke spirals spinning in front of 
	him.

				MAX 
		Math everywhere...
	
	SLOW MOTION: Max looks down at his coffee cup. He pours cream 
	into his coffee. It shoots up and mixes with the black coffee 
	forming spirals in the mug.

				MAX 
			(Serious) 
		Everywhere...
	
	SLOW MOTION: Max looks at the spiral he just drew on the Wall 
	Street Journal.

	NORMAL SPEED Suddenly, Max stands up.

				MAX 
		Oh my God...
	
	INT. MAX'S APARTMENT - DAY

	Max draws spirals all over his Wall Street Journal. Then he 
	takes a thick black marker and draws a giant spiral across the 
	entire page.

	Max is ecstatic as he pounds code into the computer takes 
	moments to wake up, drops pills, and drinks a Ginseng soda.

				MAX (V.O.) 
		Simple shapes! 
		Tuesday, September second. 
		Twenty-twenty-two. Sol! Sol! 
		Sol! Shapes in the market. 
		Why not? And they're spirals! 
		Spirals!

	Max traces a big circle on the journal. Then, he cuts it out 
	with an X-acto blade. He cuts out the middle of the circle so 
	that be has a thin loop like one of those futuristic frisbees. 
	He tears part of the loop and stretches the circle out in 
	front of him into a spiral.

				MAX (V.O.) 
		A circle spread out overtime. 
		It's open-ended. It has a 
		beginning and it grows and 
		changes through time. If I 
		can find where it fits, if I 
		can spin it and lock it into 
		a group of numbers, then I 
		can calculate the future. 
		Lead into gold. Chaos into 
		order Madness into sanity. Pain 
		into bliss. Perfection.
	
	Max is about to slap RETURN but he stops himselfhe's nervous.

	Next door, Devi and her boyfriend are making love. He looks at 
	the wall with disdain. Then he looks back at the screen, 
	shrugs and confidently slaps RETURN on his keyboard.

	Stock prices float across the screen. Max can't believe his 
	eyesthe quotes are absurd.

				MAX 
		What the...
	
	And then, Euclid crashes. The electricity in Max's room flips 
	off. The numbers on Max's screen fade to black. In near (minus 
	streetlights) darkness:

				MAX 
		Shit!
	
	TIGHT ON A FUSE BOX 
	Max removes a fuse. He replaces it with a penny.

	MAX'S ROOM

	Max tries to reboot Euclid, but nothing happens. He tries a 
	second time, but nothing happens.

	Devi and Farrouhk are still at it.

	Max puts on a pair of latex gloves. He dons a surgical mask. 
	He climbs up to a loft above his monitors. A glass case, fed 
	cool air by a vent tube, encases some computer parts. He 
	carefully removes the front glass cover.

	Then he gets it off he's stunned. Not only have the chips 
	melted down, but a strange flaky substance covers the board.

				MAX 
		What the...
	
	Max grabs his face, frustrated.
	Deri and Farroakk are giggling, having a great time. Max 
	stares at the wall.

	Then he angrily throws Euclid's mainframe onto the ground It 
	lands with a SMASH!

	Under the mainframe is a small city of ANTS. They scramble for 
	cover. Max furiously attacks them, stomping them out with his 
	bands.

	Then he jumps on the smashed mainframe. He slides to
	the ground and covers his face.

	DISSOLVE TO 
	EXT. PLAYGROUND - DAY 
	TIGHT ON a tree branch shaking manically in the wind.

	Max sits on a park bench watching the branch shake. It 
	terrifies him.

	He pulls out the printout of his picks and examines them.

				MAX (V.0.) 
		Wednesday, September third, 
		seven-fifteen. Results: AAR 
		at fourteen and a halflow, 
		very low. ABR at six and a 
		halfjeez. Six and a half, ABR 
		hasn't been beneath twenty in 
		ten years. Conclusion: 
		Simple. There is no pattern. 
		No pattern. Chaos, chaos, all 
		chaos.

	He crumples up his picks and tosses them into a public trash 
	can.

	INT. SOL'S STUDY - DAY

	Sol and Max play Go. Sol is peaceful while Max is distant.

	Max plays a piece absently. Sol counters with a deafening 
	atari. Max whispers:

				MAX 
		Euclid crashed. I lost 
		all my data, my hardware.

				SOL 
		Your mainframe?
	
				MAX 
		Burnt...
	
				SOL 
		What happened?
	
				MAX 
		I don't know, first I got 
		these horrible picks. Then 
		Euclid spits out some 
		numbers. Never saw anything 
		like it and then it fries. 
		The whole machine just 
		crashed.
	
				SOL 
		You have a printout?
	
				MAX 
		Of?
	
				SOL 
		The picks, the number?
	
				MAX 
		I threw it out.
	
				SOL 
		What was the number it 
		spit out?

				MAX 
		I don't know, just a long 
		string of digits.

				SOL 
		How many?
	
				MAX 
		I don't know.
	
				SOL 
			(Intense) 
		What was it, a 
		hundred and fifty, a 
		thousand, two hundred 
		sixteen!? How many?

				MAX 
		I don't know. Probably 
		around two hundred. 
			(Wondering) 
		Why?
	
				SOL 
			(Beat)...
		I dealt with 
		some bugs back in my Pi days. 
		I was wondering if it was 
		similar to one I ran into.

	Sol begins to feed his fish. He points to one.

				SOL 
		Have you met Archimedes. 
		The one with the black spot. 
		You see?
	
				MAX 
		Yeah.
	
				SOL 
		Remember Archimedes of 
		Syracuse? The King asks 
		Archimedes to determine if a 
		present he's received was 
		actually solid gold. Unsolved 
		problem at the time. It 
		tortures the great Greek 
		mathematician for weeks. 
		Insomnia haunts him and he 
		twists and turns on his bed 
		for nights on end. Finally, 
		his equally exhausted wife, 
		she's forced to share a bed 
		with this genius, convinces 
		him to take a bath, to relax. 
		While stepping into the tub 
		he observes the bathwater 
		rise as he enters. Displacement. 
		A way to determine volume. 
		And thus, a way to 
		determine density, weight 
		over volume. And thus, 
		Archimedes solves the 
		problem. He screams 
		"Eureka!"Greek for "I found 
		it!"and is so overwhelmed he 
		runs dripping naked through 
		the streets to the King's 
		castle to report his 
		discovery. Now, what's the 
		moral of the story.
	
				MAX 
		That a breakthrough will 
		come...

				SOL 
		Wrong. The point of the 
		story is the wife. Listen to 
		your wife, she will give you 
		perspective. Meaning, you 
		need a break, Max, you have 
		to take a bath, otherwise 
		you'll get nowhere. There will 
		be no order, only chaos. 
		Go home and take a bath.
	
	PUBLIC BENCH - MOMENTS LATER 
	Max waits for his train on an empty platform.

	Just then, he hears a DRIPPING sound. Max looks up and notices 
	something across the tracks on the other platform. He can't 
	quite make it out because his vision is blocked by columns.

	He gets up and spots a Young Hasidic Man standing at him.

	Blood drips from the Man's hand. Max doesn't know what to make 
	of it

	A TRAIN SWISHES BY -

	INT. MOVING TRAIN - LATER

	Max reads an ad that says In big block letters 'MOSHIAC IS 
	COMING!' He checks out a few of the other passengers. Then he 
	notices a man reading a newspaper across from him.

	The headline reads: 'MARKET TAKES NOSE-DIVE. Max jumps up and 
	approaches the man.

				MAX 
		Hey, excuse me, can I see 
		that?

	The man hands Max the paper. Max scans the article. Then He 
	quickly turns to the listings. His finger barrels down a 
	column. It stops at ABR.

				MAX 
		Six and a half.
	
	Max looks up the column for AAR.

			MAX 
		Fourteen and a half. Oh, 
		my...

	Max stumbles toward the doors. He looks out the window: into 
	the darkness of the tunnel.

				MAX 
			(Out of breath) 
		My God. My God. 
			(Gets pumped to himself) 
		Yes! Yes!
	
				SKINNY MAN (V.O.)
		Hey, paper, please!
	
	Max hands the paper back and looks at the man for the first 
	time. It is the Skinny Man he saw earlier.

	Max gets suspicious and moves into the next car.

	AT GRAND STREET
	Max exits. He notices that the Skinny Man gets off - one car 
	down - as well.

	He hustles toward the exit. As he's about to turn a corner he 
	looks back. The man seems to be following him.

	He dodges around a corner and heads up a staircase.

	EXT. TRAIN STATION - DAY 
	He seems to have lost him, when he notices a business-woman 
	with a pretty face heading right toward him. It is MARCY 
	DAWSON.

				MARCY DAWSON 
		Mr. Cohen! Perfect timing.
	
	Marcy sticks out her hand. Max, not knowing what else to do, 
	shakes it.

				MARCY DAWSON 
		I was just waiting for you. 
		I thought you stood me up, 
		so I was going to head home.
	
				MAX 
		Who are you?
	
				MARCY DAWSON
		Oh...Marcy Dawson. From 
		Lancet Percy. We were 
		supposed to meet at three.

				MAX 
		I'm sorry, I don't...
	
	Marcy hasn't let go of Max's hand.
	She guides him toward a large black street limo that's just 
	pulled up.

				MARCY DAWSON 
		I can't tell you what a 
		pleasure it is to finally 
		meet you. I've studied 
		your papers for years.
	
				MARCY DAWSON 
		I have something 
		you won't be able to say no 
		to. Why don't we take a spin 
		in the limo?

				MAX 
		No, no, no, really, I 
		can't.

				MARCY DAWSON 
		We're excited by your work. 
		We can't wait to discuss...

	Max attempts to pull away but Marcy is firm on leading him to 
	the car. Meanwhile, the Shinny man is heading right at them.

	The CHAUFFEUR reaches out to him. Max yanks his arm free and 
	runs away. He whips around a corner.

	INT. BODEGA - DAY 
	Max barrels into the grocery store and buys a Journal. He 
	heads to the back of the store and lays the paper across the 
	juice section. He checks the listing.

				MAX 
		On the nose. On the damn nose.
	
	Max turns the page on the Journal and sees the Lancet-Percy 
	ad. Then he notices one of the bodega owners staring at him.

	EXT. MAX'S APARTMENT - DAY

	Max scouts his front door. The coast is clear. 
	INT. MAX'S APARTMENT - DAY

	Max examines the smashed Euclid mainframe. He uncovers some of 
	the strange filo-like substance. He carefully touches it. Then 
	he grabs a small pinch of it.

	He examines it near a light bulb. He can't guess what it is. 
	He sniffs it. He carefully tastes it with the very tip of his 
	tongue. He still doesn't have a clue.

	Max opens his closet. He pulls out his dusty brass microscope. 
	He dusts it off. Next, he pulls out a slide Kit.

	Max places the instrument on the windowsill. He grabs an old 
	glass slide and puts some of the flaky stuff on it. He slides 
	it under the microscope. He looks into the lens, but doesn't 
	see anything.

	He gets up quickly and heads for the 
	HALLWAY

	where he looks at Devi's door, nervously. He gathers his 
	courage and knocks on her door. Through the door hears.

				DEVI (O.S.) 
		Farrouhk?
	
				MAX 
		Um, no, it's Max from next door.
	
	Devi opens the door wearing a sexy nightshirt.

				DEVI 
		Max, is everything all 
		right?

				MAX 
		Do you have any iodine?
	
				DEVI 
			(concerned, she reaches for Max's hands) 
		Iodine...did you cut 
		yourself?

				MAX 
			(Pulling his hands away) 
		No. I just need it to stain a 
		slide.

				DEVI 
		Ah, science, the pursuit 
		of knowledge. One second.

	She heads to her bathroom. Max waits impatiently.

				DEVI (O.S.) 
		Here we are. What are you 
		examining
			(At the door) 
		a potato!?

	She hands Max a bottle of iodine.

				MAX 
		Just something with my 
		computer.

	MAX'S ROOM - MOMENTS LATER 
	Max uses his pinky to drip a drop of iodine on the slide.

	Through the wall he hears Farrouhk arriving home.

				DEVI (0.S.) 
		The neighbor's up 
		to his old science...

				FARROUHK (O.S.) 
		What neighbor?
	
				DEVI (O.S.) 
		Next door.
	
	Max listens to the conversation for a few moments.

				FARROUHK (O.S.) 
		Why are you talking to that dork!
	
				DEVI (O.S.) 
		Shh! I just helped ...
	
				FARROUHK (O.S.) 
		Pounds on wall. Hey, dork, leave
		my girlfriend alone!

				DEVI (0.S.) 
		Farrouhk!
	
	Max shakes his bead. Then he finishes preparing the slide and 
	slips the glass under the turret.
	Max catches the low-hanging sun in the microscope's mirror and 
	reflects it through the sample and up the turret
	into his eye.

	MAX'S POV DOWN THE TURRET of some strange
	Substance.

	Max pulls out the slide and looks at it.

				FARROUHK (0.S.)
		I don't give a shit.
	
				DEVI (0.S.) 
			(Laughing) 
		Shh! C'mon, Farrouhk.
	
				FARROUHK (0.S.) 
		I'll kill the dork. 
			(Exploding again) 
		You hear me! I'll kill you. 
		I'll fucking kill you!

	Then an idea comes to him. He takes out his brain book. He 
	looks through it until he finds a picture of neurons. He 
	compares the image to the view through the turret. They look 
	different but there are similarities.

				DEVI (O.S) 
		Shh! Baby! Come here, baby!
	
	Max rushes out.

	EXT. PLAYGROUND - LATE AFTERNOON

	Max sifts through the trash can where he threw his picks from 
	yesterday. Frustrated, he dumps the trash onto the sidewalk 
	and starts looking through it Mrs. Ovadia watches him.

	Max sees her and is embarrassed for a moment.

				MAX 
		I just threw out something. 
		I didn't realize I needed it.

				MRS. OVADIA 
		Humph.
	
				MAX 
		Just a printout. I, uh, 
		lost my data...

	Max looks back at the trash And forgets about Mrs. Ovadia. 
	Soon, Max gets up and kicks the trashcan. He heads home.

	IN FRONT OF MAX'S APARTMENT BUILDING

	Max watches Marcy get out of the limo and call to Mrs. Ovadia.

	Max backs away when he smacks into someone.

	It's Lenny Meyer - the young Jewish man.

	Max jumps back in fear.

				LENNY MEYER 
		Max! How you doing? Lenny 
		Meyer. 
				MAX 
		Oh, hey... 
	
	Max tries to quickly pass him.

				LENNY MEYER 
		Hey, where you going? You 
		got a few moments to do Tefillin?

	Max turns around and notices Marcy talking to Mrs. Ovadia. 
	Mrs. Ovadia points up the street
	toward him.

				LENNY MEYER 
		I gotta car, we can cruise 
		over to my...

				MAX 
		You gotta car?
	
				LENNY MEYER 
		Yeah, right there. That's 
		Ephraim, my friend.

	We swing around with Max and see a station wagon.

	EPHRAIM sits in the passenger Seat. He's a big-boned, bearded, 
	Orthodox Jew.

				MAX 
		All tight, lets go.
	
				LENNY MEYER 
		Great...
	
	They head for the station wagon.

	INT. BASEMENT SHUL - NIGHT

	The synagogue is a claustrophobic, fluorescent-lit room in 
	general disarray. Two rows of imitation-wooden pews face a 
	makeshift altar and Ark. Young Hasidic Men study texts. Some 
	work alone, reading and dovening. Others are in small groups 
	sharing in heated discussions.

	Lenny wraps the Tefillin around Max's arm. Max just wants to 
	get out of there. Ephraim prays in the background.

				MAX 
		Lenny, I don't really 
		want to do...

				LENNY MEYER 
		Do it for me? It 
		means a lot, having someone 
		of your stature performing a 
		mitzvah in my presence. 
			(Beat) 
		When you told me your name was
		Max Cohen, I didn't realize you 
		were the Max Cohen. Maximilian Cohen.
	
				MAX
		You know me?
	
				LENNY MEYER 
		0f course, I've 
		followed your research since 
		your Columbia days. It's 
		revolutionary. You've inspired 
		the work we do.
	
				MAX 
		I have?
	
				LENNY MEYER 
		Yes, very much 
		so. The only difference is, 
		we're not looking at stocks. 
		We're searching for a pattern 
		in Torah.
	
	Lenny finishes wrapping Max's arm. He reaches for another box 
	and strap.

				MAX 
		What kind of pattern?
			
				LENNY MEYER 
		We're not really 
		sure. Our calculations have 
		shown us that there is a 
		number encoded in the text.

				MAX 
		What sort of number?
	
				LENNY MEYER 
		We don't know. 
		All we know is that it's two
		hundred and sixteen digits long.
	
	Max, stunned looks at Lenny.

				LENNY MEYER
		Don't worry. This one just 
		goes over your head.
		
	Lenny places the other Teffilin over Max's head. Max collects 
	himself.

				MAX 
			(Coolly) 
		Two sixteen?
	
				LENNY MEYER 
		Yes. Now we have to say a 
		small prayer, repeat 
		after me.
	
	Bewildered, Max does. After the prayer...

				LENNY MEYER 
		That's it. Wasn't 
		so bad, was it? You feel 
		anything?
	
	Lenny starts removing the Teffillin from Max.

				MAX 
		What is it?
	
				LENNY MEYER 
		It's a prayer about our 
		dedication to our one and 
		only God.
	
				MAX 
			(Attempting calmness) 
		No, I mean the number, the 
		two sixteen number? What is 
		it?
	
				LENNY MEYER 
		Oh. We don't know. We just 
		know that it's the most 
		common number encoded in 
		the text. It might be some 
		type of linguistic pattern. 
		If we could figure out what 
		the number is we could maybe 
		answer that.

				MAX 
		Tell me more.
	
	EXT. SOL'S APARTMENT - DAWN

	Max firmly rings SOL's bell.

	In a few moments, Sol answers the door in his pajamas.

				SOL 
		Max?
	
				MAX 
		What's going on, Sol!?
	
				SOL 
		Relax, it's early.
	
	INT. SOL'S KITCHEN - MOMENTS LATER 
	Max sits at the kitchen table while Sol heats up a pot of tea. 
	Max is shaking.

				SOL 
		Now, what's up?
	
				MAX 
		What's the two hundred 
		and sixteen number, Sol?

				SOL 
		Excuse me?
	
				MAX 
		You asked me if I had 
		seen a two hundred and 
		sixteen digit number, right?
	
				SOL 
		Oh, you mean the bug. I 
		found it working on Pi.

				MAX 
		What do you mean by "found it"?
	
				SOL 
		What's this all about, 
		Max?

				MAX 
		Well, there's these 
		religious Jews who have...

				SOL 
		Religious Jews?
	
				MAX 
		Well, you know, 
		Hassidim. I met one in the 
		coffee shop. The guy's a 
		number theorist. The Torah is 
		their data set. The thing is, 
		they're searching for a two 
		hundred and sixteen digit 
		number in the Torah.

				SOL 
		Really? What's it mean to 
		them?

				MAX 
		They say they don't 
		know, but that's crazy. I 
		mean what are the odds...
	
				SOL 
		It's just a coincidence.
	
				MAX 
		But hold on, there's 
		something else. You remember 
		those strange picks I got.
	
				SOL 
		Yesterday's stock picks?
	
				MAX 
		Right. Well, it turns out 
		that they were correct. I hit 
		two picks on the nose. Smack 
		on the nose.

				SOL 
			(Surprised) 
		Hmmm.
	
				MAX 
		Something's going on, and 
		it has to do with that 
		number. The answer is there.
	
				SOL 
		Max, it's a bug.
	
				MAX 
		No. it's a pattern. A 
		pattern is in that number

				SOL 
		Come with me.
	
	INT. SOL'S STUDY - MOMENTS LATER 
	Sol and Max sit on either side of a half-played Go board.

				SOL 
		Listen to me. The Ancient 
		Japanese considered the Go 
		board to be a microcosm of 
		the universe. Although when 
		it is empty it appears to be 
		simple and ordered, in fact, 
		the possibilities of game play 
		are endless. They say that no 
		two Go games have ever been 
		alike. Just like snowflakes. 
		So, the Go board actually 
		represents an extremely complex 
		and chaotic universe. That is 
		the truth of our world, Max. 
		It can't be easily summed up 
		with math. There is no simple 
		pattern.
	
				MAX 
		But as a Go game 
		progresses, the possibilities 
		become smaller and smaller. 
		The board does take on order. 
		Soon, all moves are 
		predictable.

				SOL
		So?
	
				MAX
		So, maybe, even though we're not 
		sophisticated enough to be aware 
		of it, there is an underlying 
		order...a pattern, beneath every 
		Go game. Maybe that pattern is 
		like the pattern in the market, 
		in the Torah. The two sixteen 
		number.

				SOL 
		That is insanity, Max.
	
				MAX 
		Or maybe it's genius. I 
		have to get that number.

				SOL 
		Hold on, you have to slow 
		down. You're losing it, you
		have to take a breath. Listen 
		to yourself. You're connecting 
		a computer bug I had, a 
		computer bug you might have 
		had, and some religious 
		hogwash. If you want to find 
		the number two sixteen in the 
		world, you'll be able to pull 
		it out of anywhere. Two 
		hundred and sixteen steps 
		from your street comer to 
		your front door. Two hundred 
		and sixteen seconds you spend 
		riding on the elevator. When 
		your mind becomes obsessed 
		with anything, it will filter 
		everything else out and find 
		examples of that thing 
		everywhere. Three hundred and 
		twenty, four hundred and 
		fifty, twenty-three. 
		Whatever! You've chosen two 
		sixteen and you'll find it 
		everywhere in nature. But 
		Max, as soon as you discard 
		scientific rigor, you are no 
		longer a mathematician. You 
		become a numerologist. What 
		you need to do is take a 
		break from your research. You 
		need it. You deserve it 
		Here's a hundred dollars, I 
		want you to take it. If ,you 
		won't take it, borrow it. 
		Either way, take a break.
		Spend it however you like as 
		long as it falls in the 
		category of vacation. Real 
		world stuff, okay. No math.

	Max looks at his bands.

				SOL 
		Just try it. In a week 
		you'll laugh about this. 
		C'mon, Max. Think about it!
	
	Max gives a half nod.

	EXT. SOL'S APARTMENT - MORNING

	Max rushes to the subway when a honking horn stops him. A limo 
	pulls up next to him. Marcy Dawson jumps out of the car

				MARCY DAWSON 
		Mr. Cohen? Mr. 
		Cohen? Please stop for a 
		second Mr. Cohen?
	
	Max stops and faces Marcy.

				MAX 
		Damn it already! Stop 
		following me. I'm not 
		interested in your money. I'm 
		searching for a way to 
		understand our world. I'm 
		searching for perfection. I 
		don't deal with mediocre 
		materialistic people like 
		you!
	
				MARCY DAWSON 
		I'm sorry. I'm very sorry. 
		I admit I've been a bit too 
		aggressive. But all I ask is 
		for five minutes of your time. 
		Here...
	
	Marcy hands Max a metal stopwatch.
	
				MARCY DAWSON
		...a stopwatch. 
		Already ticking. Allow me the 
		four and a half minutes left 
		Let me tell you what I want. 
		Let me tell you what I can 
		offer you. Afterwards, if you 
		don't want to talk to me, then 
		fine, we part as friends and 
		I promise that you will never 
		see me again. That's fair, 
		isn't it?
	
				MAX 
			(After a moment, he looks at the stopwatch) 
		Go.
	
				MARCY DAWSON 
		Good. It's funny, 
		even though we have different 
		aims and different goals 
		we're actually incredibly 
		alike. We both seek the same 
		thingperfection. I know...
		clearly we're seeking 
		different types of 
		perfection, but that is what 
		makes us perfect candidates 
		for a fruitful partnership. 
		If you let me, I can be your 
		greatest ally. Take the 
		acacia tree...in East 
		Africa. It is the most 
		prevalent plant in all of 
		Kenya because it has managed 
		to secure its niche by 
		defeating its major predator, 
		the giraffe. To accomplish 
		this, the tree has made a contract 
		with a highly specialized red ant. 
		The tree has evolved giant spores which 
		act as housing for the ants 
		In return for shelter, the 
		ants supply defense. When a 
		giraffe starts to eat the 
		tree's leaves, the shaking 
		branch acts like an alarm. The 
		ants charge out and secrete an 
		acid onto the giraffe's 
		tongue. The giraffe learns its 
		lesson and never returns. 
		Without each other, the tree 
		would be picked dry and the 
		ants would have no shade from 
		the brutal African sun Both 
		would die. But with each 
		other, they succeed, they survive, 
		they surpass. They have 
		different aims, different 
		goals but they work together.
		Max, we would like to establish 
		a mutually benefiting alliance 
		with you.
	
				MAX
			(handing back the stopwatch) 
		I'm not interested.
	
				MARCY DAWSON 
		Allow me to dose.
	
	The chauffeur pulls a black suitcase out of the limo and 
	brings it over.

				MARCY DAWSON 
		As a sign of good faith we 
		wish to offer you this.

				MAX 
		I told you I don't want money.
	
				MARCY DAWSON 
		The suitcase isn't filled with 
		fifties or gold or diamonds. Just 
		silicon. A Ming Mecca chip.
	
				MAX 
			(Yeah right!) 
		Ming Mecca. They're not declassified.
	
	Max starts to move away.

				MARCY DAWSON 
		You're right. They're not. But 
		Lancet-Percy has many friends. 
		Come here, take a look.
	
				MAX 
			(Stuttering) 
		What do...do...
	
	But then, Max notices that his thumb is twitching.

				MARCY DAWSON 
		Beautiful, isn't it? You know 
		how rare...are you okay?

				MAX 
		Yeah, I got to go.
	
				MARCY DAWSON 
		But what about...
	
				MAX 
		Let me think about it...
	
	Max trots off.

				MARCY DAWSON 
		What? Mr. Cohen!?
	
	INT. SUBWAY STATION - PUBLIC BENCH - NIGHT

	The station is strangely silent. It is also extremely rundown. 
	The tracks are rusted and fucked up. All we hear is the sound 
	of DRIPPING WATER. The sound is warped and grows and morphs 
	until it's downright scary.

	Max sits on a bench sucking down pills. His head begins to 
	hurt. He touches the right side of his scalp and nubs it.

	As the blood surges through his head it brings him waves of 
	pain. He gags several times. Then the pain lets loose and all 
	Max wants to do is die. He smashes the side of his head with 
	his fist.

	Across the tracks on the far platform he sees someone.

	For a moment Max's pain dissipates. His view is obscured by 
	the columns. Max gets up and sees the Young Hasidic Man - from 
	earlier - staring at him.
	The Man stares at Max without any emotion. Max notices blood 
	dropping from the Man's right hand.

	Max looks at the Man's face and sees for a split second his 
	own face staring back.

				MAX 
		Hey!
	
	Max charges up a flight of stairs. He crosses a passage over 
	the tracks and flies down the stairs to the other side of the 
	platform.

	The Man is gone. A pool of blood sits where the Man was. Max 
	touches it with his toe. It's sticky. He notices a trail of 
	blood leading off from the pool.
	He follows it around a corner where it leads into a corner.

	He notices something strange in the shadows. He carefully 
	advances on it. Hiding in the shadows is what looks like a 
	small piece of brain. It seems to be moving slightly.

	Max uses a pen in his jacket to carefully touch it.

	Suddenly, Max hears a train's HONK HONK behind him. Max spins 
	around. Nothing is there but silence.

	He turns back to the gray matter. He touches it again. Once 
	again, he hears the deafening HONK HONK. Max spins around, but 
	nothing is there.

	Frustrated, he pushes his pen deep into the brain - fiber 
	ripping apart.

	Suddenly, a TRAIN is barreling down on Max. Seconds from 
	impact, Max SCREAMS!!!

	DISSOLVE TO

	BLINDING WHITE VOID
	We hear two deep, long sleep-filled breaths and then we CUT 
	TO:

	INT. SUBWAY TRAIN - DAY

	Max's eyes pop open. A TRANSIT COP is sticking him with a 
	nightstick.

				TRANSIT COP 
		Up, buddy Coney Island, last stop.
	
	Max sits up. His nose is bleeding. The cop hands him a tissue.

				TRANSIT COP 
		Your nose.
	
	Max wipes his nose and looks around nervously.

	He sees the rides of Coney Island in the distance.

	EXT. CONEY ISLAND BEACH - DAY

	Max sits on a boulder on a Coney Island jetty. He watches the 
	sea.

	Then Max sees an old man dressed like KING NEPTUNE scanning 
	the shore with a rusty metal detector. The old man picks up 
	something. He admires it for a moment before gently setting it 
	back on the ground. Then Neptune continues his search.

	Max wanders over to the place where the old man exam

	INT. MAX'S APARTMENT - NIGHT 
	MAX'S POV through the microscope. Max sees the brain 
	structures.

	Just then, there's a KNOCK on the door. The knock startles him 
	and his hand bumps the turret of the microscope. The lens 
	moves and he realizes that the magnification can be changed.

	A KNOCK again.

	Max looks out the peephole and sees nothing. Confused,

	Looks down at his thumb. It's not shaking. He heads back to 
	his microscope.

	There's a knock again. Max angrily unlocks the door and whips 
	it open.

	IN THE HALLWAY is Jenna with her calculator.

				JENNA 
		Max, Max, can we do one.
	
				MAX 
		Jenna. I can't now, Jenna.
	
				JENNA 
		Please, Max.
	
				MAX 
		I'm working now, later okay?
	
	Max shuts the door and returns to the microscope. He changes 
	the magnification. At a weaker magnification, the 
	mathematician sees that the cells are grouped in spirals.

	Max is stunned, He grabs the phone and pulls a business card 
	out of his pocket He quickly dials a number.

	Someone answers with a "Shalom" on the other end of the line. 
	Max asks for Lenny Meyer and is put on hold.

				LENNY MEYER 
		Hello, this is Lenny?
	
				MAX 
		Lenny, it's Max Cohen.
	
				LENNY MEYER 
		Max! How are you? 
		You want to come down?
				MAX 
		I've been thinking about 
		our conversation earlier.

	Max looks into the microscope. He stares at the spirals.

				LENNY MEYER 
		That's good...
	
				MAX 
		I want to help.
	
				LENNY MEYER 
		Excellent.
	
				MAX 
		Do you have the Torah in 
		digital form?

	DISSOLVE FROM TURRET TO:

	SATELLITE IMAGE OF SPINNING TORNADO

	Start in tight on the epicenter and pull out to reveal the 
	entire storm.

				MAX (V.O.) 
		Thursday, September 
		fourth, sixteen forty-five. 
		The alchemist awakes. All of 
		my ideas, work and dreams are 
		spinning together It all has 
		to do with spirals. It began 
		with spirals and the answers 
		are thee.

	INT. MAX'S APARTMENT  DAY

	EUCLID'S INNARDS

	Max uses a drill to rip out some old parts. He lays new wire 
	and does a bunch of soldering.

	He rips down a bunch of old papers and does a general 
	housecleaning.

	He also goes to school on the ant population in his apartment. 
	He plants some ant motels and sprays the room with. a pest 
	killer.

				MAX (V.0.) 
		The most I can 
		remember about their 
		significance is from 
		Schneider's class. That 
		bullshit core for majors. 
		Schneider's fascination with 
		mystical geometry made him a 
		bit of a quack...but...then again, 
		look at Kepler. He was really into 
		Pythagoras. The leader of an 
		ancient sect which believed 
		the entire universe could be 
		represented by numbers. 
		Pythagoras' greatest contribution 
		was the golden ratio, which ended up 
		influencing art and science 
		for thousands of years, 
		arguably all the way up to 
		today.
	
	TIGHT ON MAX writing a : b : : b : a + b.

	He draws it over a copy of Leonardo Da Vinci's famous
	drawing of man s anatomy.

				MAX (V.0.) 
		The golden ratio, 
		if I recall, is this unique 
		relationship between the length 
		and width of a special 
		rectangle called the golden 
		rectangle.
	
	TIGHT ON MAX carefully measuring out a golden rectangle.

	The rectangle fits perfectly over Leonardo Da Vinci's Man.

				MAX (V.O.) 
		If you take the 
		width of this rectangle and 
		use it to form a square within 
		the rectangle, the part left 
		over is a rectangle that has 
		the same ratio as the 
		original rectangle. au can 
		continue squaring the 
		rectangle, over and over 
		again, making the 
		rectangles smaller and smaller 
		to infinity.

	TIGHT ON MAX squaring rectangle after rectangle. Then he draws 
	the golden spiral through the rectangles.

				MAX (V.0.) 
		Then, if you 
		connect a curve through these 
		rectangles you get the golden 
		spiral. The Pythagoreans 
		loved this shape because 
		they found it everywhere 
		in nature.
	
	MONTAGE OF IMAGES

	The images mirror what Max talks about. We see NAUTILUS 
	SHELLS, SUNFLOWERS, PLANTS, RAM HORNS, HUMAN FINGERPRINTS, THE 
	MILKY WAY, and DNA STRANDS.

				MAX (V.0.) 
		It really is amazing. In the sea, 
		on land, in air, our basic building 
		block DNA and even our home.
	
	EXT. CHINATOWN - DAY

	Max wanders through the crowded streets of Chinatown.

				MAX (V.O.) 
		If we're built from 
		spirals, while living within 
		a giant spiral, is it 
		possible that all of human 
		behavior, if it could be 
		quantified, is in the form of 
		a spiral. Then, maybe,
		extensions of our behavior 
		like the stock market. maybe 
		even the writing of The 
		Torah, is infused with the 
		spiral pattern.

	DISSOLVE TO
	PAN ACROSS NEW EUCLID

	We start on the stock ticker and pull out to reveal a leaner, 
	meaner and more exciting machine.

				MAX (V.O.) 
		Friday, September 
		fifth. Seven twelve. It's 
		fair to say, I'm stepping out onto a 
		limb. But I'm on the edge and 
		that's where it happens.
	
	He holds two wires apart from each other as he contemplates 
	what will connect them.

	EXT. ELECTRONIC MEGADUMP - DAY

	Max wanders helplessly through the dump. There's nothing but 
	junk and more junk.

	EXT. PUBLIC PAY PHONE - DAY 
	Max eyes Marcy Dawson's business card, suspiciously He dials 
	the number. A man answers on the other line.

				MAN'S VOICE (OS.) 
		Three, eight, two.
	
				MAX 
		Marcy Dawson.
	
				MAN'S VOICE (O.S.) 
		Who's calling?
	
				MAX 
		Max Cohen.
	
				MAN'S VOICE (O.S.) 
		Hold on.
	
	Max is put on hold. He notices a man in a business suit 
	watching him. Max turns away.

				MARCY DAWSON 
		Mr. Cohen? I'm so 
		Happy...

				MAX 
		Look what do you want for the chip?
	
				MARCY DAWSON 
		You tech guys. I think you 
		know what we want.

				MAX 
		No, I don't.
	
				MARCY DAWSON 
		C'mon, Mr. Cohen. We can work 
		together We can both profit 
		from this information. We both 
		need each other to get it, so why 
		not work with us?
	
				MAX 
		I don't know if I'll find 
		anything useful.

				MARCY DAWSON 
		We're willing to take the risk.
	
				MAX 
		Okay. First, I want you 
		to call off the surveillance. 
				MARCY DAWSON 
			(Beat) 
		Done. Anything else?
	
				MAX 
		Yeah, I'm a very private 
		person. Knock on my door and 
		leave the suitcase outside. 
		I don't want to talk to Anyone.

				MARCY DAWSON 
		How do I know you're home? 
	
				MAX 
		I'll knock back.
	
				MARCY DAWSON 
		Fair enough.
	
	INT. COFFEE SHOP - DAY

	Max sits at the counter. The POST headline in front of him 
	reads MARKET DOOMED. PRESIDENT IN PANIC, WORLD LEADERS MEET.

	Max flips to the stock quotes. He can't believe how far things 
	have dovetailed. He shakes his head in disbelief when an 
	envelope appears in front of him. It belongs to Lenny Meyer.

				LENNY MEYER 
		The Torah.
	
				MAX 
		What is it?
	
				LENNY MEYER 
		In Hebrew characters and numbers.

				MAX 
		No, what is it? The two 
		hundred and sixteen digits.

				LENNY MEYER
		I don't know. 
			(Beat) 
		If you get it, maybe 
		we can figure it out. 
			(Changing subject) 
		Can you really find it?
	
				MAX 
		If the number's in there, 
		I'll find it.

	EXT. MAX'S APARTMENT - DUSK

	Max marches into his foyer when he's suddenly ambushed by 
	Devi's boyfriend, Farrouhk. Farrouhk is a little guy with a 
	big sadistic smile.

	He grabs Max by the collar and slams him against the wall. His 
	fist butts up against Max's chin.

			FARROUHK 
		There you go, dork. 
		Been thinking about my 
		girlfriend. Haven't you?
	
				MAX 
		Wha...
	
				FARROUHK
		You want to fuck her, don't you?
	
				MAX 
		No, no..
	
				FARROUHK
		You calling my girlfriend 
		ugly!? Why don't you want 
		to fuck her? You think she's 
		ugly?
	
				MAX 
		No, no, I just. It's that 
		she's your girl...

				FARROUHK 
		So you do want to 
		fuck her. You think about 
		fucking her in the mouth, 
		don't you?

				MAX 
		No, no, sir, please. I've 
		never touched Devi...I 
		never will.
	
				FARROUHK 
		Give the fucking 
		genius a Mars bar. Stay away, 
		or I'll slice off your balls.
	
	Farrouhk tosses Max against the wall. Max whimpers off to his 
	apartment. Farrouhk has enjoyed this and to end his game be 
	gives Max a small slap on the butt.

	INSIDE HIS APARTMENT Max bolts the front door.

	At his desk he rips open the envelope Lenny Meyer gave him. He 
	pulls out a BLACK DISK and eyes it expectantly.

	Next door, he hears Farrouhk and Devi talking.

				FARROUHK (O.S.) 
		Damn dork.
	
				DEVI (O.S.) 
		He's just a bit unique.
	
				FARROUHK(0.S.) 
		Unique?! Unique?! He's a dork!
	
	Then, Max carefully slips the DISK into Euclid's drive. Hebrew 
	characters pop onto Euclid's screen. Max pounds in several 
	strings of code lightning fast.

	The Hebrew letters suddenly switch to their numerical 
	counterparts. Max toggles between Hebrew and numbers a few 
	timesimpressed.

	Max nods. Then there's a knock at the door.

				MAX 
			(To himself) 
		Okay.
	
	Max peeks through the peephole. Two well-dressed large men, 
	BRAD and ABE THE BABE, wait for the signal. MAX knocks and the 
	suits leave.

	Then Max shyly opens up his front door and quickly grabs the 
	black attaché case in front of his door

	Donning a surgical mask and latex gloves, Max opens the black 
	attaché case. Sitting in foam is a tiny but beautiful chip. 
	Max studies it with awe.

				MAX (V.O.) 
		Friday, September 
		fifth? Lots of work to be 
		done. But I'm close, so 
		close. Today is the day Might 
		have cost me my soul, but 
		down the line I'll work it 
		out. Just keep them in the 
		dark, let them beg. A damn 
		Ming Mecca chip. It's like 
		giving a desperate junkie a 
		syringe filled with junk. 
		Defense uses them to nun 
		nuclear sub reactors. Me? I'm 
		going to dissect the market.

	Max carefully carries the chip over to the new leaner Euclid. 
	He welds it into Euclid's waiting wires.

				MAX 
		Happy birthday, Euclid.
	
	Then he lifts his hand to slap the RETURN button, but a sudden 
	wave of fear stops him.

	He gets up and grabs a Ginseng soda from the fridge He drops 
	eight pills in the can. He calmly takes a sip from the soda 
	and places it on the counter.

	Max can hear Devi and Farrouhk starting to make love. Their 
	gentle sounds
	drift through the wall.

				MAX (V.O.) 
		Eighteen thirty. Press return...
		Max darts over and smacks 
		the RETURN. Moments later we 
		see what Max sees

	ON THE SCREEN is a long string of zeros.

	At the bottom of the screen Euclid's cursor blinks, waiting 
	for instructions.

	He smacks RETURN again Max gets the same empty result.

	Euclid's cursor blinks, waiting. Max starts to laugh. He 
	laughs and laughs and laughs.

				MAX 
		Oh God. Damn religious 
		freaks. 
			(Sarcastic) 
		The holy Torah...
	
	But then he notices his thumb twitching. He rubs his scar. 
				MAX 
		Ah God...
	
	His neighbor's love sounds start to get rough. They're having 
	fun.

	Max almost throws up.

	THE BATHROOM

	Max dry heaves in the sink. Then he forces himself to stand in 
	front of the mirror.

				MAX 
		Too much...too soon.
	
	He grabs the gun and tries to roll up his sleeve. He can't get 
	it to roll up. Suddenly he's overwhelmed by pain. He quickly 
	rips his shirt and fires the gun into his arm.

	Nothing happens. He checks the barrelits empty

				MAX 
		Ohh...
	
	He grabs a bottle of medicine but knocks them an into the 
	sink.

	He cuts his finger as be grabs one of the broken bottles. He 
	loads the gun and fires the medicine into his arm. A wave of 
	pain and nausea floods in. He grabs another bottle and fires 
	it into his arm. Then he fires another and another.

	Frustrated he collapses into the mirror.

				MAX 
		Stop, please, stop.
	
	Slightly sobbing he examines his scalp pulling his hair apart. 
	He sees something.

				MAX 
		What the?
	
	So he takes out a scissors and starts removing some hair.

	Meanwhile his neighbors' lovemaking gets more intense. Their 
	screams carry into Max's head.

	Max finishes removing a patch of hair from the right side
	of his head. He has uncovered a light scar on his head. He 
	examines it in the mirror.

				MAX 
		What is it!? What is it!?
	
	Then his neighbors' lovemaking turns outright evil. It
	sounds like Sodom and Gomorrah next door and Max
	can barely stand it.
	A jolt of pain surges into his head. He grabs his scar as he 
	vomits blood into the sink.
	He starts banging his head against the mirror. He bangs
	his head again and again until the mirror CRACKS!

	His neighbors are cumming and their cries of joy are twisted 
	and agonizing.

	The mathematician looks at himself and begins to sob. He 
	reloads the gun and fires it right into the scar on his head, 
	where the pain is coming from.

	Max collapses to the ground in complete agony until the bare 
	bulb in the bathroom starts blinking on and off.

	Suddenly the pain is gone.

	Then he hears something. It's Euclid, buzzing with life. He 
	gets to his feet and head's into Euclid.

	The main monitor is screaming with numbers. The lights in the 
	room flicker on and off like on a disco dance floor. A
	filo substance billows out of Euclid.

	And then a number pops onto the screen. Max estimates how many 
	digits are on the screen. 
				MAX
		Two...two hundred. That's it! That's it!
	
	Max grabs a piece of paper and a pencil. He starts writing 
	down the number. He mumbles each digit as he sees it.

	But then be stops writing. Power surge! He stares at the 
	number. Something clicks in his head. His eyes go wide. He 
	barely musters a

				MAX 
		Oh...
	
	We move closer and closer into the number, deeper and deeper 
	into the screen. Until finally a single pixel fills the screen 
	and we're in the

	BLINDING WHITE VOID where we hear several deep peaceful 
	breaths. 
	Then, a fuse blows and we cut to:

	BLACK
	A phone ringing...once...
	twice...then we hear

				MRS. OVADIA(O.S.) 
		He's alive. His eyes are moving. 
	
				DEVI (0.S.) 
		Yes, hello?
	
	FADE BACK INTO THE MAIN ROOM Max's eyes slowly open.


				DEVI (0.S) 
			(On the phone)
		He's busy right now I'm sorry.
		Max is sprawled out in front 
		of Euclid. A large amount of 
		blood, from his nose, is 
		semi-dried on his chin and 
		chest. Devi hangs up the phone.

	The landlady, Mrs. Ovadia, and Farrouhk, brandishing a 
	crowbar, stand over him.

				MAX 
		What happened?
	
				DEVI 
		You were screaming...
	
				MRS. OVADIA 
		Who told you you can put extra 
		locks on the door.

				FARROUHK 
			(To Mrs. OVADIA)
		Shhh!
	
				MAX 
			(Suddenly jolting up and remembering) 
		The number, the number.
	
	Max looks at Euclid. The screen is blank. He looks at the 
	mainframe. It is covered with the filo substance. Then be 
	looks at the piece of paper he wrote the number on. Only a few 
	dozen numbers are on the page. The last number be wrote is 
	barely a scribble.

				MRS. OVADIA 
		You're out, you hear me, you're out. 
		I've had enough of you. Look at all 
		this junk.
	
	He starts reciting the numbers. Then Max suddenly realizes 
	something. He continues reciting the numbers from memory.

				MAX 
		Four...zero...
		seven...It's in my head, 
		it's in my head. Somehow I 
		memorized it. I got it up 
		here!
	
	He points to his head.

				MAX 
		But what is it?
	
	Mrs. Ovadia starts looking at all the junk in the room.

				DEVI 
		Are you okay?
	
				MRS. OVADIA 
		What is this stuff? What does it do?
	
	Max finally realizes that all these strangers are in his womb. 
	He flips.

				MAX 
		0ut, out, you have to get 
		out. Get out, get out it's my 
		room!
	
				FARROUHK 
			(To Devi) 
		Let's go. 
	
	The phone starts ringing again.

				MRS. OVADIA 
		That's it, no way. You're 
		the one out of here, mister.

				MAX 
		Out! 0utt
	
	The three neighbors retreat to the front door.

				DEVI 
		Are you okay?
	
				MAX 
		Out! Get out!
	
	Max slams the door in their faces.
	Max rubs his chin and looks around the room. He starts
	saying the number to himself He gets more and more
	excited as he reads each digit.

	INT. COFFEE SHOP - NIGHT

	Max stirs cream into his coffee. Then he pulls out the
	Journal.

	A phone continues to RING.

	In the clouds of the Lancet-Percy ad - in The Journal Max 
	writes down the two hundred and sixteen digit number. He 
	studies it, examines it, draws on it, tries to figure out what 
	it is.

				MAX (V.O.)
		Saturday? Dark outside. There 
		was a moment there...when, I don't 
		know...when I didn't exist. What? What?

	We hear a phone being picked up. The ringing stops. Silence, 
	then:

				MARCY DAWSON (O.S.) 
		Max, is that you? Max? 
			(Pleading) 
		Max, just talk to me. Things 
		are a bit out of hand down 
		here. People are getting 
		desperate. 
			(Suddenly firm) 
		We had a deal, Max. A deal. 
		Talk to us, Max.

	We hear the sound of a phone hanging up.

	At the coffee counter, Max pops a handful of pills and 
	crumples the paper.

	INT. MAX'S BATHROOM - LATER

	Max stares at his BALD head in the mirror. All of his hair has 
	been removed. A fleshy scar sits on his scalp above his right 
	ear.

	Max ignores the incessantly RINGING phone.

	Max flips through an old neuroscience book. He examines a few 
	illustrations and finds the part of his brain that's killing 
	him.

				MAX (V.0.) 
		Must be an explanation, must be a 
		reason. Must.

	With a thick black marker, he carefully outlines the part of 
	his head that is causing the pain.

	INT. MAX'S APARTMENT-LATER

	Max sits in his chair staring at the stock market monitor. The 
	phone continues to RING.

	Numbers drift by.

	A single beam of sunlight leaks through the window and shines 
	on the edge of the screen. Walking along the edge in the 
	sunlight is a tiny ant.

				MAX 
		Bastard.

	Max gets up to squash it. But as he gets closer he suddenly 
	feels mercy. He looks at the ant in awe.

	And then, his attention switches to the ticker.

				MAX 
		Two and a quarter, twelve 
		and an eighth, six and two 
		eighths.
	
	Max states the numbers right before they enter onto the 
	screen.

				MAX 
		I know these...Seven 
		and a quarter. Two and a half 
		...oh...oh...
	
	Max strains to figure out what is going an. Suddenly, he's 
	overwhelmed with fear.

				MAX 
		My God. It's gonna 
		crash, it's gonna fucking 
		crash.
	
	INT. SOL'S APARTMENT - DUSK

	Max charges into the room. Sot is looking at his Go board. Sol 
	looks up when Max comes in.

				SOL 
		You're early. I was just 
		studying our...
			(Noticing ,Max's head) 
		What did you do to yourself?
	
				MAX 
		You lied to me.
	
				SOL 
		I thought you were going 
		to take a break.

				MAX 
		You found the two sixteen 
		number in Pi, didn't you? You 
		saw it.
	
	Sol doesn't respond.

				MAX 
		I saw it, Sol. I don't 
		know what happened, but I 
		know things. The market is 
		going to crash. It's going to 
		crash. It hasn't yet, but I 
		know it will. I saw it, Sol. 
		What is it, Sol? What's the 
		number?

	Sol sighs. He looks down at the board and collects himself.

				SOL 
		You have it?
	
				MAX 
		It's in my head!
	
				SOL 
			(Leveling with Max) 
		Okay, sit down.

	Max does.

				SOL 
		I gave up before I 
		pinpointed it. But my guess 
		is that certain problems 
		cause computers to get stuck 
		in a particular loop. The loop 
		leads to meltdown, but 
		right before they crash they...
		they become "aware" of 
		their own structure. The 
		computer has a sense of its 
		own silicon nature and it 
		prints out its ingredients.
	
				MAX 
		The computer becomes conscious?
	
				SOL 
		In some ways...I guess...
	
				MAX 
			(To himself) 
		Studying the pattern made Euclid 
		conscious of itself. Before it died it 
		spit out the number That consciousness 
		is the number.

				SOL 
		No, Max, it's only a 
		nasty bug.

				SOL 
		A door in front of a cliff. 
		You're driving yourself over 
		the edge. You need to stop.
	
				MAX 
		Stop? How can I stop? I'm 
		this close.

				SOL 
		The bug doesn't only 
		destroy computers.
			
				MAX 
		What are you saying?
	
				SOL 
		Look what it did to your 
		computer. Look what it's doing 
		to you.
	
	Max doesn't respond.
				SOL 
		It's killing you. Leave it 
		unknown.

				MAX 
			(Clarity) 
		You were afraid of 
		it. That's why you quit.

				SOL 
		Max, I got burnt.
	
				MAX 
		C'mon, Sol.
	
				SOL 
		It caused my stroke.
	
				MAX 
		That's bullshit. It's 
		math, numbers, ideas. 
		Mathematicians are suppose to 
		be out on the edge. You 
		taught me that!
	
				SOL 
		Max, there's more than 
		math! There's a whole world...

				MAX 
		That's where discoveries 
		happen. We have to go out 
		there alone, all alone, no 
		one can accompany us. We have 
		to search the edge. We have 
		to risk it all. But you ran 
		from it. You're a coward.
	
				SOL 
		Max, it's death!
	
	Max stands up and screams down at Sol.

				MAX 
		You can't tell me what it 
		is. You don't know You've 
		retreated to your goldfish, 
		to your books, to your Go, 
		but you're not satisfied.
	
	Sol grabs his cane and whacks the Go board.

				SOL 
		Get out! Max, get out!
	
				MAX 
		I want to understand it. 
		I want to know!

	Sol swings his cane as Max heads for the door.

				SOL 
		Out!
	
	INT. SUBWAY - PORT AUTHORITY - NIGHT 
	Max paces on a downtown train as it pulls into 42nd Street.

	Through the open doors, Max notices a YOUNG PHOTOGRAPHER in 
	jeans and a leather jacket photographing him from the uptown 
	platform.

	Max is enraged and screams at him. The man ducks behind a 
	column, but a few moments later he's back snapping pictures.

	The doors start to shut, but Max uses his body to get
	off the train.

	The Photographer sees him coming and flees.

	Max follows the man's movement on his platform. When the young 
	man shoots up the exit stairs, Max does so as well.

	Max catches a glimpse of his foe entering the catacombs 
	heading toward Times Square. Max pursues.

	Max chases him down a looooong passage.

	But he loses him at an underground five-way fork in the road. 
	One staircase is Uptown and Queens...
	another is Brooklyn...one other is unlabeled.

	Still enraged, Max marches forward Just then, he catches a 
	glimpse of the Photographer exiting the station.

	SMASH TO

	EXT. TIMES SQUARE - NEON NIGHT

	In the heart of New York, Max spins around searching for his 
	foe.
	His frustration mounts until out of the comer of his eye he 
	sees a strange reflection. Not knowing what it's of, he turns 
	around to see the source The reflection is from a giant, 
	brilliant stock ticker - 50 yards long and luminous.

	Max stares at the quotes They are hypnotizing and Max is 
	suddenly calm.

	Then, Max has a premonition. He turns and spots the 
	Photographer in front of a porn shop on Eighth and 42nd.

	EXT. PORN SHOP - 42ND STREET - NIGHT

	Max whacks the Photographer against a back-lit image of a 
	Hustler Centerfold. The man screams.

				MAX 
		Who are you working for?
	
				PHOTOGRAPHER 
		Here, here.
	
	The photographer hands Max his wallet.

				MAX
		I don't want your wallet. Who sent you?
	
	Max grabs the kid's camera.

				MAX
		Who the hell sent you!?
	
				PHOTOGRAPHER 
		Wha...I'm sorry...
	
				MAX 
		Who are you?!
	
				PHOTOGRAPHER 
		I'm...a...student I've got 
		an assignment for class.
	
	The Photographer pulls out his student ID. Max looks at it. 
	Then he rips out the film-exposing it.

				MAX 
		Leave me alone, damn it. 
		Leave me alone.

	Max hands the man back his camera and leaves.

	EXT. MAX'S APARTMENT - NIGHT 
	Max heads home in a furious state. Suddenly, he sees two of 
	Marcy's men blocking his path. It's Brad and Jake, yet another 
	tough guy, and they don't look happy. Max spins around and 
	sees Marcy Dawson blocking his exit.

				MAX 
		Marcy? What's up?
	
	Max retreats.

				MARCY DAWSON 
		Let's take a ride, Max.
	
				MAX 
		I can't, I got work...
	
	Max looks back at the tough guys who are almost on top of him.

				MARCY DAWSON 
		We had a deal! NOW get in the limo!
	
	Marcy releases a vicious slap that nearly knocks Max down. Max 
	whimpers.

				MAX 
		Don't ever hit...
	
	He pushes Marcy aside and darts.

	EXT. CITY STREETS - NIGHT 
	Max flees. Jake and Brad charge after him. They're right on 
	him - he has a meter or so on them.
	He scurries through a construction site and over a footbridge.

	Then, he runs into an all-night 
	BODEGA

	The tough guys chase after him and he gets a bit of a
	lead in the narrow aisles. He pleads with the owners for
	help - nothing doing.

	Jake heads him off and uses his body to block the aisle. But 
	Max grabs a can of beans and slams it down on the tough guy's 
	nose. The guy goes down and Max shoots out the exit.

	EXT. UNDERNEATH CAR - NIGHT 
	Max dives under a car and crawls for terror. He sees two sets 
	of feet nun by. Max starts to relax when he notices a pair of 
	heels on the other side of the car. Marcy bends down and looks 
	at him.

				MARCY DAWSON 
		Enough, Max, c'mon out.
	
				MAX 
		Leave me alone. I don't 
		know anything.

	Max retreats in the opposite direction. Suddenly Jake and Brad 
	grab him and drag him out.

				MAX 
		Hey! Hey! Hey!
	
	They search him, taking his wallet, keys, everything.

	Marcy looks at the guys, who shake their heads. She walks over 
	to Max and shows Max the front page of the Wall Street 
	Journal. It reads, "MARKET CRACHES"

				MARCY DAWSON 
		You're responsible for this.
	
				MAX 
		I didn't do anything. I 
		didn't play the market.

				MARCY DAWSON 
		But we did.
	
	Marcy pulls out a folded, worn piece of paper. She opens it. 
	It's Max's stock pick that he threw out. Part of THE number is 
	on the page

				MARCY DAWSON 
		You have to be careful 
		where you throw out your trash.

				MAX 
		How could you do that?
	
				MARCY DAWSON 
		You gave us faulty information. 
		You gave us the carrot, the right 
		picks, but then you only gave us 
		part of the code.

				MAX 
		You selfish, irresponsible 
		cretins. How could you be so 
		stupid!?

	Marcy jabs Max in his stomach. Max falls to the ground. The 
	tough guys sit on him.

				MARCY DAWSON 
		C'mon, Max. This isn't a 
		game anymore. We're playing 
		on a global scale. We used 
		your code. Foolish...I admit. 
		But we can fix things if we 
		make some careful picks. Give 
		us the rest of the code so 
		we can set things right.

				MAX
		C'mon! I know who you are. 
		You're not gonna save the world.

				MARCY DAWSON 
		Look, Max...
	
	Marcy nods to Jake, who pulls out a gun and points it at Max's 
	head.

				MAX 
		My God, what are you doing?
	
				MARCY DAWSON 
		Information is 
		the private language
		of Capital. We tried to 
		establish a symbiotic 
		relationship but if
		you choose to compete and 
		enter our niche we are forced 
		to comply with the laws of 
		nature.
	
	Max thinks for a second. Max thinks hard. He realizes be
	can't give them the number.

				MAX 
		You can't kill me!
	
				MARCY DAWSON 
		C'mon, Max. You 
		don't get it. I don't
		give a shit about you. I only 
		care about what's in your 
		fucking head. If you won't help 
		us help yourself, then I'll 
		have only one choice. Destroy the 
		competition. I'll take you 
		out of the game. Survival of the 
		fittest, Max. And we've got 
		the gun.
	
	Jake cocks the gun. Max starts to cry.

				MAX 
		You bastards! You stupid 
		bastards!

	Suddenly, Jake is whacked with a sawed-off baseball bat.
	He smashes into the sidewalk.
	It is Farrouhk, Max's neighbor, who's just pulled up in his 
	taxicab.

				MAX 
			(Spotting his savior) 
		Farrouhk!
	
	Farroukh threatens Marcy and the other tough guy, who
	retreat in fear. Farroubk is afraid as well, so he doesn't
	quite leap on them. He just keeps swinging the bat.

				FARROUHK 
		He's sick! He's sick!
	
	Max gets to his feet and runs behind Farrouhk. 
	Just then a station wagon screeches up to the curb. Lenny 
	Meyer, Ephraim, and a bunch of other his burly Jews jump out.

				LENNY MEYER 
		Max!
	
	Max looks at Farrouhk and then he looks at Lenny. Ephraim
	grabs Max and pulls him toward the station wagon.

				MAX 
			(To Farrouhk) 
		C'mon...
	
	Farrouhk heads for his cab. Ephraim helps Max into the
	backseat of the wagon and climbs in after him.

	Lenny Meyer jumps into the passenger seat and the gray-bearded 
	YISRAEL slams on the gas Pedal.

	Farrouhk jumps into his cab.

	INT. LENNY MEYER'S CAR - MOVING - NIGHT 
	Yisrael yanks the steering wheel to the left, the old station 
	wagon skids around a corner.

				MAX 
		Farrouhk what about Farrouhk!?
	
				LENNY MEYER 
		Stay down!
	
	Ephraim pushes Max's head down. Yisrael takes another
	corner sharp.

				MAX 
		Go back!
	
				LENNY MEYER 
		He's okay, he got 
		in his cab. We've been
		looking for you.
	
				MAX 
		What's going on?
	
				LENNY MEYER 
		Do you have the number?
	
				MAX 
		What's going on?
	
				LENNY MEYER 
		Do you have the number?
	
				MAX 
		Yeah, I have it!
	
				LENNY MEYER 
		You have it. Where is it? 
		You have it written down?

				MAX 
		What is it?
	
	Lenny nods to Ephraim, who starts scanning through
	Max's pockets. Max resists. The other guys hold him down.

				MAX 
		What are you doing!? What 
		the hell are you doing!?

				LENNY MEYER 
		We're not joking 
		around, Max? Where's
		the number?
	
				MAX 
			(Pushing Ephraim away) 
		It's not on me. It's in my
		head.

				LENNY MEYER 
		You memorized it? 
		Did you give it to them?

				MAX 
		Who?
	
				LENNY MEYER 
		Who!? Those 
		Wall Street bastards.

				MAX 
		Why do you care?
	
				LENNY MEYER
		Just answer me!
	
				MAX 
		Screw you!
	
				LENNY MEYER 
			(In Hebrew) 
		Hit him!
	
	Yisrael screeches the car to a halt. He spins around in his 
	seat and looks Max in the face.

				LENNY MEYER 
		You're dealing with something 
		really big now, Max. I don't 
		want to hurt you, so answer 
		me. Did you give it to them?

				MAX 
		They've got part of it 
		Now get off me!

				LENNY MEYER 
		Damn it! Damn it! 
		They're using it.

				MAX 
		Using what?
	
				LENNY MEYER 
		Shut up!
	
				MAX 
		Let go!
	
	Max chews into Ephraim's hand which is pinning him. Ephraim 
	screams and lets loose a punch to Max's jaw.

				LENNY MEYER 
		No, don't!
	
	But Lenny is late, and Max's world - as well as ours goes 
	black.

	INT. MAX'S APARTMENT - NIGHT 
	Max stares suspiciously at the bathroom. He slowly picks up 
	his drill. Wielding it like a hammer, he carefully advances 
	into the 
	BATHROOM where he looks into the sink. He almost vomits when 
	he sees a piece of human brain sitting above the drain. Ants 
	swarm across its surface.

	Max becomes furious. He whacks it with the drill. Blood flies 
	up into his face. In a wild rage, he smashes it and punches 
	it.

	Then he drops the drill and uses his bare hands to shove it 
	down the drain. Screaming like a madman, he jams it until it 
	is gone.

	INT. BASEMENT SHUL - DAY

	A wise-looking, bearded Hasidic man with benevolent, piercing 
	eyes stands tenderly over Max. He wears traditional black 
	clothes. Lenny Meyer paces nervously in the background.

	As Max comes through, RAV COHEN speaks.

				RAV COHEN 
		Max, Max. You're 
		okay I'm Rabbi Cohen. Cohen 
		like you. I'm sorry for what 
		Lenny did, he's been 
		reprimanded. It is not our way 
		Are you okay?

				MAX 
		Yeah, yeah
	
				RAV COHEN 
		Everything will be 
		fine, Max. You need to give 
		us the number. Do you have 
		it?

				MAX 
		What is it?
	
				LENNY MEYER 
			(Charging over) 
		I told you we don't know
	
				MAX 
		You wouldn't be so 
		flipped out if you didn't 
		know. What's happening to me?
	
				LENNY MEYER 
		Give us the number!
	
				MAX 
		Screw you!
	
				RAV COHEN 
		Okay, okay! Lenny, 
		easy! Max, I'll tell you 
		what's going on. Just calm 
		down. 
			(Deep breath, then) 
		The Talmud tells us it began two 
		thousand years ago, when the 
		Romans destroyed the second 
		temple.

				MAX 
		What are you...
	
				RAV COHEN 
		Just give me a chance. 
		You'll understand everything 
		if you listen.
	
	Max takes out his pills and starts feeding himself some.

				RAV COHEN 
		The Romans also 
		murdered all of our priest-
		hoodthe Cohanimthe Cohens, 
		and with their deaths they 
		destroyed our greatest 
		secret. In the center of the 
		great temple was the holy of 
		holies which was the heart of 
		Jewish life. This was the 
		earthly residence for our 
		God. The one God. It 
		contained the ark of the 
		Tabernacle which stored the 
		original Ten Commandments 
		that God gave to Moses. Only 
		one man could enter this 
		space once a year on the 
		holiest day of the year, Yom 
		Kippur On the Day of 
		Atonement, all of Israel 
		would descend upon Jerusalem 
		to witness the High Cohen's 
		trip into the holy of holies. 
		If the holy man was pure he 
		would reemerge a few moments 
		later and Israel was secured 
		a prosperous year. It meant 
		that we were one yea r closer 
		to the messianic age. Closer 
		to the return of the Garden 
		of Eden. But if he was 
		impure, he would die 
		instantly and it meant that 
		we were doomed. The High 
		Cohen had a single ritual to
		perform in the holy of holies. 
		He had to intone a single 
		word.

	Rav Cohen takes a dramatic pause. Max is anxious to hear the 
	end of the story.

				MAX
		So?
	
				RAV COHEN
		That word was the true name of God.
	
				MAX
		Yeah...
	
				RAV COHEN
		The true name, which only 
		the Cohanim knew, was two 
		hundred and sixteen letters 
		long.

	A long beat.

				MAX 
			(Incredulous) 
		You're telling me that the number in 
		my head is the name of God!?

	Wondrously, Max rubs the scar on his head.

				RAV COHEN 
			(Passion building) 
		Yes...it's The key into 
		the messianic age. As the 
		Romans burned the temple, the 
		Talmud says, the High Cohen 
		walked into the flames. He 
		took his secret to the top of 
		the burning building. The 
		heavens opened up and took 
		the key from the priest's 
		outstretched hand. We've been 
		searching for the key ever 
		since. And you may have found 
		it. Now let us find out.
	
				MAX 
		That's what happened. I 
		saw God.

				RAV COHEN 
		No, no, Max. 
		You're not pure. You can't 
		see God unless you're pure.
	
				MAX 
		It's more than God...
		it s everything. It's math 
		and science and nature...
		the universe. I saw the 
		Universe's DNA
	
				RAV COHEN 
		You saw nothing.
	
				MAX 
		I saw everything.
	
				RAV COHEN 
		There's much more. 
		We can unlock the door with 
		the key. It will show God 
		that we are pure again. He 
		will return us to The Garden.
	
				MAX 
		Garden? You're not pure. 
		I'm the one who has the 
		number
	
				RAV COHEN 
		Who do you think 
		you are? You are a vessel 
		from our God. You are 
		carrying a delivery that 
		needs to be made to us.
	
				MAX 
		It was given to me. It's 
		part of me. It's changing me.

				RAV COHEN 
		It's killing you. 
		Because you are impure.

				LENNY MEYER 
		It will kill you!
	
				MAX 
		And what will it do to 
		you?

				LENNY MEYER 
		We're pure. Give 
		us the number!

				MAX 
		The number is nothing. 
		You know that!

				RAV COHEN 
		We can use it. We 
		can wield it.

				MAX 
		It's just a number. I'm 
		sure you've written down 
		every two hundred sixteen number. 
		You've translated all of 
		them. You've intoned them 
		all. Haven't you? But what's 
		it gotten you? It's not the 
		number! It's the meaning. 
		It's the syntax. It's what's 
		between the numbers. If you 
		could understand you would. 
		But it's not for you! I've 
		got it. I understand it. I'm 
		going to see it! 
			(Whispers to Rav Cohen) 
		Rabbi...I was chosen.
	
	EXT. CITY STREETS - DAY

	Max races through the streets of New York. He is wide-eyed.

				MAX (V.0.) 
		Suddenly, it's all there. 
		It all makes sense. I 
		can crack it. I can know it. 
		I know what it is. Sol knows, 
		too. I need to tell him. I 
		need to show him. I need to 
		bring him with me.
	
	People fly by. Max in a spiraling whirlwind.

	EXT. SOL'S APARTMENT - NIGHT

	A pumped and excited Max paces the hall as he rings the bell.

	The door opens. But it isn't Sol. It's a young, beautiful 
	woman wearing a simple black dress. Her name is JENNY ROBESON 
	and she is Sol's niece.

				JENNY ROBESON 
		Can I help you?
	
				MAX 
			(Confused) 
		Sol?
	
				JENNY ROBESON 
		Were you a friend?
	
				MAX 
		What do you mean?
	
				JENNY ROBESON 
		He had a second stroke.
	
				MAX 
		Where is he?
	
	Jenny's eyes drop.

				MAX 
		No.
	
	Max rushes into Sol s study. The room is covered with Sol's P, 
	research books. It seems Sol had recently come out of 
	retirement. Max looks at a few of Sol's books. Then he finds a 
	piece of paper with Sol's handwriting on it. On the paper is 
	THE number. Max slides it into his pocket.

	Max looks at the Go board. The pieces are arranged in a giant 
	spiral across the board.

	DISSOLVE TO

	INT. MAX'S APARTMENT - DAY

	Max sits on his bed staring at Sol's handwritten number.
	Then he notices that his thumb is twitching. He drops Sol's 
	note.

				MAX
		Stop it, please!

	He dumps the contents of the bottle of pills into his hand.

	Max stops as he prepares to shove the pills down his throat. 
	He looks at the pills. Then he looks at Euclid around him. He 
	throws the pills and the bottle to the floor. They fall to 
	earth in SLOW MOTION.

	The room rushes in on Max and so does the pain. It throws him 
	to the ground and he bashes his head against the floor.

				MAX 
			(Courageously) 
		No. No. I'm ready. I'm 
		ready! Show me!

	Max recites THE number and uses it to get to his feet. The 
	pain rips apart his voice.

	Max's pain and anger transform into violence. He attacks 
	Euclid furiously. He recites the number with rage in his 
	voice.

				MAX 
		Three, seven, two...
	
	He smashes the old computer apart. He tosses his step stool 
	through the mainframe.

	Then he goes to the window and tries to rip off the cardboard 
	covering the glass panes. Nothing doing, so he yanks the 
	entire window wide open.

	Sunlight floods the room and throws Max into the 
	BLINDING WHITE VOID 
	where Max looks around starry-eyed. The pain is gone. 
	Everything is new to Max - even his hands. The stress leases 
	from his brow and his shoulders sag.

	Max continues to recite the number His voice becomes tender 
	and peaceful. As he starts to become part of the void, his 
	voice turns into a whisper and his eyes start to close.

	Then he hears Devi.

				DEVI (O.S.) 
		Max. Max! Are you 
		okay!? Oh my God, Max!

	Her voice reaches into the void.

				DEVI (O.S) 
		Max! Breathe, Max. Breathe!
	
	Max looks toward her voice.

				DEVI (O.S.) 
		Yes, Max. Listen to me...
	
	We cut back to 
	...THE MAIN ROOM 
	where Devi leans over Max. Max's eyes are open while he 
	continues to recite the number.

				DEVI 
		Breathe, Max! Breathe. 
		Focus.

	Max turns away from Devi and we return to the 
	BLINDING WHITE VOID 
	where Max continues to recite the number.

				DEVI (O.S.) 
		No, Max. No. 
		Stay with me Max. Stay with 
		me. 
	
	And then we cut back to 
	THE MAIN ROOM 
	where Devi grabs Max's palm. Max's fingers wrap around her 
	hand. We return to 
	THE BLINDING WHITE VOID 
	where Max stops reciting the number. He suddenly opens his 
	fear filled eyes.

				MAX 
		Where am I? What is 
		this? This is wrong, Sol. 
		Sol!
	
	Max lets out a 'SOL!, and reaches out into the void. We match 
	cut back to 
	THE MAIN ROOM

	where Max grabs Devi and hugs her. He gasps for air as
	he collapses into her arms, sobbing.

				MAX 
		Sol! You were right Sol! 
		He was right.

				DEVI 
		That's right Max. That's 
		Right. Breathe. Breathe.

				MAX 
		He was right. I want to 
		breathe. Breathe.

				DEVI 
		Yes, breathe, Max. 
		Breathe...

	Max sobs. He holds onto her for dear life

	And then be realizes that Devi is not in his arms. He is 
	holding onto himself.

	Then Max notices Sol's note on the ground. He looks at the 
	number. He collects himself and catches his breath.

	INT. MAX'S BATHROOM  DAY

	Max looks at Sol's note. He lights a match and burns it.

	Next, he prepares something in the sink.

	We hear the WHINE of a motor. Then it stops, Max looks at 
	himself in the mirror, He smiles. Then he gets solemn.

	He takes a deep breath. Then we hear the motor again. Max 
	lifts up his arm. He's holding a drill. He places the bit 
	against the math section of his scalp.

	He applies pressure and drills into his brain.

	Max collapses as we quickly 
	CUT TO

	EXT. CITY PLAYGROUND - DAY

	TIGHT ON
	a tree branch gently blowing in the wind.

	Max watches it with peaceful, understanding eyes. He wears a 
	hat on his head.

	He listens to the wind in the trees.

	Just then, Jenna surprises him with her Fisher Price 
	calculator on hand.

				JEHNA 
		Max, Max!
	
	Max smiles at Jenna. He's glad to see her.

				JENNA 
		Can we do one, Max, can 
		we?

	Max shrugs, not able to say no.

				JENNA 
		How about two hundred 
		and fifty-five times a 
		hundred and eighty-three.
	
	Jenna types m the number.

	Max is about to say "no" to Jenna, but then be decides to give 
	it a shot.

	Max thinks, he really thinks.

	Jenna presses the EQUALS button.

				JENNA 
		I got it! I got it! 
		What's the answer?

				MAX 
			(Smiling and then laughing) 
		I don't know. I really don't 
		know. What is it, Jenna?

				JENNA 
		Forty-six thousand six 
		hundred and sixty-five.

				MAX 
		Oh.
	
	The trees blow gently in the wind as we slowly 
	FADE TO WHITE which brings us to 
	THE END

	TITLES EXPLODE TO WHITE

	SLOW FADE TO:

	EXTREME CLOSE-UP of MAXIMILIAN COHEN'S eyes popping open.

	INT. MAX'S APARTMENT -CHINATOWN FLAT  NEW YORK CITY - NIGHT

	Max jolts his head from his desk and tries to orient him-self 
	in the darkness. He has intelligent eyes set in an exhausted, 
	good-looking face.

	Then he notices the blood dripping from his nose. Max wipes 
	it.

	Max's voiceover begins:

				MAX (V.O.)  
		Monday, September first. 
		Six-fifteen.

	INT. BATHROOM - DAWN

	A pull-string light flips on. Max examines his bloody nose in 
	the mirror.

				MAX (V.O.) 
		The alchemist awakes. 
			(Imitating) 
		"Turn lead into gold, Max, 
		lead into gold." Today, I find it.

	TIGHT ON

	Max's hand as three unmarked, circular pills hit his palm. 
	Then, he slams the pills into the back of his mouth.

	Max replaces the cap on a plastic bottle of unmarked 
	prescription drugs. He drinks from the sink and splashes a 
	generous amount of water onto his head and face, cleaning his 
	nose.

	He wipes his nose and examines the last remnants of blood on 
	his fingertip. Then, he dips his finger under the tap.

	INT. MAX'S APARTMENT - MAIN ROOM - DAY

	Max's room is constantly dark because the windows are blacked 
	out. He flips on his desk lamp.

	A tiny ANT crawls across his desk. He looks at it for a moment 
	before getting angry and squashing it.

	Sitting on the desk are three computer monitors, which Max 
	flips on.

	Then he pops on more lights and more switches. We pull back 
	revealing that Max's apartment looks more like the inside of a 
	computer than a human's home.

	The room is knee-high in computer parts of all shapes and 
	sizes. The walls are covered with circuit boards. Cables hang 
	from the ceiling like vines in a Brazilian rain forest. They 
	all seem to be wired together forming a monstrous homemade 
	computer.

	This is EUCLID, Max's creation. The computer is alive with 
	sounds and lights.

	Max works on Euclid with his solder and drill. He cares for 
	the machine as if it were his dream car

				MAX (V.O.) 
		Heat's been getting 
		to Euclid. Feel it most in 
		the afternoon when I run the 
		set. Have to keep the fans on 
		all night from now on. 
		Otherwise, everything is 
		running topnotch. The stack 
		of 286's is now faster than 
		Columbia's computer science 
		department. I spent a couple 
		hundred dollars. Columbia's 
		cost? Half a million? 
			(Small snicker) 
		Ha...
	
	Max checks the peephole on His front door. No one is there. He 
	unbolts the five lock and slides into the hall.

	INT. APARTMENJ HALLWAY - DAY

	As he secures his apartment, a Young girl named JENNA runs up 
	to him. Her MOM, down the hall, looks apologetic.

	Jenna's eyes light up and she pulls out her Fisher Price 
	calculator.

				JENNA 
		Max, Max! Can we do one?
	
				MOM 
			(Over and over again) 
		Jenna! Jenna!
	
				MAX 
		Oh, no.
	
				JENNA 
		What's three hundred 
		and twenty-two times four 
		hundred and ninety-one.
	
	Jenna types it into her calculator. Max finishes locking his 
	door.

				MAX 
			(instantly) 
		One hundred fifty-eight thousand, 
		a hundred two. Right?

				JENNA 
			(Eyes light up) 
		Right.
	
	Max heads down the staircase.

				MOM 
		Jenna...
	
	Jenna screams after him.

				JENNA 
		Okay, seventy-three 
		divided by twenty-two.

				MAX 
			(instantly again) 
		Three point three one eight one 
		eight one eight...

	EXT. CHINATOWN - DAY 
	Max watches people bustle through the busy intersections of 
	Chinatown. The streets are clogged with people.

				MAX (V.O.) 
		Somewhere in there. 
		Somewhere. I know it's right 
		in front of me. The pattern. 
		They say it's chaos, it can't 
		be understood, too much 
		complexity.

	EXT. ELECTRONIC MEGADUMP - DAY 
	Max scavenges electronic parts as he carefully navigates an 
	endless dump for old and rotting computers.

				MAX (V.O.) 
		History it's there. 
		Lurking, shaping. 
		structuring, hiding, right 
		beneath the surface.

	He unscrews a random IBM Board from a keyboard and slides it 
	into his pocket.

	EXT PLAYGROUND  DAY 
	MOVE IN
	on Max looking up at something as he reclines on a public 
	bench.

				MAX (V.0.) 
		The cycling of disease epidemics, 
		the wax and wane of Caribou populations 
		in the Arctic, sunspot cycles, 
		the rise and fall of the 
		Nile and yes! the New York Stock 
		Exchange, they are all the 
		same.
	
	MOVE IN
	on a tree branch - shaking gently in the wind.

	SLOW DISSOLVE TO EXTREME CLOSE-UP OF STOCK TICKER 
	Bright stock quotes drift across the screen.

				MAX (V.O.) 
		I'll find this structure, 
		this order, this perfection.

	INT. MAX'S APARTMENT - DAY 
	Max stares intensely at the ticker on the small TV that sits 
	next to his monitors.

				MAX (V.O.) 
		Turn lead into gold. 
		The first. Right here. Right 
		here. With math. The numbers 
		of the stock market are my 
		lead. When I find the 
		pattern, then I will find 
		gold.
	
	Max watches the right edge of the screen where the numbers 
	appear. He wants to see what's before that edge...

	Max slaps the RETURN button on his computer.

	The phone starts ringing.
	Max eyes it suspiciously.

	Just then, Euclid starts printing results on an old dot-
	matrix printer.

	Max suspiciously answers The phone.

				MAX 
		Hello?
	
				WOMAN'S VOICE 
		Maximilian Cohen, please.
	
				MAX 
		Yeah?
	
				WOMAN'S VOICE 
		Mr. Cohen?
	
				MAX 
		Who's this?
	
				WOMAN'S VOICE 
		Hi. my name is Marcy Dawson. 
		I'm a partner with the predictive 
		strategy firm Lancet-Percy. Can I 
		speak with Mr. Cohen, please?

				MAX 
		I told you...
	
	The printer finishes printing.

				MARCY DAWSON 
		Mr. Cohen! How 
		are you? It's been a long 
		time. Sorry I haven't been in 
		touch. But I was hoping you 
		would allow me to take you to 
		lunch tomorrow, say one 
		o'clock?
	
				MAX 
		Sorry, I can't.
	
				MARCY DAWSON 
		We're very anxious to talk 
		with you, sir

				MAX 
		I can't.
	
				MARCY DAWSON 
		I'm prepared to 
		make you a generous...

	Max hurries to wrap up the conversation.

				MAX 
		I don't take offers for 
		my research. You know that. 
		Sorry, I Couldn't help you.
	
				MARCY DAWSON 
		Mr. Cohen, give 
		me a moment...

	But before Marcy finishes, Max hangs up. He rips off the 
	printout and heads to the front door.

	He checks the peephole, His landlady. MRS. OVADIA, is sweeping 
	the hallway stairs humming a turn-of-the century (the last 
	one, not this one) tune.

	Max waits a moment. He tousles his hair. Then he checks again. 
	She's gone. He opens his locks and releases several bolts.

	INT.MAX'S BUILDING HALLWAY - DAY

	Max locks his front door. Meanwhile, his next-door neighbor, 
	DEVI MINSTRY, a sexy young Indian woman, is just getting home. 
	Max looks away and tries to get his door locked.

	She's weighted down by a bunch of bags filled with food.

				DEVI 
		Max, good! 
	
				MAX 
		Hi, Devi.
	
				DEV1 
		I grabbed you some 
		somosas. 
				MAX 
		Great.
	
	Devi heads over to Max with her bags of food. She looks up at 
	Max.

				DEVI 
		Your hair.
	
	Devi hands the bags to Max. Then she goes to pat down his 
	Hair. Max retreats.

				MAX 
		What are you doing?
	
				DEVI 
		Your hair, you can't go 
		out like that. Don't worry. 
				MAX 
		It's fine. It's fine.
	
	Devi pats down his hair. Max is humiliated. 
				DEVI 
		You need a mom.
	
	Max hands back the bags and heads quickly for the stairs. 
				MAX 
		I have to go.
	
				DEVI 
		Your somosas!
	
	An embarrassed Max takes the bag.

				MAX 
		Thanks.
	
	INT. COFFEE SHOP - DAY

	At the counter, Max stirs cream into his coffee. Then he takes 
	three pills from the plastic bottle and drops them in his 
	coffee.

	Max flips past a full-page ad in the paper that reads 
	LANCET-PERCY 86% ACCURACY (ONLY GOD IS PERFECT). 
	Max flips the page before he or we can absorb it. He compares 
	stock quotes in the Wall Street Journal against his printout.

				MAX (V.O.) 
		Sixteen, twenty-seven. Results: Euclid 
		shows tomorrow's Dow closing 
		up by four points. Anomalies 
		include PRONET at sixty-fire 
		and a quarter, a career high. 
		Possible explanations, either 
		A, an error in the June fifth 
		algorithm, or B, Euclid's 
		main processor is running a 
		recursion...

	Max marks up the paper with lines and diagrams as he ponders 
	his bits and misses.

	Then a puff of cigarette smoke drifts by and succeeds in 
	bothering Max. He fans it away when

				VOICE FROM OFFSCREEN 
		Oh sorry, am I bothering you?
	
	Max shrugs and looks over.

	The voice belongs to LENNY MEYERa bearded man in his late 20s 
	sucking on a cigarette.

	On closer inspection, something is off. It seems that Lenny is 
	an Orthodox Jew. His yarmulke sticks out Slightly from his 
	wide-brimmed hat and the fringes from his tsi-tsis hang out 
	from the bottom of his untucked shirt.

				LENNY MEYER 
		I'll put it out. 
			(Which he does) 
		The name's Lenny Meyer
	
	Lenny sticks out his hand. Max responds with a small nod. 
				LENNY MEYER 
		And you are?
	
				MAX 
		Max.
	
				LENNY MEYER 
		Max? 
	
				MAX 
		Max Cohen.
	
				LENNY MEYER 
		Cohen! 
			(Judging) 
		Jewish? 
	Max shrugs and turns back to his work.

				LENNY MEYER 
		It's okay. 
			(Joking) 
				I'm a Jew, too. 
			(Serious) 
				Do you practice?

				MAX 
		No, I'm not interested 
		in religion.

				LENNY MEYER 
		Have you ever 
		heard of Kabbalah?


				MAX 
		No.

				LENNY MEYER 
		Jewish mysticism.
	
				MAX 
		I'm sorry, I'm very busy.
	
				LENNY MEYER 
		I understand...it's just that 
		it's a very exciting time in 
		our history. Right now is a 
		critical moment in time.

				MAX 
			(Sarcastic) 
		Really?
	
				LENNY MEYER 
		Yes, it's very exciting. 
		Have you ever put on Tefillin?

	Max has no idea what Lenny's talking about. Lenny pulls a 
	leather box with black leather straps from his pocket.

				LENNY MEYER 
		Tefillin. You know Tefillin. 
		I know it looks strange. 
		But it's an amazing 
		tradition that has a 
		tremendous amount of power. 
		It's a mitzvah for all 
		Jewish men to do. Mitzvahs, 
		good deeds, are spiritual 
		food for our hearts and our 
		heads.

	And then Max notices that his thumb is twitching He grabs it 
	self-consciously.

				LENNY MEYER 
		They purify us and bring us 
		closer to God. You want to try it?

	Just then, Max pays his bill and prepares to leave.

				MAX 
		I gotta go...
	
				LENNY MEYER 
		Are you okay? Max? Max?
	
				MAX 
		I'm sorry, bye.
	
				LENNY MEYER 
		Well, maybe some other time.
	
	INT. MAX'S BATHROOM - NIGHT 
	Max splashes water on his face.

				MAX 
		Please God, Let it be a 
		small one.

	He pulls a metal vaccinating gun out of the medicine cabinet. 
	Then be loads it with a small bottle of medicine. He rolls up 
	his sleeve, dabs alcohol on his arm, and fires the gun into 
	his arm.

				MAX (V.O.) 
		Sixteen thirty-five. 
		Second headache in under 
		twenty-four hours. They're 
		getting more frequent 
		now...more painful, too. Drugs 
		don't work, just take the 
		edge off of it. Just gotta 
		wait for the nosebleed. 
		Relief comes from my nose.
	
	Next door, he hears Devi and her boyfriend talking.

				FARROUHK (O.S.) 
		So I gotta make this drop off 
		in Harlem and on the way down 
		there's these three kids 
		hailing me.

	Max slaps himself in the face a few times.

				DEVI (O.S.) 
		You stopped?
	
				FARROUHK (O.S.) 
		I was tight, so...
	
	Max watches his thumb twitch. And then pain shoots through 
	him. He grabs the right side of his head, massages it, and 
	pushes it in with his fingers.

	In the mirror, he examines the right side of his scalp. He 
	sees nothing

				MAX 
		Ahh...
	
	Max walks back into the 
	MAIN ROOM

	and sits down in a chair. The lamp is blinding so he
	snaps it off. Only the bathroom light lights the room. He 
	takes a few breaths.

				MAX 
		Leave me alone.
	
	His neighbors conversation begins to build in volume
	and distortion.

				FARROUHK (O.S.) 
		So I drop them off in the 
		Village and they dart.

				DEVI (O.S.) 
		Oh God...
	
	Max gags and rubs his head.

				FARROUHK (O.S.) 
		I get out, grab my bat and 
		start running. One of the kids, 
		maybe sixteen, I catch a block 
		later he's cursing at me, calling 
		me a Paki bastard. So I whacked him, 
		right in the head.

				DEVI (O.S.) 
		Farrouhk!
	
	The pain seems to disappear. Max looks at his hand that was 
	rubbing his bead.

	Then he looks at the front door. The doorknob seems to
	move. 
	Something begins knocking on Max's door. The knocking gets 
	louder and louder then the locks begin to unlock.

	FARROUHK's words begin to overpower Max.

				FARROUHK (O.S.) 
		I'm kicking the bastard in the 
		ribs banging his ass, knocking his 
		head against the curb, harder 
		and harder, I fucking lost 
		it. A hot dog guy starts 
		screaming "You're cracking his 
		skull, you're cracking his 
		skull." So they pulled me off 
		of him and calmed me down. 
		Cops said he had it coming to 
		him.
	
	Then something starts pounding the door. The doorknob quivers, 
	the locks unbolt. The chains are the only thing keeping out 
	the intruder. The door shakes and the chains are strained.

	MAX is paralyzed with terror.

				MAX 
		No! No!
	
	And then the door smashes open. Blinding light fills the room 
	and we crash into the

	BLINDING WHITE VOID

	A moment of silence, then we 
	CUT TO 
	INT. BATHROOM - DAWN 
	A phone rings incessantly. Max's eyes pop open. He's scrunched 
	up in a corner of the room, squashed beneath the sink.

	His nose is bleeding.

	Max, crawls into the 
	MAIN ROOM

	and picks up the phone. He pinches his nose and tilts his head 
	back.

				MARCY DAWSON 
		Mr. Cohen. Marcy 
		Dawson here again I was just 
		looking over my schedule and 
		I realized I'll be in your 
		neighborhood tomorrow around 
		three.

	Max heads to the 
	FRONT DOOR

	and checks the locks. He is barely listening to Marcy

				MAX 
			(Groggy) 
		Who is...
	
	The locks seem secure.

				MARCY DAWSON 
		Marcy Dawson from 
		Lancet-Percy I'm so anxious 
		to meet you. It will be worth 
		itfor both of us I promise. 
		See you at your house at 
		three, okay?

				MAX 
		My house...how do...
	
				MARCY DAWSON 
		Oh, don't worry, 
		I got your address from 
		Columbia. So three it is. 
		Looking forward to it.

	Max tries to stop her but, before he can Marcy hangs up.
	A bewildered Max slowly hangs up.

				MAX 
		Damn.
	
	Max checks the peephole - all clear.

	Then, he opens his -

	CLOSET

	which is filled with random computer parts and boxes.

	He pulls a thick neuroscience book from a shelf in the back of 
	the closet. He almost knocks over an old dusty brass 
	microscope on the shelf.

	Max flips through the book. It contains old plates 
	illustrating the brain. Max examines some of the diagrams.

	EXT. S0L'S HALLWAY - DAY Max rings the bell on an apartment 
	door.

	A few moments pass, and then SOL ROBESON opens the door.

	Sol is a wise-looking man in his early 70's. He walks with 
	difficulty, leaning out of breath on a wooden cane.

	His arms are covered with faded Russian prison tattoos and he 
	speaks with a thick Eastern European accent, He's happy to see 
	Max.

				S0L 
		Max! How are you7
	
	Max is happy to see Sol, but he's a bit bashful and 
	intimidated.

				MAX Okay.

	EXT. SOL'S STUDY - MOMENTS LATER 
	TIGHT ON the Japanese game of Go being played. Sol is white 
	and Max is black. Sol's moves are secure and controlled while 
	Max is hesitant.

				SOL 
		Stop thinking, Max, just 
		feel. Use your intuition. 
		It's the only way to get into 
		the flow. 
			(Beat) 
		What did you think of Hamlet?
	
				MAX 
		I didn't get to it.
	
				SOL 
		It's been a month. 
			(Knowingly) 
		You haven't taken 
		a single break.

				MAX 
		I'm so close, Sol. I'm 
		so close but I just can't 
		grab it.
	
	Sol changes the subject. He feeds his goldfish and points to 
	one of them.

				SOL 
		Have you met the new 
		fish my niece bought me? I 
		named her Icarus. After you. 
		My renegade pupil. You fly 
		too high, you'll get burned.
	
	Max looks up at Sol.

				SOL 
		The more I see you, the 
		more I see myself thirty 
		years ago. My greatest pupil. 
		Published at 16, Ph.D. at 20.

				MAX 
		We'll see.
	
				SOL 
		But life isn't just 
		mathematics. I spent forty 
		years looking for patterns in 
		Pi, I found nothing.

				MAX 
		You found things...
	
				SOL 
		I found things, but not a 
		pattern.

	INT. MOVING TRAIL - DAY

	Max sits in the corner of a rickety New York City subway car. 
	The train is almost completely deserted.

	Max looks down at his hand. He opens his palm and reveals a 
	black Go chip.

				MAX (V.O.) 
		Tuesday, September 
		second, eighteen twelve. If 
		Sol hadn't gotten sick who 
		knows where math would be. He 
		spent years in the numbers of 
		Pi. Searching for meaning, for 
		order.
	
	Max notices a SKINNY MAN in a business suit staring at him. 
	The man catches Max's eye and looks away, but then he quickly 
	looks back, making Max turn away.

	He looks down at his Wall Street journal and draws a circle 
	with its diameter then he writes "A=pir2" and "C=2pir." Next 
	he writes "pi=3.14159..."

				MAX (V.O.) 
		Three point one 
		four...off into infinity 
		and maybe insanity. Somewhere 
		in there he wanted sanity. 
		Sanity like he found in the 
		circles Pi represented. 
		Simple, sane circles. If only 
		the stock market had circles. 
		Some type of sanity. Some 
		type of form, of shape.

	Suddenly, Max hears someone singing. Max looks up. It is the 
	Skinny Man and he's singing with passion. It's all very 
	strange to Max, who nervously looks away.

	And then the singing stops
	mid-verse Max looks up and the man is gone. Vanished. Max 
	looks aroundno one in Sight.

	INT. APARTMENT STAIRCASE - DAY

	Max heads up the stairs to his apartment. Just then, a toy 
	SLINKY appears from nowhere marching down the stairs.

	Max stops and waits until the Slinky hits his foot. He picks 
	it up and looks at it.

	He looks around wondering what's going on. Then Jenna leans 
	out over a railing and starts laughing at Max.

	INT. COFFEE SHOP-DAY

	Max sits at the counter frantically looking at the Wall Street 
	Journal. He plops three pills into his coffee.

	He draws circles and other shapes across the page.

	Max is interrupted by a puff of smoke. At the same time, 
	someone touches his shoulder and says:

				LENNY MEYER 
		Hey, Max, how you doing?
	
				MAX 
		Oh, okay.
	
				LENNY MEYER 
		Lenny Meyer. 
			(Motioning to the cigarette) 
		I'll put it out. 
			(Which be does) 
		So, what do you do?
	
				MAX 
		Um, I work with computers 
		...math.

				LENNY MEYER 
		Really? What type of math?
	
				MAX 
		Number theory. Mostly 
		research.

				LENNY MEYER 
		Number theory? No 
		way, I work in theory, too. 
		Not traditional, though...
			(Points to his yarmulke) 
		I work with the Torah. 
			(Awed by the coincidence) 
		Amazing.
	
				MAX 
			(Passing it of as a coincidence) 
		Yeah...
	
				LENNY MEYER
		Yeah. You know Hebrew is 
		all numbers. It's all math.

				MAX 
		Hm.
	
	Lenny pulls out a worn' dog-eared Bible from his pocket. There 
	are paper slips marking what seems like every other page. When 
	he opens it up,
	Max sees that the pages are marked up by highlighter pens, 
	notes and diagrams.

	Lenny points to the text. EXTREME CLOSE-UP of Hebrew letters.

				LENNY MEYER 
		Here, look...the ancient 
		Jews used Hebrew as their 
		numerical system. Each 
		letter is a number.

	Lenny pulls out a pen and grabs Max's Journal. He writes on it 
	as he talks.

				LENNY MEYER
		You see...The Hebrew "A," the 
		number 1. The Hebrew "B," 
		Bet, is two. You can take any 
		Hebrew text and turn them into 
		a long string of numbers.
	
	The waitress refills Max's coffee.

				LENNY MEYER
		The Torah is just 
		a long string of numbers. 
		Some say that it's a long 
		code sent to us from God.

	Satisfied, Lenny lights up a cigarette and takes a drag.

				MAX 
			(Mildly impressed) 
		Kind of interesting.
	
				LENNY MEYER 
			(Proud of himself) 
		Yeah, like take the 
		Hebrew word for, say, the 
		Garden of Eden, Kadem. Kuf, 
		Dalei Mem...Kuf is a 
		hundred. Daled, four Mem, 
		forty. They equal one hundred 
		and forty-four. Then take the 
		tree of knowledge...in 
		the garden, Aat Ha Haim, it 
		equals two hundred and 
		thirty-three. Now you can take 
		that number and...

				MAX 
		They're Fibonacci numbers.
	
				LENNY MEYER 
		Huh?
	
				MAX 
		The Fibonacci sequence. 
		Italian mathematician, thirteenth
		century. If you divide 
		a hundred and forty-four into 
		two hundred and thirty-three, 
		it approaches theta.

				LENNY MEYER 
		Theta?
	
				MAX 
		The Greek symbol for the 
		golden ratio. The golden 
		spiral.
	
	Lenny exhales the smoke. Max quickly graphs the number on his 
	Wall Street Journal.

				LENNY MEYER 
		You're right, I never saw 
		that before. That's the series 
		you find in nature. Like the 
		face of a sunflower.

				MAX 
		Wherever there's spirals.
	
				LENNY MEYER 
		You see, there's math everywhere.
	
	Lenny's smoke drifts by Max's eyes.

	SLOW MOTION: MAX'S POV of smoke spirals spinning in front of 
	him.

				MAX 
		Math everywhere...
	
	SLOW MOTION: Max looks down at his coffee cup. He pours cream 
	into his coffee. It shoots up and mixes with the black coffee 
	forming spirals in the mug.

				MAX 
			(Serious) 
		Everywhere...
	
	SLOW MOTION: Max looks at the spiral he just drew on the Wall 
	Street Journal.

	NORMAL SPEED Suddenly, Max stands up.

				MAX 
		Oh my God...
	
	INT. MAX'S APARTMENT - DAY

	Max draws spirals all over his Wall Street Journal. Then he 
	takes a thick black marker and draws a giant spiral across the 
	entire page.

	Max is ecstatic as he pounds code into the computer takes 
	moments to wake up, drops pills, and drinks a Ginseng soda.

				MAX (V.O.) 
		Simple shapes! 
		Tuesday, September second. 
		Twenty-twenty-two. Sol! Sol! 
		Sol! Shapes in the market. 
		Why not? And they're spirals! 
		Spirals!

	Max traces a big circle on the journal. Then, he cuts it out 
	with an X-acto blade. He cuts out the middle of the circle so 
	that be has a thin loop like one of those futuristic frisbees. 
	He tears part of the loop and stretches the circle out in 
	front of him into a spiral.

				MAX (V.O.) 
		A circle spread out overtime. 
		It's open-ended. It has a 
		beginning and it grows and 
		changes through time. If I 
		can find where it fits, if I 
		can spin it and lock it into 
		a group of numbers, then I 
		can calculate the future. 
		Lead into gold. Chaos into 
		order Madness into sanity. Pain 
		into bliss. Perfection.
	
	Max is about to slap RETURN but he stops himselfhe's nervous.

	Next door, Devi and her boyfriend are making love. He looks at 
	the wall with disdain. Then he looks back at the screen, 
	shrugs and confidently slaps RETURN on his keyboard.

	Stock prices float across the screen. Max can't believe his 
	eyesthe quotes are absurd.

				MAX 
		What the...
	
	And then, Euclid crashes. The electricity in Max's room flips 
	off. The numbers on Max's screen fade to black. In near (minus 
	streetlights) darkness:

				MAX 
		Shit!
	
	TIGHT ON A FUSE BOX 
	Max removes a fuse. He replaces it with a penny.

	MAX'S ROOM

	Max tries to reboot Euclid, but nothing happens. He tries a 
	second time, but nothing happens.

	Devi and Farrouhk are still at it.

	Max puts on a pair of latex gloves. He dons a surgical mask. 
	He climbs up to a loft above his monitors. A glass case, fed 
	cool air by a vent tube, encases some computer parts. He 
	carefully removes the front glass cover.

	Then he gets it off he's stunned. Not only have the chips 
	melted down, but a strange flaky substance covers the board.

				MAX 
		What the...
	
	Max grabs his face, frustrated.
	Deri and Farroakk are giggling, having a great time. Max 
	stares at the wall.

	Then he angrily throws Euclid's mainframe onto the ground It 
	lands with a SMASH!

	Under the mainframe is a small city of ANTS. They scramble for 
	cover. Max furiously attacks them, stomping them out with his 
	bands.

	Then he jumps on the smashed mainframe. He slides to
	the ground and covers his face.

	DISSOLVE TO 
	EXT. PLAYGROUND - DAY 
	TIGHT ON a tree branch shaking manically in the wind.

	Max sits on a park bench watching the branch shake. It 
	terrifies him.

	He pulls out the printout of his picks and examines them.

				MAX (V.0.) 
		Wednesday, September third, 
		seven-fifteen. Results: AAR 
		at fourteen and a halflow, 
		very low. ABR at six and a 
		halfjeez. Six and a half, ABR 
		hasn't been beneath twenty in 
		ten years. Conclusion: 
		Simple. There is no pattern. 
		No pattern. Chaos, chaos, all 
		chaos.

	He crumples up his picks and tosses them into a public trash 
	can.

	INT. SOL'S STUDY - DAY

	Sol and Max play Go. Sol is peaceful while Max is distant.

	Max plays a piece absently. Sol counters with a deafening 
	atari. Max whispers:

				MAX 
		Euclid crashed. I lost 
		all my data, my hardware.

				SOL 
		Your mainframe?
	
				MAX 
		Burnt...
	
				SOL 
		What happened?
	
				MAX 
		I don't know, first I got 
		these horrible picks. Then 
		Euclid spits out some 
		numbers. Never saw anything 
		like it and then it fries. 
		The whole machine just 
		crashed.
	
				SOL 
		You have a printout?
	
				MAX 
		Of?
	
				SOL 
		The picks, the number?
	
				MAX 
		I threw it out.
	
				SOL 
		What was the number it 
		spit out?

				MAX 
		I don't know, just a long 
		string of digits.

				SOL 
		How many?
	
				MAX 
		I don't know.
	
				SOL 
			(Intense) 
		What was it, a 
		hundred and fifty, a 
		thousand, two hundred 
		sixteen!? How many?

				MAX 
		I don't know. Probably 
		around two hundred. 
			(Wondering) 
		Why?
	
				SOL 
			(Beat)...
		I dealt with 
		some bugs back in my Pi days. 
		I was wondering if it was 
		similar to one I ran into.

	Sol begins to feed his fish. He points to one.

				SOL 
		Have you met Archimedes. 
		The one with the black spot. 
		You see?
	
				MAX 
		Yeah.
	
				SOL 
		Remember Archimedes of 
		Syracuse? The King asks 
		Archimedes to determine if a 
		present he's received was 
		actually solid gold. Unsolved 
		problem at the time. It 
		tortures the great Greek 
		mathematician for weeks. 
		Insomnia haunts him and he 
		twists and turns on his bed 
		for nights on end. Finally, 
		his equally exhausted wife, 
		she's forced to share a bed 
		with this genius, convinces 
		him to take a bath, to relax. 
		While stepping into the tub 
		he observes the bathwater 
		rise as he enters. Displacement. 
		A way to determine volume. 
		And thus, a way to 
		determine density, weight 
		over volume. And thus, 
		Archimedes solves the 
		problem. He screams 
		"Eureka!"Greek for "I found 
		it!"and is so overwhelmed he 
		runs dripping naked through 
		the streets to the King's 
		castle to report his 
		discovery. Now, what's the 
		moral of the story.
	
				MAX 
		That a breakthrough will 
		come...

				SOL 
		Wrong. The point of the 
		story is the wife. Listen to 
		your wife, she will give you 
		perspective. Meaning, you 
		need a break, Max, you have 
		to take a bath, otherwise 
		you'll get nowhere. There will 
		be no order, only chaos. 
		Go home and take a bath.
	
	PUBLIC BENCH - MOMENTS LATER 
	Max waits for his train on an empty platform.

	Just then, he hears a DRIPPING sound. Max looks up and notices 
	something across the tracks on the other platform. He can't 
	quite make it out because his vision is blocked by columns.

	He gets up and spots a Young Hasidic Man standing at him.

	Blood drips from the Man's hand. Max doesn't know what to make 
	of it

	A TRAIN SWISHES BY -

	INT. MOVING TRAIN - LATER

	Max reads an ad that says In big block letters 'MOSHIAC IS 
	COMING!' He checks out a few of the other passengers. Then he 
	notices a man reading a newspaper across from him.

	The headline reads: 'MARKET TAKES NOSE-DIVE. Max jumps up and 
	approaches the man.

				MAX 
		Hey, excuse me, can I see 
		that?

	The man hands Max the paper. Max scans the article. Then He 
	quickly turns to the listings. His finger barrels down a 
	column. It stops at ABR.

				MAX 
		Six and a half.
	
	Max looks up the column for AAR.

			MAX 
		Fourteen and a half. Oh, 
		my...

	Max stumbles toward the doors. He looks out the window: into 
	the darkness of the tunnel.

				MAX 
			(Out of breath) 
		My God. My God. 
			(Gets pumped to himself) 
		Yes! Yes!
	
				SKINNY MAN (V.O.)
		Hey, paper, please!
	
	Max hands the paper back and looks at the man for the first 
	time. It is the Skinny Man he saw earlier.

	Max gets suspicious and moves into the next car.

	AT GRAND STREET
	Max exits. He notices that the Skinny Man gets off - one car 
	down - as well.

	He hustles toward the exit. As he's about to turn a corner he 
	looks back. The man seems to be following him.

	He dodges around a corner and heads up a staircase.

	EXT. TRAIN STATION - DAY 
	He seems to have lost him, when he notices a business-woman 
	with a pretty face heading right toward him. It is MARCY 
	DAWSON.

				MARCY DAWSON 
		Mr. Cohen! Perfect timing.
	
	Marcy sticks out her hand. Max, not knowing what else to do, 
	shakes it.

				MARCY DAWSON 
		I was just waiting for you. 
		I thought you stood me up, 
		so I was going to head home.
	
				MAX 
		Who are you?
	
				MARCY DAWSON
		Oh...Marcy Dawson. From 
		Lancet Percy. We were 
		supposed to meet at three.

				MAX 
		I'm sorry, I don't...
	
	Marcy hasn't let go of Max's hand.
	She guides him toward a large black street limo that's just 
	pulled up.

				MARCY DAWSON 
		I can't tell you what a 
		pleasure it is to finally 
		meet you. I've studied 
		your papers for years.
	
				MARCY DAWSON 
		I have something 
		you won't be able to say no 
		to. Why don't we take a spin 
		in the limo?

				MAX 
		No, no, no, really, I 
		can't.

				MARCY DAWSON 
		We're excited by your work. 
		We can't wait to discuss...

	Max attempts to pull away but Marcy is firm on leading him to 
	the car. Meanwhile, the Shinny man is heading right at them.

	The CHAUFFEUR reaches out to him. Max yanks his arm free and 
	runs away. He whips around a corner.

	INT. BODEGA - DAY 
	Max barrels into the grocery store and buys a Journal. He 
	heads to the back of the store and lays the paper across the 
	juice section. He checks the listing.

				MAX 
		On the nose. On the damn nose.
	
	Max turns the page on the Journal and sees the Lancet-Percy 
	ad. Then he notices one of the bodega owners staring at him.

	EXT. MAX'S APARTMENT - DAY

	Max scouts his front door. The coast is clear. 
	INT. MAX'S APARTMENT - DAY

	Max examines the smashed Euclid mainframe. He uncovers some of 
	the strange filo-like substance. He carefully touches it. Then 
	he grabs a small pinch of it.

	He examines it near a light bulb. He can't guess what it is. 
	He sniffs it. He carefully tastes it with the very tip of his 
	tongue. He still doesn't have a clue.

	Max opens his closet. He pulls out his dusty brass microscope. 
	He dusts it off. Next, he pulls out a slide Kit.

	Max places the instrument on the windowsill. He grabs an old 
	glass slide and puts some of the flaky stuff on it. He slides 
	it under the microscope. He looks into the lens, but doesn't 
	see anything.

	He gets up quickly and heads for the 
	HALLWAY

	where he looks at Devi's door, nervously. He gathers his 
	courage and knocks on her door. Through the door hears.

				DEVI (O.S.) 
		Farrouhk?
	
				MAX 
		Um, no, it's Max from next door.
	
	Devi opens the door wearing a sexy nightshirt.

				DEVI 
		Max, is everything all 
		right?

				MAX 
		Do you have any iodine?
	
				DEVI 
			(concerned, she reaches for Max's hands) 
		Iodine...did you cut 
		yourself?

				MAX 
			(Pulling his hands away) 
		No. I just need it to stain a 
		slide.

				DEVI 
		Ah, science, the pursuit 
		of knowledge. One second.

	She heads to her bathroom. Max waits impatiently.

				DEVI (O.S.) 
		Here we are. What are you 
		examining
			(At the door) 
		a potato!?

	She hands Max a bottle of iodine.

				MAX 
		Just something with my 
		computer.

	MAX'S ROOM - MOMENTS LATER 
	Max uses his pinky to drip a drop of iodine on the slide.

	Through the wall he hears Farrouhk arriving home.

				DEVI (0.S.) 
		The neighbor's up 
		to his old science...

				FARROUHK (O.S.) 
		What neighbor?
	
				DEVI (O.S.) 
		Next door.
	
	Max listens to the conversation for a few moments.

				FARROUHK (O.S.) 
		Why are you talking to that dork!
	
				DEVI (O.S.) 
		Shh! I just helped ...
	
				FARROUHK (O.S.) 
		Pounds on wall. Hey, dork, leave
		my girlfriend alone!

				DEVI (0.S.) 
		Farrouhk!
	
	Max shakes his bead. Then he finishes preparing the slide and 
	slips the glass under the turret.
	Max catches the low-hanging sun in the microscope's mirror and 
	reflects it through the sample and up the turret
	into his eye.

	MAX'S POV DOWN THE TURRET of some strange
	Substance.

	Max pulls out the slide and looks at it.

				FARROUHK (0.S.)
		I don't give a shit.
	
				DEVI (0.S.) 
			(Laughing) 
		Shh! C'mon, Farrouhk.
	
				FARROUHK (0.S.) 
		I'll kill the dork. 
			(Exploding again) 
		You hear me! I'll kill you. 
		I'll fucking kill you!

	Then an idea comes to him. He takes out his brain book. He 
	looks through it until he finds a picture of neurons. He 
	compares the image to the view through the turret. They look 
	different but there are similarities.

				DEVI (O.S) 
		Shh! Baby! Come here, baby!
	
	Max rushes out.

	EXT. PLAYGROUND - LATE AFTERNOON

	Max sifts through the trash can where he threw his picks from 
	yesterday. Frustrated, he dumps the trash onto the sidewalk 
	and starts looking through it Mrs. Ovadia watches him.

	Max sees her and is embarrassed for a moment.

				MAX 
		I just threw out something. 
		I didn't realize I needed it.

				MRS. OVADIA 
		Humph.
	
				MAX 
		Just a printout. I, uh, 
		lost my data...

	Max looks back at the trash And forgets about Mrs. Ovadia. 
	Soon, Max gets up and kicks the trashcan. He heads home.

	IN FRONT OF MAX'S APARTMENT BUILDING

	Max watches Marcy get out of the limo and call to Mrs. Ovadia.

	Max backs away when he smacks into someone.

	It's Lenny Meyer - the young Jewish man.

	Max jumps back in fear.

				LENNY MEYER 
		Max! How you doing? Lenny 
		Meyer. 
				MAX 
		Oh, hey... 
	
	Max tries to quickly pass him.

				LENNY MEYER 
		Hey, where you going? You 
		got a few moments to do Tefillin?

	Max turns around and notices Marcy talking to Mrs. Ovadia. 
	Mrs. Ovadia points up the street
	toward him.

				LENNY MEYER 
		I gotta car, we can cruise 
		over to my...

				MAX 
		You gotta car?
	
				LENNY MEYER 
		Yeah, right there. That's 
		Ephraim, my friend.

	We swing around with Max and see a station wagon.

	EPHRAIM sits in the passenger Seat. He's a big-boned, bearded, 
	Orthodox Jew.

				MAX 
		All tight, lets go.
	
				LENNY MEYER 
		Great...
	
	They head for the station wagon.

	INT. BASEMENT SHUL - NIGHT

	The synagogue is a claustrophobic, fluorescent-lit room in 
	general disarray. Two rows of imitation-wooden pews face a 
	makeshift altar and Ark. Young Hasidic Men study texts. Some 
	work alone, reading and dovening. Others are in small groups 
	sharing in heated discussions.

	Lenny wraps the Tefillin around Max's arm. Max just wants to 
	get out of there. Ephraim prays in the background.

				MAX 
		Lenny, I don't really 
		want to do...

				LENNY MEYER 
		Do it for me? It 
		means a lot, having someone 
		of your stature performing a 
		mitzvah in my presence. 
			(Beat) 
		When you told me your name was
		Max Cohen, I didn't realize you 
		were the Max Cohen. Maximilian Cohen.
	
				MAX
		You know me?
	
				LENNY MEYER 
		0f course, I've 
		followed your research since 
		your Columbia days. It's 
		revolutionary. You've inspired 
		the work we do.
	
				MAX 
		I have?
	
				LENNY MEYER 
		Yes, very much 
		so. The only difference is, 
		we're not looking at stocks. 
		We're searching for a pattern 
		in Torah.
	
	Lenny finishes wrapping Max's arm. He reaches for another box 
	and strap.

				MAX 
		What kind of pattern?
			
				LENNY MEYER 
		We're not really 
		sure. Our calculations have 
		shown us that there is a 
		number encoded in the text.

				MAX 
		What sort of number?
	
				LENNY MEYER 
		We don't know. 
		All we know is that it's two
		hundred and sixteen digits long.
	
	Max, stunned looks at Lenny.

				LENNY MEYER
		Don't worry. This one just 
		goes over your head.
		
	Lenny places the other Teffilin over Max's head. Max collects 
	himself.

				MAX 
			(Coolly) 
		Two sixteen?
	
				LENNY MEYER 
		Yes. Now we have to say a 
		small prayer, repeat 
		after me.
	
	Bewildered, Max does. After the prayer...

				LENNY MEYER 
		That's it. Wasn't 
		so bad, was it? You feel 
		anything?
	
	Lenny starts removing the Teffillin from Max.

				MAX 
		What is it?
	
				LENNY MEYER 
		It's a prayer about our 
		dedication to our one and 
		only God.
	
				MAX 
			(Attempting calmness) 
		No, I mean the number, the 
		two sixteen number? What is 
		it?
	
				LENNY MEYER 
		Oh. We don't know. We just 
		know that it's the most 
		common number encoded in 
		the text. It might be some 
		type of linguistic pattern. 
		If we could figure out what 
		the number is we could maybe 
		answer that.

				MAX 
		Tell me more.
	
	EXT. SOL'S APARTMENT - DAWN

	Max firmly rings SOL's bell.

	In a few moments, Sol answers the door in his pajamas.

				SOL 
		Max?
	
				MAX 
		What's going on, Sol!?
	
				SOL 
		Relax, it's early.
	
	INT. SOL'S KITCHEN - MOMENTS LATER 
	Max sits at the kitchen table while Sol heats up a pot of tea. 
	Max is shaking.

				SOL 
		Now, what's up?
	
				MAX 
		What's the two hundred 
		and sixteen number, Sol?

				SOL 
		Excuse me?
	
				MAX 
		You asked me if I had 
		seen a two hundred and 
		sixteen digit number, right?
	
				SOL 
		Oh, you mean the bug. I 
		found it working on Pi.

				MAX 
		What do you mean by "found it"?
	
				SOL 
		What's this all about, 
		Max?

				MAX 
		Well, there's these 
		religious Jews who have...

				SOL 
		Religious Jews?
	
				MAX 
		Well, you know, 
		Hassidim. I met one in the 
		coffee shop. The guy's a 
		number theorist. The Torah is 
		their data set. The thing is, 
		they're searching for a two 
		hundred and sixteen digit 
		number in the Torah.

				SOL 
		Really? What's it mean to 
		them?

				MAX 
		They say they don't 
		know, but that's crazy. I 
		mean what are the odds...
	
				SOL 
		It's just a coincidence.
	
				MAX 
		But hold on, there's 
		something else. You remember 
		those strange picks I got.
	
				SOL 
		Yesterday's stock picks?
	
				MAX 
		Right. Well, it turns out 
		that they were correct. I hit 
		two picks on the nose. Smack 
		on the nose.

				SOL 
			(Surprised) 
		Hmmm.
	
				MAX 
		Something's going on, and 
		it has to do with that 
		number. The answer is there.
	
				SOL 
		Max, it's a bug.
	
				MAX 
		No. it's a pattern. A 
		pattern is in that number

				SOL 
		Come with me.
	
	INT. SOL'S STUDY - MOMENTS LATER 
	Sol and Max sit on either side of a half-played Go board.

				SOL 
		Listen to me. The Ancient 
		Japanese considered the Go 
		board to be a microcosm of 
		the universe. Although when 
		it is empty it appears to be 
		simple and ordered, in fact, 
		the possibilities of game play 
		are endless. They say that no 
		two Go games have ever been 
		alike. Just like snowflakes. 
		So, the Go board actually 
		represents an extremely complex 
		and chaotic universe. That is 
		the truth of our world, Max. 
		It can't be easily summed up 
		with math. There is no simple 
		pattern.
	
				MAX 
		But as a Go game 
		progresses, the possibilities 
		become smaller and smaller. 
		The board does take on order. 
		Soon, all moves are 
		predictable.

				SOL
		So?
	
				MAX
		So, maybe, even though we're not 
		sophisticated enough to be aware 
		of it, there is an underlying 
		order...a pattern, beneath every 
		Go game. Maybe that pattern is 
		like the pattern in the market, 
		in the Torah. The two sixteen 
		number.

				SOL 
		That is insanity, Max.
	
				MAX 
		Or maybe it's genius. I 
		have to get that number.

				SOL 
		Hold on, you have to slow 
		down. You're losing it, you
		have to take a breath. Listen 
		to yourself. You're connecting 
		a computer bug I had, a 
		computer bug you might have 
		had, and some religious 
		hogwash. If you want to find 
		the number two sixteen in the 
		world, you'll be able to pull 
		it out of anywhere. Two 
		hundred and sixteen steps 
		from your street comer to 
		your front door. Two hundred 
		and sixteen seconds you spend 
		riding on the elevator. When 
		your mind becomes obsessed 
		with anything, it will filter 
		everything else out and find 
		examples of that thing 
		everywhere. Three hundred and 
		twenty, four hundred and 
		fifty, twenty-three. 
		Whatever! You've chosen two 
		sixteen and you'll find it 
		everywhere in nature. But 
		Max, as soon as you discard 
		scientific rigor, you are no 
		longer a mathematician. You 
		become a numerologist. What 
		you need to do is take a 
		break from your research. You 
		need it. You deserve it 
		Here's a hundred dollars, I 
		want you to take it. If ,you 
		won't take it, borrow it. 
		Either way, take a break.
		Spend it however you like as 
		long as it falls in the 
		category of vacation. Real 
		world stuff, okay. No math.

	Max looks at his bands.

				SOL 
		Just try it. In a week 
		you'll laugh about this. 
		C'mon, Max. Think about it!
	
	Max gives a half nod.

	EXT. SOL'S APARTMENT - MORNING

	Max rushes to the subway when a honking horn stops him. A limo 
	pulls up next to him. Marcy Dawson jumps out of the car

				MARCY DAWSON 
		Mr. Cohen? Mr. 
		Cohen? Please stop for a 
		second Mr. Cohen?
	
	Max stops and faces Marcy.

				MAX 
		Damn it already! Stop 
		following me. I'm not 
		interested in your money. I'm 
		searching for a way to 
		understand our world. I'm 
		searching for perfection. I 
		don't deal with mediocre 
		materialistic people like 
		you!
	
				MARCY DAWSON 
		I'm sorry. I'm very sorry. 
		I admit I've been a bit too 
		aggressive. But all I ask is 
		for five minutes of your time. 
		Here...
	
	Marcy hands Max a metal stopwatch.
	
				MARCY DAWSON
		...a stopwatch. 
		Already ticking. Allow me the 
		four and a half minutes left 
		Let me tell you what I want. 
		Let me tell you what I can 
		offer you. Afterwards, if you 
		don't want to talk to me, then 
		fine, we part as friends and 
		I promise that you will never 
		see me again. That's fair, 
		isn't it?
	
				MAX 
			(After a moment, he looks at the stopwatch) 
		Go.
	
				MARCY DAWSON 
		Good. It's funny, 
		even though we have different 
		aims and different goals 
		we're actually incredibly 
		alike. We both seek the same 
		thingperfection. I know...
		clearly we're seeking 
		different types of 
		perfection, but that is what 
		makes us perfect candidates 
		for a fruitful partnership. 
		If you let me, I can be your 
		greatest ally. Take the 
		acacia tree...in East 
		Africa. It is the most 
		prevalent plant in all of 
		Kenya because it has managed 
		to secure its niche by 
		defeating its major predator, 
		the giraffe. To accomplish 
		this, the tree has made a contract 
		with a highly specialized red ant. 
		The tree has evolved giant spores which 
		act as housing for the ants 
		In return for shelter, the 
		ants supply defense. When a 
		giraffe starts to eat the 
		tree's leaves, the shaking 
		branch acts like an alarm. The 
		ants charge out and secrete an 
		acid onto the giraffe's 
		tongue. The giraffe learns its 
		lesson and never returns. 
		Without each other, the tree 
		would be picked dry and the 
		ants would have no shade from 
		the brutal African sun Both 
		would die. But with each 
		other, they succeed, they survive, 
		they surpass. They have 
		different aims, different 
		goals but they work together.
		Max, we would like to establish 
		a mutually benefiting alliance 
		with you.
	
				MAX
			(handing back the stopwatch) 
		I'm not interested.
	
				MARCY DAWSON 
		Allow me to dose.
	
	The chauffeur pulls a black suitcase out of the limo and 
	brings it over.

				MARCY DAWSON 
		As a sign of good faith we 
		wish to offer you this.

				MAX 
		I told you I don't want money.
	
				MARCY DAWSON 
		The suitcase isn't filled with 
		fifties or gold or diamonds. Just 
		silicon. A Ming Mecca chip.
	
				MAX 
			(Yeah right!) 
		Ming Mecca. They're not declassified.
	
	Max starts to move away.

				MARCY DAWSON 
		You're right. They're not. But 
		Lancet-Percy has many friends. 
		Come here, take a look.
	
				MAX 
			(Stuttering) 
		What do...do...
	
	But then, Max notices that his thumb is twitching.

				MARCY DAWSON 
		Beautiful, isn't it? You know 
		how rare...are you okay?

				MAX 
		Yeah, I got to go.
	
				MARCY DAWSON 
		But what about...
	
				MAX 
		Let me think about it...
	
	Max trots off.

				MARCY DAWSON 
		What? Mr. Cohen!?
	
	INT. SUBWAY STATION - PUBLIC BENCH - NIGHT

	The station is strangely silent. It is also extremely rundown. 
	The tracks are rusted and fucked up. All we hear is the sound 
	of DRIPPING WATER. The sound is warped and grows and morphs 
	until it's downright scary.

	Max sits on a bench sucking down pills. His head begins to 
	hurt. He touches the right side of his scalp and nubs it.

	As the blood surges through his head it brings him waves of 
	pain. He gags several times. Then the pain lets loose and all 
	Max wants to do is die. He smashes the side of his head with 
	his fist.

	Across the tracks on the far platform he sees someone.

	For a moment Max's pain dissipates. His view is obscured by 
	the columns. Max gets up and sees the Young Hasidic Man - from 
	earlier - staring at him.
	The Man stares at Max without any emotion. Max notices blood 
	dropping from the Man's right hand.

	Max looks at the Man's face and sees for a split second his 
	own face staring back.

				MAX 
		Hey!
	
	Max charges up a flight of stairs. He crosses a passage over 
	the tracks and flies down the stairs to the other side of the 
	platform.

	The Man is gone. A pool of blood sits where the Man was. Max 
	touches it with his toe. It's sticky. He notices a trail of 
	blood leading off from the pool.
	He follows it around a corner where it leads into a corner.

	He notices something strange in the shadows. He carefully 
	advances on it. Hiding in the shadows is what looks like a 
	small piece of brain. It seems to be moving slightly.

	Max uses a pen in his jacket to carefully touch it.

	Suddenly, Max hears a train's HONK HONK behind him. Max spins 
	around. Nothing is there but silence.

	He turns back to the gray matter. He touches it again. Once 
	again, he hears the deafening HONK HONK. Max spins around, but 
	nothing is there.

	Frustrated, he pushes his pen deep into the brain - fiber 
	ripping apart.

	Suddenly, a TRAIN is barreling down on Max. Seconds from 
	impact, Max SCREAMS!!!

	DISSOLVE TO

	BLINDING WHITE VOID
	We hear two deep, long sleep-filled breaths and then we CUT 
	TO:

	INT. SUBWAY TRAIN - DAY

	Max's eyes pop open. A TRANSIT COP is sticking him with a 
	nightstick.

				TRANSIT COP 
		Up, buddy Coney Island, last stop.
	
	Max sits up. His nose is bleeding. The cop hands him a tissue.

				TRANSIT COP 
		Your nose.
	
	Max wipes his nose and looks around nervously.

	He sees the rides of Coney Island in the distance.

	EXT. CONEY ISLAND BEACH - DAY

	Max sits on a boulder on a Coney Island jetty. He watches the 
	sea.

	Then Max sees an old man dressed like KING NEPTUNE scanning 
	the shore with a rusty metal detector. The old man picks up 
	something. He admires it for a moment before gently setting it 
	back on the ground. Then Neptune continues his search.

	Max wanders over to the place where the old man exam

	INT. MAX'S APARTMENT - NIGHT 
	MAX'S POV through the microscope. Max sees the brain 
	structures.

	Just then, there's a KNOCK on the door. The knock startles him 
	and his hand bumps the turret of the microscope. The lens 
	moves and he realizes that the magnification can be changed.

	A KNOCK again.

	Max looks out the peephole and sees nothing. Confused,

	Looks down at his thumb. It's not shaking. He heads back to 
	his microscope.

	There's a knock again. Max angrily unlocks the door and whips 
	it open.

	IN THE HALLWAY is Jenna with her calculator.

				JENNA 
		Max, Max, can we do one.
	
				MAX 
		Jenna. I can't now, Jenna.
	
				JENNA 
		Please, Max.
	
				MAX 
		I'm working now, later okay?
	
	Max shuts the door and returns to the microscope. He changes 
	the magnification. At a weaker magnification, the 
	mathematician sees that the cells are grouped in spirals.

	Max is stunned, He grabs the phone and pulls a business card 
	out of his pocket He quickly dials a number.

	Someone answers with a "Shalom" on the other end of the line. 
	Max asks for Lenny Meyer and is put on hold.

				LENNY MEYER 
		Hello, this is Lenny?
	
				MAX 
		Lenny, it's Max Cohen.
	
				LENNY MEYER 
		Max! How are you? 
		You want to come down?
				MAX 
		I've been thinking about 
		our conversation earlier.

	Max looks into the microscope. He stares at the spirals.

				LENNY MEYER 
		That's good...
	
				MAX 
		I want to help.
	
				LENNY MEYER 
		Excellent.
	
				MAX 
		Do you have the Torah in 
		digital form?

	DISSOLVE FROM TURRET TO:

	SATELLITE IMAGE OF SPINNING TORNADO

	Start in tight on the epicenter and pull out to reveal the 
	entire storm.

				MAX (V.O.) 
		Thursday, September 
		fourth, sixteen forty-five. 
		The alchemist awakes. All of 
		my ideas, work and dreams are 
		spinning together It all has 
		to do with spirals. It began 
		with spirals and the answers 
		are thee.

	INT. MAX'S APARTMENT  DAY

	EUCLID'S INNARDS

	Max uses a drill to rip out some old parts. He lays new wire 
	and does a bunch of soldering.

	He rips down a bunch of old papers and does a general 
	housecleaning.

	He also goes to school on the ant population in his apartment. 
	He plants some ant motels and sprays the room with. a pest 
	killer.

				MAX (V.0.) 
		The most I can 
		remember about their 
		significance is from 
		Schneider's class. That 
		bullshit core for majors. 
		Schneider's fascination with 
		mystical geometry made him a 
		bit of a quack...but...then again, 
		look at Kepler. He was really into 
		Pythagoras. The leader of an 
		ancient sect which believed 
		the entire universe could be 
		represented by numbers. 
		Pythagoras' greatest contribution 
		was the golden ratio, which ended up 
		influencing art and science 
		for thousands of years, 
		arguably all the way up to 
		today.
	
	TIGHT ON MAX writing a : b : : b : a + b.

	He draws it over a copy of Leonardo Da Vinci's famous
	drawing of man s anatomy.

				MAX (V.0.) 
		The golden ratio, 
		if I recall, is this unique 
		relationship between the length 
		and width of a special 
		rectangle called the golden 
		rectangle.
	
	TIGHT ON MAX carefully measuring out a golden rectangle.

	The rectangle fits perfectly over Leonardo Da Vinci's Man.

				MAX (V.O.) 
		If you take the 
		width of this rectangle and 
		use it to form a square within 
		the rectangle, the part left 
		over is a rectangle that has 
		the same ratio as the 
		original rectangle. au can 
		continue squaring the 
		rectangle, over and over 
		again, making the 
		rectangles smaller and smaller 
		to infinity.

	TIGHT ON MAX squaring rectangle after rectangle. Then he draws 
	the golden spiral through the rectangles.

				MAX (V.0.) 
		Then, if you 
		connect a curve through these 
		rectangles you get the golden 
		spiral. The Pythagoreans 
		loved this shape because 
		they found it everywhere 
		in nature.
	
	MONTAGE OF IMAGES

	The images mirror what Max talks about. We see NAUTILUS 
	SHELLS, SUNFLOWERS, PLANTS, RAM HORNS, HUMAN FINGERPRINTS, THE 
	MILKY WAY, and DNA STRANDS.

				MAX (V.0.) 
		It really is amazing. In the sea, 
		on land, in air, our basic building 
		block DNA and even our home.
	
	EXT. CHINATOWN - DAY

	Max wanders through the crowded streets of Chinatown.

				MAX (V.O.) 
		If we're built from 
		spirals, while living within 
		a giant spiral, is it 
		possible that all of human 
		behavior, if it could be 
		quantified, is in the form of 
		a spiral. Then, maybe,
		extensions of our behavior 
		like the stock market. maybe 
		even the writing of The 
		Torah, is infused with the 
		spiral pattern.

	DISSOLVE TO
	PAN ACROSS NEW EUCLID

	We start on the stock ticker and pull out to reveal a leaner, 
	meaner and more exciting machine.

				MAX (V.O.) 
		Friday, September 
		fifth. Seven twelve. It's 
		fair to say, I'm stepping out onto a 
		limb. But I'm on the edge and 
		that's where it happens.
	
	He holds two wires apart from each other as he contemplates 
	what will connect them.

	EXT. ELECTRONIC MEGADUMP - DAY

	Max wanders helplessly through the dump. There's nothing but 
	junk and more junk.

	EXT. PUBLIC PAY PHONE - DAY 
	Max eyes Marcy Dawson's business card, suspiciously He dials 
	the number. A man answers on the other line.

				MAN'S VOICE (OS.) 
		Three, eight, two.
	
				MAX 
		Marcy Dawson.
	
				MAN'S VOICE (O.S.) 
		Who's calling?
	
				MAX 
		Max Cohen.
	
				MAN'S VOICE (O.S.) 
		Hold on.
	
	Max is put on hold. He notices a man in a business suit 
	watching him. Max turns away.

				MARCY DAWSON 
		Mr. Cohen? I'm so 
		Happy...

				MAX 
		Look what do you want for the chip?
	
				MARCY DAWSON 
		You tech guys. I think you 
		know what we want.

				MAX 
		No, I don't.
	
				MARCY DAWSON 
		C'mon, Mr. Cohen. We can work 
		together We can both profit 
		from this information. We both 
		need each other to get it, so why 
		not work with us?
	
				MAX 
		I don't know if I'll find 
		anything useful.

				MARCY DAWSON 
		We're willing to take the risk.
	
				MAX 
		Okay. First, I want you 
		to call off the surveillance. 
				MARCY DAWSON 
			(Beat) 
		Done. Anything else?
	
				MAX 
		Yeah, I'm a very private 
		person. Knock on my door and 
		leave the suitcase outside. 
		I don't want to talk to Anyone.

				MARCY DAWSON 
		How do I know you're home? 
	
				MAX 
		I'll knock back.
	
				MARCY DAWSON 
		Fair enough.
	
	INT. COFFEE SHOP - DAY

	Max sits at the counter. The POST headline in front of him 
	reads MARKET DOOMED. PRESIDENT IN PANIC, WORLD LEADERS MEET.

	Max flips to the stock quotes. He can't believe how far things 
	have dovetailed. He shakes his head in disbelief when an 
	envelope appears in front of him. It belongs to Lenny Meyer.

				LENNY MEYER 
		The Torah.
	
				MAX 
		What is it?
	
				LENNY MEYER 
		In Hebrew characters and numbers.

				MAX 
		No, what is it? The two 
		hundred and sixteen digits.

				LENNY MEYER
		I don't know. 
			(Beat) 
		If you get it, maybe 
		we can figure it out. 
			(Changing subject) 
		Can you really find it?
	
				MAX 
		If the number's in there, 
		I'll find it.

	EXT. MAX'S APARTMENT - DUSK

	Max marches into his foyer when he's suddenly ambushed by 
	Devi's boyfriend, Farrouhk. Farrouhk is a little guy with a 
	big sadistic smile.

	He grabs Max by the collar and slams him against the wall. His 
	fist butts up against Max's chin.

			FARROUHK 
		There you go, dork. 
		Been thinking about my 
		girlfriend. Haven't you?
	
				MAX 
		Wha...
	
				FARROUHK
		You want to fuck her, don't you?
	
				MAX 
		No, no..
	
				FARROUHK
		You calling my girlfriend 
		ugly!? Why don't you want 
		to fuck her? You think she's 
		ugly?
	
				MAX 
		No, no, I just. It's that 
		she's your girl...

				FARROUHK 
		So you do want to 
		fuck her. You think about 
		fucking her in the mouth, 
		don't you?

				MAX 
		No, no, sir, please. I've 
		never touched Devi...I 
		never will.
	
				FARROUHK 
		Give the fucking 
		genius a Mars bar. Stay away, 
		or I'll slice off your balls.
	
	Farrouhk tosses Max against the wall. Max whimpers off to his 
	apartment. Farrouhk has enjoyed this and to end his game be 
	gives Max a small slap on the butt.

	INSIDE HIS APARTMENT Max bolts the front door.

	At his desk he rips open the envelope Lenny Meyer gave him. He 
	pulls out a BLACK DISK and eyes it expectantly.

	Next door, he hears Farrouhk and Devi talking.

				FARROUHK (O.S.) 
		Damn dork.
	
				DEVI (O.S.) 
		He's just a bit unique.
	
				FARROUHK(0.S.) 
		Unique?! Unique?! He's a dork!
	
	Then, Max carefully slips the DISK into Euclid's drive. Hebrew 
	characters pop onto Euclid's screen. Max pounds in several 
	strings of code lightning fast.

	The Hebrew letters suddenly switch to their numerical 
	counterparts. Max toggles between Hebrew and numbers a few 
	timesimpressed.

	Max nods. Then there's a knock at the door.

				MAX 
			(To himself) 
		Okay.
	
	Max peeks through the peephole. Two well-dressed large men, 
	BRAD and ABE THE BABE, wait for the signal. MAX knocks and the 
	suits leave.

	Then Max shyly opens up his front door and quickly grabs the 
	black attaché case in front of his door

	Donning a surgical mask and latex gloves, Max opens the black 
	attaché case. Sitting in foam is a tiny but beautiful chip. 
	Max studies it with awe.

				MAX (V.O.) 
		Friday, September 
		fifth? Lots of work to be 
		done. But I'm close, so 
		close. Today is the day Might 
		have cost me my soul, but 
		down the line I'll work it 
		out. Just keep them in the 
		dark, let them beg. A damn 
		Ming Mecca chip. It's like 
		giving a desperate junkie a 
		syringe filled with junk. 
		Defense uses them to nun 
		nuclear sub reactors. Me? I'm 
		going to dissect the market.

	Max carefully carries the chip over to the new leaner Euclid. 
	He welds it into Euclid's waiting wires.

				MAX 
		Happy birthday, Euclid.
	
	Then he lifts his hand to slap the RETURN button, but a sudden 
	wave of fear stops him.

	He gets up and grabs a Ginseng soda from the fridge He drops 
	eight pills in the can. He calmly takes a sip from the soda 
	and places it on the counter.

	Max can hear Devi and Farrouhk starting to make love. Their 
	gentle sounds
	drift through the wall.

				MAX (V.O.) 
		Eighteen thirty. Press return...
		Max darts over and smacks 
		the RETURN. Moments later we 
		see what Max sees

	ON THE SCREEN is a long string of zeros.

	At the bottom of the screen Euclid's cursor blinks, waiting 
	for instructions.

	He smacks RETURN again Max gets the same empty result.

	Euclid's cursor blinks, waiting. Max starts to laugh. He 
	laughs and laughs and laughs.

				MAX 
		Oh God. Damn religious 
		freaks. 
			(Sarcastic) 
		The holy Torah...
	
	But then he notices his thumb twitching. He rubs his scar. 
				MAX 
		Ah God...
	
	His neighbor's love sounds start to get rough. They're having 
	fun.

	Max almost throws up.

	THE BATHROOM

	Max dry heaves in the sink. Then he forces himself to stand in 
	front of the mirror.

				MAX 
		Too much...too soon.
	
	He grabs the gun and tries to roll up his sleeve. He can't get 
	it to roll up. Suddenly he's overwhelmed by pain. He quickly 
	rips his shirt and fires the gun into his arm.

	Nothing happens. He checks the barrelits empty

				MAX 
		Ohh...
	
	He grabs a bottle of medicine but knocks them an into the 
	sink.

	He cuts his finger as be grabs one of the broken bottles. He 
	loads the gun and fires the medicine into his arm. A wave of 
	pain and nausea floods in. He grabs another bottle and fires 
	it into his arm. Then he fires another and another.

	Frustrated he collapses into the mirror.

				MAX 
		Stop, please, stop.
	
	Slightly sobbing he examines his scalp pulling his hair apart. 
	He sees something.

				MAX 
		What the?
	
	So he takes out a scissors and starts removing some hair.

	Meanwhile his neighbors' lovemaking gets more intense. Their 
	screams carry into Max's head.

	Max finishes removing a patch of hair from the right side
	of his head. He has uncovered a light scar on his head. He 
	examines it in the mirror.

				MAX 
		What is it!? What is it!?
	
	Then his neighbors' lovemaking turns outright evil. It
	sounds like Sodom and Gomorrah next door and Max
	can barely stand it.
	A jolt of pain surges into his head. He grabs his scar as he 
	vomits blood into the sink.
	He starts banging his head against the mirror. He bangs
	his head again and again until the mirror CRACKS!

	His neighbors are cumming and their cries of joy are twisted 
	and agonizing.

	The mathematician looks at himself and begins to sob. He 
	reloads the gun and fires it right into the scar on his head, 
	where the pain is coming from.

	Max collapses to the ground in complete agony until the bare 
	bulb in the bathroom starts blinking on and off.

	Suddenly the pain is gone.

	Then he hears something. It's Euclid, buzzing with life. He 
	gets to his feet and head's into Euclid.

	The main monitor is screaming with numbers. The lights in the 
	room flicker on and off like on a disco dance floor. A
	filo substance billows out of Euclid.

	And then a number pops onto the screen. Max estimates how many 
	digits are on the screen. 
				MAX
		Two...two hundred. That's it! That's it!
	
	Max grabs a piece of paper and a pencil. He starts writing 
	down the number. He mumbles each digit as he sees it.

	But then be stops writing. Power surge! He stares at the 
	number. Something clicks in his head. His eyes go wide. He 
	barely musters a

				MAX 
		Oh...
	
	We move closer and closer into the number, deeper and deeper 
	into the screen. Until finally a single pixel fills the screen 
	and we're in the

	BLINDING WHITE VOID where we hear several deep peaceful 
	breaths. 
	Then, a fuse blows and we cut to:

	BLACK
	A phone ringing...once...
	twice...then we hear

				MRS. OVADIA(O.S.) 
		He's alive. His eyes are moving. 
	
				DEVI (0.S.) 
		Yes, hello?
	
	FADE BACK INTO THE MAIN ROOM Max's eyes slowly open.


				DEVI (0.S) 
			(On the phone)
		He's busy right now I'm sorry.
		Max is sprawled out in front 
		of Euclid. A large amount of 
		blood, from his nose, is 
		semi-dried on his chin and 
		chest. Devi hangs up the phone.

	The landlady, Mrs. Ovadia, and Farrouhk, brandishing a 
	crowbar, stand over him.

				MAX 
		What happened?
	
				DEVI 
		You were screaming...
	
				MRS. OVADIA 
		Who told you you can put extra 
		locks on the door.

				FARROUHK 
			(To Mrs. OVADIA)
		Shhh!
	
				MAX 
			(Suddenly jolting up and remembering) 
		The number, the number.
	
	Max looks at Euclid. The screen is blank. He looks at the 
	mainframe. It is covered with the filo substance. Then be 
	looks at the piece of paper he wrote the number on. Only a few 
	dozen numbers are on the page. The last number be wrote is 
	barely a scribble.

				MRS. OVADIA 
		You're out, you hear me, you're out. 
		I've had enough of you. Look at all 
		this junk.
	
	He starts reciting the numbers. Then Max suddenly realizes 
	something. He continues reciting the numbers from memory.

				MAX 
		Four...zero...
		seven...It's in my head, 
		it's in my head. Somehow I 
		memorized it. I got it up 
		here!
	
	He points to his head.

				MAX 
		But what is it?
	
	Mrs. Ovadia starts looking at all the junk in the room.

				DEVI 
		Are you okay?
	
				MRS. OVADIA 
		What is this stuff? What does it do?
	
	Max finally realizes that all these strangers are in his womb. 
	He flips.

				MAX 
		0ut, out, you have to get 
		out. Get out, get out it's my 
		room!
	
				FARROUHK 
			(To Devi) 
		Let's go. 
	
	The phone starts ringing again.

				MRS. OVADIA 
		That's it, no way. You're 
		the one out of here, mister.

				MAX 
		Out! 0utt
	
	The three neighbors retreat to the front door.

				DEVI 
		Are you okay?
	
				MAX 
		Out! Get out!
	
	Max slams the door in their faces.
	Max rubs his chin and looks around the room. He starts
	saying the number to himself He gets more and more
	excited as he reads each digit.

	INT. COFFEE SHOP - NIGHT

	Max stirs cream into his coffee. Then he pulls out the
	Journal.

	A phone continues to RING.

	In the clouds of the Lancet-Percy ad - in The Journal Max 
	writes down the two hundred and sixteen digit number. He 
	studies it, examines it, draws on it, tries to figure out what 
	it is.

				MAX (V.O.)
		Saturday? Dark outside. There 
		was a moment there...when, I don't 
		know...when I didn't exist. What? What?

	We hear a phone being picked up. The ringing stops. Silence, 
	then:

				MARCY DAWSON (O.S.) 
		Max, is that you? Max? 
			(Pleading) 
		Max, just talk to me. Things 
		are a bit out of hand down 
		here. People are getting 
		desperate. 
			(Suddenly firm) 
		We had a deal, Max. A deal. 
		Talk to us, Max.

	We hear the sound of a phone hanging up.

	At the coffee counter, Max pops a handful of pills and 
	crumples the paper.

	INT. MAX'S BATHROOM - LATER

	Max stares at his BALD head in the mirror. All of his hair has 
	been removed. A fleshy scar sits on his scalp above his right 
	ear.

	Max ignores the incessantly RINGING phone.

	Max flips through an old neuroscience book. He examines a few 
	illustrations and finds the part of his brain that's killing 
	him.

				MAX (V.0.) 
		Must be an explanation, must be a 
		reason. Must.

	With a thick black marker, he carefully outlines the part of 
	his head that is causing the pain.

	INT. MAX'S APARTMENT-LATER

	Max sits in his chair staring at the stock market monitor. The 
	phone continues to RING.

	Numbers drift by.

	A single beam of sunlight leaks through the window and shines 
	on the edge of the screen. Walking along the edge in the 
	sunlight is a tiny ant.

				MAX 
		Bastard.

	Max gets up to squash it. But as he gets closer he suddenly 
	feels mercy. He looks at the ant in awe.

	And then, his attention switches to the ticker.

				MAX 
		Two and a quarter, twelve 
		and an eighth, six and two 
		eighths.
	
	Max states the numbers right before they enter onto the 
	screen.

				MAX 
		I know these...Seven 
		and a quarter. Two and a half 
		...oh...oh...
	
	Max strains to figure out what is going an. Suddenly, he's 
	overwhelmed with fear.

				MAX 
		My God. It's gonna 
		crash, it's gonna fucking 
		crash.
	
	INT. SOL'S APARTMENT - DUSK

	Max charges into the room. Sot is looking at his Go board. Sol 
	looks up when Max comes in.

				SOL 
		You're early. I was just 
		studying our...
			(Noticing ,Max's head) 
		What did you do to yourself?
	
				MAX 
		You lied to me.
	
				SOL 
		I thought you were going 
		to take a break.

				MAX 
		You found the two sixteen 
		number in Pi, didn't you? You 
		saw it.
	
	Sol doesn't respond.

				MAX 
		I saw it, Sol. I don't 
		know what happened, but I 
		know things. The market is 
		going to crash. It's going to 
		crash. It hasn't yet, but I 
		know it will. I saw it, Sol. 
		What is it, Sol? What's the 
		number?

	Sol sighs. He looks down at the board and collects himself.

				SOL 
		You have it?
	
				MAX 
		It's in my head!
	
				SOL 
			(Leveling with Max) 
		Okay, sit down.

	Max does.

				SOL 
		I gave up before I 
		pinpointed it. But my guess 
		is that certain problems 
		cause computers to get stuck 
		in a particular loop. The loop 
		leads to meltdown, but 
		right before they crash they...
		they become "aware" of 
		their own structure. The 
		computer has a sense of its 
		own silicon nature and it 
		prints out its ingredients.
	
				MAX 
		The computer becomes conscious?
	
				SOL 
		In some ways...I guess...
	
				MAX 
			(To himself) 
		Studying the pattern made Euclid 
		conscious of itself. Before it died it 
		spit out the number That consciousness 
		is the number.

				SOL 
		No, Max, it's only a 
		nasty bug.

				SOL 
		A door in front of a cliff. 
		You're driving yourself over 
		the edge. You need to stop.
	
				MAX 
		Stop? How can I stop? I'm 
		this close.

		The bug doesn't only 
		destroy computers.
			
				MAX 
		What are you saying?
	
				SOL 
		Look what it did to your 
		computer. Look what it's doing 
		to you.
	
	Max doesn't respond.
				SOL 
		It's killing you. Leave it 
		unknown.

				MAX 
			(Clarity) 
		You were afraid of 
		it. That's why you quit.

				SOL 
		Max, I got burnt.
	
				MAX 
		C'mon, Sol.
	
				SOL 
		It caused my stroke.
	
				MAX 
		That's bullshit. It's 
		math, numbers, ideas. 
		Mathematicians are suppose to 
		be out on the edge. You 
		taught me that!
	
				SOL 
		Max, there's more than 
		math! There's a whole world...

				MAX 
		That's where discoveries 
		happen. We have to go out 
		there alone, all alone, no 
		one can accompany us. We have 
		to search the edge. We have 
		to risk it all. But you ran 
		from it. You're a coward.
	
				SOL 
		Max, it's death!
	
	Max stands up and screams down at Sol.

				MAX 
		You can't tell me what it 
		is. You don't know You've 
		retreated to your goldfish, 
		to your books, to your Go, 
		but you're not satisfied.
	
	Sol grabs his cane and whacks the Go board.

				SOL 
		Get out! Max, get out!
	
				MAX 
		I want to understand it. 
		I want to know!

	Sol swings his cane as Max heads for the door.

				SOL 
		Out!
	
	INT. SUBWAY - PORT AUTHORITY - NIGHT 
	Max paces on a downtown train as it pulls into 42nd Street.

	Through the open doors, Max notices a YOUNG PHOTOGRAPHER in 
	jeans and a leather jacket photographing him from the uptown 
	platform.

	Max is enraged and screams at him. The man ducks behind a 
	column, but a few moments later he's back snapping pictures.

	The doors start to shut, but Max uses his body to get
	off the train.

	The Photographer sees him coming and flees.

	Max follows the man's movement on his platform. When the young 
	man shoots up the exit stairs, Max does so as well.

	Max catches a glimpse of his foe entering the catacombs 
	heading toward Times Square. Max pursues.

	Max chases him down a looooong passage.

	But he loses him at an underground five-way fork in the road. 
	One staircase is Uptown and Queens...
	another is Brooklyn...one other is unlabeled.

	Still enraged, Max marches forward Just then, he catches a 
	glimpse of the Photographer exiting the station.

	SMASH TO

	EXT. TIMES SQUARE - NEON NIGHT

	In the heart of New York, Max spins around searching for his 
	foe.
	His frustration mounts until out of the comer of his eye he 
	sees a strange reflection. Not knowing what it's of, he turns 
	around to see the source The reflection is from a giant, 
	brilliant stock ticker - 50 yards long and luminous.

	Max stares at the quotes They are hypnotizing and Max is 
	suddenly calm.

	Then, Max has a premonition. He turns and spots the 
	Photographer in front of a porn shop on Eighth and 42nd.

	EXT. PORN SHOP - 42ND STREET - NIGHT

	Max whacks the Photographer against a back-lit image of a 
	Hustler Centerfold. The man screams.

				MAX 
		Who are you working for?
	
				PHOTOGRAPHER 
		Here, here.
	
	The photographer hands Max his wallet.

				MAX
		I don't want your wallet. Who sent you?
	
	Max grabs the kid's camera.

				MAX
		Who the hell sent you!?
	
				PHOTOGRAPHER 
		Wha...I'm sorry...
	
				MAX 
		Who are you?!
	
				PHOTOGRAPHER 
		I'm...a...student I've got 
		an assignment for class.
	
	The Photographer pulls out his student ID. Max looks at it. 
	Then he rips out the film-exposing it.

				MAX 
		Leave me alone, damn it. 
		Leave me alone.

	Max hands the man back his camera and leaves.

	EXT. MAX'S APARTMENT - NIGHT 
	Max heads home in a furious state. Suddenly, he sees two of 
	Marcy's men blocking his path. It's Brad and Jake, yet another 
	tough guy, and they don't look happy. Max spins around and 
	sees Marcy Dawson blocking his exit.

				MAX 
		Marcy? What's up?
	
	Max retreats.

				MARCY DAWSON 
		Let's take a ride, Max.
	
				MAX 
		I can't, I got work...
	
	Max looks back at the tough guys who are almost on top of him.

				MARCY DAWSON 
		We had a deal! NOW get in the limo!
	
	Marcy releases a vicious slap that nearly knocks Max down. Max 
	whimpers.

				MAX 
		Don't ever hit...
	
	He pushes Marcy aside and darts.

	EXT. CITY STREETS - NIGHT 
	Max flees. Jake and Brad charge after him. They're right on 
	him - he has a meter or so on them.
	He scurries through a construction site and over a footbridge.

	Then, he runs into an all-night 
	BODEGA

	The tough guys chase after him and he gets a bit of a
	lead in the narrow aisles. He pleads with the owners for
	help - nothing doing.

	Jake heads him off and uses his body to block the aisle. But 
	Max grabs a can of beans and slams it down on the tough guy's 
	nose. The guy goes down and Max shoots out the exit.

	EXT. UNDERNEATH CAR - NIGHT 
	Max dives under a car and crawls for terror. He sees two sets 
	of feet nun by. Max starts to relax when he notices a pair of 
	heels on the other side of the car. Marcy bends down and looks 
	at him.

				MARCY DAWSON 
		Enough, Max, c'mon out.
	
				MAX 
		Leave me alone. I don't 
		know anything.

	Max retreats in the opposite direction. Suddenly Jake and Brad 
	grab him and drag him out.

				MAX 
		Hey! Hey! Hey!
	
	They search him, taking his wallet, keys, everything.

	Marcy looks at the guys, who shake their heads. She walks over 
	to Max and shows Max the front page of the Wall Street 
	Journal. It reads, "MARKET CRACHES"

				MARCY DAWSON 
		You're responsible for this.
	
				MAX 
		I didn't do anything. I 
		didn't play the market.

				MARCY DAWSON 
		But we did.
	
	Marcy pulls out a folded, worn piece of paper. She opens it. 
	It's Max's stock pick that he threw out. Part of THE number is 
	on the page

				MARCY DAWSON 
		You have to be careful 
		where you throw out your trash.

				MAX 
		How could you do that?
	
				MARCY DAWSON 
		You gave us faulty information. 
		You gave us the carrot, the right 
		picks, but then you only gave us 
		part of the code.

				MAX 
		You selfish, irresponsible 
		cretins. How could you be so 
		stupid!?

	Marcy jabs Max in his stomach. Max falls to the ground. The 
	tough guys sit on him.

				MARCY DAWSON 
		C'mon, Max. This isn't a 
		game anymore. We're playing 
		on a global scale. We used 
		your code. Foolish...I admit. 
		But we can fix things if we 
		make some careful picks. Give 
		us the rest of the code so 
		we can set things right.

				MAX
		C'mon! I know who you are. 
		You're not gonna save the world.

				MARCY DAWSON 
		Look, Max...
	
	Marcy nods to Jake, who pulls out a gun and points it at Max's 
	head.

				MAX 
		My God, what are you doing?
	
				MARCY DAWSON 
		Information is 
		the private language
		of Capital. We tried to 
		establish a symbiotic 
		relationship but if
		you choose to compete and 
		enter our niche we are forced 
		to comply with the laws of 
		nature.
	
	Max thinks for a second. Max thinks hard. He realizes be
	can't give them the number.

				MAX 
		You can't kill me!
	
				MARCY DAWSON 
		C'mon, Max. You 
		don't get it. I don't
		give a shit about you. I only 
		care about what's in your 
		fucking head. If you won't help 
		us help yourself, then I'll 
		have only one choice. Destroy the 
		competition. I'll take you 
		out of the game. Survival of the 
		fittest, Max. And we've got 
		the gun.
	
	Jake cocks the gun. Max starts to cry.

				MAX 
		You bastards! You stupid 
		bastards!

	Suddenly, Jake is whacked with a sawed-off baseball bat.
	He smashes into the sidewalk.
	It is Farrouhk, Max's neighbor, who's just pulled up in his 
	taxicab.

				MAX 
			(Spotting his savior) 
		Farrouhk!
	
	Farroukh threatens Marcy and the other tough guy, who
	retreat in fear. Farroubk is afraid as well, so he doesn't
	quite leap on them. He just keeps swinging the bat.

				FARROUHK 
		He's sick! He's sick!
	
	Max gets to his feet and runs behind Farrouhk. 
	Just then a station wagon screeches up to the curb. Lenny 
	Meyer, Ephraim, and a bunch of other his burly Jews jump out.

				LENNY MEYER 
		Max!
	
	Max looks at Farrouhk and then he looks at Lenny. Ephraim
	grabs Max and pulls him toward the station wagon.

				MAX 
			(To Farrouhk) 
		C'mon...
	
	Farrouhk heads for his cab. Ephraim helps Max into the
	backseat of the wagon and climbs in after him.

	Lenny Meyer jumps into the passenger seat and the gray-bearded 
	YISRAEL slams on the gas Pedal.

	Farrouhk jumps into his cab.

	INT. LENNY MEYER'S CAR - MOVING - NIGHT 
	Yisrael yanks the steering wheel to the left, the old station 
	wagon skids around a corner.

				MAX 
		Farrouhk what about Farrouhk!?
	
				LENNY MEYER 
		Stay down!
	
	Ephraim pushes Max's head down. Yisrael takes another
	corner sharp.

				MAX 
		Go back!
	
				LENNY MEYER 
		He's okay, he got 
		in his cab. We've been
		looking for you.
	
				MAX 
		What's going on?
	
				LENNY MEYER 
		Do you have the number?
	
				MAX 
		What's going on?
	
				LENNY MEYER 
		Do you have the number?
	
				MAX 
		Yeah, I have it!
	
				LENNY MEYER 
		You have it. Where is it? 
		You have it written down?

				MAX 
		What is it?
	
	Lenny nods to Ephraim, who starts scanning through
	Max's pockets. Max resists. The other guys hold him down.

				MAX 
		What are you doing!? What 
		the hell are you doing!?

				LENNY MEYER 
		We're not joking 
		around, Max? Where's
		the number?
	
				MAX 
			(Pushing Ephraim away) 
		It's not on me. It's in my
		head.

				LENNY MEYER 
		You memorized it? 
		Did you give it to them?

				MAX 
		Who?
	
				LENNY MEYER 
		Who!? Those 
		Wall Street bastards.

				MAX 
		Why do you care?
	
				LENNY MEYER
		Just answer me!
	
				MAX 
		Screw you!
	
				LENNY MEYER 
			(In Hebrew) 
		Hit him!
	
	Yisrael screeches the car to a halt. He spins around in his 
	seat and looks Max in the face.

				LENNY MEYER 
		You're dealing with something 
		really big now, Max. I don't 
		want to hurt you, so answer 
		me. Did you give it to them?

				MAX 
		They've got part of it 
		Now get off me!

				LENNY MEYER 
		Damn it! Damn it! 
		They're using it.

				MAX 
		Using what?
	
				LENNY MEYER 
		Shut up!
	
				MAX 
		Let go!
	
	Max chews into Ephraim's hand which is pinning him. Ephraim 
	screams and lets loose a punch to Max's jaw.

				LENNY MEYER 
		No, don't!
	
	But Lenny is late, and Max's world - as well as ours goes 
	black.

	INT. MAX'S APARTMENT - NIGHT 
	Max stares suspiciously at the bathroom. He slowly picks up 
	his drill. Wielding it like a hammer, he carefully advances 
	into the 
	BATHROOM where he looks into the sink. He almost vomits when 
	he sees a piece of human brain sitting above the drain. Ants 
	swarm across its surface.

	Max becomes furious. He whacks it with the drill. Blood flies 
	up into his face. In a wild rage, he smashes it and punches 
	it.

	Then he drops the drill and uses his bare hands to shove it 
	down the drain. Screaming like a madman, he jams it until it 
	is gone.

	INT. BASEMENT SHUL - DAY

	A wise-looking, bearded Hasidic man with benevolent, piercing 
	eyes stands tenderly over Max. He wears traditional black 
	clothes. Lenny Meyer paces nervously in the background.

	As Max comes through, RAV COHEN speaks.

				RAV COHEN 
		Max, Max. You're 
		okay I'm Rabbi Cohen. Cohen 
		like you. I'm sorry for what 
		Lenny did, he's been 
		reprimanded. It is not our way 
		Are you okay?

				MAX 
		Yeah, yeah
	
				RAV COHEN 
		Everything will be 
		fine, Max. You need to give 
		us the number. Do you have 
		it?

				MAX 
		What is it?
	
				LENNY MEYER 
			(Charging over) 
		I told you we don't know
	
				MAX 
		You wouldn't be so 
		flipped out if you didn't 
		know. What's happening to me?
	
				LENNY MEYER 
		Give us the number!
	
				MAX 
		Screw you!
	
				RAV COHEN 
		Okay, okay! Lenny, 
		easy! Max, I'll tell you 
		what's going on. Just calm 
		down. 
			(Deep breath, then) 
		The Talmud tells us it began two 
		thousand years ago, when the 
		Romans destroyed the second 
		temple.

				MAX 
		What are you...
	
				RAV COHEN 
		Just give me a chance. 
		You'll understand everything 
		if you listen.
	
	Max takes out his pills and starts feeding himself some.

				RAV COHEN 
		The Romans also 
		murdered all of our priest-
		hoodthe Cohanimthe Cohens, 
		and with their deaths they 
		destroyed our greatest 
		secret. In the center of the 
		great temple was the holy of 
		holies which was the heart of 
		Jewish life. This was the 
		earthly residence for our 
		God. The one God. It 
		contained the ark of the 
		Tabernacle which stored the 
		original Ten Commandments 
		that God gave to Moses. Only 
		one man could enter this 
		space once a year on the 
		holiest day of the year, Yom 
		Kippur On the Day of 
		Atonement, all of Israel 
		would descend upon Jerusalem 
		to witness the High Cohen's 
		trip into the holy of holies. 
		If the holy man was pure he 
		would reemerge a few moments 
		later and Israel was secured 
		a prosperous year. It meant 
		that we were one yea r closer 
		to the messianic age. Closer 
		to the return of the Garden 
		of Eden. But if he was 
		impure, he would die 
		instantly and it meant that 
		we were doomed. The High 
		Cohen had a single ritual to
		perform in the holy of holies. 
		He had to intone a single 
		word.

	Rav Cohen takes a dramatic pause. Max is anxious to hear the 
	end of the story.

				MAX
		So?
	
				RAV COHEN
		That word was the true name of God.
	
				MAX
		Yeah...
	
				RAV COHEN
		The true name, which only 
		the Cohanim knew, was two 
		hundred and sixteen letters 
		long.

	A long beat.

				MAX 
			(Incredulous) 
		You're telling me that the number in 
		my head is the name of God!?

	Wondrously, Max rubs the scar on his head.

				RAV COHEN 
			(Passion building) 
		Yes...it's The key into 
		the messianic age. As the 
		Romans burned the temple, the 
		Talmud says, the High Cohen 
		walked into the flames. He 
		took his secret to the top of 
		the burning building. The 
		heavens opened up and took 
		the key from the priest's 
		outstretched hand. We've been 
		searching for the key ever 
		since. And you may have found 
		it. Now let us find out.
	
				MAX 
		That's what happened. I 
		saw God.

				RAV COHEN 
		No, no, Max. 
		You're not pure. You can't 
		see God unless you're pure.
	
				MAX 
		It's more than God...
		it s everything. It's math 
		and science and nature...
		the universe. I saw the 
		Universe's DNA
	
				RAV COHEN 
		You saw nothing.
	
				MAX 
		I saw everything.
	
				RAV COHEN 
		There's much more. 
		We can unlock the door with 
		the key. It will show God 
		that we are pure again. He 
		will return us to The Garden.
	
				MAX 
		Garden? You're not pure. 
		I'm the one who has the 
		number
	
				RAV COHEN 
		Who do you think 
		you are? You are a vessel 
		from our God. You are 
		carrying a delivery that 
		needs to be made to us.
	
				MAX 
		It was given to me. It's 
		part of me. It's changing me.

				RAV COHEN 
		It's killing you. 
		Because you are impure.

				LENNY MEYER 
		It will kill you!
	
				MAX 
		And what will it do to 
		you?

				LENNY MEYER 
		We're pure. Give 
		us the number!

				MAX 
		The number is nothing. 
		You know that!

				RAV COHEN 
		We can use it. We 
		can wield it.

				MAX 
		It's just a number. I'm 
		sure you've written down 
		every two hundred sixteen number. 
		You've translated all of 
		them. You've intoned them 
		all. Haven't you? But what's 
		it gotten you? It's not the 
		number! It's the meaning. 
		It's the syntax. It's what's 
		between the numbers. If you 
		could understand you would. 
		But it's not for you! I've 
		got it. I understand it. I'm 
		going to see it! 
			(Whispers to Rav Cohen) 
		Rabbi...I was chosen.
	
	EXT. CITY STREETS - DAY

	Max races through the streets of New York. He is wide-eyed.

				MAX (V.0.) 
		Suddenly, it's all there. 
		It all makes sense. I 
		can crack it. I can know it. 
		I know what it is. Sol knows, 
		too. I need to tell him. I 
		need to show him. I need to 
		bring him with me.
	
	People fly by. Max in a spiraling whirlwind.

	EXT. SOL'S APARTMENT - NIGHT

	A pumped and excited Max paces the hall as he rings the bell.

	The door opens. But it isn't Sol. It's a young, beautiful 
	woman wearing a simple black dress. Her name is JENNY ROBESON 
	and she is Sol's niece.

				JENNY ROBESON 
		Can I help you?
	
				MAX 
			(Confused) 
		Sol?
	
				JENNY ROBESON 
		Were you a friend?
	
				MAX 
		What do you mean?
	
				JENNY ROBESON 
		He had a second stroke.
	
				MAX 
		Where is he?
	
	Jenny's eyes drop.

				MAX 
		No.
	
	Max rushes into Sol s study. The room is covered with Sol's P, 
	research books. It seems Sol had recently come out of 
	retirement. Max looks at a few of Sol's books. Then he finds a 
	piece of paper with Sol's handwriting on it. On the paper is 
	THE number. Max slides it into his pocket.

	Max looks at the Go board. The pieces are arranged in a giant 
	spiral across the board.

	DISSOLVE TO

	INT. MAX'S APARTMENT - DAY

	Max sits on his bed staring at Sol's handwritten number.
	Then he notices that his thumb is twitching. He drops Sol's 
	note.

				MAX
		Stop it, please!

	He dumps the contents of the bottle of pills into his hand.

	Max stops as he prepares to shove the pills down his throat. 
	He looks at the pills. Then he looks at Euclid around him. He 
	throws the pills and the bottle to the floor. They fall to 
	earth in SLOW MOTION.

	The room rushes in on Max and so does the pain. It throws him 
	to the ground and he bashes his head against the floor.

				MAX 
			(Courageously) 
		No. No. I'm ready. I'm 
		ready! Show me!

	Max recites THE number and uses it to get to his feet. The 
	pain rips apart his voice.

	Max's pain and anger transform into violence. He attacks 
	Euclid furiously. He recites the number with rage in his 
	voice.

				MAX 
		Three, seven, two...
	
	He smashes the old computer apart. He tosses his step stool 
	through the mainframe.

	Then he goes to the window and tries to rip off the cardboard 
	covering the glass panes. Nothing doing, so he yanks the 
	entire window wide open.

	Sunlight floods the room and throws Max into the 
	BLINDING WHITE VOID 
	where Max looks around starry-eyed. The pain is gone. 
	Everything is new to Max - even his hands. The stress leases 
	from his brow and his shoulders sag.

	Max continues to recite the number His voice becomes tender 
	and peaceful. As he starts to become part of the void, his 
	voice turns into a whisper and his eyes start to close.

	Then he hears Devi.

				DEVI (O.S.) 
		Max. Max! Are you 
		okay!? Oh my God, Max!

	Her voice reaches into the void.

				DEVI (O.S) 
		Max! Breathe, Max. Breathe!
	
	Max looks toward her voice.

				DEVI (O.S.) 
		Yes, Max. Listen to me...
	
	We cut back to 
	...THE MAIN ROOM 
	where Devi leans over Max. Max's eyes are open while he 
	continues to recite the number.

				DEVI 
		Breathe, Max! Breathe. 
		Focus.

	Max turns away from Devi and we return to the 
	BLINDING WHITE VOID 
	where Max continues to recite the number.

				DEVI (O.S.) 
		No, Max. No. 
		Stay with me Max. Stay with 
		me. 
	
	And then we cut back to 
	THE MAIN ROOM 
	where Devi grabs Max's palm. Max's fingers wrap around her 
	hand. We return to 
	THE BLINDING WHITE VOID 
	where Max stops reciting the number. He suddenly opens his 
	fear filled eyes.

				MAX 
		Where am I? What is 
		this? This is wrong, Sol. 
		Sol!
	
	Max lets out a 'SOL!, and reaches out into the void. We match 
	cut back to 
	THE MAIN ROOM

	where Max grabs Devi and hugs her. He gasps for air as
	he collapses into her arms, sobbing.

				MAX 
		Sol! You were right Sol! 
		He was right.

				DEVI 
		That's right Max. That's 
		Right. Breathe. Breathe.

				MAX 
		He was right. I want to 
		breathe. Breathe.

				DEVI 
		Yes, breathe, Max. 
		Breathe...

	Max sobs. He holds onto her for dear life

	And then be realizes that Devi is not in his arms. He is 
	holding onto himself.

	Then Max notices Sol's note on the ground. He looks at the 
	number. He collects himself and catches his breath.

	INT. MAX'S BATHROOM  DAY

	Max looks at Sol's note. He lights a match and burns it.

	Next, he prepares something in the sink.

	We hear the WHINE of a motor. Then it stops, Max looks at 
	himself in the mirror, He smiles. Then he gets solemn.

	He takes a deep breath. Then we hear the motor again. Max 
	lifts up his arm. He's holding a drill. He places the bit 
	against the math section of his scalp.

	He applies pressure and drills into his brain.

	Max collapses as we quickly 
	CUT TO

	EXT. CITY PLAYGROUND - DAY

	TIGHT ON
	a tree branch gently blowing in the wind.

	Max watches it with peaceful, understanding eyes. He wears a 
	hat on his head.

	He listens to the wind in the trees.

	Just then, Jenna surprises him with her Fisher Price 
	calculator on hand.

				JEHNA 
		Max, Max!
	
	Max smiles at Jenna. He's glad to see her.

				JENNA 
		Can we do one, Max, can 
		we?

	Max shrugs, not able to say no.

				JENNA 
		How about two hundred 
		and fifty-five times a 
		hundred and eighty-three.
	
	Jenna types m the number.

	Max is about to say "no" to Jenna, but then be decides to give 
	it a shot.

	Max thinks, he really thinks.

	Jenna presses the EQUALS button.

				JENNA 
		I got it! I got it! 
		What's the answer?

				MAX 
			(Smiling and then laughing) 
		I don't know. I really don't 
		know. What is it, Jenna?

				JENNA 
		Forty-six thousand six 
		hundred and sixty-five.

				MAX 
		Oh.
	
	The trees blow gently in the wind as we slowly 
	FADE TO WHITE which brings us to

     NOTE: THE HARD COPY OF THIS SCRIPT CONTAINED SCENE NUMBERS
     AND SOME "OMITTED" SLUGS. THEY HAVE BEEN REMOVED FOR THIS

     NOTE ALSO: THE HARD COPY OF THIS SCRIPT WAS IN THE NON-

     TO PREFORMATTED TEXT FOR THIS SOFT COPY.









Though mentioned often in the script, the creatures in PITCH BLACK are 
seldom seen at length; rather, they are glimpsed, they are heard, they are 
felt. They are, really, the embodiment of your nocturnal fears: A howling 
coyote that jars you awake; the painting on the wall that comes to life
when stared at too long...the sway of your bed just before the earthquake 
hits. Chimera of the night. The point is made so the reader appreciates
that the focus of the finished film will not be on what the creatures do, 
but on what the creatures do to reveal the inner nature of the characters. 
For PITCH BLACK is, at its heart, a story of humanity and courage -- and 
lack of the same.

     CUT IN:

     INT. MAIN CABIN

     A CRYO-LOCKER BLOWS OPEN, spitting out...

     CAROLYN FRY. She hits the deck of the main cabin: Four crew
     lockers in a forward section, countless more in back. But the
     deck is canted at a sick angle and ALARMS SCREAM everywhere:
     The world is dying around her.

     Legs wobbly, shivering like a flu victim, Fry stumbles to the
     next forward locker. It's riddled with holes. One DEAD CREWIE
     is seen through fractured plexi, body pocked and bloodied. But
     in the next cryo-locked...

     The CAPTAIN is struggling awake. Fry's face floods with relief.
     Slapping an intercom:

                              FRY
               Hear me? Cap'n? Some kinda compromise to
               the hull...holding for now, but...Goddamn,
               I'm glad you're alive. Gotta pull your
               E-release...no, red handle, red handle.
               I'll get the warm-ups out while --

     PHFUT-PHFUT-PHFUT-PHFUT: Particles bore through the cabin,
     blasting open the captain's chest, shattering plexi, DETONATING
     INSTRUMENTS on the opposite wall and leaving CONTRAILS
     HISSING in the air.

     Fry lands on her ass, horrified. Suddenly...

     Another LOCKER BLOWS OPEN. A body falls right on top of Fry --
     but this one's still alive. Disoriented, frantic:

                              OWENS
               Why did I fall on you?

                              FRY
               He's dead. Cap'n's dead. Christ, I was
               looking right at him when --

                              OWENS
               I mean, I mean, chrono shows we're 22
               weeks out, so gravity wasn't supposed to
               kick in for another 19. I mean, I mean,
               I mean, why did I fall at all?

                              FRY
               You hear me? Captain's dead. Owens too.

                              OWENS
               Oh, no. Not Owens, not.... Wai', wai',
               wait. I'm Owens. Right?

     They swap nightmare looks, momentarily unsure of their own
     identities.

                              FRY
               Cryo-sleep. Swear to God, it sloughs
               brain cells.


     INT. NAV-BAY - MAIN CABIN

     They stumble into nav-bay. ALARMS CONTINUE. Fry grabs warm-up
     suits out of storage, pitches one to Owens, checks her screens.

                              FRY
               1550 millibars, dropping 20 MB per minute,
               shit, we're hemorrhaging air. Somethin'
               took a swipe at us.

                              OWENS
               Just tell me we're still in the shipping
               lane. Just show me all those stars, all
               those bright, beautiful, deep-space....

     Owens activates an exterior view: A planet rushes up at us.
     That's why they have gravity.

                              FRY
               Jesus God....


     EXT. SHIP - PLANET'S ATMOSPHERE - DAY

     The SHIP PLOWS through the upper atmosphere, antennae pylons
     already disintegrating.


     INT. PASSAGE TO FLIGHT DECK

     Heart battering her ribs, Fry runs forward, using hand-holds to
     steady herself. Over a headset:

                              OWENS (V.O.)
               They trained you for this, right? Fry?
               FRY?

     She doesn't answer.


     INT. FLIGHT DECK - DAY

     Fry harnesses in, starts running switches -- but fumbles a few
     times, making mental errors. Finally she gets crash-shutters
     open to reveal...

     CLOUD STRATA sweeping up past the windscreen like floor-lights
     on a dropping elevator. We're shedding big altitude.


     INT. NAV-BAY - MAIN CABIN

                              OWENS
               ... crisis program selected Number Two of
               this system because it shows at least some
               oxygen and more than 1,500 -- would you
               SHUT THE FUCK UP!
                         (hammers a button,
                          SILENCES ALARMS)
               -- more than 1,500-millibars of pressure
               at surface-level. Okay, so maybe the ship
               did something right for a change....


     INT. FLIGHT DECK - DAY

     As Fry runs more switches.


     INT. SHIP - DAY

     As JETTISON DOORS CLOSE around the ship.


     INT. FLIGHT DECK - DAY

     As Fry flips up a security-latch -- and thumbs the switch below.


     EXT. SHIP - PLANET'S ATMOSPHERE - DAY

     MULTIPLE SHOTS: EXPLOSIVE BOLTS RAPID-FIRE around the ship's
     skin, blowing away non-essentials that hinder aerodynamics --
     including big deep-space drives. But this last separation puts
     the ship into a dangerous roll.


     INT. FLIGHT DECK - DAY

     Out the windscreen, cloud strata roll vertiginously. Fry throws
     actuators...


     EXT. SHIP - PLANET'S ATMOSPHERE - DAY

     And airbrakes deploy. She manages to kill the roll. But the
     ship's still coming in nose-high.


     INT. NAV-BAY - MAIN CABIN

                              OWENS
               ...showing no major water bodies...maximum
               terrain, 220 meters over mean surface...
               largely cinder and gypsum with some
               evaporite deposits....

     JETTISON DOORS CLOSE behind Owens, segregating him from the
     passenger compartment. It scares him for a new reason.

                              OWENS
               Fry? What're you doing?


     INT. FLIGHT DECK - DAY

     Fry flips up a new security-latch. INTERCUTTING:

                              OWENS
               Fry?

                              FRY
               Can't get my nose down...too much load
               back there....

                              OWENS
               You mean that "load" of passengers?

                              FRY
               So what, we should both go down too?
               Out of sheer fucking nobility?

     Tortured silence. Fry's thumb moves to the switch that will
     jettison the passenger cabin. Jettison 50 people.


     INT. MAIN CABIN

     SELECTED SHOTS of faces inside cryo-lockers, among them JOHNS.
     He's prime-of-life, badge on display, some kind of cop. Shaken
     awake, he clears condensation to check the locker directly across
     from his, finding...

     RIDDICK. Small black goggles hide his eyes. A metal bit wedged
     in his mouth lends a perpetual grimace. A read-out admonishes
     "LOCK-OUT PROTOCOL IN EFFECT. ABSOLUTELY NO EARLY
     RELEASE."


     INT. FLIGHT DECK - DAY

                              OWENS
               Look, Fry. Company says we're responsible
               for every one of those --

                              FRY
               Company's not here, is it?

                              OWENS
               When captain went down, you stepped up --
               whether you like it or not. Now they
               train you for this, so --

                              FRY
               And there wasn't a simulated cockroach
               alive within 50 clicks of the simulated
               crash site! That's how they train you!
               On a fucking simulator!

     Owens unbuckles from his chair.

                              OWENS
               Don't touch that switch!

     Overcome by guilt, Fry retracts her thumb of mass destruction.
     But a HUGE JOLT puts the thumb right back.

                              FRY
               I'm not dying for them.

     She pushes it. But this time...


     EXT. SHIP - PLANET'S ATMOSPHERE - DAY

     No bolts fire. Nothing separates from the SHIP THAT SCREAMS DOWN
     through the clouds.


     INT. NAV-BAY - MAIN CABIN

     Now we see why: Owens reopened the jettison doors locally -- and
     blocked them open.

                              FRY
               Owens!

                              OWENS
               70 seconds! You still got 70 seconds to
               level this beast out!


     INT. FLIGHT DECK - DAY

     Seething anger and guilt, Fry pops more airbrakes, shedding more
     speed, more heat. The ship does level -- but it's still being
     pounded hellishly. She tries to get a stable view out...

     The windscreen. We're breaking through cloud-bottoms. There's
     just a glimpse of landscape before...


     EXT. SHIP - PLANET'S ATMOSPHERE - DAY

     An airbrake fails. It shears off and pinwheels into...


     INT. FLIGHT DECK - DAY

     The windscreen. It cracks into a thousand spiderwebs -- but
     impossibly it holds. For now.

                              OWENS (V.O.)
               What the shit was that?

     Sunlight flares from every fractured edge: It's like looking
     into burning diamonds, and Fry can only get an impression
     of the outside world. Now she has to rely on...

     A ground-mapping display. 120 meters altitude. And dropping.


     INT. CRYO-LOCKER - DAY

     INTERCUT Johns. Realizing he's in some kind of shit-storm, he
     claws at safety restraints.


     INT. FLIGHT DECK - DAY

     Ground-mapper: 60 meters. COLLISION ALARMS kick in.

     Out the fractured windscreen, we see a huge dark mass rise up
     into view. Land.

     40 meters...30...20...10....

     Fry braces.

     IMPACT. The WINDSCREENS IMPLODE. AIR HURRICANES in.


     INT. NAV-BAY - MAIN CABIN

     IMPACT. Chairs rip from their moorings. Strapped into one,
     Owens slams into the ceiling.


     INT. MAIN CABIN - DAY

     IMPACT. Johns BLOWS OUT of his locker -- and wishes to God he
     would've stayed inside, because just beside him...

     The hull is cracking open.

     NIGHTMARE SHOT: A huge section of the cabin tears free...
     skitters and CRASHES along the planetfloor behind us...and
     disintegrates out of sight. 40 cryo-lockers vanished with it.
     40 lives.


     INT. FLIGHT DECK - DAY

     Hammered by WIND, Fry opens her eyes experimentally.

     FRY'S POV: A vortex of motion, of speed, of blurring debris.
     But the ship is burrowing in. Burrowing under.

     Fry pivots her chair 180 degrees a nanosecond before...
     Dirt avalanches into the cockpit. It buries CAMERA.

                                                       BLACKOUT


     INT. MAIN CABIN - CRASH SHIP - DAY

     Choking yellow dust. Ghostly silhouettes are COUGHING, MOANING,
     CALLING OUT to other survivors in English and, surreally, in
     Arabic. Soon we find...

     Johns. Ears running blood. Stumbling his way to...

     Riddick's cryo-locker. Empty. Johns reaches for his holster.
     Gone, torn right off his belt. No prisoner and no weapon --
     spooky combination. Nearby he sees...

     The light of a cutting torch. Someone's using it to open a
     jammed cryo-locker. The plexi is torched away to reveal...

     AUDREY, 12 years old. Unscathed.

                              AUDREY
               Somethin' went wrong, huh?

     Johns searches for his pistol. Behind him, two chained feet
     lower into FRAME -- and then attack, swinging over Johns' head...
     getting the chain on his neck...twisting hard, using the chain as
     a choke-collar. Johns flicks open a baton, swings it up at...

     Riddick. Still in body chains and mouth-bit. Clinging to a
     ceiling support. Riding out the baton blows.

     Seconds from blacking out, Johns strains forward...forward...and
     finally breaks Riddick's grip on the support. He keeps hold of
     the chained feet so that...

     Riddick SLAMS HEADFIRST into the deck. Johns lays the baton on
     his neck.

                              JOHNS
               One chance and you blew it, Riddick.
               Never cease to disappoint me.


     INT. FLIGHT DECK - CRASH SHIP - DAY

     Darkness. A light beam sweeps the dusty air of the cockpit.
     It's packed with dirt, no signs of life. About to search
     elsewhere, Johns turns back at...

                              FRY (O.S.)
               Hey.

                              JOHNS
               Hey, who?

                              FRY (O.S.)
               Hey, me. Over here.

     His light finds a headrest sticking up from the dirt. Johns
     crawls closer, checks the other side of the headrest and finds
     her. Fry. Buried to the gills.

                              JOHNS
               Amazing. I'm Johns.

                              FRY
               Carolyn Fry. I'd shake hands, but...

     He manages a smile and starts digging her out. Almost dreading
     to ask:

                              FRY
               Are there any others, Johns?


     INT. MAIN CABIN - CRASH SHIP - DAY

     Johns helps Fry through the carnage. She's stunned by it all --
     but especially by the blast of sunlight where a hull used to be.

     Realizing she's in nav-bay, Fry starts digging like a search dog
     to uncover...

     Owens. Still strapped to his chair. Metal rod piercing his
     chest close to the heart. Dead. Fry reaches out to touch him.

                              OWENS
               Out, out, out, GET IT OUTTA ME!

     She recoils hard. He's still alive. The other survivors bungle
     over. Ten seconds of pure chaos:

                              VOICES
               Pull it out of him...No, it's too close to
               the heart...You gotta do it, just do it
               fast....

     Fry grabs the rod.

                              OWENS
               Don't touch it! Don't touch that switch!

                              VOICES
               You'll kill him, I'm tellin' you, shit,
               just leave it alone...delirious...doncha
               you got some drugs for this poor man....

                              OWENS
               Don't touch that switch!

                              FRY
               Awright, awright, someone...there's
               Anestaphine in the med-lock, that end of
               the cabin...next to....

     But there is no more "that end." In exquisite pain, Owens
     screams on. REACTION SHOTS of Johns, Audrey. Seldom are human
     beings witness to such raw suffering.

                              FRY
               Get away. Everybody.

     The others leave -- except for Audrey, staying behind to watch
     in morbid fascination. Johns doubles back and collars her.
     Leaving, they pass...

     Riddick, cuffed to a bulkhead. His eyes, still hidden by
     goggles, track Johns and Audrey toward daylight.


     EXT. CRASH SHIP - DAY

     The survivors straggle outside. CAMERA SURVEYS new faces:

     ZEKE and SHAZZA. Male-female team of bushwhackers, partners in
     life. Shazza has a tough sexiness. Zeke's face shows aboriginal
     blood. (30s.)

     PARIS. Overfed, overgroomed. A puff pastry of a man. (40s or
     50s.)

     Four male "Chrislams": The pillar-steady IMAM (50ish), and
     THREE PILGRIMS, young and excitable (late-teens). (NOTE: The
     Chrislams represent a union between Christianity and Islam. They
     have the iconography of Christians yet the physical look of Arab
     Muslims.)

     WIDE SHOT: All around them is stark and unforgiving terrain.
     The valley floor is relieved only by low hills to one side,
     spiked with earthen spires. Scorching down on everything are
     two suns -- one red, one yellow.

                              PARIS
               Well. Our own little slice of heaven.

     The Chrislams fall to their knees. Confusion as they try to
     orient themselves.

                              IMAM
               Please...which way to New Mecca? We must
               know the direction in order to pray.

     North? South? East? West? Nobody knows. Johns snaps open a
     compass, finds the needle swaying rudderlessly. The SCREAMING
     inside the ship finally ends.


     INT. CRASH SHIP - DAY

     As Fry holds Owens, now dead.


     EXT. CRASH SHIP - DAY

     The four Chrislams have devised a way to pray: Backs together,
     each faces a different compass point.


     EXT. TOP OF CRASH SHIP - DAY

     Fry climbs onto the back of the ship. Johns Paris, Zeke, Shazza,
     Audrey are already here.

                              JOHNS
               Big talk about a scouting party...

     Fry sees the huge smoldering scar in the ground behind the ship.
     One glance confirms that there are no other survivors.

                              JOHNS (CONT'D)
               ...then we saw this.

                              PARIS
               Anyone else having breathing problems?
               Aside from me?

                              AUDREY
               Like I just ran, or something....

                              SHAZZA
               Feel one lung short. All of us.

                              PARIS
               Well, I tend toward the asthmatic. And
               with all this dust....

     Faces turn to Fry: They're looking to her for answers.

                              FRY
               It's the atmosphere. Too much pressure,
               not enough oxygen. Might take a few days
               to --

                              ZEKE
               So what the bloody hell happened, anyways?

                              FRY
               Somethin' knocked us off-lane. Maybe a
               rogue comet. Maybe we'll never know.

                              SHAZZA
               Well, I for one, am thoroughly fucking
               grateful. This beast wasn't made to land
               like this. But cripes, you rode it down.
                         (to others)
               C'mon, you lousy ingrates, only reason
               we're alive is a'cuzza her.

     Others CHIME AGREEMENT, laying thankful hands on Fry's shoulders.
     HOLD on Fry, her face betraying nothing as they anoint her their
     savior.


     INT. MAIN CABIN - CRASH SHIP - DAY

     Breaking out pressure suits:

                              FRY
               Liquid oxygen canisters inside. Start
               ripping them out. Quick hits only -- try
               to make it last.

                              AUDREY
               Well, is someone coming for us? Or are
               we all just gonna die of exposure or
               dehydration or sunstroke or maybe even
               something worse?
                         (off their looks)
               Hey, you don't have to worry about scaring
               me.

                              SHAZZA
               We're worried you'll scare us.
                         (ushering her away)
               Name's "Audrey," right, love? And you're
               goin' to Taurus Three like we were?

                              AUDREY
               Yeah, but...do we even have enough food
               to get there? Or will we have to resort
               to cannibalism?

                              ZEKE
                         (to Fry)
               I'll see 'bout makin' this air go a bit
               further, cap'n. With your permission,
               a' course.

     Fry blinks. "They actually think I'm the captain." Zeke and the
     others get to work. Fry finds herself staring at another
     problem. Riddick.

                              FRY
               And him?

                              JOHNS
               Big Evil?

                              FRY
               We just keep him locked up forever?

                              JOHNS
               Be my choice. Already escaped once from
               the max-slam facility on --

                              FRY
               I don't need his life story. Is he really
               that dangerous?

                              JOHNS
               Only around humans.

     Riddick has his mouth on the hull, virtually licking the metal.
     Fry moves closer -- and now sees it sheeting down the hull.

                              FRY
               Oh, Christ....

     They're losing water. Suddenly Fry is running, snatching up an
     emergency light, climbing wall-rungs...


     INT. MACHINE LEVEL - CRASH SHIP - DAY

     And crawling through dusty superstructure to reach the water
     cistern. She opens a crank-hatch -- and finds light invading the
     interior. Her face dies.

                              ZEKE (V.O.)
                         (shouting)
               Well? Is it just the pump?

                              FRY
               Ask if anyone has anything in cargo!
               Anything to drink!


     INT. CARGO HOLD - DAY

     Oversize DOORS RUMBLE open. Fry, Johns, and Paris climb into
     this dark corridor lined with cargo containers. Each container
     has an access door.

                              PARIS
               Mine here....

     As Paris unlocks, Johns steadies himself, suddenly light-headed.

                              FRY
               S'matter?

                              JOHNS
               Little swamp-flu from the Conga system.
               Never shook it with all this cryo-sleep.

     Paris opens his container to reveal...


     INT. PARIS' CONTAINER - CARGO HOLD - DAY

     Tiffany chairs stacked 10 high. Bronze eagle lecterns. Oriental
     umbrellas. Neo-Egyptian castings.

                              JOHNS
               King Tut's tomb....

                              PARIS
               Be surprised what these will fetch in the
               Taurus system. Here. This Wooten here --
               easy, easy. Very rare.

     They open the Wooten desk. Cubbyholed inside are dusty bottles
     of sherry. Vintage Port. Glenfiddich. Bicardi 151.

                              FRY
               This is it? Booze? That's what you have
               to drink?

                              PARIS
                         (educating her)
               200-year-old single-malt scotch is to
               "booze" as foie gras is to "duck guts."

                              JOHNS
                         (cracking a bottle)
               A toast to whatever he just said.

                              PARIS
               I'll need a receipt for that.
                         (to Fry)
               For all these.

                              FRY
               Top of my list.

     She joins Johns for a drink. Entering, the Chrislams watch with
     both envy and aversion.

                              FRY
               I don't suppose....

                              IMAM
               One of the Christian habits we didn't
               adopt -- perhaps unfortunately. We'll
               have to wait.

                              JOHNS
               For what? There is no water. You
               understand that, don't you?

                              IMAM
               All deserts have water, somewhere. God
               shall lead us there.


     INT. MAIN CABIN - CRASH SHIP - DAY

     START on the cutting torch, abandoned in wreckage. Staring at it
     is...

     Riddick. With his hands cuffed behind him and around a bulkhead,
     he can't get near it. Or can he? Near the ceiling, the bulkhead
     is fractured -- a slim spot where maybe chains could pass through.

     Riddick stands. With a GRUESOME POPPING, he dislocates both
     shoulders...carries his arms overhead...passes the chains through
     the broken spot...and brings his arms down in front of him. A
     body-flex POPS HIS SHOULDERS back into joint.

     Free, he reaches for the cutting torch.


     EXT. CRASH SHIP - DAY

     Pistol in hand, Johns runs into a BIG CLOSEUP, eyes sweeping.
     Nothing on the horizon. But something lies on the ground nearby.
     It's Riddick's mouth-bit.

                              JOHNS
               Like we needed another way to die.


     INT. CARGO HOLD - DAY

     FAST CLOSEUPS: Hands pillaging storage lockers, pulling out
     anything that might qualify as a "weapon." It all gets hauled
     back and dumped into...

     INT. NAV BAY - CRASH SHIP - DAY

     Nav-bay. Gathered, the survivors take inventory: Johns has a
     pistol, shotgun, baton. Zeke and Shazza offer up a pick-ax,
     digging tools, hunting boomerang. Imam shows a ceremonial blade.
     Paris straggles in with antique curios.

                              JOHNS
               What the hell are these?

                              PARIS
               Maratha crow-bill war-picks from Northern
               India. Very rare.

                              ZEKE
               An' this?

                              PARIS
               Blow-dart hunting stick from Papua New
               Guinea. Very very rare, since the tribe's
               extinct.

                              ZEKE
               'Cuz they couldn't hunt shit with these
               things, be my guess.

                              PARIS
               Well, what's the need, anyway? If he's
               gone, he's gone. Why should he bother us?

                              JOHNS
               First, because he can only live out there
               for so long -- he's gonna come back and
               take what we got. Second, for the sheer
               thrill of the kill.

     A beat. They all grab for weapons.


     EXT. CRASH SHIP - DAY

     Johns stands atop the crash ship, scanning with a scope. He
     fixates on...

     A blue glow on the horizon. "What the hell is it?"

     Zeke and Shazza modify breather units, adding straps and tubing
     and ball-floats. The prototype is tested on Audrey. She sucks
     on the mouthpiece -- and finds that it works, supplying oxygen on
     demand rather than in a constant flow.

     Chrislams convert to traditional bedouin head-gear, readying for
     travel.

     Fry finishes wrapping Owens' body. She looks to the yellow sun,
     low on the horizon. The red sun seems inclined to follow.

                              FRY
               Imam. We should leave soon. Before
               nightfall but while it's cooler.

                              ZEKE
               What, you're goin' off, too?

                              FRY
               Johns is leaving you a gun. Just do me a
               favor, huh? Get my crewies buried? They
               were good guys who died bad.

                              SHAZZA
               A'course we will.

                              PILGRIM #1 (O.S.)
               Imam...Imam....

     (NOTE: "Imam" is pronounced "el-ee-MAM.")

     Fry and the others round the ship to see...

     A blue star flaring into view. It's rising as the other suns are
     setting.

                              SHAZZA
               My bloody oath....

                              AUDREY
               Three suns?

                              ZEKE
                         (to Fry)
               So much for your nightfall.

                              PARIS
               So much for my cocktail hour.

                              IMAM
               We take this to be a good sign -- a path,
               a direction from God.

     Johns swings down from the top of the ship.

                              JOHNS
               A very good sign.
                         (re: blue sun)
               That's Riddick's direction. You do not
               wanna be caught in the dark with this guy.

                              FRY
               Thought you found his restraints over
               there. Toward sunset.

                              JOHNS
                         (nodding)
               Which means he went toward sunrise.


     EXT. PLANET - DAY

     Trekking, the Chrislams waft incense pots and CHANT FROM
     THE KORAN as they head toward the blue star. Johns provides
     shotgun escort; Fry carries Paris' second war-pick on a shoulder.
     Silhouetted against the alien sky, the scouting party is an odd,
     odd sight.

     Already sun-battered, Johns crafts an eye-visor out of plexi.
     Fry tries to wrap her head like the Chrislams. Imam helps.

                              FRY
               So quiet. You get used to the sounds of
               the ship, then....

                              IMAM
               You know who Muhammad was?

                              FRY
               Some prophet guy?

                              IMAM
               "Some prophet guy." And a city man. But
               he had to travel to the desert -- where
               there was quiet -- to hear the words of
               God.

                              FRY
               You were on a pilgrimage? To New Mecca?

                              IMAM
                         (nodding)
               Chrislam teaches that once in every
               lifetime should there be a great hajj --
               a great pilgrimage. To know God, better,
               yes, but to know yourself as well.

                              FRY
               Frightening thought.

                              IMAM
                         (finishes wrapping her)
               We're all on the same hajj now.

     Fry notices Johns scope-locked on something.

                              FRY
               What?

                              JOHNS
                         (hands her scope)
               Tell me it's not a mirage.

     SCOPE POV: Beyond a distant rise, strange branches.

                              FRY
               Trees?


     EXT. CRASH SHIP - DAY

     Paris has taken over as look-out atop the ship. He deals with
     the heat by erecting a "misting" umbrella: He fills a reservoir
     with liquor, dials up a regulator. Umbrella spars shoot bursts
     of cooling alcohol vapor. Paris luxuriates in it.

                              ZEKE (O.S.)
               Comfy up there?

     Zeke appears below. He loads a scrap-metal sled with tarp,
     cable, pick-ax.

                              PARIS
               Amazing how you can do without the
               essentials of life -- so long as you have
               the luxuries.

                              ZEKE
               Well, just keep your bloody-fuckin' eyes
               open. Don't want that ratbag sneakin' up
               on me bloody-fuckin' arse.

     He drags the sled toward the spired hills. Keeping one eye on
     Zeke, Paris eases into a chair, lays the war-pick across his lap,
     pours himself a spot of sherry. As he sips, a blade touches his
     throat.

                              AUDREY
               He'd probably get you right here, right
               under the jaw. And you'd never hear him
               coming. That's how good Riddick is.

     Paris eases the hunting boomerang away.

                              PARIS
               Now did you run away from your parents?
               Or did they run away from you?

     EXT. BONEYARD OVERLOOK - DAY

     The scouting party approaches a rise. The trees loom just beyond.

                              PILGRIMS
               Allahu Akbar...Allahu Akbar....

     The young pilgrims break into a excited run, anticipating an
     oasis. But Fry hangs back, taking a harder look at the trees.
     They don't move in the wind.

     The pilgrims scramble up the rise -- and go motionless. Fry,
     Johns and Imam catch up to behold...

     The "trees" are actually the dorsal bones of a titanic skeleton,
     tinted green by lichen. Beyond is a sea of bleached animal
     bones. Impossibly, the bones seem to MOAN IN PAIN. All told,
     it's like Hell overflowed right here.

                              FRY
               Is this whole planet dead?

     A pilgrim questions Imam IN ARABIC.

                              IMAM
               He asks what could have killed so many
               great things...
         

     EXT. BONEYARD - DAY

     Moving into the boneyard:

                              IMAM
               Some...communal graveyard, perhaps...
               like the elephants of Earth....

     Fry touches one of the towering bones. It shows cut-marks --
     almost as if the bone was hacked by a sword. "Graveyard? Or
     killing field?"

                              JOHNS
               Long time ago. Whatever happened.


     EXT. SKULL - BONEYARD - DAY

     Pilgrim #1 reaches a huge skull laced with baleen-like combing.
     Wind hitting the comb makes a LOW HARMONIC MOANING. By
     moving a hand over the comb, the pilgrim can "play" DIRGELIKE
     MUSIC. Wanting to show off the trick:

                              PILGRIM #1
               Ah....

     He looks for Pilgrim #3 but can't spot him. And when he turns
     back to the skull -- a face is staring through the combing. But
     it's only...


     INT. SKULL - BONEYARD - DAY

     Pilgrim #3, inside the skull. Johns enters and chases him out.
     About to leave, Johns notices...

     Bone-chippings piled on the ground. It could be nothing, but
     still...

     Johns double-checks shadows, probing with the muzzle of his
     shotgun. Satisfied, Johns exits. Now BOOM UP to reveal...

     Riddick. Hidden in a sinus cavity.


     EXT. SKULL - BONEYARD - DAY

     Trailing the others, Fry pauses to change out the O2 on her
     breather.


     INT. SKULL - BONEYARD - DAY

     Riddick drops to the ground. His arms and hands are now pierced
     with shards of boneyard ivory -- fashionable little body talons.
     Spotting a shadow on the combing, he draws closer. And sees Fry.
     Alone.


     EXT. SKULL - BONEYARD - DAY

     Johns doubles back to Fry. He takes a hit of scotch, offers her
     some.

                              FRY
               Probably makes it worse. Dehydrates you
               even more.

                              JOHNS
               Probably right.

     They drink anyway. Moving out of the sun, Fry leans up against
     the combing. It brings her within arm's length of...


     INT. SKULL - BONEYARD - DAY

     Riddick. He pulls a bone-shiv, freshly chiseled.

                              JOHNS (O.S.)
               You know, I woulda played road dog for
               these guys. You could've stayed back.
               Pro'bly should've -- because, you know,
               if we don't find water....

     "We may not make it back."

                              FRY (O.S.)
               No, no, I wanted to get away.

                              JOHNS (O.S.)
               So I noticed. Never seen a "captain"
               quite so ready to leave her ship.

     Just as Riddick eases his blade toward Fry's neck...


     EXT. SKULL - BONEYARD - DAY

     She steps away.

                              FRY
               Better keep moving....

                              JOHNS
               What'd Owens mean? 'Bout not touching
               the switch?

     Fry searches his eyes, wondering if she can trust him -- and
     again she leans back on the combing. We can actually see Riddick
     now. They could too, if they would just TURN THE FUCK AROUND!

                              JOHNS (CONT'D)
               Hey. You can tell me, Carolyn.

                              FRY
               Promise me. Swear to me you won't --

                              JOHNS
               You see anybody else here? Just between
               you and me.

                              FRY
               During the landing...when things were
               at their worst...Owens was at his best.
               He's the one who wouldn't let the pilot
               dump the passenger cabin.

     Johns blinks, stunned. "Are you shittin' me?"


     INT. SKULL - BONEYARD - DAY

     Trying again, Riddick reaches out with his shiv -- and deftly
     slices off some of Fry's hair. A locket. A souvenir. That's
     all he wanted.

                              FRY (O.S.)
               So now you know.

                              JOHNS (O.S.)
               Fuck. Guess I'm more glad to be here than
               I thought.

     Riddick watches them move off -- then looks at the scotch bottle,
     left behind. It's still got one good swallow.


     EXT. START OF GAUNTLET - DAY

     Leaving the boneyard, the scouting party reaches a cleft in the
     hills. Ahead is a canyon.

                              JOHNS
               Hold up.

     He jumps onto a rock, puts the scope to an eye.

                              JOHNS (CONT'D)
               Didn't bite.

                              FRY
               What?

                              JOHNS
               Thought he might be coolin' it in the
               boneyard -- could either double-back to
               the ship or slip in behind us. So I left
               the bottle out as bait.

     SCOPE POV: PANNING the boneyard. FINDING the bottle. It's
     still got that one swallow.

                              JOHNS (CONT'D)
               But nah. Didn't bite.


     EXT. BONEYARD - DAY

     CLOSER on the bottle. Only we see that the scotch has been
     emptied -- and replaced with sand.


     EXT. GRAVE SITE - SPIRED HILLS - DAY

     Working under the shade of a tarp, Zeke digs a communal grave.
     Three wrapped corpses wait nearby. He keeps a sight-line on...

     The crash ship. Shazza waves. Zeke waves back.


     EXT. RIBCAGE - THE GAUNTLET - DAY

     The scouting party transits a narrowing canyon. Lined with rib
     bones, it makes us feel like we're in the belly of some beast.

     Fry squints at the ridgetops. More of those spires are visible
     on the canyon rims, looming like silent sentinels. "What are
     they? Just mineral deposits?"

                              PILGRIM #1
               Captain...captain....

     The Chrislams have found what appears to be a small desert plant.
     Leathery petals are spread wide, revealing a round stringy core.
     ARABIC DISCUSSION. Desert fruit? Is it edible?

                              FRY
               Wait, wait, wait....

     Fry takes the "plant," pushes the "petals" back down over the
     core. They all stare. It's a baseball.

                              IMAM
               We are not alone here, yes?

     They look ahead, wondering what awaits them. But Johns is
     looking back.

                              JOHNS
               Never thought we were.


     EXT. SETTLEMENT - DAY

     HIGH ANGLE: An old WEATHER COCK CREAKS in the wind. Fry,
     Johns, and the Chrislams enter FRAME far below.

                              PILGRIM #1
               Assalamoo ahlaykum!

     The GREETING ECHOES through the settlement, built from stacked
     shipping containers. Tattered sun-shades flap in the wind. A
     rusty bike lies on the ground.

                              PILGRIM #2
               Assalamoo ahlaykum!

                              JOHNS
               Long gone. Whoever they were.

     They move around a building -- and pull up short. Before them
     looms a moisture-recovery unit, a hulking machine in disrepair.
     Old jugs litter the ground.

                              IMAM
               Water...water there was here....

                              PILGRIMS
               Allahu Akbar....


                              IMAM
                         (translating)
               "God is Great," yes?

                              JOHNS
               I'm born-again.

     Fry manages a weary smile -- but soon her eyes revisit the
     abandoned buildings. "Who were these people? Why did they
     leave so much behind?"


     INT. MAIN ROOM - SETTLEMENT - DAY

     Through a window, we see the Johns and the Chrislams crawling
     over the moisture-recovery unit, assessing repairs. PULL BACK to
     include Fry inside the settlement, inspecting...

     Refectory table. Place settings out. Years of dust.

     Photos on the wall: Settlers working modest gardens. Playing
     baseball. Posing with children.

     INT. LIVING QUARTERS - SETTLEMENT - DAY

     Fry enters a dark room.

                              FRY
               Lights.

     No response to her command. She pats around for old-style wall
     switches. Nothing. Perceiving black-out blinds on a window, she
     throws them open to reveal...

     A man standing right outside.

                              JOHNS
                         (through window)
               Hey. Don't go too far, huh?

     Fry nods. Johns smiles, leaves. Just as her heart settles,
     SOMETHING CREAKS behind her.

     It's an orrery, a mechanical device that shows the motion of the
     planets around their suns. Solar powered, the orrery starts
     turning, CREAKING. One planet seems always to have sunlight.

                              FRY
               No darkness. No lights because no
               darkness....


     EXT. PORCH - SETTLEMENT - DAY

     Fry reaches a porch. It looks out over the rear of the
     settlement and more unforgiving terrain. She starts back
     inside -- but something glints at the edge of her vision. Fry
     turns back...parts clothes on a laundry line...and sees the
     source of the glint.

     Excited hits on her breather.

     Fry vaults off the porch -- and starts walking as if on magnetic
     bearing. Soon she's running.


     EXT. SETTLEMENT - DAY

                              FRY (V.O.)
               Allahu Akbar! Allahu Akbar!

     Johns and the Chrislams trade looks.


     EXT. SKIFF - DAY

                              FRY
               Allahu Akbar!

     Fry stops on a groomed runway, out of breath. The others catch
     up. They too marvel at...

     The skiff, a light-duty vehicle of hybrid technology -- part bush
     plane, part space craft. Its fabric wings are wind-torn -- but
     the hull looks intact.


     EXT. TOP OF CRASH SHIP - DAY

     CLOSE on caviar being added to toast-points.

     A SCRABBLING SOUND stops Paris in mid-bite. He eases out of his
     rocker, moves to the rear edge of the ship and looks down on...

     A shadow ducking under him. Small rocks still trickle down a
     dirt rampart just climbed by...someone.

                              PARIS
               This now qualifies as the worst fun I've
               ever had. Stop it.

     No response.


     EXT. CRASH SHIP - DAY

     War-pick in hand, Paris eases to ground-level. He checks the
     perimeter, looks inside the ship. Nobody. Is he being fucked
     with? Again? He hopes?

                              PARIS
               Audrey? Oh, Audrey....

                              AUDREY (O.S.)
               What?

     Paris spins. The voice came from the cargo hold -- and not where
     he expected.


     INT. CARGO HOLD - DAY

     Blades of sunlight stream in through cracks in the hull. Paris
     enters to find Shazza and Audrey cutting open containers,
     searching for usable goods.

                              PARIS
               Tell me that was you.

                              AUDREY
               Okay, it was me. What'd I do now?

                              PARIS
               Assailing my fragile sense of security,
               that's what.

                              SHAZZA
               What're you goin' on about? She's been
               right here for the last....

     They all see it: Sun-blades are momentarily blocked by something
     passing outside. Someone.

                              SHAZZA
                         (a quiet probe)
               Zeke?

     No answer. Audrey springs to the other side of hold, puts an eye
     to a crack there.

     HULL-CRACK POV: Far away, Zeke finishes digging the grave. He
     starts toward the ship.

     Audrey whirls back, mouths a silent alarm: "RIDDICK!"

     Paris goes bloodless. Shazza grabs the war-pick out of his
     frozen hands, moves catlike to the main doors and poises there,
     ready to strike. Audrey follows with the hunting boomerang.
     All eyes watch as...

     The sun-blades, winking off and on, chart Riddick's approach:
     We feel like we're inside a magician's sword box, watching the
     blades shave closer and closer to us. Suddenly he appears...

     And Shazza swings hard.

                              AUDREY
               No!

     Facing them is a TOTAL STRANGER -- burned, half naked, one hand
     still clutching the emergency-release lever of his cryo-locker.
     Shazza stopped one inch short of killing him.

                              TOTAL STRANGER
               I thought...my God, I thought I was the
               only one who....

     He lurches toward Shazza, trying to embrace her -- and sees blood
     and brain-bits BLAM-BLAMMING against her. His own. The stranger
     sinks bonelessly to the ground. FAST RACK to reveal Zeke in the
     background, pistol leveled. He reads Shazza's horrified face --
     and understands what he's done.

                              PARIS
               Oh, Lord....

                              AUDREY
               It was just somebody else. From the
               crash. He was just....

                              ZEKE
               Cripes galore, I thought it was him. The
               murderin' ratbag. I thought he was....

     He rushes over to check the dead stranger. As he bends down,
     FAST RACK AGAIN to reveal Riddick in the background. He stands
     20 paces off, still unseen by the others. His goggle eyes
     covet...

     Zeke's breather.


     EXT. SKIFF - DAY

     Fry exits the skiff.

                              FRY
               No juice, looks like it's been laid up
               for years. But we might be able to
               adapt --

                              JOHNS
               Shut up.

     Outside, Johns has an ear cocked to the wind.

                              JOHNS (CONT'D)
               Sorry. Thought I heard something.

                              FRY
               Like what?

                              JOHNS
               Like my pistola.


     EXT. GRAVE SITE - SPIRED HILLS - DAY

     START on the drag-sled carrying Corpse #4-- the stranger.

     Zeke reaches the grave. The sun-tarp has fallen on one side,
     blocking the sight-line between ship and grave. Zeke starts to
     unload the body -- but sees something he didn't notice before:
     There's some kind of opening at the bottom of the grave.

                              ZEKE
               Now what the bloody hell....

     Zeke hops down into the grave. CAMERA MOVES to reveal Riddick
     hidden among the spires. He's been waiting for a chance just
     like this.


     EXT. GRAVE - DAY

     Zeke drops to all fours. Looks into the tunnel. There seems to
     be some kind of burrow beyond.

     BURROW POV: Staring back at Zeke.

     Zeke takes a handlight off his belt, shines it into the burrow.
     It's the last thing he ever does.


     INT./EXT. CRASH SHIP - DAY

     As MORE GUNSHOTS jar Paris, Audrey, Shazza.


     EXT. GRAVE - DAY

     FURIOUS CLOSEUPS: Zeke fighting for his life. PISTOL BLASTING.
     Something slashing at him. Blood dancing on air.


     EXT. CRASH SHIP - DAY

     Shazza sprints across hard-pack, heading for...


     EXT. GRAVE SITE - SPIRED HILLS - DAY

     The grave. She slaps aside the tarp to find...

     Riddick. Bone-shiv in hand, he just stands on the other side of
     the grave. Shazza looks down. And SCREAMS.


     EXT. SPIRED HILLS - DAY

     CAMERA PURSUES Riddick as he lopes through the spires, running
     from the scene of the crime. He turns a blind corner -- and
     SOMETHING NEARLY BLOWS HIS HEAD OFF at close range. He hits
     ground. A boot steps on his neck, keeping him there.

                              JOHNS
               Same crap, different planet, huh?


     EXT. SETTLEMENT - DAY

     Sucking on their breathers, Fry and the Chrislams make it back to
     the ship. They find Johns beating Riddick like a chained dog.

                              JOHNS
               ...I don't play that...I don't play that
               so just try again. C'mon, Riddick, tell
               me a better lie....

                              FRY
               Ease up, ease up. JOHNS! Just tell me
               what....

     She hauls him off -- only to have Shazza start punching Riddick.

                              SHAZZA
               What'd you do with 'im? You bloody sick
               animal you, what'dja do with me Zeke?


     EXT. GRAVE SITE - SPIRED HILLS - DAY

     Fry and Johns stand over the grave. It's a gory mess -- but no
     sign of Zeke. Johns has Riddick's confiscated shiv.

                              FRY
               He used that?

                              JOHNS
               Sir Shiv-a-lot. He likes to cut.

                              FRY
               So why isn't it all bloody?

                              JOHNS
               I assume he licked it clean.


     INT. MAIN CABIN - CRASH SHIP - DAY

     Riddick is back in chains, face pulpy from the beating, listening
     to SOTTO VOCE VOICES outside. Fry enters, looks at him hard.

                              FRY
               So where is he?

     Riddick turns away, revealing a broken goggle-lens. The eye
     beneath is closed: For some reason, he won't look at her.

                              FRY
               Tell me about the sounds. You told them
               you heard something right before....
                         (no response)
               If you don't talk to me, Johns'll take
               another crack at it -- at your skull.

                              RIDDICK
               'Mean the whispers?

                              FRY
               What whispers?

                              RIDDICK
               The ones tellin' me to go for the sweet
               spot -- just to the left of the spine,
               fourth lumbar down. The abdominal aorta.
               What a gusher. Had a cup on his belt,
               so I used it to catch a little run-off.
               Metallic taste to it, human blood.
               Coppery. But if you cut it with
               peppermint schnapps, that goes away.
               Course, that's more for winter.
               Summertime, I take mine straight.

     Fry stares. Riddick gets a black satisfaction from his role as
     Boogeyman: If fear is the only kind of respect he can get,
     Riddick is going to grab some with both hands.

                              FRY
               Why don't we try the truth now?

     A head-shaking beat, then:

                              RIDDICK
               All you people are so scared of me --
               an' most days, I'd take that as a
               compliment -- but it ain't me you gotta
               worry about now.

                              FRY
               Show me your eyes.

     Again he turns away. She strips the goggles off. He sits with
     lids shut tight, anticipating the pain.

                              FRY
               Show me, Riddick.

     Imagine a virgin undressing in front of someone for the first
     time. That's how Riddick opens his eyes, startling us: No
     irises, just huge black-pool pupils. And from deep within, a
     jewel-like eyeshine. His eyes are as beautiful and unsettling as
     those of a starved jaguar.

                              FRY
               You did this? To yourself?

                              RIDDICK
               Slam doctor. Well, we called him "doctor."

                              FRY
               Heard about it. Just never seen it.

                              RIDDICK
               Fairly fuckin' ironic, wouldn't you say?
               Slamlight's so dim that you go and get
               your eyeballs taken out and shined up --
               then you wind up here. Three ass-kick
               suns.
                         (replacing goggles)
               Maybe I did do a few people. But not this
               one. No ma'am, not this time.

                              FRY
               Then where is he? He's not in the hole.
               We looked.

                              RIDDICK
               Look deeper.

     He CLICKS HIS TONGUE at her.


     EXT. CRASH SHIP - DAY

     Chain looped over one shoulder, Fry heads back to the grave site.
     Johns, Imam, Shazza, and Audrey keep pace as...

                              JOHNS
               I know what happened -- he went off on the
               guy, buried him on the hill somewhere, and
               now he's trying to --

                              FRY
               Let's just be sure.

                              JOHNS
               I am sure. Look, murders aside, Riddick
               belongs in the Asshole Hall of Fame. He
               loves the jaw-jackin', loves making you
               afraid, 'cuz that's all he has. And
               you're playing right into --

                              FRY
               We're gonna find the body, Johns. Christ,
               you're a cop. Why am I tellin' you this?
               We gotta go down and find it.

                              JOHNS
               Well, don't ask me to.

                              FRY
               Thought you didn't believe his story.

                              JOHNS
               I don't. But that ground looked none too
               stable, and I don't want anyone --

                              AUDREY
               If you're afraid, I'll go.

     He shoots Audrey a scowl.

                              FRY
               Nobody else is going down but me, okay?

                              JOHNS
                         (pulling her aside)
               Hey. Bein' ballsy with your life now
               doesn't change what came before -- it's
               just stupid.

                              FRY
               What, you think I'm doin' this to prove
               something?

                              JOHNS
               You said it, not me. Let's just not let
               one bad call lead to another.

                              FRY
               Thanks for the tip, Johns.

     "Now get outta my way."


     EXT. GRAVE - DAY

     Chain hooked to her web belt, Fry drops into the grave. She
     peers into the burrow...looks back up at the halo of faces above
     her...then slithers out of sight.


     INT. BURROW - DAY

     Letting her eyes adjust, Fry pats around lightly. Quickly she
     finds Zeke's handlight, tries it. Broken.


     EXT. GRAVE-SITE - SPIRED HILLS - DAY

     CLOSE on the chain slithering through hands, playing out as Fry
     moves deeper underground.


     INT. UPHILL TUNNEL - DAY

     Fry makes an uphill turn. Sees a spray of light ahead. Worms
     forward to reach...


     INT. THE LAIR - DAY

     Another chamber, wide and just large enough to stand in. Shafts
     of daylight bore down into the room. More old bones litter the
     floor. Fry moves into one shaft and looks up at...

     An earthen funnel. The inside of a spire.

                              FRY
               They're hollow....

     CLICK-CLICK.

     Fry slow-turns toward the sound.

     CLICK-CLICK-CLICK.

     There's something here, something just beyond the cusp of light.
     Something unfolding.

     An icy hand grips her heart. Soundlessly, Fry backtracks her
     chain, but...

     Something shadows across the exit. It stops her cold.

     Her hand finds something new. She angles it to the light. It's
     one of Zeke's boots -- with a bit of Zeke still in it.

     CLICKITY-CLICKITY-CLICKITY....

     The whole chamber is coming alive around her, shadows unfurling,
     skulking the perimeter, circling.

     Something impales the boot out of her hand, reclaiming it. It
     was faster than a lightning-strike.

     A paralyzed beat before...

     Fry makes her move, rolling back into the shaft of daylight and
     springing straight up into...


     INT. SPIRE - DAY

     The spire. Bracing against the walls, Fry tries to "walk" her
     way up -- but her chain goes taut. Did it catch on something?
     Or did something catch it? Fry starts pounding the earthen walls.

                              FRY
               Here! I'm in HERE, HERE, HERE!


     EXT. GRAVE-SITE - SPIRED HILLS - DAY

                              IMAM
               Did you hear....

     They drop down and suspend their heads over the bloody grave,
     listening. Nothing now.


     INT. SPIRE - DAY

                              FRY
               I'm over here in the --

     Something tugs on her chain.

                              FRY
               Oh, God....

     CLOSE on her feet. Kicking hard at the walls, trying to gouge
     out footholds.

     A stronger tug. Fry loses altitude, slipping closer to...

     The MADLY CLICKING LAIR below.

     She tries to jettison her belt -- but can't brace herself up and
     undo the belt. Suddenly...

     Something explodes near her head. Daylight appears, followed by
     faces, human faces. They're breaking through the spire with the
     pick-ax. Hands reach inside...


     EXT. SPIRED HILLS - DAY

     ...and birth her into daylight. Overlapping:

                              JOHNS
               We got you...it's okay, it's okay...we got
               you now....

                              IMAM
               The child heard you before any of us could
               even....

                              SHAZZA
               Did you find him? You find Zeke?

                              FRY
                         (half insane)
               ...wasn't Riddick...it was...it was...
               goddamn, that was stupid....but wasn't
               Riddick. Somethin' else down there that
               got Zeke and nearly got --

     Her. She flies back into the spire. Something's still got the
     chain.

     The others grab at flailing limbs. It's a tug-of-war now, human
     hands on one end, unseen "hands" on the other -- and the humans
     are losing. Until...

     Imam unsheathes his blade...

     And slices through Fry's belt.


     INT. SPIRE - DAY

     As the chain falls down the spire. Without Fry.


     INT./EXT. CRASH SHIP - DAY

     FAST SHOTS: Survivors packing up O2, liquor, umbrellas, the
     Koran -- whatever qualifies as "essential" on this planet. Amid
     the activity, Audrey pauses to look at...

     The spired hills.


     INT. BATTERY BAY - CRASH SHIP - DAY

     Fry and Imam pull a power cell from the ship's battery bay,
     THUMPING it down on the deck.

                              IMAM
               One is all?

                              FRY
               For now.


     INT. CARGO HOLD - DAY

     At his personal locker, Johns digs out a box of shotgun shells.
     He bypasses the blue-metal shells for a red-metal one. There's
     something special about it -- though what, we can't be sure.


     INT. MAIN CABIN - CRASH SHIP - DAY

     A shadow falls over Riddick. He doesn't look up.

                              RIDDICK
               Found somethin' worse than me, huh?

                              JOHNS
               We're movin'. And I'm just wondering if
               I shouldn't lighten the load right now.

     Now their eyes meet. Johns RATCHETS HIS SHOTGUN and points it
     at Riddick's head.

                              RIDDICK
               Woof, woof.

     The SHOTGUN EXPLODES. CAMERA PANS off of Johns to show
     Riddick still alive. The shotgun discharged next to his head and
     blew off his wrist chains.

                              JOHNS
               Want you to remember this moment, Riddick.
               The way it coulda gone and didn't.

                              RIDDICK
                         (deaf)
               Say that again.

                              JOHNS
               Here's the deal. You work without the
               chains, without the bit -- without the
               shivs. You help us get off this rock....

                              RIDDICK
               For what? The honor of goin' back to some
               asshole of a cell?

                              JOHNS
               Truth is, Riddick, I'm tired of this
               head-up shit. I wanna be free of you as
               much as you wanna be free of me.

     A beat. The future rearranges in Riddick's head.

                              RIDDICK
               You'd cut me loose, Boss?

                              JOHNS
               Only if we both get outta this alive.
               And there may be a way.

     He offers a hand to help Riddick up, to seal the deal.

                              RIDDICK
                         (staring at hand)
               My recommendation: Do me. Don't take
               the chance that I'll get shiv-happy on
               your wannabe ass. Ghost me, Riddick.
               Would if I were you.

                              JOHNS
               If you were me, I'd kill us both. C'mon,
               you wanna sit at the grown-up table or not?

     A beat. Riddick reaches out for the hand -- and grabs the
     shotgun with his off-hand. A blur of movement. Suddenly Johns
     is staring at the eyes of his own shotgun.

                              RIDDICK
               Want you to remember this moment.

     He pumps shotgun, spitting blue shells over Johns. He drops the
     emptied gun and walks away.


     EXT. PLANET - DAY

     EXTREMELY WIDE: Blue sun setting, yellow and red sun rising.
     The survivors trek for the settlement. Fry and Imam lug the
     power cell between them, but the real load is shouldered by...

     Riddick. Promoted from murderous monster to beast of burden,
     he tows a drag-sled heavy with cargo.

                              PARIS
                         (to Johns)
               So just like that. Wave your little wand
               and he's one of us now.

                              JOHNS
               Didn't say that. But least this way I
               don't have to worry about falling asleep
               and not wakin' up.

                              IMAM
               Well, I feel we owe Mr. Riddick amends.

                              SHAZZA
               Oh, right. Let's all line up and beg his
               forgiveness. Right you are.

                              IMAM
               At least give the man some oxygen....

                              JOHNS
               He's happy just bein' vertical. Leave him
               be.

                              AUDREY
               So I can talk to him now?

                              JOHNS/SHAZZA
                         (in unison)
               No.

     Paris drops a wine bottle. Trailing, Riddick collects it.

                              PARIS
               Paris P. Ogilvie. Antiquities dealer,
               entrepreneur.

                              RIDDICK
                         (shaking hands)
               Richard B. Riddick. Escaped convict,
               murderer.

     Instead of returning the bottle, Riddick opens it and drinks.
     Paris hurries to catch up to the others.

                              PARIS
               You know, if I owned Hell and this
               planet...I believe I'd rent this out and
               live in Hell.


     EXT. THE GAUNTLET - DAY

     FRY'S POV: Of spires high above us.

     The group falls silent as they transit the canyon, all eyes on
     the spires. Fry stops short, hearing...

     CLICKITY-CLICK.

     Neck hairs rise -- but soon the sound vanishes. The group starts
     moving again, faster.

     CLICKITY-CLICKITY-CLICK.

     Are they being stalked? Nervously, Fry traces the sound back
     to...

     Beads dangling from the belt of Pilgrim #1. Whenever he moves,
     the STRINGS CLACK together.


     EXT. SKIFF - DAY

                              PARIS
               I mean, usually I can appreciate antiques,
               but, uh....

     The survivors have reached the settlement. Fry is trying to get
     the power cell aboard the skiff as the others walk its exterior.

                              JOHNS
               Little ratty-ass.

                              FRY
               Nothing we can't repair -- so long as the
               electrical adapts.

                              SHAZZA
               Not a star-jumper.

                              RIDDICK
               Doesn't need to be. Use this to get back
               up to the Sol-Track Shipping Lanes, stick
               out a thumb. You'll get picked up.
                         (to Fry)
               Right?

     Fry looks from Riddick to Johns. "How did he know that?"

                              FRY
               Little help here?

     They muscle the power cell aboard. Riddick starts to follow, but
     Johns blocks. He doesn't want Riddick inside.

                              JOHNS
               Check those containers for me. See what
               we can patch wings with.


     EXT. SETTLEMENT - DAY

     With religious fervor, the Chrislams are repairing the moisture-
     recovery unit -- the machine Allah led them to.


     INT. SKIFF - DAY

     START on the battery bay. Hands are adapting the power cell to
     the skiffs older electrical system. Soon...

     Lights wink on throughout the ship.

                              FRY
               Okay, that should buy us a sys-check.
               But we'll need more cells.

                              JOHNS
               How many?

                              FRY
               15 6-gigs here...90 gigs total...other
               ship carries 20-gig cells, so...five.
               Five total to launch.

                              JOHNS
               25 kilos each, huh?

                              SHAZZA
               Old sand-cat outside. See if I can't get
               it up and chuggin'.

                              JOHNS
               Do it. And if you need an extra hand,
               tap our problem child out....
                         (looking out)
               Where's Riddick?


     EXT. SETTLEMENT - DAY

     He's walking the ghost town, finding dead gardens...upended
     chairs and furniture...broken skylights. Behind his back...

     Audrey and Pilgrim #3 (the youngest Chrislam) scurry through
     FRAME, stalking this curious monster in their midst.


     EXT. MOISTURE-RECOVERY UNIT - SETTLEMENT - DAY

     CLOSE on the other Chrislams, faces charged with anticipation
     while awaiting...

     The first drop of water. It appears at the bottom of a pipette.

     Tongues fight for it. Another drop forms in its place. Now
     another and another. It brings CHEERS.


     INT. MAIN ROOM - SETTLEMENT - DAY

     CLOSE on Paris' hands. Getting ready to celebrate, he unwraps
     crystal goblets...dusts off the refectory table...and rehangs an
     old Christmas garland. INTERCUT WITH...


     EXT. CORING ROOM - SETTLEMENT - DAY

     Hands digging in dirt.

     Covertly, Audrey and Pilgrim #3 watch Riddick digging near the
     entrance of a tall windowless structure.

     He excavates a pair of broken eyeglasses... a shattered light...
     and a child's tin robot, timeless. Riddick thumbs a solar panel
     clean. The robot's language program warbles to life:

                              ROBOT
               "...to all intruders. I am the guardian
               of this land. I will protect my masters
               at all cost. Death to all intruders..."

     Riddick stands and tries the doors. Locked. He peers through a
     small filthy window. Is there something moving inside? Nothing
     now. Riddick removes some windblown trash from a doorside sign.
     "Coring Room."

                              JOHNS (O.S.)
               Missin' the party. C'mon.

     It's Johns, keeping him on a short leash. Leaving, Riddick kicks
     a trash bin. Hard.

                              RIDDICK
               Missin' the party. C'mon.

     He leaves. HOLD on the trash bin a beat.


                              AUDREY (O.S.)
               Talkin' to me?


     INT. CORING ROOM - DAY

     PILGRIM'S POV: Of Audrey exiting the trash bin and running after
     Riddick and Johns.

     Pilgrim #3 is at the window of the coring room. He's found a way
     inside. By the window's feeble light, he starts exploring. Just
     visible at the center of this room is a vertical coring drill.


     INT. MAIN ROOM - SETTLEMENT - DAY

                              IMAM
               ...and for this, our gift of drink, we
               give thanks in the name of our Prophet,
               Muhammad, peace be upon him, and to our
               Lord, Jesus Christ of Nazareth, and to his
               father, Allah the Compassionate and the
               Merciful.

                              PARIS
                         (to himself)
               The strangest religion....

     Pilgrims finish pouring cloudy water into goblets. Riddick gets
     the last of it -- the part with sediment. SELECTED CLOSEUPS as
     they drink. Nothing ever tasted finer.

                              PARIS
               Perhaps we should toast our hosts. Who
               were these people, anyway? Miners?

                              SHAZZA
               Looks like geologists. Advance team,
               moves around from rock to rock.

                              JOHNS
               Musta crapped out here, huh?

                              AUDREY
               But why did they leave their ship?

     Silence. It's a question no one has chosen to deal with yet.
     Imam notices one water glass unspoken for.


     EXT. CORING ROOM - DAY

     CLOSE on the "Coring Room" sign. An attached solar panel begins
     moving, orienting toward sunlight. When it catches the full
     brunt of the suns' rays...

     STORM SHUTTERS unlatch on the roof.


     INT. CORING ROOM - DAY

     Pilgrim #3 hears SHOOTING LATCHES overhead. That sound brings
     another sound: A strange SKITTERING. The pilgrim looks up. Is
     there something in the rafters?


     INT. MAIN ROOM - SETTLEMENT - DAY

                              JOHNS
                         (answering Audrey)
               Well, just a skiff. Disposable, really.

                              PARIS
               Like an emergency life-raft, right?

                              SHAZZA
               Sure. Coulda had a real drop-ship take
               them off-planet. Long gone.

                              PARIS
               A toast to their ghosts, then....

     Goblets rise.

                              RIDDICK
               Didn't leave, these people. Whatever got
               Zeke got them. They're all dead.

     It's like he just pissed in the punchbowl.

                              RIDDICK (CONT'D)
               What, you don't really think they left
               with their clothes on the lines? Photos
               on the walls?

                              SHAZZA
               Maybe they had weight limits, you don't
               know.

                              RIDDICK
               I know you don't uncrate your emergency
               ship unless there's a fucking emergency.

                              JOHNS
               Rag it, Riddick. Nobody wants your
               theories on --

                              FRY
                         (to Riddick)
               So what happened? Where are they, then?

     Fry is the only one willing to look at reality -- or at least
     glance its way. At the window, Imam scans outside.

                              IMAM
               Has anyone seen the young one? Ali?

                              RIDDICK
                         (to Fry and Imam)
               Has anyone checked the coring room?


     INT. CORING ROOM - DAY

     Now the storm shutters start yawning open, spreading daylight
     over Pilgrim #3 and...

     The ceiling rafters. They're encrusted with thick nests of...
     something. The SKITTERING grows louder, more agitated.

     Sensing trouble, Pilgrim #3 hurries for a sliver of daylight in
     a wall -- the breach he entered through. He never gets there:

     Sunlight hits the first nest. It EXPLODES WITH LIFE.


     INT./EXT. MAIN ROOM - SETTLEMENT - DAY

     As Imam hears the SCREAM.

                              IMAM
               Ali....


     INT. CORING ROOM - DAY

     CHAOTIC SHOTS: More NESTS EXPLODE into individual creatures,
     winged hatchlings moving like bats in a fire, talons hacking and
     slashing. His exit blocked, Pilgrim #3 veers into...

     A dark supply room. He slams the door, MUMBLES A BLESSING and
     waits for the storm to pass. He's been cut -- but at least he's
     still alive.


     EXT. SETTLEMENT - DAY

     As the survivors run for the coring room.


     INT. MAIN ROOM - SETTLEMENT - DAY

     As Riddick stays behind to drink their water.


     INT. CORING ROOM - DAY

     HINGES ARE BLASTED AWAY. The door caves in. Imam shoulders
     past Johns to enter and find...

     The empty coring room.

                              IMAM
               Ali?

     A NOISE from the supply room. Is it Ali? Just too scared to
     come out? Imam opens the door...

     And hatchlings pour out.

     Moving with a gang-intelligence, they circle the room in a wave,
     soar high into the rafters -- then plunge into the coring shaft,
     SQUEALS VANISHING to infinity. Shocked silence, then...

     Pilgrim #3 tumbles to the ground. He's been shredded into bloody
     kite-tails. There was a nest inside the supply room.

     Imam falls on him in grief. Johns and Fry inch forward to peer
     down...

     The coring shaft. It's littered with human bones. The skeletons
     of the settlers. Scattered about and picked clean.


     EXT. SETTLEMENT - DAY

     Against a blue sunrise, the Chrislams hold a prayer service.
     Paris and Audrey attend. Riddick watches from afar.


     INT. CORING ROOM - DAY

                              SHAZZA
               Why was the door chained up? Why the
               bloody hell would they lock themselves in
               like that?

                              JOHNS
               Not sure, but tell you what: Chrislams
               better not be diggin' another grave out
               there.

                              RIDDICK (O.S.)
               Other buildings weren't secure...

     They turn. Riddick enters.

                              RIDDICK (CONT'D)
               ...so they ran here. Heaviest doors.
               Thought they'd be safe inside, but...
                         (looks down shaft)
               Someone forget to lock the back door.

     Shazza joins him at the shaft. Gazing on the human remains:

                              SHAZZA
               So that's what come of me Zeke. An' you
               saw it. You was right there.

     Riddick nods.

                              SHAZZA (CONT'D)
               You were tryin' to kill him too.

                              RIDDICK
                         (shrugging, "not
                          necessarily")
               Just wanted his O-2.
                         (a beat)
               Though I notice he tried to ghost my ass.
               When he shot up that stranger instead.

     Shazza can't deny it. She looks at him differently now, the man
     she once beat while in chains. She takes off her breather.

                              SHAZZA
               Take it.

                              RIDDICK
                         (suspicious)
               What, it's broken?

                              SHAZZA
               Startin' to acclimate, anyhow. Take it.

     Riddick accepts it awkwardly, sucks down some pure O2. Johns
     watches the exchange closely, not much liking the idea of Riddick
     being promoted to oxygen-breathing human.

                              JOHNS
                         (to Fry)
               Let's board this up and get the hell gone.
               They seem to stick to the dark, so if we
               stick to daylight, should be all --

                              FRY
               60 years ago.

                              JOHNS
               Wha'?

     Coring samples line the room, laid out on counters. Fry's been
     scrutinizing them.

                              FRY
               Core-samples are dated. Last one is 60
               years ago. This month.

                              SHAZZA
               Yeah? What's special about that?

                              FRY
               Dunno. Maybe nothing, but....

     But now Fry remembers...


     INT. LIVING QUARTERS - SETTLEMENT - DAY

     The orrery. The year-counter clicks over to "45" as...

     Fry opens the drive box and starts turning the main gear,
     accelerating the orbits.

     CLOSE on the counter. "56...57...58...59...60."

     They all see it: A giant ringed world eclipses the suns and
     plunges their planet into darkness. Persistent darkness.

                              JOHNS
               Are you fuckin' kidding me?

                              RIDDICK
               Not afraid of the dark, are you?


     EXT. SETTLEMENT - DAY

     Crossing the yard in wide strides:

                              FRY
               ...need those cells from the crash ship.
               Shit, still gotta check out the hull,
               patch the wings --

                              JOHNS
               Let's wait on the power cells.

                              FRY
               Wait for what? Until it's so dark we
               can't even find our way back to --

                              JOHNS
               We're not sure when it happens, so let's
               not --

                              FRY
               Get the fucking cells over here, Johns.
               What's the discussion?

     A beat.

                              JOHNS
               Ever tell you how Riddick escaped?


     INT. SKIFF - DAY

     Alone inside the skiff, Johns and Fry continue with more privacy.

                              FRY
                         (jarred)
               He can pilot?

                              JOHNS
               Hijacked a prison transport, made a
               helluva good run 'fore I tracked him down.

                              FRY
                         (with faint hope)
               Okay, maybe that's a good thing. Maybe I
               can use him to help with --

                              JOHNS
               He also figured out how to kill the pilot,
               Fry.

     A mental shiver.

                              FRY
               You said we were going to trust him now.
               You said there was a deal.

                              JOHNS
               That's what I said.

     He challenges her to read his mind.

                              FRY
               Oh, this is a dangerous game you're
               playing, Johns.

                              JOHNS
               May've noticed chains don't work on this
               guy. Only way we're truly safe is if he
               believes he's goin' free. But if he stops
               believin' --

                              FRY
               You mean, if he learns that you're gonna
               royally fuck him over.

                              JOHNS (CONT'D)
               -- we need a fail-safe. Bring the cells
               over at the last possible minute -- when
               the wings are ready, when we know we're
               ready to launch.

     Fry looks at him with new eyes.

                              FRY
               You know, he hasn't harmed any of us.
               Far as I can tell, he hasn't even lied
               to us. Just stick to the deal, Johns.
               Let him go if that's what it --

                              JOHNS
               He's a murderer. The law says he's gotta
               do his bid.

     Shaking her head, she looks off.

                              FRY
               Dancin' on razor blades here...

                              JOHNS
               I won't give him a chance to grab another
               ship -- or to slash another pilot's throat.


     EXT. SKIFF - SETTLEMENT - DAY

     Johns descends the gangway -- and finds Riddick erecting a field
     table in the shade of the skiff. He seems out of earshot. Now,
     anyway. As they trade looks, another flu-like shiver runs
     through Johns.

                              RIDDICK
               Bad sign. Shakin' like that in this heat.

     Johns moves on. The Chrislams appear, shouldering a roll of
     Vectran (wing-fabric material). They drop it on the table.
     Ready to cut bindings, Imam pats his hip for the knife that was
     just there.

                              RIDDICK
                         (looking after Johns)
               I'll cut.

     He has the knife.


     EXT. SETTLEMENT - DAY

     As Shazza and Audrey repair the sand-cat.


     EXT. SKIFF - DAY

     CLOSE on the knife slicing through the Vectran.

     Riddick hands the trim to Pilgrim #1. CAMERA FOLLOWS as he
     scampers onto the skiff...balance-beams over wing-struts...and
     delivers the piece to Imam, who stitches the fabric like an old
     Berber rug-weaver. Pilgrim #1 pauses to check on...

     The setting blue sun. Nothing unusual. Yet.


     INT. SKIFF - DAY

     The hatch closes, seals.

     CLOSE on a monitor. A "HULL INTEGRITY TEST" is underway. Fry
     scans rising pressure gauges.

                              RIDDICK (O.S.)
               Looks like we're a few shy....

     Fry whirls. Riddick is aboard, staring at the depleted battery
     bay. And he has Imam's blade.

                              RIDDICK (CONT'D)
               Power cells.

                              FRY
               They're coming.

                              RIDDICK
               Strange, not doin' a run-up on the main
               drive yet.
                         (half-beat)
               Strange unless he told you the particulars
               of my escape.

                              FRY
               I got the quick-and-ugly version.

                              RIDDICK
               An' now you're worried about a repeat of
               history?

                              FRY
               Entered our minds.

                              RIDDICK
               I asked what you thought.

                              FRY
               You scare me, Riddick. That's what you
               wanna hear, isn't it? There, I admit it,
               Can I get back to work now?

     She finds the courage to turn her back on him. Riddick moves
     closer -- and takes a beat to scan the controls. The cabin
     pressure builds.

                              RIDDICK
               Think Johns is an do-right man? You
               think I can trust him to cut me loose?

     A beat. Does Riddick already know? Is he testing her?

                              FRY
               Why, what'd you hear?

                              RIDDICK
               Well, guess if it was trickeration he'd
               just do me, huh? Then again...I am worth
               twice as much alive.
                         (reading her face)
               Didn't know? Johns ain't a cop. Oh, he's
               got that shiny badge an' all, but nah --
               he's just a merc and I'm just a payday.
               That's why he won't kill me. The creed is
               greed.

     It knocks her off stride, but...

                              FRY
               Save it, Riddick. We aren't gonna turn on
               each other -- no matter how hard you try.

     Riddick moves right up behind her.

                              RIDDICK
               I don't truly know what's gonna happen
               when the lights go out, Carolyn -- but I
               do know that once the dyin' starts, this
               little psycho family of ours is gonna rip
               itself apart. So you better find out the
               truth. Come nightfall, you better know
               exactly who's standing behind you.

     A monitor chirps the news: "HULL INTEGRITY --100%." EXHALING
     GASSES, the hatch opens automatically.

                              RIDDICK
               Oh, ask him 'bout those shakes. And ask
               why your crew-pal had to scream like that
               'fore he died.


     INT. PRIVATE ROOM - SETTLEMENT - DAY

     CLOSEUPS: Hands select a red-metal shotgun shell from a box...
     pull the shell open...remove a glass ampule hidden inside...drop
     the ampule into a injection syringe. The syringe touches an
     eager arm vein.

                              FRY (O.S.)
               Who are you? Really?

     Shirt off, Johns looks up. She's in the doorway.

                              FRY (CONT'D)
               You're not a real cop, are you? Just some
               mercenary who goes around talkin' about
               the law like --

                              JOHNS
               I never said I was.

                              FRY
               Never said you were a hype, either.

     She moves closer. Rummages through his stuff brazenly. Finds a
     shitload of red shells with the hidden ampules.

                              JOHNS
               You have a little caffeine in the morning,
               I have a little morphine. So what?

                              FRY
               And here you got two mornings every day.
               Wow, were you born lucky?

                              JOHNS
               Not a problem unless you're gonna make --

                              FRY
                         (lashing)
               You made it a problem when you let Owens
               die like that. When you had enough drugs
               to knock out a fucking mule-team.

                              JOHNS
               Owens was already dead. His brain just
               hadn't caught on to that fact.

                              FRY
               Anything else we should know about you,
               Johns? Christ, here I am lettin' you play
               games with our lives when --

     He catches her hands -- and moves them around his body, forcing
     her into an embrace. We understand why when we see a CLOSEUP
     of her hands: They find a jagged purple scar beside his spine.

                              JOHNS
               My first run-in with Riddick. Went for
               the sweet-spot and missed. They had to
               leave a piece of the shiv in there. I can
               feel it, sometimes, pressing against the
               cord.
                         (giving her hands back)
               So maybe the care and feeding of my
               nerve-endings is my business.

                              FRY
               You coulda helped. And you didn't.

     O.S., we hear the Chrislams JABBERING ARABIC and calling for
     "Captain, Captain...."

                              JOHNS
               Yeah, well, look to thine own ass first.
               Right, "captain"?

     It cuts deep.


     EXT. SETTLEMENT - DAY

     Fry and Johns move outside. The others have gathered, all eyes
     gang-locked on...

     An arch in the sky. Luminous, ominous, it grows from the horizon.

                              PARIS
               What do my eyes see?

                              FRY
               It's starting....

     They watch hypnotically as the arch rises, inching toward the two
     suns. Shazza shakes out of the trance first.

                              SHAZZA
                         (to Fry)
               If we need anything from the crash ship --
               I suggest we kick on. That sand-cat's
               solar.


     EXT. SETTLEMENT - DAY

     MULTIPLE SHOTS: Shazza cranking the sand-cat...hands snatching
     up lights, water, ropes...Chrislams piling aboard the sand-cat.

                              FRY
               LET'S GET THOSE CELLS!

     Sand-cat moving...Riddick jumping onto the rear bed....Paris and
     Audrey running, catching up.

                              SHAZZA
               We stay together! C'mon!


     INT. PRIVATE ROOM - SETTLEMENT - DAY

     Johns doubles back, grabs his shotgun shells, swings out the
     door...


     EXT. INCINERATOR - SETTLEMENT - DAY

     ...and catches up to the sand-cat. Riddick reels him aboard.

                              RIDDICK
               Don't wanna miss this.

                              AUDREY
               Lookit. Lookit!

     They turn back to see the rim of a giant planet. It's cresting
     over the horizon. The luminous arch is the planet's rings.


     EXT. RIBCAGE - THE GAUNTLET - DAY

     The sand-cat storms through the canyon. As it passes through the
     massive ribcage...

     The ROLL CAGE SMASHES OUT some low-bridge bones.


     EXT. CRASH SHIP - DAY

     The sand-cat reaches the crash ship. Bodies leap off. Paris
     steals a look at...

     The rising planet. It threatens to blot out suns, sky, universe.


     INT. BATTERY BAY - CRASH SHIP - DAY

     Johns yanks the first power cell and starts dragging it over the
     deck. Riddick yanks a second cell and, carrying it on his
     shoulder, passes Johns with a suck-my-ass grin. Johns shoulders
     his cell and stumbles after.


     EXT. CRASH SHIP - DAY

     Shazza wheels the sand-cat around, getting clearance between it
     and the ship.

     The Chrislams lash a scrap-metal sled to the sand-cat.

     Riddick drops the first cell onto the sled, Johns the second.
     They're racing the eclipse and each other.


     EXT. SKY - DAY TO DUSK

     As the rings of the planet eclipse the yellow sun.


     EXT. CRASH SHIP - DUSK

     It's like God just closed a blind: Daylight dims. The change in
     light brings a GROWING HIGH-PITCHED SOUND.

                              FRY
               Don't stop, don't stop....

     But Paris can't help himself. He squints to see...


     EXT. SPIRED HILLS - DUSK

     The spires. THE SOUND seems to come from there.


     EXT. SKY - DUSK

     As the rings eclipse the red sun.


     EXT. CRASH SHIP - DEEP DUSK

     A second darkness sweeps over the survivors. Now they all stop,
     beholding...


     EXT. SPIRED HILLS - DEEP DUSK

     Something pouring from the spire-tops. Backlit by coronal light,
     it first seems to be smoke or ash -- but soon we realize these
     are living things, HATCHLINGS SQUEALING IN DELIGHT over their
     first nightfall.


     EXT. CRASH SHIP - DEEP DUSK

                              JOHNS
               Jesus, how many can there....

     They keep coming, filling the sky with thick waves. Mercifully,
     the hatchlings seem to be moving away. But now one wave cleaves
     from another -- and does a quick about-face.

                              PARIS
               Just a suggestion, but perhaps we should
               flee.

                              FRY
               Cargo hold, everyone in the cargo hold.
               lesgo, lesgo, lesgo.

     They run. Reach the cargo hold. Turn back to see...

     Riddick and Shazza still coming. Hearing the SQUEALING WAVE
     descending on them...

     Riddick and Shazza hit to the dirt. Hatchlings torrent just
     inches overhead.

     CLOSE on Shazza. Horrified. Hard to breathe. Like being
     underwater.

     CLOSE on Riddick. He watches in awe, no more frightened that a
     kid lying on his back looking up at the stars. Experimenting, he
     eases a bone-shiv into the hatchlings. Instantly it's whittled
     down to nothing. It's like a river of razor blades.

     The hatchling keep coming. Shazza whips a panicky look at the
     cargo hold. Can she make it? Should she even try?

                              AUDREY
               Tell her to stay there. Stay down.
               SHAZZA, JUST STAY DOWN!

     Shazza starts worming toward the cargo hold. Suddenly the
     hatchings vanish. A beat. Is it safe? Shazza gets to her
     feet...

                              FRY
               No, no, NO, NO, NO....

     ...and the wave is back, enveloping Shazza.


     INT./EXT. CARGO HOLD - DEEP DUSK

     Standing in the mouth of the cargo container, the others get a
     last glimpse of Shazza as she flies by the doors, caught up in
     the funnel-cloud of hatchlings. Then she's simply gone.


     EXT. CRASH SHIP - DEEP DUSK

     Still on the ground, Riddick checks left and right like someone
     about to cross a busy street. Now he gets up, smacks his hands
     clean, strolls for the hold. Behind him...

     A rising GANG-CLICKING.

     CLOSE on Fry. She knows the sound better than anyone.


     EXT. SPIRED HILLS - DEEP DUSK

     The spires are crumbling, torn down from within.


     EXT. CRASH SHIP - DEEP DUSK

     Reaching the cargo hold, Riddick turns around for one last look.
     PUSH IN as he sheds goggles -- and looks at the world with his
     jaguar eyes.

     RIDDICK'S POV: In degraded image, we see the predators -- adult
     hatchlings -- emerge from the spires. They're large, mammalian,
     hammer-headed. They CLICK with echo-location, sounding out the
     world they haven't inhabited in 60 years.

                              FRY
               What is it? What's happening?

     RIDDICK'S POV: The predators launch from the hills, gliding,
     SOUNDING, searching.

                              RIDDICK
               Like I said. Ain't me you gotta worry
               about.


     EXT. SKY - DEEP DUSK TO NIGHT

     The rim of the planet overtakes both suns. The world goes dark.


     INT. CARGO HOLD - NIGHT

     Vault-like DOORS BOOM CLOSED.

     The survivors are locked inside the only secure part of the ship.
     Somehow they've been reduced to neanderthals huddling in their
     cave, listening to the howls of the sabertooths.

                              AUDREY
               What if...what if she's still out there...
               still alive....

                              JOHNS
               Well, I don't want to jump to conclusions
               here...but 'member that boneyard? These
               just might be the fuckers that killed
               every other living thing on this planet,
               okay? Chances of Shazza knockin' on that
               door anytime soon are just about zero
               squared.

                              FRY
                         (agreeing)
               I saw the cut-marks on the bones. Wasn't
               a natural die-off.

                              IMAM
               Quiet, please. Everyone.

     Imam is listening at the cargo door. The others pile up
     alongside, ears tuned like radar. CLICKING SWEEPS PAST outside.

                              AUDREY
                         (whispering)
               Why do they do that? Make that sound?

                              IMAM
               Perhaps the way they see. With sound,
               reflecting back.

                              FRY
                         (realizing)
               Echo-location. That's what it is....

     Now MORE CLICKING -- behind them. Lights whip around to find...

     Nothing. Only the door of an open container about halfway down
     the tunnel-like hold.

     A volley of looks. "How the fuck could one get in here?"

                              FRY
               Breach in the hull. I dunno.

     More CLICKING. Johns realizes they expect him to check it out.

                              JOHNS
               I'd rather piss glass.

                              RIDDICK
               Well, you got the big gauge.

                              JOHNS
               Wanna rag your fat mouth?

                              AUDREY
               Maybe it's just their beads again. Imam,
               are you still --

                              IMAM
               No, no, no, I do not believe --

                              JOHNS
               C'mon, man, you're drivin' everybody
               bugfuck with those things. Why don't you
               just lose the goddamn....

     More CLICKING -- along with the sound of TOPPLING CARGO.

                              RIDDICK
               Big beads.

     Butching up, Johns sucks on his breather and shimmies toward...

     The open container. Leading with his shotgun, he FIRES blindly
     around the door. Something SQUEALS -- then silence. Johns eases
     his head and a light around the door to spot...

     Hatchlings on the ground, blasted into dog food.

                              JOHNS
                         (to others)
               Okay. We're okay. Just some small ones
               that musta --

     Something WHOOSHES for his head, swinging like a scythe. It
     catches his shotgun, DISCHARGING IT, giving us...

     A flash-image of an adult predator. Up close.

     In one thin second, Johns is back with the others.

                              JOHNS
               Very big beads.

                              PARIS
               Not staying in here another....

     He goes for the main-door lever, ready to flee into the night.
     Fry lunges for him.

                              FRY
               Christ, you don't know what's out there!

                              PARIS
               I know what's in here!

                              IMAM
               Everybody come, this way and we should be
               safe. Hurry, please....


     INT. FIRST CONTAINER - CARGO HOLD - NIGHT

     Imam shepherds them into a container. The door slams closed.
     At first, only the sound of MOUTHS SUCKING BREATHERS. Then a
     SCRATCHING.

     Johns fumbles with a cutting torch. Gets it burning. Adjusts
     the gasses to illuminate...

     The door. Scythe-like blades are probing joints. Suddenly HEAVY
     BLOWS drive everyone back.

                              RIDDICK
                         (to Johns)
               Can you do sumpin' else with that?
               'Sides holding it in my fucking face?

     Taking the hint, Johns starts cutting the common wall between
     containers. It's a race between the sparks of his cutter and the
     blades of the predators.


     INT. SECOND CONTAINER - CARGO HOLD - NIGHT

     An burn-outline appears in the common wall. Johns kicks out the
     escape hatch. Audrey speed-crawls through first as...


     INT. FIRST CONTAINER - CARGO HOLD - NIGHT

     Predators shred into the container right behind them, CLICKING,
     sweeping, hunting.


     INT. THIRD/FOURTH CONTAINERS - CARGO HOLD - NIGHT

     SERIES OF SHOTS: Again and again, they burn a new escape hatch
     just as the predators break into the container being vacated,
     always entering darkness.


     INT. FIFTH CONTAINER - CARGO HOLD - NIGHT

     Inside their fifth container now, Johns torches away. Fry and
     Paris use cargo to block the entrance hole -- then block the
     cargo with their bodies.

     Riddick adds his weight -- until he notices pepper-shot in the
     cargo. Suspecting the worst, he leaves the others behind...

                              PARIS
               Hello, hello?

     ...and moves to the front of the container where darkness
     prevails. Something SQUISHES underfoot. He slips off goggles.

     RIDDICK'S POV: Of dead hatchlings on the floor. This is the
     open container, the one where Johns found predators.

     Sensing energy, Riddick lifts his face.

     RIDDICK'S POV: Of an adolescent predator. It squats atop cargo,
     eating a hatchling. A heavy bone-blade crowns its skull.

     Sensing Riddick, it sweeps the area with INQUISITIVE CLICKS.

     PREDATOR POV: Of Riddick.

     (NOTE: The PREDATOR POV is a crude image that gives impression
     without detail. We're "seeing" what the predator hears with
     echo-location. Think of a sonagram that strobes and wraps its
     subject in 3-D space.)

     Oblivious, the others kick out the new escape hatch. Audrey,
     Fry, and Johns worm through. Imam and Pilgrim #2 hang back.
     "Where's Riddick?"

     He's in a stare-down with a predator.

     Searching, Pilgrim #2 rounds a corner -- and finds his head
     caught in a vice-like grip.

                              RIDDICK
               Don't. Move.

     RIDDICK'S POV: As a second predator appears above them. This
     one reaches down with its scythe blade...

     And gently probes the two men. It wants know what they're made
     of.

     CLOSE on the pilgrim's shoes. Over-running with piss.

     More blades descend, moving over them like surgical instruments.
     One test-slices Riddick's shirt.


     INT. SIXTH CONTAINER - CARGO HOLD - NIGHT

     In the next container, Fry waits anxiously. Hissing through the
     escape hatch:

                              FRY
               Imam? Where are they?


     INT. FIFTH CONTAINER - CARGO HOLD - NIGHT

     CLOSE on a predator's scythe blade. It test-slices the pilgrim's
     skin. Blood wells up. All CLICKING CEASES.

                              IMAM (O.S.)
               Hasan?

                              FRY (O.S.)
               Riddick?

     TIGHT on the pilgrim -- more scared now that the clicking has
     stopped. Losing his nerve, he bolts.

                              RIDDICK
               No....

     The predators are on him, just blurs in the dark. DEATH-SCREAM.

     RIDDICK'S POV: A third predator appears above him.

     Making his move, Riddick darts around cargo and heads for the
     escape hatch as...

     Fry's light catches him square in the face. Blinded, Riddick
     HOWLS and stumbles forward. Fry's light leaps deeper to hit...

     The predator right behind him. With a similar reaction, the
     beast HOWLS and flails back.

     HOLD on Fry for a time-stopped moment. What stopped it? Was it
     really her? Suddenly a SHOTGUN EXPLODES beside her head. Jacked
     up, Johns is BLASTING shadows.

                              FRY
               Stop it, stop it, STOP IT!

                              JOHNS
               'Sokay, 'sokay. I killed it.

     They give him a look. "Sure you did." Suddenly a CARCASS SLAMS
     to the floor, sending everyone jumping back in a perfect splash-
     pattern. "Christ, he did kill one."

     Fry reclaims her dropped light and beams it on the carcass.
     Wherever the light strikes it, the flesh chars and steams.

                              FRY
               There....

                              PARIS
               Like the light is scalding it.

                              FRY
               It hurts them. Light actually hurts
               them....

     VULTURE SOUNDS from the two O.S. adolescents, fighting over the
     scraps of the pilgrim.

                              IMAM
               Is that...Hasan?

     Riddick nods.

                              JOHNS
               We'll burn a candle for him later. C'mon.


     INT. SIXTH CONTAINER - CARGO HOLD - NIGHT

     Cargo has been shoved against the door and walls. The survivors
     gather around Fry's handlight. Audrey -- tough little Audrey --
     has been reduced to a shivering lump of mush.

                              FRY
               ...one cutting torch...one handlight here,
               two more in the cabin...I think two
               more....

                              PARIS
               Spirits. Anything over 45 proof burns
               well.

                              FRY
               How many bottles?

                              PARIS
               Not sure. Ten?

                              FRY
               Those umbrellas, the ones that mist.
               Would they burn?
                         (reading his face)
               If you got a receipt?

                              PARIS
               Possibly.

                              FRY
               Awright. So maybe we'll have enough light.

                              JOHNS
               Enough for what?

     Now she challenges him to be the mind-reader.

                              JOHNS (CONT'D)
               Oh, lady. If you're in your right mind,
               I pray you go insane.

                              FRY
                         (to others)
               We can stick to the plan. If we get four
               cells back to the skiff, we're off this
               rock.

                              PARIS
               I hate to kill a beautiful theory with an
               ugly fact, but that sand-cat won't run at
               night.

                              FRY
               We'll have to carry the cells...drag
               them...whatever it takes.

     Troubled faces. Is it just our imagination? Or is the light on
     the floor growing dimmer?

                              AUDREY
               You mean...tonight? With all those things
               still out there?

                              PARIS
               Oh, sure. Why not? Sounds like a hoot.

                              JOHNS
               Back it up. How long can this last? Few
               minutes? Couple hours?

     No one knows for sure.

                              IMAM
               I had the impression...from the model...
               that the two planets were moving as one.
               That there would be...a lasting darkness.

                              JOHNS
               Those suns gotta come back sometime. And
               if these animals really are phobic about
               light, we just sit tight till then.

                              FRY
               I'm sure that's what someone else said.
               Locked inside that coring room.

     A persuasive thought. Eyes swing back to Audrey.

                              JOHNS
               Look, we gotta think about everyone now --
               the kid especially. How scared is she
               gonna be out there?

                              FRY
               Oh, don't use her like that, for a smoke
               screen.

                              JOHNS
               Smoke screen for what?

                              FRY
               For your own fear.

                              JOHNS
                         (eyes narrowing)
               Hey. Why don't you rag your hole for two
               seconds and let someone else come up with
               a plan that doesn't involve MASS SUICIDE?

     Two seconds pass.

                              FRY
               How much you weigh, Johns?

                              JOHNS
               What the hell's it matter?

                              FRY
               How much?

                              JOHNS
               79 kilos.

                              FRY
               Because you're 79 kilos of gutless white
               meat, and that's why you can't come up
               with a better plan.

     He makes a move for her. Riddick blocks. Johns' shotgun bumps
     the underside of Riddick's chin.

                              RIDDICK
               Think about that reward, Johns.

                              JOHNS
               I'm willing to take a cut in pay.

                              RIDDICK
               How 'bout a cut in your gut?

     Johns looks down. CAMERA DROPS to reveal the shiv Riddick holds,
     poised for evisceration.

                              JOHNS
               Oh, Trash Baby, you're gonna regret this.

                              IMAM
               Please...this solves nothing...please....

     Johns backs off first. The light grows dimmer.

                              FRY
                         (to Audrey)
               They're afraid of our light. That means
               we don't have to be so afraid of them.

                              IMAM
               And you're certain you can find the way
               back? Even in the dark?

                              FRY
               No, I'm not. But he can.

     She's pointing, of course, to Riddick.


     EXT. PLANET - NIGHT

     The eclipsing planet dominates half the sky. In whatever coronal
     light remains, we see clouds forming.


     EXT. CRASH SHIP - NIGHT

     Cargo doors crack open. Mixed for maximum flame, the cutter is
     pushed outside and swept around. Fry appears behind it.

     Moving like hostages, the survivors cross open ground, trying not
     to heed the PRIMAL SOUNDS beyond their light. Soon they reach...

     The main cabin. Blackness inside.

                              FRY
               Riddick.

     He lifts his goggles.

     RIDDICK'S POV: Checking the cabin. Finding a lot of wreckage
     but no life.

                              RIDDICK
               Looks clear.

     Johns shoulders ahead and crawls in first. Just as he stands up
     inside...

     A PREDATOR BUZZSAWS over his head, fleeing the cabin, taking off
     into the night.

                              JOHNS
               Fuck me. You said "clear."

                              RIDDICK
               Said "looks clear."

                              JOHNS
               Well, what's it look like now?

                              RIDDICK
                         (rechecking)
               Looks clear.

                              FRY
               Just get the goddamn lights on....

     They scramble aboard. Riddick TONGUE-CLICKS behind Johns.
     He isn't amused.


     INT. MAIN CABIN - CRASH SHIP - NIGHT

     PREP MONTAGE: We see the survivors powering up cabin lights...
     yanking three more cells from the battery bay...threading nylon
     cord through Paris' misting umbrellas, filling the reservoirs
     with high-octane liquor...swapping out O2 canisters.


     INT. MAIN CABIN - CRASH SHIP - NIGHT

     Reloading his shotgun, Johns finds himself shaking again. He
     unpockets a shell -- a red morphine shell -- and gives it a
     lover's look. Behind him...

                              FRY
               Ready, Johns.

     He palms the shell.

                              JOHNS
               He'll lead you over the first cliff.
               You know that, don't you?

                              FRY
               We're just burnin' light here.

                              JOHNS
               You give him the cells and the ship --
               and he will leave you. He will leave you
               all out there to die.

                              FRY
               I don't get it, Johns. What is so goddamn
               valuable in your life that you're worried
               about losing? Huh? Is there anything at
               all? Besides your next hype?
                         (no response)
               Got no right to be so scared. Neither one
               of us.


     INT. BATTERY BAY - CRASH SHIP - NIGHT

     As hands yank the last power cell.


     INT. MAIN CABIN - CRASH SHIP - NIGHT

     Cabin lights die. Still brooding, Johns finishes loading his
     shotgun in the dark.


     EXT. CRASH SHIP - NIGHT

     CLOSE on a burning wick. Alcohol mist shoots across the flame to
     create...

     A FIREBALL. Two umbrella torches, fabric already burned away,
     BELCH FIREBALLS into the night. By this light and more, we see...

     Imam chained into the first harness of the drag-sled. Beside
     him, Johns fumbles with a second harness. Hands help him into
     the chains. The hands belong to...

     Riddick. Both men recognize the irony of the prisoner helping
     his captor into chains.

                              FRY
                         (to all)
               Keep the light going. That's all we have
               to do to live through this. Just keep
               your light burning.

     Riddick loops a handlight over his neck, places it to shine light
     down his back. A beacon.

                              RIDDICK
                         (to Fry)
               Be runnin' about 10 paces ahead. I want
               light on my back -- but not in my eyes.
               And check your cuts. These things know
               our blood now.

     CLOSE on Audrey. Overhearing, she goes stone-faced.

                              FRY
               Riddick...was thinkin' we should make some
               kind of deal. Just in case, you know,
               this actually --

                              RIDDICK
                         (shaking head)
               Had it with deals.

                              FRY
               But I just wanted to say --

                              RIDDICK
               Nobody's gonna turn a murderer loose.
               I fuckin' knew better.

     It worries Fry. "If he doesn't expect to go free...."

                              RIDDICK (CONT'D)
               Been a long time since anyone's trusted
               me. That's somethin' right there.

                              FRY
               We can, can't we? Trust you?

                              RIDDICK
               Actually...
                         (completely genuine)
               That's what I been askin' myself.

     He walks away. HOLD on Fry -- wondering if she hasn't made a
     terrible, terrible mistake.


     EXT. NIGHT

     The drag-sled begins moving.

     SERIES OF TRACKING SHOTS: Riddick running point, goggles off,
     eyes flashing. Johns and Imam pulling the drag-sled like
     malamutes, handlights sweeping. Pilgrims #1 at the first side-
     guard position, Fry and Audrey at the second, each position
     carrying an umbrella torch, FIREBALLS BLAZING. Paris stumbling
     along at rear-point, sweeping the cutter back and forth, every
     shadow a threat. They are a train of light.

     CLOSE on the sled. Holding four power cells and eight bottles
     of booze.

     CLOSE on Fry. Looking down. Noting sand-cat tracks underfoot.


     EXT. NIGHT

     Below us run the survivors. CRANE UP AND AWAY so that their
     lights become insignificant...so that we include, in FOREGROUND,
     the silhouettes of gliding predators. They're following from
     above, awaiting their chance.


     EXT. NIGHT

     FRY'S POV: Of the ground. The sand-cat tracks have vanished.

                              JOHNS
               So you noticed too?

                              FRY
               Riddick. Riddick.

     The procession grinds to a halt. Everyone sucks hard on
     breathers as they muster inside the light.

                              FRY
               Where are the sand-cat tracks? Why aren't
               we still following them?

                              RIDDICK
               Saw something I didn't like.

                              JOHNS
               Such as.

                              RIDDICK
               Hard to tell, sometimes...even for me...
               but looked like a bunch of those big boys
               chewin' each other's gonads off. Thought
               we'd swing wide. Okay by you?

     Paris looks over his shoulder. "We went around what?" Nearby
     CLICKING breaks up the confrontation.

                              FRY
               Let's move.
                         (to Audrey)
               Just a detour. He'll get us there.

                              PARIS
               Can we switch?

                              FRY
               What, switch what?

                              PARIS
               I think I twisted my ankle running
               backwards like that. And I'm not sure I
               can....
                         (off their stares)
               Okay, that's a lie. I just don't want to
               be alone back there anymore. If you could
               just give me a few minutes up front here --

                              JOHNS
               She's the pilot, she should stay close to
               the cells.

                              PARIS
               Oh, so I'm disposable?

                              FRY
               I'll switch, I'll switch! Christ, just
               get this train moving!


     EXT. NIGHT

     They trundle on, Fry the new tail-gunner.

     At side guard, Paris relaxes a bit -- even though the CLICKING
     never seems far from earshot. A weak FIREBALL SPEWS from his
     torch. He checks the reservoir. Almost empty.

                              PARIS
               Light, please, need light here....

     Still moving, Johns and Imam train lights on Paris while he
     refuels. For a brief moment, Audrey strays from the light.

     PREDATOR'S POV: Dive-bombing the girl.

     A HIGH-VELOCITY CLICKING: It's like an incoming missile. Imam
     lunges at the last nanosecond...

     And flattens Audrey to the ground. Scythe blades swing...

     CHINKING the harness-chains on Imam's back.

     Johns whirls, BLASTS. Light-beams leap around. But the predator
     is long gone.

                              IMAM
                         (trembling)
               Please...have we been cut? Can someone
               tell me if....

     He finds his dropped light, thumbs the switch again and again.
     Broken.

     In the confusion, Paris has been left in the dark. Something
     slashes him from behind. It's like the night has claws.

                              PARIS
               Oh, sweet Jesus....

     The bottle drops.

     The blood flows.

     The CLICKING STOPS.

                              PARIS
               Oh, sweet Jesus, WILL YOU GET ME SOME
               LIGHT OVER HERE!

     Faces whip around. But before their lights can rescue him...

     Paris is gone, snatched away by a swooping blur.

     Light-beams jump fitfully, vainly.

     RIDDICK'S POV: Of predators feasting on Paris. Carrying a
     youngling on its back, a female predator arrives late and can't
     find a place at the trough. With shocking apathy, it whips the
     youngling off its back and begins devouring it. Other predators
     start in-fighting, killing themselves for food. POV PANS to a
     pair of predators, closer, SOUNDING out new prey. POV PANS
     AGAIN to include the object of their desire. Audrey.

     CLOSE on Riddick. Trying to figure it out.

     CLOSE on Audrey. Listening to the HORRIFIC FEEDING SOUNDS.
     Oblivious to all the attention she's getting.

                              FRY
               What do you see? Riddick?

                              RIDDICK
               Hunger. I see 60 years of hunger.


     EXT. SKY - NIGHT

     As clouds mass.


     EXT. NIGHT

     Into a rising wind, the survivors range on.

     Audrey now carries Paris' torch, refueled and COUGHING FIREBALLS
     at regular intervals. Fry seems to be handling rear-point fairly
     well, until...

     The cutter sputters and dies. She ditches it and takes the torch
     from Audrey.

                              FRY
               Bottle-count.

                              AUDREY
               Four fulls, one half. That mean we're
               halfway there? I hope?

     Good question. They've just been blindly following...

     The light on Riddick's back.

                              FRY
               Can we pick up the pace?

     Working like a mule, Johns growls to himself. "If you think you
     can do better...." Abruptly he slaps an arm across Imam's chest,
     spotting...

     A sled-track. In front of them.

     Fry hears a SHOTGUN RATCHET. She spins to see...

     Johns out of his chains. Moving forward. Jamming the shotgun
     into the back of Riddick's neck.

                              JOHNS
               We aren't completely stupid.

                              FRY
               Stay in the light! Everybody! Stay in
               the fucking --

                              IMAM
               We crossed our own tracks.

                              JOHNS
               He's running us 'round in circles. Look
               for yourself. Look!

                              FRY
               Riddick? What the hell are you --

                              RIDDICK
               Listen.

     Imagine a hundred Geiger-counters next to a truckload of
     plutonium. That's the SOUND that rides the wind now.

                              RIDDICK
               Canyon ahead. I circled once to buy some
               time to think.

                              FRY
               Think about what?

                              JOHNS
               About how to kill us and still get these
               cells to the skiff. Goddamnit, we're just
               doin' the heavy lifting for this prick!

                              RIDDICK
                         (answering Fry)
               About the girl.

                              FRY
               What about her?

                              RIDDICK
               What it's gonna be like when we hit that
               canyon. With her bleeding.

                              JOHNS
               What're you jaw-jackin' about? Girl's not
               cut.

                              RIDDICK
                         (agreeing)
               No. She's not.

     It hits Fry like a two-by-four. She looks at Audrey.

                              AUDREY
                         (confessing)
               I didn't want you to leave me there...
               back at the ship...that's why I didn't
               say anything....

                              FRY
               No, we'd never....Oh, God, honey, you
               shoulda told me sooner.

                              JOHNS
                         (finally getting it)
               Aw, this can't be happening to me....

                              RIDDICK
               They been nose-open for her ever since we
               left. They go off blood.

                              IMAM
               Well...we must keep her close, then.
               Here, she'll be safe if we put her
               between --

                              RIDDICK
                         (scanning)
               There is no "safe."

     An epic beat. The wind gusts...the FLAMES CHATTER...their ears
     fill with CANYON SOUNDS.

                              FRY
               It's not gonna work. We gotta go back.

     Johns brays.

                              JOHNS
               Hey, you're the one who got me out here,
               turned me into a goddamn sled dog. An'
               now you 'spect me to go back like a
               whipped dog?

                              FRY
               I was wrong. I admit it. My bad, okay?
               Now let's just go back to the ship.

                              JOHNS
               I dunno. Nice breeze, wide open spaces --
               you know, I'm startin' to enjoy myself out
               here.

                              FRY
               Are you fucking high again? Just listen
               to --

                              JOHNS
               No, no, you're right, Fry. What's to be
               afraid of? My life is a steamin' pile of
               meaningless toadshit anyhow. So I say
               mush on! Canyon's only couple hundred
               meters, after that we're in Skiff City!
               So why don't you just butch up, stuff a
               cork in that kid, and get --

                              IMAM
               She's the captain, we should listen to --

                              JOHNS
               Listen to her? Her? When she was willing
               to sacrifice us all?

     A beat. Eyes turn to Fry. She wants to protest -- but can't.

                              AUDREY
               What's he talkin' about?

                              JOHNS
               During the crash, she --

                              FRY
                         (a warning growl)
               This does not help us, Johns.

                              JOHNS
               -- she tried to blow the whole fucking
               passenger cabin, tried to kill us --

                              FRY
               Just shut up, okay?

                              JOHNS
               -- tried to kill us in our sleep. Paris
               had it right -- we are disposable. We're
               just walking ghosts to her.

                              FRY
               Would you RAG YOUR STUPID HOLE!

     She rushes him, ready to rip his eyes out. He shunts her aside.

                              JOHNS
               We're not alive because of her -- we're
               alive in spite of her.

     He swung below the belt -- and connected. Fry's chin quakes,
     her knees fail. The undertow of events finally pulls her down.

                              FRY
               We cannot go through there....

                              JOHNS
                         (lording)
               How much you weigh right now, Fry? Huh?

                              IMAM
                         (pushing him back)
               Fine, fine, you've made your point. We
               can all be so scared as you.

     Johns snatches a light away from Imam.

                              JOHNS
                         (to all)
               Verdict's in. The light moves forward.


     EXT. BONEYARD - NIGHT

     They trudge on, slower now, building reserves for the canyon-run.
     At rear-point, Fry follows like a broken rudder. Pilgrim #1 now
     draws the sled with Imam. And up ahead...


     EXT. BONEYARD - NIGHT

     Johns falls in step with Riddick.

                              JOHNS
               Ain't all of us gonna make it.

                              RIDDICK
               Just realized that, huh?

     CLICKING nearby. Johns BLASTS the night, driving the sound
     away -- and reminding everyone of who carries the Big Gauge.

                              JOHNS
               Six of us left. If we could get through
               that canyon and lose just one, that'd be
               quite a fucking feat, huh? A good thing,
               right?

                              RIDDICK
               Not if I'm the one.

                              JOHNS
               What if you're one of five?

     Riddick stares. "I'm listening."


     EXT. BONEYARD - NIGHT

                              AUDREY
               What're they doin' up there?

                              IMAM
               Talking about the canyon, I suppose.
               How to get us through.

     Overhearing, Fry looks. It's odd to see Johns and Riddick
     walking side by side, like equals. Like partners.


     EXT. BONEYARD - NIGHT

                              JOHNS
               Look, it's hellified stuff -- but no
               different than those battlefield doctors
               when they have to decide who lives and who
               dies. It's called "triage," okay?

                              RIDDICK
               Kept calling it "murder" when I did it.

                              JOHNS
               Either way, figure it's something you can
               grab onto.

                              RIDDICK
                         (doping it out)
               Sacrifice play. Hack up one body, leave
               it at start of the canyon. Like a bucket
               of chum.

                              JOHNS
               Trawl with it. There's a cable on the
               sled. We can drag the body behind us.

                              RIDDICK
               Nice embellishment.

                              JOHNS
               Don't wanna feed these land-sharks -- just
               keep 'em off our scent.

                              RIDDICK
                         (looking back)
               So which one caught your eye?

                              JOHNS
               Don' look, don' look, don' look....


     EXT. BONEYARD - NIGHT

     Fry spots Riddick's look -- and Johns' non-look.

                              FRY
               Imam. Slow down.

                              IMAM
               What?

                              FRY
               Don't stop, just slow down.  Little more
               space 'tween us and them.

                              IMAM
               I would rather we all stay--

                              FRY
               Do what I say. Please.


     EXT. BONEYARD - NIGHT

                              RIDDICK
               What's her name, anyway?

                              JOHNS
               What do you care?

     Riddick shrugs. "I don't."

                              JOHNS
               Then let's not name the Thanksgiving
               turkey, okay? I assume you still got a
               shiv.

                              RIDDICK
               What, you 'spect me to do it?

                              JOHNS
               What's one more to you? Like this is the
               one that sends you to Hell?

                              RIDDICK
               Oh, you're a piece of art, Johns. They
               oughtta hang you in a museum somewhere.
               Or forget the museum -- maybe they should
               just hang you.


     EXT. BONEYARD - NIGHT

     As Fry and the others keep slowing.


     EXT. BONEYARD - NIGHT

                              JOHNS
               Awright. You do the girl, I'll keep the
               others off your back.

     Riddick stops. Reconsiders.

                              JOHNS (CONT'D)
               Aw, don't tell me you're growin' scruples.

                              RIDDICK
                         (shakes head)
               Just wonderin' if we don't need a bigger
               piece of chum.

                              JOHNS
               Like who, Mr. Chrislam?

     EXTREMELY TIGHT on both men: In their eyes, we see the new
     partnership splintering apart: "Like Mr. Johns."

     Riddick makes a play for the shotgun. It BLASTS skyward.


     EXT. BONEYARD - NIGHT

     As the fight erupts:

                              FRY
               Bring the light!

                              AUDREY
               What're they doing? What're we --

                              FRY
               Leave the sled, let's go, go, go!


     EXT. BONEYARD - NIGHT

     FIGHT SCENE: Johns' light hits the ground, creating an arena of
     illumination. FAST CLICKING nearby. Still struggling, Riddick
     and Johns somehow manage to gang-aim the shotgun and BLAST THE
     CLICKING AWAY.

     The shotgun goes free. Johns lunges for it, but Riddick kicks it
     into the night. And then pulls his shiv.

                              RIDDICK
               Gotta stay in the light, Johns. That's
               the only rule.

     Johns circles inside the light. Fucking with him, Riddick starts
     poking and jabbing, backing him up against the wail of dark.
     Johns stumbles over something. A bone. A club.

     Riddick finds his own bone-club, and now they go at it like two
     cavemen. Riddick beats on Johns' club-hand, breaking fingers,
     forcing him to drop the bone. Just trying to get away now, Johns
     makes a desperate lunge for the light, but...

     Riddick shivs open his back.

                              RIDDICK
               Remember that moment?

     Gushing blood, Johns starts crawling pathetically with the light.
     Riddick dogs him.

                              RIDDICK
               Shoulda never took the chains off, Johns.
               You were one brave fuck, before. Now look
               at you. Oh, yeah, you were Billy Bad-ass
               with your gauge...with your chains....

     Johns finds the shotgun. "And I'm still Billy Bad-ass." He
     sweeps it around with the light, ready to kill...

     Blackness. Where'd Riddick go?

     CLICKING behind Johns. He whirls to see...

     Something big coming for him. Johns BLASTS IT back into the
     night, dropping the light as he does. Eyes in the back of his
     head, he whirls again and takes aim on...

     Another bull-rushing predator.

     Johns triggers a bad round. Crazed, he ratchets and levels the
     shotgun for another try. He's too late.

     BIG CLOSEUP as the ejected shell rolls to a stop. It's red.
     Johns loaded a morphine shell in the dark.

     RIDDICK'S POV: With Johns skewered by the armpits, the predator
     lifts him off the ground and "stares" with a deceptively gentle
     CLICKING-COOING SOUND.

     PREDATOR'S POV: Of Johns' final expression.

     RIDDICK'S POV: The predator rears back its head -- then slams
     forward, hitting Johns with the full force of its skull-blade,
     splitting him in two.


     EXT. NIGHT

     Fry, Imam, Audrey, Pilgrim #1. They're running, stumbling,
     trying to backtrack the sled marks. Checking for pursuit, Fry
     looks over her shoulder...

     And crashes into Riddick. He was just standing in the dark,
     waiting for them.

                              RIDDICK
               Back to the ship, huh?

                              FRY
               Get out of our way.

                              RIDDICK
               So everybody huddles together till the
               lights burn out? Until you can't see
               what's eating you? That the big plan?

                              IMAM
               Where's Mr. Johns?

                              RIDDICK
               Which half?

                              IMAM
               You mean....

     Conflicted, they all look back. Audrey starts to puddle up.

                              AUDREY
               Gonna lose everybody out here....

                              RIDDICK
               He died fast. And if we got any choice,
               that's the way we should all go out.
                         (to Audrey, softly)
               Don't you cry for Johns. Don't you dare.


     EXT. CANYON RIM - THE GAUNTLET - NIGHT

     BLACK SCREEN. We hear the canyon in full cry now -- CLICKING...
     BATTLING BONE-BLADES...MATING CRIES...the RENDING OF FLESH
     and SNAPPING OF TENDON. Far below, twin flames appear as the
     survivors reach the gauntlet. Predators perch in FOREGROUND,
     just hulking silhouettes "watching" from a canyon rim.


     EXT. START OF GAUNTLET - NIGHT

     They are but five: Fry, Riddick, Audrey, Imam, and Pilgrim #1.
     CLOSE on each face as they listen to the CANYON. There must be
     countless predators ahead.

                              FRY
               How many you see?

                              RIDDICK
               One or two.

                              FRY
               Audrey?

                              AUDREY
               Three full bottles. But almost time to
               refill.

                              FRY
               Doesn't seem like enough to turn back on,
               does it?

                              RIDDICK
               Only see one way. Turn the sled over and
               drag it like that, girl down low. Light
               up everything we got -- and run through
               like dogs on fire.

     A beat.

                              IMAM
                         (understanding)
               The sled as a shield....

                              FRY
               And what about the cells?

                              RIDDICK
               I'll take those.

     She looks at him hard.

                              FRY
               We're just here to carry your light,
               aren't we? Just the torch-bearers.

                              RIDDICK
               Let's drop back an' boot up.


     EXT. BONEYARD - NIGHT

     START on the power cells. They're been lashed together into one
     queue.

     Working amid the giant bones, Riddick crafts a new harness from
     the old straps. Close behind him, Imam is MUTTERING IN ARABIC.

                              RIDDICK
               What're you doin'?

                              IMAM
               Blessing you like the others.
                         (off his look)
               It's painless.

                              RIDDICK
               And pointless.

                              IMAM
                         (a beat)
               I see. Well, even if you don't believe
               in God, it doesn't mean He won't be --

                              RIDDICK
               You don't see.

     Riddick shrugs into the harness, snugs it down.

                              RIDDICK (CONT'D)
               'Cuz you don't spend half your life in
               lock-down with a horse-bit in your mouth
               and not believe. And you surely don't
               start out in a liquor store trash bin with
               an umbilical cord wrapped around your neck
               and not believe. Oh, absolutely I believe
               in God. And I absolutely hate the fucker.

                              IMAM
               He will be with us. Nonetheless.

                              RIDDICK
               Give my blessing to the girl. She needs
               a spare.


     EXT. START OF GAUNTLET - NIGHT

     The torches. Maxed out. Burning non-stop.

     Fry and Imam. Sled chains on. Lapping up O2. Each holding a
     torch.

     Pilgrim #1. Clutching a handlight.

     Audrey. Rolling under her sled-shield, becoming the turtle in a
     metal carapace.

     Riddick. Goggles on. He has no desire to see what horrors will
     surround them. There's just one path, anyway: Straight through.

                              RIDDICK
               As fast as you can.

                              FRY
               You sure you can keep --

                              RIDDICK
               As fast as you can.


     EXT. THE GAUNTLET - NIGHT

     SLEW OF SHOTS: Fry and Imam on the move, dragging the shield
     fast. Audrey speed-crawling beneath. Pilgrim #1 tripping along
     behind the shield. And Riddick behind them all, face already
     tortured, pulling 200 pounds of stubborn-mule cargo -- yet
     somehow keeping pace. The torch flames, stretched by the wind,
     flank them in fire.


     EXT. CANYON RIM - THE GAUNTLET - NIGHT

     As predators launch from the rim.


     EXT. THE GAUNTLET - NIGHT

     First come the hatchlings, streaming right into their faces --
     then veering away at the last second, repulsed by light. Next
     come FERAL SOUNDS overhead.

                              RIDDICK
               Don't look.

     Thin blue liquid spatters them.

                              RIDDICK
               Do not look up.

     More spattering. Fry looks up -- and stumbles when she beholds...

     A ceiling of predators. At the cusp of light, they dive and
     weave and dart, slashing each other in a rabid desire to SOUND
     OUT the humans below. It's like looking into a bucket of angry
     eels.

                              RIDDICK
               Keep going, keep going, keep going,
               keep going!

     His voice whips them like the Devil's coxswain. Chastened, Fry
     keeps her eyes down and speed up.

     More blue blood showers down -- followed by entrails dropping
     out of the sky. Could this be Hell itself?

                              IMAM
                         (a muttered mantra)
               "So dark the clouds around my way
                    I cannot see,
               But through the darkness I believe
                    God leadeth me.
               I gladly place my hand in His when
                    all is dim,
               And, closing my weary eyes, lean
                    hard on him...."

     Now WHOLE CORPSES ARE CRASHING DOWN around them, victims
     of in-fighting. Fry and Imam start slaloming through the ghastly
     mess.

     Pilgrim #1 passes too close to a corpse: A blade slices his leg,
     drawing blood. He keeps his mouth shut.


     EXT. CHOKE-POINT - THE GAUNTLET - NIGHT

     The passage narrows into a choke-point. Fry sees it first.

                              FRY
               Riddick? RIDDICK?

     Ahead, a clot of dead predators blocks the canyon.

                              AUDREY
               What? What is it?

                              RIDDICK
               It's a fucking staircase! Go over it!
               GO OVER IT!

     Steeling themselves, they start climbing.

     But Audrey, on all fours, has to discover the corpses with her
     hands. Then, taking exception at being walked on...

     One "corpse" snaps at her. Audrey recoils sideways...

     And tumbles down the mound of corpses. She's exposed.

     PREDATORS' POV: Rapid-fire images of Audrey. Flashes from 10
     different predators.

                              FRY
               Audrey!

     Audrey shakes out of it and scrambles for the shield just as...

     A predator kamikazes onto the shield, its bone-blades piercing
     the metal...

     And nearly skewering Audrey beneath.

     Caught in torchlight, steaming, the PREDATOR HOWLS as it tries
     to rip free of the shield.

     Beneath, Audrey hangs on and takes a thrashing.

     The predator tears clear, spins, pounces blindly at...

     Riddick, standing at light's edge. Stunningly, he catches the
     beast under its scythe blades, blunting the attack. The predator
     CLICKS MADLY at him.

     PREDATOR'S POV: Of Riddick's face.

     The predator rears back its head, ready to bisect Riddick with
     its skull-blade.

     Switchblade fast, Riddick drops a hand...

     ...yanks his shiv...

     ...and sweeps it over the belly of the beast. HOWLING, the
     predator falls, disemboweled.

     REACTION SHOTS of Fry and Imam. Stunned.

                              RIDDICK
               Didn't know who he was fuckin' with.

     They regroup. Imam's head swivels back and forth: They're one
     person short.

                              IMAM
               Suleiman!

                              RIDDICK
               Get the girl back under. Keep going.

                              IMAM
               SULEIMAN!

                              RIDDICK
               KEEP GOING OR I WILL!

     Suddenly Pilgrim #1 reappears, thrust back into the light by
     unseen forces. He's still alive -- but shouldn't be. He makes
     a feeble attempt to grab onto Imam, to anyone, but he's gone
     again before they can even react, jerked out of the light. Out
     of existence.


     EXT. THE GAUNTLET - NIGHT

     They flail on. And now, finally...finally....

     The canyon widens, opening up like some door to Heaven. The
     WORST SOUNDS fall behind. We can see it in their sweat-sheened
     faces: The faintest hope that maybe they've survived the Seventh
     Circle of Hell. But then...

     The TORCHES SPIT AND SPUTTER.

     Audrey hears PATTERING on the metal shield.

     Blood falls anew.

     One torch dies -- yet somehow comes back to life.

     Imam upturns a hand, checking the liquid for color. But this
     blood has no hue.

                              FRY
               Oh, no. No, no, no....

                              IMAM
               Rain.


     EXT. THE GAUNTLET - NIGHT

     RAIN MONTAGE: Water rilling, running, flowing over rocks and
     ground.


     EXT. THE GAUNTLET - NIGHT

     Caught in a downpour, the survivors slog to a stop. One torch
     goes out -- and won't relight.

                              RIDDICK
               So where the hell's God now, huh?
                         (no answer from Imam)
               I'll tell you where! He's up there
               PISSING ON ME!

                              FRY
               Riddick? How close?

     Riddick sheds goggles to look ahead. We don't know what he
     sees -- nor what he's thinking.

                              FRY
               Tell me the settlement is right there!
               RIDDICK, PLEASE!

                              RIDDICK
               We can't make it.

     HOLD on Fry's anguished face, rendered in dying torchlight.
     Somewhere behind, the AWFUL SOUNDS RETURN.

                              RIDDICK
               Here...hide here....

     He's found a crevice in the canyon wall.

                              RIDDICK
               Inside...inside....


     EXT. CREVICE - THE GAUNTLET - NIGHT

     They crawl into the fissure. The second torch dies behind them.


     EXT. THE GAUNTLET - NIGHT

     There's just one light left now -- the one Riddick wears on his
     back. By its glow, we watch him lift the shield, muscle it over
     to the crevice...


     EXT. CREVICE - THE GAUNTLET - NIGHT

     ...and slide it over the opening. A black beat.

                              AUDREY
                         (a beat)
               Why's he still out there?

     Fry's not sure. Is he protecting them? Or entombing them?


     EXT. MUDDY RISE - THE GAUNTLET - NIGHT

     Working like Sisyphus, Riddick hauls the cells up a muddy rise.
     He stops at the top, peers through the rain.

     RIDDICK'S POV: Of the settlement.

     Riddick disappears over the rise. The four cells follow,
     slithering through the mud like a serpent's tail.


     EXT. CREVICE - THE GAUNTLET - NIGHT

                              AUDREY
               He's not coming back, is he?

     Fry checks Imam's face. Did Riddick say anything to you?" Imam
     wags his head. A bleak beat -- before Fry realizes she can see
     his face.

                              FRY
               There's light in here.

     It's a soft glow from above. Imam climbs higher to discover
     small blue-white lights clinging to rocks. He plucks a few.

                              FRY
               What are they?

     CLOSE on the lights in Imam's palm. They writhe with life.

                              IMAM
               Larva....

                              AUDREY
               Glow worms....

                              FRY
                         (mind racing)
               How many bottles we got? Empty ones?


     INT. SKIFF - NIGHT

     Riddick boards the dark craft.

     Connects the power cells to the battery bay.

     Watches the ship come to life.


     EXT. CREVICE - THE GAUNTLET - NIGHT

     CLOSE on a liquor bottle. It's half full of glow-worms.

                              AUDREY
               More, more, we need more....

     They climb higher. Little by little, the bottle brightens their
     world.


     EXT. SKIFF - NIGHT

     Drenched in light, Riddick stands in the hatchway of the skiff,
     looking out into dark rain. Is he struggling with a decision?
     Or just savoring the safe harbor? Then very deliberately...

     Riddick smashes his handlight on the hull. He steps inside and
     closes the hatch behind him.


     EXT. MUDDY RISE - THE GAUNTLET - NIGHT

     Something claws its way up the rise. Standing, we see that it's
     Fry, a bottle of glow-worms strung around her neck. Ahead she
     spies...

     The settlement. Silhouetted by engine-light.


     EXT. SKIFF - NIGHT

     As the skiffs ENGINES WARM UP.


     INT. SKIFF - NIGHT

     As Riddick dabbles with flight controls.


     EXT. SETTLEMENT - NIGHT

     As Fry, running, splashes past buildings.


     EXT. CREVICE - THE GAUNTLET - NIGHT

     Audrey and Imam huddle around a bottle of glow-worms: This is
     all they could harvest. Presently SCRABBLING SOUNDS on the
     shield. Imam eases one eye to a small hole in the shield. He
     can't see much until...

     A blade rushes through the hole. Imam recoils hard, snatches up
     the glow-worm light to see...

     More predator blades exploring the edges of the shield. The
     light drives them away. For now.


     INT. SKIFF - NIGHT

     Riddick dims interior lights, activates exterior lights. He's
     actually startled by the sight of...

     Fry. Standing in the skiffs headbeams. Daring him to run her
     over.

     Eye-lock.

     Riddick opens the hatch.


     EXT. SKIFF - NIGHT

     They meet at opposite ends of the gangway -- Fry in the rain,
     Riddick in the light.

                              RIDDICK
               Strong survival instinct. Admire that in
               a woman.

                              FRY
               You're not leaving. Not until we go back
               for the others.

     He laughs at that.

                              FRY (CONT'D)
               I promised them we'd go back with more
               light. And that's exactly what we're
               gonna do..

                              RIDDICK
               Think you've mistaken me for somebody who
               gives a fuck.

                              FRY
               What, you're afraid?

                              RIDDICK
               Confusin' me with Johns now -- fear was
               his monkey. I only deal in life and
               death. All that stuff in between? Some
               shade of grey my eyes don't see.

                              FRY
               I trusted you, Riddick. Goddamn, I
               trusted that some part of you wanted to
               rejoin the human race.

                              RIDDICK
               Truthfully? I wouldn't know how.

     Fry realizes it's impossible to shame a shameless man. With
     desperation edging her voice:

                              FRY
               Then wait for me. I'll go back myself.
               Just give me more light for them.

     He tosses her a light. The broken one.

                              FRY
               Just come with me!

                              RIDDICK
               Got a better idea. Come with me.

     Fry's mouth moves but nothing comes out.

                              RIDDICK (CONT'D)
               They're already dead. Get on board.

                              FRY
               You're fuckin' with me. I know you are.

                              RIDDICK
               'Course I am -- but doesn't mean I won't
               leave you here. If you believe anything
               about me, better be that.

                              FRY
               No, you see, I promised them...I have
               to...I have to go and....

     She's bleeding resolve. Riddick can see it -- can smell it --
     and he keeps slashing away.

                              RIDDICK
               Step aboard, Carolyn.

                              FRY
                         (tortured)
               I can't....I can't....

                              RIDDICK
                         (approaching, extending
                          a hand)
               Here. Make it easy on you.

                              FRY
               Don't do this to me....

                              RIDDICK
               Just give me your hand.

                              FRY
               But they...they could still be....

                              RIDDICK
               No one's gonna blame you. C'mon. Take my
               hand and save yourself, Carolyn.

     A beat. She takes his hand -- and jerks him down the gangway.
     They sprawl through mud. She gets a knee on his neck.

                              FRY
               I will not give up on them! I Will not
               leave anyone on this rock with those
               fucking things, even if it means --

     In a blur, Riddick rolls and slaps a shiv on her neck. Is
     history repeating itself? Riddick's face, though, is strangely
     calm. Curious. Even gentle.

                              RIDDICK
               You'd die for them?

                              FRY
               I would try for them.

                              RIDDICK
               You barely know them.

                              FRY
               But I'm human. I know you view that as a
               weakness, but I'm sorry -- I do feel fear,
               theirs too. Goddamnit, Riddick -- yes.
               I would die for them.


     EXT. CREVICE - THE GAUNTLET - NIGHT

     MORE SCRABBLING at the shield. Imam cocks his blade back, ready
     to do battle with...

     Fry. She heaves the shield aside. Behind her, Riddick.

                              AUDREY
                         (big-eyed)
               You came for us....

                              RIDDICK
               Yeah, yeah -- we're all fuckin' amazed.
               Anyone not ready for this?


     EXT. THE GAUNTLET - NIGHT

     Protected by the meager light of two glow-worm bottles, the four
     remaining survivors head out.

                              RIDDICK
               Tighter, tighter....


     EXT. MUDDY RISE - THE GAUNTLET - NIGHT

                              RIDDICK
               Stop.

     They pile up awkwardly. Fry listens hard. Only RAINFALL.

                              FRY
               I don't hear --

     He covers her mouth.

     RIDDICK'S POV: Water has pooled at the base of the muddy rise.
     A predator drinks there.

                              RIDDICK
                         (on his breath)
               Doesn't see us...wait for it to leave....

     RIDDICK'S POV: Another predator lands to drink. Then another.
     Their backs are to us, but the pool is turning into a major
     gathering place.

     Soon they all can hear CLICKING above the RAIN. Their nightmare
     is far from over.

                              RIDDICK
               Get behind me.

     RIDDICK'S POV: Of a half-dozen predators shifting places at the
     pool. A slim gap appears.

                              RIDDICK
               When I go, we go. Full-throttle.

     CLOSE on their hands, gripping each other.

                              RIDDICK
               Ready...ready....

     RIDDICK'S POV: The gap between predators widens into a passage.
     A gauntlet within a gauntlet.

     Riddick runs. Linked like paper dolls, the others follow blindly.

     RIDDICK'S POV: Of a predator turning to "stare" over its
     shoulder.

     PREDATOR'S POV: Of Riddick bearing down fast.

     The survivors hit the water like lawn mowers on legs, crashing
     through, scattering water and predators alike, managing to
     reach...

     The muddy rise. Audrey loses her grip on the others...

     And starts back-sliding. She CRIES OUT, turning the head of...

     Riddick. He catches Audrey as her legs hit the pool. He muscles
     her back up the rise and heaves her over the top, sending her
     slip-sliding down the other side.

                              RIDDICK
               You know the way!

     Not waiting for him, Fry and Imam disappear over the rise.

     RIDDICK'S POV: Of the predators. Regrouping. Crawling up the
     rise at us.


     EXT. NIGHT

     Fry, Imam, and Audrey run hard, glow-worm lights bouncing wildly.

     RIDDICK'S POV: Chasing them.

     PREDATOR'S POV: Chasing Riddick.


     EXT. SETTLEMENT - NIGHT

     Fry, Imam, and Audrey reach the settlement. They spill around a
     corner and see...

     The light of the skiff.


     EXT. SETTLEMENT - NIGHT

     RIDDICK'S POV: Ahead of us, we see Fry, Imam, and Audrey
     vanishing around the corner. BREATHING LIKE A RACEHORSE, we
     follow in their steps, storming around the same corner. Suddenly
     a predator is right there, right in our face.

     PREDATOR'S POV: Of Riddick skidding to a stop. He snaps a look
     up.

     RIDDICK'S POV: Of another predator perched gargoyle-like on the
     building. It SPEED-CLICKS at us.

     PREDATOR'S POV: Of Riddick slowly pulling two shivs. Bracing
     himself. Ready to blade it out.


     EXT. SKIFF - NIGHT

     Imam and Audrey stagger aboard. Safe in the light of the
     headbeams, Fry turns back, panting, waiting.

     Waiting.

                              IMAM
               Captain....

     He wants her to board the skiff. Fry gives it another beat, eyes
     sweeping the dark rain. And just when we think it's over for
     Riddick -- TERRIBLE SCREAMS are heard from both man and predator:
     There's a helluva fight going on out there. Close out there.

     Fry snatches the glow-worms off Imam's neck...

     And plunges into the darkness, homing in on the SOUNDS until...

     A blade flashes in her face. She ducks and spots...

     Riddick. Bloody, muddy, he's down on his knees, still trying to
     fight off the shadow-beasts that swirl and slash all around him.
     Around them both.

                              FRY
               It's me, it's me, it's me!

     She gets the light around his neck. Now we see his face
     clearly -- and see a very human expression there: Fear. Fry
     grabs his armpits and tries to pull him up.

                              FRY
               C'mon, Riddick -- said I'd die for them,
               not you.

     He gets his feet under him. Gripping each other, they start
     moving, turning like dancers in a macabre waltz, hoping the
     predators can't fix on Riddick's blood.

                              FRY
               Just 10 steps...keep turning, keep
               turning...that's right...others're already
               'board, waitin' for us right now...five
               steps...c'mon, almost there, Riddick...
               almost there...we're almost --

     Something jolts them. ALL CLICKING STOPS.

     EXTREME CLOSEUPS: Searching each other's eyes. Someone just got
     slashed from behind, slashed bad. But who?

                              RIDDICK
               Not for me....

     In an eyeblink she's gone, ripped from his arms. There was no
     scream. No cry. No final words. Just...

     Blackness.


     EXT. PLANET'S ORBIT - NIGHT

     Out of the blackness, a spot of fire races toward us. It
     resolves into the skiff, fabric wings burning off as it hits
     escape velocity.


     INT. SKIFF - NIGHT

     CLOSE on a bloody hand. It toggles through nav-charts, plots a
     rendezvous with "Sol-Track 17B" shipping lane.

     In the cockpit, Riddick finds Audrey beside him. She stares
     hypnotically at the stars ahead.

                              RIDDICK
               Probably okay to talk to me now.

                              AUDREY
               Not sure where to go. I was just runnin'
               away when this whole thing started.
                         (a beat)
               Where you goin'?

                              RIDDICK
               Not sure. I was just runnin' away when
               this whole thing....

     Interior smiles. Stars sweep the windscreen as the skiff makes
     a course-correction. One very bright star comes into view.

                              RIDDICK
               Might interest you....

     Imam moves forward. Seeing, his face lifts.

                              IMAM
               New Mecca....

                              RIDDICK
               Think a soul could get lost there? With
               all those pilgrim-types?

                              IMAM
               It's more a place where souls are found,
               Mr. Riddick.

     As Riddick ponders the possibilities, we CUT TO...


     EXT. PLANET'S ORBIT - NEW DAWN

     The first sun flares out from behind the eclipsing planet. Its
     light feels cleansing. Renewing. Life-giving.

                                                            FADE OUT
PITCH BLACK

                           Screenplay

                               by

                           David Twohy


               Based on material by Ken and Jim Wheat






                                             Revised First Draft
                                             3/3/98








     NOTE: THE HARD COPY OF THIS SCRIPT CONTAINED SCENE NUMBERS
     AND SOME "OMITTED" SLUGS. THEY HAVE BEEN REMOVED FOR THIS
     SOFT COPY.

     NOTE ALSO: THE HARD COPY OF THIS SCRIPT WAS IN THE NON-
     PREFORMAT FONT "TIMES NEW ROMAN". THIS HAS BEEN CHANGED
     TO PREFORMATTED TEXT FOR THIS SOFT COPY.









Though mentioned often in the script, the creatures in PITCH BLACK are 
seldom seen at length; rather, they are glimpsed, they are heard, they are 
felt. They are, really, the embodiment of your nocturnal fears: A howling 
coyote that jars you awake; the painting on the wall that comes to life
when stared at too long...the sway of your bed just before the earthquake 
hits. Chimera of the night. The point is made so the reader appreciates
that the focus of the finished film will not be on what the creatures do, 
but on what the creatures do to reveal the inner nature of the characters. 
For PITCH BLACK is, at its heart, a story of humanity and courage -- and 
lack of the same.

     CUT IN:

     INT. MAIN CABIN

     A CRYO-LOCKER BLOWS OPEN, spitting out...

     CAROLYN FRY. She hits the deck of the main cabin: Four crew
     lockers in a forward section, countless more in back. But the
     deck is canted at a sick angle and ALARMS SCREAM everywhere:
     The world is dying around her.

     Legs wobbly, shivering like a flu victim, Fry stumbles to the
     next forward locker. It's riddled with holes. One DEAD CREWIE
     is seen through fractured plexi, body pocked and bloodied. But
     in the next cryo-locked...

     The CAPTAIN is struggling awake. Fry's face floods with relief.
     Slapping an intercom:

                              FRY
               Hear me? Cap'n? Some kinda compromise to
               the hull...holding for now, but...Goddamn,
               I'm glad you're alive. Gotta pull your
               E-release...no, red handle, red handle.
               I'll get the warm-ups out while --

     PHFUT-PHFUT-PHFUT-PHFUT: Particles bore through the cabin,
     blasting open the captain's chest, shattering plexi, DETONATING
     INSTRUMENTS on the opposite wall and leaving CONTRAILS
     HISSING in the air.

     Fry lands on her ass, horrified. Suddenly...

     Another LOCKER BLOWS OPEN. A body falls right on top of Fry --
     but this one's still alive. Disoriented, frantic:

                              OWENS
               Why did I fall on you?

                              FRY
               He's dead. Cap'n's dead. Christ, I was
               looking right at him when --

                              OWENS
               I mean, I mean, chrono shows we're 22
               weeks out, so gravity wasn't supposed to
               kick in for another 19. I mean, I mean,
               I mean, why did I fall at all?

                              FRY
               You hear me? Captain's dead. Owens too.

                              OWENS
               Oh, no. Not Owens, not.... Wai', wai',
               wait. I'm Owens. Right?

     They swap nightmare looks, momentarily unsure of their own
     identities.

                              FRY
               Cryo-sleep. Swear to God, it sloughs
               brain cells.


     INT. NAV-BAY - MAIN CABIN

     They stumble into nav-bay. ALARMS CONTINUE. Fry grabs warm-up
     suits out of storage, pitches one to Owens, checks her screens.

                              FRY
               1550 millibars, dropping 20 MB per minute,
               shit, we're hemorrhaging air. Somethin'
               took a swipe at us.

                              OWENS
               Just tell me we're still in the shipping
               lane. Just show me all those stars, all
               those bright, beautiful, deep-space....

     Owens activates an exterior view: A planet rushes up at us.
     That's why they have gravity.

                              FRY
               Jesus God....


     EXT. SHIP - PLANET'S ATMOSPHERE - DAY

     The SHIP PLOWS through the upper atmosphere, antennae pylons
     already disintegrating.


     INT. PASSAGE TO FLIGHT DECK

     Heart battering her ribs, Fry runs forward, using hand-holds to
     steady herself. Over a headset:

                              OWENS (V.O.)
               They trained you for this, right? Fry?
               FRY?

     She doesn't answer.


     INT. FLIGHT DECK - DAY

     Fry harnesses in, starts running switches -- but fumbles a few
     times, making mental errors. Finally she gets crash-shutters
     open to reveal...

     CLOUD STRATA sweeping up past the windscreen like floor-lights
     on a dropping elevator. We're shedding big altitude.


     INT. NAV-BAY - MAIN CABIN

                              OWENS
               ... crisis program selected Number Two of
               this system because it shows at least some
               oxygen and more than 1,500 -- would you
               SHUT THE FUCK UP!
                         (hammers a button,
                          SILENCES ALARMS)
               -- more than 1,500-millibars of pressure
               at surface-level. Okay, so maybe the ship
               did something right for a change....


     INT. FLIGHT DECK - DAY

     As Fry runs more switches.


     INT. SHIP - DAY

     As JETTISON DOORS CLOSE around the ship.


     INT. FLIGHT DECK - DAY

     As Fry flips up a security-latch -- and thumbs the switch below.


     EXT. SHIP - PLANET'S ATMOSPHERE - DAY

     MULTIPLE SHOTS: EXPLOSIVE BOLTS RAPID-FIRE around the ship's
     skin, blowing away non-essentials that hinder aerodynamics --
     including big deep-space drives. But this last separation puts
     the ship into a dangerous roll.


     INT. FLIGHT DECK - DAY

     Out the windscreen, cloud strata roll vertiginously. Fry throws
     actuators...


     EXT. SHIP - PLANET'S ATMOSPHERE - DAY

     And airbrakes deploy. She manages to kill the roll. But the
     ship's still coming in nose-high.


     INT. NAV-BAY - MAIN CABIN

                              OWENS
               ...showing no major water bodies...maximum
               terrain, 220 meters over mean surface...
               largely cinder and gypsum with some
               evaporite deposits....

     JETTISON DOORS CLOSE behind Owens, segregating him from the
     passenger compartment. It scares him for a new reason.

                              OWENS
               Fry? What're you doing?


     INT. FLIGHT DECK - DAY

     Fry flips up a new security-latch. INTERCUTTING:

                              OWENS
               Fry?

                              FRY
               Can't get my nose down...too much load
               back there....

                              OWENS
               You mean that "load" of passengers?

                              FRY
               So what, we should both go down too?
               Out of sheer fucking nobility?

     Tortured silence. Fry's thumb moves to the switch that will
     jettison the passenger cabin. Jettison 50 people.


     INT. MAIN CABIN

     SELECTED SHOTS of faces inside cryo-lockers, among them JOHNS.
     He's prime-of-life, badge on display, some kind of cop. Shaken
     awake, he clears condensation to check the locker directly across
     from his, finding...

     RIDDICK. Small black goggles hide his eyes. A metal bit wedged
     in his mouth lends a perpetual grimace. A read-out admonishes
     "LOCK-OUT PROTOCOL IN EFFECT. ABSOLUTELY NO EARLY
     RELEASE."


     INT. FLIGHT DECK - DAY

                              OWENS
               Look, Fry. Company says we're responsible
               for every one of those --

                              FRY
               Company's not here, is it?

                              OWENS
               When captain went down, you stepped up --
               whether you like it or not. Now they
               train you for this, so --

                              FRY
               And there wasn't a simulated cockroach
               alive within 50 clicks of the simulated
               crash site! That's how they train you!
               On a fucking simulator!

     Owens unbuckles from his chair.

                              OWENS
               Don't touch that switch!

     Overcome by guilt, Fry retracts her thumb of mass destruction.
     But a HUGE JOLT puts the thumb right back.

                              FRY
               I'm not dying for them.

     She pushes it. But this time...


     EXT. SHIP - PLANET'S ATMOSPHERE - DAY

     No bolts fire. Nothing separates from the SHIP THAT SCREAMS DOWN
     through the clouds.


     INT. NAV-BAY - MAIN CABIN

     Now we see why: Owens reopened the jettison doors locally -- and
     blocked them open.

                              FRY
               Owens!

                              OWENS
               70 seconds! You still got 70 seconds to
               level this beast out!


     INT. FLIGHT DECK - DAY

     Seething anger and guilt, Fry pops more airbrakes, shedding more
     speed, more heat. The ship does level -- but it's still being
     pounded hellishly. She tries to get a stable view out...

     The windscreen. We're breaking through cloud-bottoms. There's
     just a glimpse of landscape before...


     EXT. SHIP - PLANET'S ATMOSPHERE - DAY

     An airbrake fails. It shears off and pinwheels into...


     INT. FLIGHT DECK - DAY

     The windscreen. It cracks into a thousand spiderwebs -- but
     impossibly it holds. For now.

                              OWENS (V.O.)
               What the shit was that?

     Sunlight flares from every fractured edge: It's like looking
     into burning diamonds, and Fry can only get an impression
     of the outside world. Now she has to rely on...

     A ground-mapping display. 120 meters altitude. And dropping.


     INT. CRYO-LOCKER - DAY

     INTERCUT Johns. Realizing he's in some kind of shit-storm, he
     claws at safety restraints.


     INT. FLIGHT DECK - DAY

     Ground-mapper: 60 meters. COLLISION ALARMS kick in.

     Out the fractured windscreen, we see a huge dark mass rise up
     into view. Land.

     40 meters...30...20...10....

     Fry braces.

     IMPACT. The WINDSCREENS IMPLODE. AIR HURRICANES in.


     INT. NAV-BAY - MAIN CABIN

     IMPACT. Chairs rip from their moorings. Strapped into one,
     Owens slams into the ceiling.


     INT. MAIN CABIN - DAY

     IMPACT. Johns BLOWS OUT of his locker -- and wishes to God he
     would've stayed inside, because just beside him...

     The hull is cracking open.

     NIGHTMARE SHOT: A huge section of the cabin tears free...
     skitters and CRASHES along the planetfloor behind us...and
     disintegrates out of sight. 40 cryo-lockers vanished with it.
     40 lives.


     INT. FLIGHT DECK - DAY

     Hammered by WIND, Fry opens her eyes experimentally.

     FRY'S POV: A vortex of motion, of speed, of blurring debris.
     But the ship is burrowing in. Burrowing under.

     Fry pivots her chair 180 degrees a nanosecond before...
     Dirt avalanches into the cockpit. It buries CAMERA.

                                                       BLACKOUT


     INT. MAIN CABIN - CRASH SHIP - DAY

     Choking yellow dust. Ghostly silhouettes are COUGHING, MOANING,
     CALLING OUT to other survivors in English and, surreally, in
     Arabic. Soon we find...

     Johns. Ears running blood. Stumbling his way to...

     Riddick's cryo-locker. Empty. Johns reaches for his holster.
     Gone, torn right off his belt. No prisoner and no weapon --
     spooky combination. Nearby he sees...

     The light of a cutting torch. Someone's using it to open a
     jammed cryo-locker. The plexi is torched away to reveal...

     AUDREY, 12 years old. Unscathed.

                              AUDREY
               Somethin' went wrong, huh?

     Johns searches for his pistol. Behind him, two chained feet
     lower into FRAME -- and then attack, swinging over Johns' head...
     getting the chain on his neck...twisting hard, using the chain as
     a choke-collar. Johns flicks open a baton, swings it up at...

     Riddick. Still in body chains and mouth-bit. Clinging to a
     ceiling support. Riding out the baton blows.

     Seconds from blacking out, Johns strains forward...forward...and
     finally breaks Riddick's grip on the support. He keeps hold of
     the chained feet so that...

     Riddick SLAMS HEADFIRST into the deck. Johns lays the baton on
     his neck.

                              JOHNS
               One chance and you blew it, Riddick.
               Never cease to disappoint me.


     INT. FLIGHT DECK - CRASH SHIP - DAY

     Darkness. A light beam sweeps the dusty air of the cockpit.
     It's packed with dirt, no signs of life. About to search
     elsewhere, Johns turns back at...

                              FRY (O.S.)
               Hey.

                              JOHNS
               Hey, who?

                              FRY (O.S.)
               Hey, me. Over here.

     His light finds a headrest sticking up from the dirt. Johns
     crawls closer, checks the other side of the headrest and finds
     her. Fry. Buried to the gills.

                              JOHNS
               Amazing. I'm Johns.

                              FRY
               Carolyn Fry. I'd shake hands, but...

     He manages a smile and starts digging her out. Almost dreading
     to ask:

                              FRY
               Are there any others, Johns?


     INT. MAIN CABIN - CRASH SHIP - DAY

     Johns helps Fry through the carnage. She's stunned by it all --
     but especially by the blast of sunlight where a hull used to be.

     Realizing she's in nav-bay, Fry starts digging like a search dog
     to uncover...

     Owens. Still strapped to his chair. Metal rod piercing his
     chest close to the heart. Dead. Fry reaches out to touch him.

                              OWENS
               Out, out, out, GET IT OUTTA ME!

     She recoils hard. He's still alive. The other survivors bungle
     over. Ten seconds of pure chaos:

                              VOICES
               Pull it out of him...No, it's too close to
               the heart...You gotta do it, just do it
               fast....

     Fry grabs the rod.

                              OWENS
               Don't touch it! Don't touch that switch!

                              VOICES
               You'll kill him, I'm tellin' you, shit,
               just leave it alone...delirious...doncha
               you got some drugs for this poor man....

                              OWENS
               Don't touch that switch!

                              FRY
               Awright, awright, someone...there's
               Anestaphine in the med-lock, that end of
               the cabin...next to....

     But there is no more "that end." In exquisite pain, Owens
     screams on. REACTION SHOTS of Johns, Audrey. Seldom are human
     beings witness to such raw suffering.

                              FRY
               Get away. Everybody.

     The others leave -- except for Audrey, staying behind to watch
     in morbid fascination. Johns doubles back and collars her.
     Leaving, they pass...

     Riddick, cuffed to a bulkhead. His eyes, still hidden by
     goggles, track Johns and Audrey toward daylight.


     EXT. CRASH SHIP - DAY

     The survivors straggle outside. CAMERA SURVEYS new faces:

     ZEKE and SHAZZA. Male-female team of bushwhackers, partners in
     life. Shazza has a tough sexiness. Zeke's face shows aboriginal
     blood. (30s.)

     PARIS. Overfed, overgroomed. A puff pastry of a man. (40s or
     50s.)

     Four male "Chrislams": The pillar-steady IMAM (50ish), and
     THREE PILGRIMS, young and excitable (late-teens). (NOTE: The
     Chrislams represent a union between Christianity and Islam. They
     have the iconography of Christians yet the physical look of Arab
     Muslims.)

     WIDE SHOT: All around them is stark and unforgiving terrain.
     The valley floor is relieved only by low hills to one side,
     spiked with earthen spires. Scorching down on everything are
     two suns -- one red, one yellow.

                              PARIS
               Well. Our own little slice of heaven.

     The Chrislams fall to their knees. Confusion as they try to
     orient themselves.

                              IMAM
               Please...which way to New Mecca? We must
               know the direction in order to pray.

     North? South? East? West? Nobody knows. Johns snaps open a
     compass, finds the needle swaying rudderlessly. The SCREAMING
     inside the ship finally ends.


     INT. CRASH SHIP - DAY

     As Fry holds Owens, now dead.


     EXT. CRASH SHIP - DAY

     The four Chrislams have devised a way to pray: Backs together,
     each faces a different compass point.


     EXT. TOP OF CRASH SHIP - DAY

     Fry climbs onto the back of the ship. Johns Paris, Zeke, Shazza,
     Audrey are already here.

                              JOHNS
               Big talk about a scouting party...

     Fry sees the huge smoldering scar in the ground behind the ship.
     One glance confirms that there are no other survivors.

                              JOHNS (CONT'D)
               ...then we saw this.

                              PARIS
               Anyone else having breathing problems?
               Aside from me?

                              AUDREY
               Like I just ran, or something....

                              SHAZZA
               Feel one lung short. All of us.

                              PARIS
               Well, I tend toward the asthmatic. And
               with all this dust....

     Faces turn to Fry: They're looking to her for answers.

                              FRY
               It's the atmosphere. Too much pressure,
               not enough oxygen. Might take a few days
               to --

                              ZEKE
               So what the bloody hell happened, anyways?

                              FRY
               Somethin' knocked us off-lane. Maybe a
               rogue comet. Maybe we'll never know.

                              SHAZZA
               Well, I for one, am thoroughly fucking
               grateful. This beast wasn't made to land
               like this. But cripes, you rode it down.
                         (to others)
               C'mon, you lousy ingrates, only reason
               we're alive is a'cuzza her.

     Others CHIME AGREEMENT, laying thankful hands on Fry's shoulders.
     HOLD on Fry, her face betraying nothing as they anoint her their
     savior.


     INT. MAIN CABIN - CRASH SHIP - DAY

     Breaking out pressure suits:

                              FRY
               Liquid oxygen canisters inside. Start
               ripping them out. Quick hits only -- try
               to make it last.

                              AUDREY
               Well, is someone coming for us? Or are
               we all just gonna die of exposure or
               dehydration or sunstroke or maybe even
               something worse?
                         (off their looks)
               Hey, you don't have to worry about scaring
               me.

                              SHAZZA
               We're worried you'll scare us.
                         (ushering her away)
               Name's "Audrey," right, love? And you're
               goin' to Taurus Three like we were?

                              AUDREY
               Yeah, but...do we even have enough food
               to get there? Or will we have to resort
               to cannibalism?

                              ZEKE
                         (to Fry)
               I'll see 'bout makin' this air go a bit
               further, cap'n. With your permission,
               a' course.

     Fry blinks. "They actually think I'm the captain." Zeke and the
     others get to work. Fry finds herself staring at another
     problem. Riddick.

                              FRY
               And him?

                              JOHNS
               Big Evil?

                              FRY
               We just keep him locked up forever?

                              JOHNS
               Be my choice. Already escaped once from
               the max-slam facility on --

                              FRY
               I don't need his life story. Is he really
               that dangerous?

                              JOHNS
               Only around humans.

     Riddick has his mouth on the hull, virtually licking the metal.
     Fry moves closer -- and now sees it sheeting down the hull.

                              FRY
               Oh, Christ....

     They're losing water. Suddenly Fry is running, snatching up an
     emergency light, climbing wall-rungs...


     INT. MACHINE LEVEL - CRASH SHIP - DAY

     And crawling through dusty superstructure to reach the water
     cistern. She opens a crank-hatch -- and finds light invading the
     interior. Her face dies.

                              ZEKE (V.O.)
                         (shouting)
               Well? Is it just the pump?

                              FRY
               Ask if anyone has anything in cargo!
               Anything to drink!


     INT. CARGO HOLD - DAY

     Oversize DOORS RUMBLE open. Fry, Johns, and Paris climb into
     this dark corridor lined with cargo containers. Each container
     has an access door.

                              PARIS
               Mine here....

     As Paris unlocks, Johns steadies himself, suddenly light-headed.

                              FRY
               S'matter?

                              JOHNS
               Little swamp-flu from the Conga system.
               Never shook it with all this cryo-sleep.

     Paris opens his container to reveal...


     INT. PARIS' CONTAINER - CARGO HOLD - DAY

     Tiffany chairs stacked 10 high. Bronze eagle lecterns. Oriental
     umbrellas. Neo-Egyptian castings.

                              JOHNS
               King Tut's tomb....

                              PARIS
               Be surprised what these will fetch in the
               Taurus system. Here. This Wooten here --
               easy, easy. Very rare.

     They open the Wooten desk. Cubbyholed inside are dusty bottles
     of sherry. Vintage Port. Glenfiddich. Bicardi 151.

                              FRY
               This is it? Booze? That's what you have
               to drink?

                              PARIS
                         (educating her)
               200-year-old single-malt scotch is to
               "booze" as foie gras is to "duck guts."

                              JOHNS
                         (cracking a bottle)
               A toast to whatever he just said.

                              PARIS
               I'll need a receipt for that.
                         (to Fry)
               For all these.

                              FRY
               Top of my list.

     She joins Johns for a drink. Entering, the Chrislams watch with
     both envy and aversion.

                              FRY
               I don't suppose....

                              IMAM
               One of the Christian habits we didn't
               adopt -- perhaps unfortunately. We'll
               have to wait.

                              JOHNS
               For what? There is no water. You
               understand that, don't you?

                              IMAM
               All deserts have water, somewhere. God
               shall lead us there.


     INT. MAIN CABIN - CRASH SHIP - DAY

     START on the cutting torch, abandoned in wreckage. Staring at it
     is...

     Riddick. With his hands cuffed behind him and around a bulkhead,
     he can't get near it. Or can he? Near the ceiling, the bulkhead
     is fractured -- a slim spot where maybe chains could pass through.

     Riddick stands. With a GRUESOME POPPING, he dislocates both
     shoulders...carries his arms overhead...passes the chains through
     the broken spot...and brings his arms down in front of him. A
     body-flex POPS HIS SHOULDERS back into joint.

     Free, he reaches for the cutting torch.


     EXT. CRASH SHIP - DAY

     Pistol in hand, Johns runs into a BIG CLOSEUP, eyes sweeping.
     Nothing on the horizon. But something lies on the ground nearby.
     It's Riddick's mouth-bit.

                              JOHNS
               Like we needed another way to die.


     INT. CARGO HOLD - DAY

     FAST CLOSEUPS: Hands pillaging storage lockers, pulling out
     anything that might qualify as a "weapon." It all gets hauled
     back and dumped into...

     INT. NAV BAY - CRASH SHIP - DAY

     Nav-bay. Gathered, the survivors take inventory: Johns has a
     pistol, shotgun, baton. Zeke and Shazza offer up a pick-ax,
     digging tools, hunting boomerang. Imam shows a ceremonial blade.
     Paris straggles in with antique curios.

                              JOHNS
               What the hell are these?

                              PARIS
               Maratha crow-bill war-picks from Northern
               India. Very rare.

                              ZEKE
               An' this?

                              PARIS
               Blow-dart hunting stick from Papua New
               Guinea. Very very rare, since the tribe's
               extinct.

                              ZEKE
               'Cuz they couldn't hunt shit with these
               things, be my guess.

                              PARIS
               Well, what's the need, anyway? If he's
               gone, he's gone. Why should he bother us?

                              JOHNS
               First, because he can only live out there
               for so long -- he's gonna come back and
               take what we got. Second, for the sheer
               thrill of the kill.

     A beat. They all grab for weapons.


     EXT. CRASH SHIP - DAY

     Johns stands atop the crash ship, scanning with a scope. He
     fixates on...

     A blue glow on the horizon. "What the hell is it?"

     Zeke and Shazza modify breather units, adding straps and tubing
     and ball-floats. The prototype is tested on Audrey. She sucks
     on the mouthpiece -- and finds that it works, supplying oxygen on
     demand rather than in a constant flow.

     Chrislams convert to traditional bedouin head-gear, readying for
     travel.

     Fry finishes wrapping Owens' body. She looks to the yellow sun,
     low on the horizon. The red sun seems inclined to follow.

                              FRY
               Imam. We should leave soon. Before
               nightfall but while it's cooler.

                              ZEKE
               What, you're goin' off, too?

                              FRY
               Johns is leaving you a gun. Just do me a
               favor, huh? Get my crewies buried? They
               were good guys who died bad.

                              SHAZZA
               A'course we will.

                              PILGRIM #1 (O.S.)
               Imam...Imam....

     (NOTE: "Imam" is pronounced "el-ee-MAM.")

     Fry and the others round the ship to see...

     A blue star flaring into view. It's rising as the other suns are
     setting.

                              SHAZZA
               My bloody oath....

                              AUDREY
               Three suns?

                              ZEKE
                         (to Fry)
               So much for your nightfall.

                              PARIS
               So much for my cocktail hour.

                              IMAM
               We take this to be a good sign -- a path,
               a direction from God.

     Johns swings down from the top of the ship.

                              JOHNS
               A very good sign.
                         (re: blue sun)
               That's Riddick's direction. You do not
               wanna be caught in the dark with this guy.

                              FRY
               Thought you found his restraints over
               there. Toward sunset.

                              JOHNS
                         (nodding)
               Which means he went toward sunrise.


     EXT. PLANET - DAY

     Trekking, the Chrislams waft incense pots and CHANT FROM
     THE KORAN as they head toward the blue star. Johns provides
     shotgun escort; Fry carries Paris' second war-pick on a shoulder.
     Silhouetted against the alien sky, the scouting party is an odd,
     odd sight.

     Already sun-battered, Johns crafts an eye-visor out of plexi.
     Fry tries to wrap her head like the Chrislams. Imam helps.

                              FRY
               So quiet. You get used to the sounds of
               the ship, then....

                              IMAM
               You know who Muhammad was?

                              FRY
               Some prophet guy?

                              IMAM
               "Some prophet guy." And a city man. But
               he had to travel to the desert -- where
               there was quiet -- to hear the words of
               God.

                              FRY
               You were on a pilgrimage? To New Mecca?

                              IMAM
                         (nodding)
               Chrislam teaches that once in every
               lifetime should there be a great hajj --
               a great pilgrimage. To know God, better,
               yes, but to know yourself as well.

                              FRY
               Frightening thought.

                              IMAM
                         (finishes wrapping her)
               We're all on the same hajj now.

     Fry notices Johns scope-locked on something.

                              FRY
               What?

                              JOHNS
                         (hands her scope)
               Tell me it's not a mirage.

     SCOPE POV: Beyond a distant rise, strange branches.

                              FRY
               Trees?


     EXT. CRASH SHIP - DAY

     Paris has taken over as look-out atop the ship. He deals with
     the heat by erecting a "misting" umbrella: He fills a reservoir
     with liquor, dials up a regulator. Umbrella spars shoot bursts
     of cooling alcohol vapor. Paris luxuriates in it.

                              ZEKE (O.S.)
               Comfy up there?

     Zeke appears below. He loads a scrap-metal sled with tarp,
     cable, pick-ax.

                              PARIS
               Amazing how you can do without the
               essentials of life -- so long as you have
               the luxuries.

                              ZEKE
               Well, just keep your bloody-fuckin' eyes
               open. Don't want that ratbag sneakin' up
               on me bloody-fuckin' arse.

     He drags the sled toward the spired hills. Keeping one eye on
     Zeke, Paris eases into a chair, lays the war-pick across his lap,
     pours himself a spot of sherry. As he sips, a blade touches his
     throat.

                              AUDREY
               He'd probably get you right here, right
               under the jaw. And you'd never hear him
               coming. That's how good Riddick is.

     Paris eases the hunting boomerang away.

                              PARIS
               Now did you run away from your parents?
               Or did they run away from you?

     EXT. BONEYARD OVERLOOK - DAY

     The scouting party approaches a rise. The trees loom just beyond.

                              PILGRIMS
               Allahu Akbar...Allahu Akbar....

     The young pilgrims break into a excited run, anticipating an
     oasis. But Fry hangs back, taking a harder look at the trees.
     They don't move in the wind.

     The pilgrims scramble up the rise -- and go motionless. Fry,
     Johns and Imam catch up to behold...

     The "trees" are actually the dorsal bones of a titanic skeleton,
     tinted green by lichen. Beyond is a sea of bleached animal
     bones. Impossibly, the bones seem to MOAN IN PAIN. All told,
     it's like Hell overflowed right here.

                              FRY
               Is this whole planet dead?

     A pilgrim questions Imam IN ARABIC.

                              IMAM
               He asks what could have killed so many
               great things...
         

     EXT. BONEYARD - DAY

     Moving into the boneyard:

                              IMAM
               Some...communal graveyard, perhaps...
               like the elephants of Earth....

     Fry touches one of the towering bones. It shows cut-marks --
     almost as if the bone was hacked by a sword. "Graveyard? Or
     killing field?"

                              JOHNS
               Long time ago. Whatever happened.


     EXT. SKULL - BONEYARD - DAY

     Pilgrim #1 reaches a huge skull laced with baleen-like combing.
     Wind hitting the comb makes a LOW HARMONIC MOANING. By
     moving a hand over the comb, the pilgrim can "play" DIRGELIKE
     MUSIC. Wanting to show off the trick:

                              PILGRIM #1
               Ah....

     He looks for Pilgrim #3 but can't spot him. And when he turns
     back to the skull -- a face is staring through the combing. But
     it's only...


     INT. SKULL - BONEYARD - DAY

     Pilgrim #3, inside the skull. Johns enters and chases him out.
     About to leave, Johns notices...

     Bone-chippings piled on the ground. It could be nothing, but
     still...

     Johns double-checks shadows, probing with the muzzle of his
     shotgun. Satisfied, Johns exits. Now BOOM UP to reveal...

     Riddick. Hidden in a sinus cavity.


     EXT. SKULL - BONEYARD - DAY

     Trailing the others, Fry pauses to change out the O2 on her
     breather.


     INT. SKULL - BONEYARD - DAY

     Riddick drops to the ground. His arms and hands are now pierced
     with shards of boneyard ivory -- fashionable little body talons.
     Spotting a shadow on the combing, he draws closer. And sees Fry.
     Alone.


     EXT. SKULL - BONEYARD - DAY

     Johns doubles back to Fry. He takes a hit of scotch, offers her
     some.

                              FRY
               Probably makes it worse. Dehydrates you
               even more.

                              JOHNS
               Probably right.

     They drink anyway. Moving out of the sun, Fry leans up against
     the combing. It brings her within arm's length of...


     INT. SKULL - BONEYARD - DAY

     Riddick. He pulls a bone-shiv, freshly chiseled.

                              JOHNS (O.S.)
               You know, I woulda played road dog for
               these guys. You could've stayed back.
               Pro'bly should've -- because, you know,
               if we don't find water....

     "We may not make it back."

                              FRY (O.S.)
               No, no, I wanted to get away.

                              JOHNS (O.S.)
               So I noticed. Never seen a "captain"
               quite so ready to leave her ship.

     Just as Riddick eases his blade toward Fry's neck...


     EXT. SKULL - BONEYARD - DAY

     She steps away.

                              FRY
               Better keep moving....

                              JOHNS
               What'd Owens mean? 'Bout not touching
               the switch?

     Fry searches his eyes, wondering if she can trust him -- and
     again she leans back on the combing. We can actually see Riddick
     now. They could too, if they would just TURN THE FUCK AROUND!

                              JOHNS (CONT'D)
               Hey. You can tell me, Carolyn.

                              FRY
               Promise me. Swear to me you won't --

                              JOHNS
               You see anybody else here? Just between
               you and me.

                              FRY
               During the landing...when things were
               at their worst...Owens was at his best.
               He's the one who wouldn't let the pilot
               dump the passenger cabin.

     Johns blinks, stunned. "Are you shittin' me?"


     INT. SKULL - BONEYARD - DAY

     Trying again, Riddick reaches out with his shiv -- and deftly
     slices off some of Fry's hair. A locket. A souvenir. That's
     all he wanted.

                              FRY (O.S.)
               So now you know.

                              JOHNS (O.S.)
               Fuck. Guess I'm more glad to be here than
               I thought.

     Riddick watches them move off -- then looks at the scotch bottle,
     left behind. It's still got one good swallow.


     EXT. START OF GAUNTLET - DAY

     Leaving the boneyard, the scouting party reaches a cleft in the
     hills. Ahead is a canyon.

                              JOHNS
               Hold up.

     He jumps onto a rock, puts the scope to an eye.

                              JOHNS (CONT'D)
               Didn't bite.

                              FRY
               What?

                              JOHNS
               Thought he might be coolin' it in the
               boneyard -- could either double-back to
               the ship or slip in behind us. So I left
               the bottle out as bait.

     SCOPE POV: PANNING the boneyard. FINDING the bottle. It's
     still got that one swallow.

                              JOHNS (CONT'D)
               But nah. Didn't bite.


     EXT. BONEYARD - DAY

     CLOSER on the bottle. Only we see that the scotch has been
     emptied -- and replaced with sand.


     EXT. GRAVE SITE - SPIRED HILLS - DAY

     Working under the shade of a tarp, Zeke digs a communal grave.
     Three wrapped corpses wait nearby. He keeps a sight-line on...

     The crash ship. Shazza waves. Zeke waves back.


     EXT. RIBCAGE - THE GAUNTLET - DAY

     The scouting party transits a narrowing canyon. Lined with rib
     bones, it makes us feel like we're in the belly of some beast.

     Fry squints at the ridgetops. More of those spires are visible
     on the canyon rims, looming like silent sentinels. "What are
     they? Just mineral deposits?"

                              PILGRIM #1
               Captain...captain....

     The Chrislams have found what appears to be a small desert plant.
     Leathery petals are spread wide, revealing a round stringy core.
     ARABIC DISCUSSION. Desert fruit? Is it edible?

                              FRY
               Wait, wait, wait....

     Fry takes the "plant," pushes the "petals" back down over the
     core. They all stare. It's a baseball.

                              IMAM
               We are not alone here, yes?

     They look ahead, wondering what awaits them. But Johns is
     looking back.

                              JOHNS
               Never thought we were.


     EXT. SETTLEMENT - DAY

     HIGH ANGLE: An old WEATHER COCK CREAKS in the wind. Fry,
     Johns, and the Chrislams enter FRAME far below.

                              PILGRIM #1
               Assalamoo ahlaykum!

     The GREETING ECHOES through the settlement, built from stacked
     shipping containers. Tattered sun-shades flap in the wind. A
     rusty bike lies on the ground.

                              PILGRIM #2
               Assalamoo ahlaykum!

                              JOHNS
               Long gone. Whoever they were.

     They move around a building -- and pull up short. Before them
     looms a moisture-recovery unit, a hulking machine in disrepair.
     Old jugs litter the ground.

                              IMAM
               Water...water there was here....

                              PILGRIMS
               Allahu Akbar....


                              IMAM
                         (translating)
               "God is Great," yes?

                              JOHNS
               I'm born-again.

     Fry manages a weary smile -- but soon her eyes revisit the
     abandoned buildings. "Who were these people? Why did they
     leave so much behind?"


     INT. MAIN ROOM - SETTLEMENT - DAY

     Through a window, we see the Johns and the Chrislams crawling
     over the moisture-recovery unit, assessing repairs. PULL BACK to
     include Fry inside the settlement, inspecting...

     Refectory table. Place settings out. Years of dust.

     Photos on the wall: Settlers working modest gardens. Playing
     baseball. Posing with children.

     INT. LIVING QUARTERS - SETTLEMENT - DAY

     Fry enters a dark room.

                              FRY
               Lights.

     No response to her command. She pats around for old-style wall
     switches. Nothing. Perceiving black-out blinds on a window, she
     throws them open to reveal...

     A man standing right outside.

                              JOHNS
                         (through window)
               Hey. Don't go too far, huh?

     Fry nods. Johns smiles, leaves. Just as her heart settles,
     SOMETHING CREAKS behind her.

     It's an orrery, a mechanical device that shows the motion of the
     planets around their suns. Solar powered, the orrery starts
     turning, CREAKING. One planet seems always to have sunlight.

                              FRY
               No darkness. No lights because no
               darkness....


     EXT. PORCH - SETTLEMENT - DAY

     Fry reaches a porch. It looks out over the rear of the
     settlement and more unforgiving terrain. She starts back
     inside -- but something glints at the edge of her vision. Fry
     turns back...parts clothes on a laundry line...and sees the
     source of the glint.

     Excited hits on her breather.

     Fry vaults off the porch -- and starts walking as if on magnetic
     bearing. Soon she's running.


     EXT. SETTLEMENT - DAY

                              FRY (V.O.)
               Allahu Akbar! Allahu Akbar!

     Johns and the Chrislams trade looks.


     EXT. SKIFF - DAY

                              FRY
               Allahu Akbar!

     Fry stops on a groomed runway, out of breath. The others catch
     up. They too marvel at...

     The skiff, a light-duty vehicle of hybrid technology -- part bush
     plane, part space craft. Its fabric wings are wind-torn -- but
     the hull looks intact.


     EXT. TOP OF CRASH SHIP - DAY

     CLOSE on caviar being added to toast-points.

     A SCRABBLING SOUND stops Paris in mid-bite. He eases out of his
     rocker, moves to the rear edge of the ship and looks down on...

     A shadow ducking under him. Small rocks still trickle down a
     dirt rampart just climbed by...someone.

                              PARIS
               This now qualifies as the worst fun I've
               ever had. Stop it.

     No response.


     EXT. CRASH SHIP - DAY

     War-pick in hand, Paris eases to ground-level. He checks the
     perimeter, looks inside the ship. Nobody. Is he being fucked
     with? Again? He hopes?

                              PARIS
               Audrey? Oh, Audrey....

                              AUDREY (O.S.)
               What?

     Paris spins. The voice came from the cargo hold -- and not where
     he expected.


     INT. CARGO HOLD - DAY

     Blades of sunlight stream in through cracks in the hull. Paris
     enters to find Shazza and Audrey cutting open containers,
     searching for usable goods.

                              PARIS
               Tell me that was you.

                              AUDREY
               Okay, it was me. What'd I do now?

                              PARIS
               Assailing my fragile sense of security,
               that's what.

                              SHAZZA
               What're you goin' on about? She's been
               right here for the last....

     They all see it: Sun-blades are momentarily blocked by something
     passing outside. Someone.

                              SHAZZA
                         (a quiet probe)
               Zeke?

     No answer. Audrey springs to the other side of hold, puts an eye
     to a crack there.

     HULL-CRACK POV: Far away, Zeke finishes digging the grave. He
     starts toward the ship.

     Audrey whirls back, mouths a silent alarm: "RIDDICK!"

     Paris goes bloodless. Shazza grabs the war-pick out of his
     frozen hands, moves catlike to the main doors and poises there,
     ready to strike. Audrey follows with the hunting boomerang.
     All eyes watch as...

     The sun-blades, winking off and on, chart Riddick's approach:
     We feel like we're inside a magician's sword box, watching the
     blades shave closer and closer to us. Suddenly he appears...

     And Shazza swings hard.

                              AUDREY
               No!

     Facing them is a TOTAL STRANGER -- burned, half naked, one hand
     still clutching the emergency-release lever of his cryo-locker.
     Shazza stopped one inch short of killing him.

                              TOTAL STRANGER
               I thought...my God, I thought I was the
               only one who....

     He lurches toward Shazza, trying to embrace her -- and sees blood
     and brain-bits BLAM-BLAMMING against her. His own. The stranger
     sinks bonelessly to the ground. FAST RACK to reveal Zeke in the
     background, pistol leveled. He reads Shazza's horrified face --
     and understands what he's done.

                              PARIS
               Oh, Lord....

                              AUDREY
               It was just somebody else. From the
               crash. He was just....

                              ZEKE
               Cripes galore, I thought it was him. The
               murderin' ratbag. I thought he was....

     He rushes over to check the dead stranger. As he bends down,
     FAST RACK AGAIN to reveal Riddick in the background. He stands
     20 paces off, still unseen by the others. His goggle eyes
     covet...

     Zeke's breather.


     EXT. SKIFF - DAY

     Fry exits the skiff.

                              FRY
               No juice, looks like it's been laid up
               for years. But we might be able to
               adapt --

                              JOHNS
               Shut up.

     Outside, Johns has an ear cocked to the wind.

                              JOHNS (CONT'D)
               Sorry. Thought I heard something.

                              FRY
               Like what?

                              JOHNS
               Like my pistola.


     EXT. GRAVE SITE - SPIRED HILLS - DAY

     START on the drag-sled carrying Corpse #4-- the stranger.

     Zeke reaches the grave. The sun-tarp has fallen on one side,
     blocking the sight-line between ship and grave. Zeke starts to
     unload the body -- but sees something he didn't notice before:
     There's some kind of opening at the bottom of the grave.

                              ZEKE
               Now what the bloody hell....

     Zeke hops down into the grave. CAMERA MOVES to reveal Riddick
     hidden among the spires. He's been waiting for a chance just
     like this.


     EXT. GRAVE - DAY

     Zeke drops to all fours. Looks into the tunnel. There seems to
     be some kind of burrow beyond.

     BURROW POV: Staring back at Zeke.

     Zeke takes a handlight off his belt, shines it into the burrow.
     It's the last thing he ever does.


     INT./EXT. CRASH SHIP - DAY

     As MORE GUNSHOTS jar Paris, Audrey, Shazza.


     EXT. GRAVE - DAY

     FURIOUS CLOSEUPS: Zeke fighting for his life. PISTOL BLASTING.
     Something slashing at him. Blood dancing on air.


     EXT. CRASH SHIP - DAY

     Shazza sprints across hard-pack, heading for...


     EXT. GRAVE SITE - SPIRED HILLS - DAY

     The grave. She slaps aside the tarp to find...

     Riddick. Bone-shiv in hand, he just stands on the other side of
     the grave. Shazza looks down. And SCREAMS.


     EXT. SPIRED HILLS - DAY

     CAMERA PURSUES Riddick as he lopes through the spires, running
     from the scene of the crime. He turns a blind corner -- and
     SOMETHING NEARLY BLOWS HIS HEAD OFF at close range. He hits
     ground. A boot steps on his neck, keeping him there.

                              JOHNS
               Same crap, different planet, huh?


     EXT. SETTLEMENT - DAY

     Sucking on their breathers, Fry and the Chrislams make it back to
     the ship. They find Johns beating Riddick like a chained dog.

                              JOHNS
               ...I don't play that...I don't play that
               so just try again. C'mon, Riddick, tell
               me a better lie....

                              FRY
               Ease up, ease up. JOHNS! Just tell me
               what....

     She hauls him off -- only to have Shazza start punching Riddick.

                              SHAZZA
               What'd you do with 'im? You bloody sick
               animal you, what'dja do with me Zeke?


     EXT. GRAVE SITE - SPIRED HILLS - DAY

     Fry and Johns stand over the grave. It's a gory mess -- but no
     sign of Zeke. Johns has Riddick's confiscated shiv.

                              FRY
               He used that?

                              JOHNS
               Sir Shiv-a-lot. He likes to cut.

                              FRY
               So why isn't it all bloody?

                              JOHNS
               I assume he licked it clean.


     INT. MAIN CABIN - CRASH SHIP - DAY

     Riddick is back in chains, face pulpy from the beating, listening
     to SOTTO VOCE VOICES outside. Fry enters, looks at him hard.

                              FRY
               So where is he?

     Riddick turns away, revealing a broken goggle-lens. The eye
     beneath is closed: For some reason, he won't look at her.

                              FRY
               Tell me about the sounds. You told them
               you heard something right before....
                         (no response)
               If you don't talk to me, Johns'll take
               another crack at it -- at your skull.

                              RIDDICK
               'Mean the whispers?

                              FRY
               What whispers?

                              RIDDICK
               The ones tellin' me to go for the sweet
               spot -- just to the left of the spine,
               fourth lumbar down. The abdominal aorta.
               What a gusher. Had a cup on his belt,
               so I used it to catch a little run-off.
               Metallic taste to it, human blood.
               Coppery. But if you cut it with
               peppermint schnapps, that goes away.
               Course, that's more for winter.
               Summertime, I take mine straight.

     Fry stares. Riddick gets a black satisfaction from his role as
     Boogeyman: If fear is the only kind of respect he can get,
     Riddick is going to grab some with both hands.

                              FRY
               Why don't we try the truth now?

     A head-shaking beat, then:

                              RIDDICK
               All you people are so scared of me --
               an' most days, I'd take that as a
               compliment -- but it ain't me you gotta
               worry about now.

                              FRY
               Show me your eyes.

     Again he turns away. She strips the goggles off. He sits with
     lids shut tight, anticipating the pain.

                              FRY
               Show me, Riddick.

     Imagine a virgin undressing in front of someone for the first
     time. That's how Riddick opens his eyes, startling us: No
     irises, just huge black-pool pupils. And from deep within, a
     jewel-like eyeshine. His eyes are as beautiful and unsettling as
     those of a starved jaguar.

                              FRY
               You did this? To yourself?

                              RIDDICK
               Slam doctor. Well, we called him "doctor."

                              FRY
               Heard about it. Just never seen it.

                              RIDDICK
               Fairly fuckin' ironic, wouldn't you say?
               Slamlight's so dim that you go and get
               your eyeballs taken out and shined up --
               then you wind up here. Three ass-kick
               suns.
                         (replacing goggles)
               Maybe I did do a few people. But not this
               one. No ma'am, not this time.

                              FRY
               Then where is he? He's not in the hole.
               We looked.

                              RIDDICK
               Look deeper.

     He CLICKS HIS TONGUE at her.


     EXT. CRASH SHIP - DAY

     Chain looped over one shoulder, Fry heads back to the grave site.
     Johns, Imam, Shazza, and Audrey keep pace as...

                              JOHNS
               I know what happened -- he went off on the
               guy, buried him on the hill somewhere, and
               now he's trying to --

                              FRY
               Let's just be sure.

                              JOHNS
               I am sure. Look, murders aside, Riddick
               belongs in the Asshole Hall of Fame. He
               loves the jaw-jackin', loves making you
               afraid, 'cuz that's all he has. And
               you're playing right into --

                              FRY
               We're gonna find the body, Johns. Christ,
               you're a cop. Why am I tellin' you this?
               We gotta go down and find it.

                              JOHNS
               Well, don't ask me to.

                              FRY
               Thought you didn't believe his story.

                              JOHNS
               I don't. But that ground looked none too
               stable, and I don't want anyone --

                              AUDREY
               If you're afraid, I'll go.

     He shoots Audrey a scowl.

                              FRY
               Nobody else is going down but me, okay?

                              JOHNS
                         (pulling her aside)
               Hey. Bein' ballsy with your life now
               doesn't change what came before -- it's
               just stupid.

                              FRY
               What, you think I'm doin' this to prove
               something?

                              JOHNS
               You said it, not me. Let's just not let
               one bad call lead to another.

                              FRY
               Thanks for the tip, Johns.

     "Now get outta my way."


     EXT. GRAVE - DAY

     Chain hooked to her web belt, Fry drops into the grave. She
     peers into the burrow...looks back up at the halo of faces above
     her...then slithers out of sight.


     INT. BURROW - DAY

     Letting her eyes adjust, Fry pats around lightly. Quickly she
     finds Zeke's handlight, tries it. Broken.


     EXT. GRAVE-SITE - SPIRED HILLS - DAY

     CLOSE on the chain slithering through hands, playing out as Fry
     moves deeper underground.


     INT. UPHILL TUNNEL - DAY

     Fry makes an uphill turn. Sees a spray of light ahead. Worms
     forward to reach...


     INT. THE LAIR - DAY

     Another chamber, wide and just large enough to stand in. Shafts
     of daylight bore down into the room. More old bones litter the
     floor. Fry moves into one shaft and looks up at...

     An earthen funnel. The inside of a spire.

                              FRY
               They're hollow....

     CLICK-CLICK.

     Fry slow-turns toward the sound.

     CLICK-CLICK-CLICK.

     There's something here, something just beyond the cusp of light.
     Something unfolding.

     An icy hand grips her heart. Soundlessly, Fry backtracks her
     chain, but...

     Something shadows across the exit. It stops her cold.

     Her hand finds something new. She angles it to the light. It's
     one of Zeke's boots -- with a bit of Zeke still in it.

     CLICKITY-CLICKITY-CLICKITY....

     The whole chamber is coming alive around her, shadows unfurling,
     skulking the perimeter, circling.

     Something impales the boot out of her hand, reclaiming it. It
     was faster than a lightning-strike.

     A paralyzed beat before...

     Fry makes her move, rolling back into the shaft of daylight and
     springing straight up into...


     INT. SPIRE - DAY

     The spire. Bracing against the walls, Fry tries to "walk" her
     way up -- but her chain goes taut. Did it catch on something?
     Or did something catch it? Fry starts pounding the earthen walls.

                              FRY
               Here! I'm in HERE, HERE, HERE!


     EXT. GRAVE-SITE - SPIRED HILLS - DAY

                              IMAM
               Did you hear....

     They drop down and suspend their heads over the bloody grave,
     listening. Nothing now.


     INT. SPIRE - DAY

                              FRY
               I'm over here in the --

     Something tugs on her chain.

                              FRY
               Oh, God....

     CLOSE on her feet. Kicking hard at the walls, trying to gouge
     out footholds.

     A stronger tug. Fry loses altitude, slipping closer to...

     The MADLY CLICKING LAIR below.

     She tries to jettison her belt -- but can't brace herself up and
     undo the belt. Suddenly...

     Something explodes near her head. Daylight appears, followed by
     faces, human faces. They're breaking through the spire with the
     pick-ax. Hands reach inside...


     EXT. SPIRED HILLS - DAY

     ...and birth her into daylight. Overlapping:

                              JOHNS
               We got you...it's okay, it's okay...we got
               you now....

                              IMAM
               The child heard you before any of us could
               even....

                              SHAZZA
               Did you find him? You find Zeke?

                              FRY
                         (half insane)
               ...wasn't Riddick...it was...it was...
               goddamn, that was stupid....but wasn't
               Riddick. Somethin' else down there that
               got Zeke and nearly got --

     Her. She flies back into the spire. Something's still got the
     chain.

     The others grab at flailing limbs. It's a tug-of-war now, human
     hands on one end, unseen "hands" on the other -- and the humans
     are losing. Until...

     Imam unsheathes his blade...

     And slices through Fry's belt.


     INT. SPIRE - DAY

     As the chain falls down the spire. Without Fry.


     INT./EXT. CRASH SHIP - DAY

     FAST SHOTS: Survivors packing up O2, liquor, umbrellas, the
     Koran -- whatever qualifies as "essential" on this planet. Amid
     the activity, Audrey pauses to look at...

     The spired hills.


     INT. BATTERY BAY - CRASH SHIP - DAY

     Fry and Imam pull a power cell from the ship's battery bay,
     THUMPING it down on the deck.

                              IMAM
               One is all?

                              FRY
               For now.


     INT. CARGO HOLD - DAY

     At his personal locker, Johns digs out a box of shotgun shells.
     He bypasses the blue-metal shells for a red-metal one. There's
     something special about it -- though what, we can't be sure.


     INT. MAIN CABIN - CRASH SHIP - DAY

     A shadow falls over Riddick. He doesn't look up.

                              RIDDICK
               Found somethin' worse than me, huh?

                              JOHNS
               We're movin'. And I'm just wondering if
               I shouldn't lighten the load right now.

     Now their eyes meet. Johns RATCHETS HIS SHOTGUN and points it
     at Riddick's head.

                              RIDDICK
               Woof, woof.

     The SHOTGUN EXPLODES. CAMERA PANS off of Johns to show
     Riddick still alive. The shotgun discharged next to his head and
     blew off his wrist chains.

                              JOHNS
               Want you to remember this moment, Riddick.
               The way it coulda gone and didn't.

                              RIDDICK
                         (deaf)
               Say that again.

                              JOHNS
               Here's the deal. You work without the
               chains, without the bit -- without the
               shivs. You help us get off this rock....

                              RIDDICK
               For what? The honor of goin' back to some
               asshole of a cell?

                              JOHNS
               Truth is, Riddick, I'm tired of this
               head-up shit. I wanna be free of you as
               much as you wanna be free of me.

     A beat. The future rearranges in Riddick's head.

                              RIDDICK
               You'd cut me loose, Boss?

                              JOHNS
               Only if we both get outta this alive.
               And there may be a way.

     He offers a hand to help Riddick up, to seal the deal.

                              RIDDICK
                         (staring at hand)
               My recommendation: Do me. Don't take
               the chance that I'll get shiv-happy on
               your wannabe ass. Ghost me, Riddick.
               Would if I were you.

                              JOHNS
               If you were me, I'd kill us both. C'mon,
               you wanna sit at the grown-up table or not?

     A beat. Riddick reaches out for the hand -- and grabs the
     shotgun with his off-hand. A blur of movement. Suddenly Johns
     is staring at the eyes of his own shotgun.

                              RIDDICK
               Want you to remember this moment.

     He pumps shotgun, spitting blue shells over Johns. He drops the
     emptied gun and walks away.


     EXT. PLANET - DAY

     EXTREMELY WIDE: Blue sun setting, yellow and red sun rising.
     The survivors trek for the settlement. Fry and Imam lug the
     power cell between them, but the real load is shouldered by...

     Riddick. Promoted from murderous monster to beast of burden,
     he tows a drag-sled heavy with cargo.

                              PARIS
                         (to Johns)
               So just like that. Wave your little wand
               and he's one of us now.

                              JOHNS
               Didn't say that. But least this way I
               don't have to worry about falling asleep
               and not wakin' up.

                              IMAM
               Well, I feel we owe Mr. Riddick amends.

                              SHAZZA
               Oh, right. Let's all line up and beg his
               forgiveness. Right you are.

                              IMAM
               At least give the man some oxygen....

                              JOHNS
               He's happy just bein' vertical. Leave him
               be.

                              AUDREY
               So I can talk to him now?

                              JOHNS/SHAZZA
                         (in unison)
               No.

     Paris drops a wine bottle. Trailing, Riddick collects it.

                              PARIS
               Paris P. Ogilvie. Antiquities dealer,
               entrepreneur.

                              RIDDICK
                         (shaking hands)
               Richard B. Riddick. Escaped convict,
               murderer.

     Instead of returning the bottle, Riddick opens it and drinks.
     Paris hurries to catch up to the others.

                              PARIS
               You know, if I owned Hell and this
               planet...I believe I'd rent this out and
               live in Hell.


     EXT. THE GAUNTLET - DAY

     FRY'S POV: Of spires high above us.

     The group falls silent as they transit the canyon, all eyes on
     the spires. Fry stops short, hearing...

     CLICKITY-CLICK.

     Neck hairs rise -- but soon the sound vanishes. The group starts
     moving again, faster.

     CLICKITY-CLICKITY-CLICK.

     Are they being stalked? Nervously, Fry traces the sound back
     to...

     Beads dangling from the belt of Pilgrim #1. Whenever he moves,
     the STRINGS CLACK together.


     EXT. SKIFF - DAY

                              PARIS
               I mean, usually I can appreciate antiques,
               but, uh....

     The survivors have reached the settlement. Fry is trying to get
     the power cell aboard the skiff as the others walk its exterior.

                              JOHNS
               Little ratty-ass.

                              FRY
               Nothing we can't repair -- so long as the
               electrical adapts.

                              SHAZZA
               Not a star-jumper.

                              RIDDICK
               Doesn't need to be. Use this to get back
               up to the Sol-Track Shipping Lanes, stick
               out a thumb. You'll get picked up.
                         (to Fry)
               Right?

     Fry looks from Riddick to Johns. "How did he know that?"

                              FRY
               Little help here?

     They muscle the power cell aboard. Riddick starts to follow, but
     Johns blocks. He doesn't want Riddick inside.

                              JOHNS
               Check those containers for me. See what
               we can patch wings with.


     EXT. SETTLEMENT - DAY

     With religious fervor, the Chrislams are repairing the moisture-
     recovery unit -- the machine Allah led them to.


     INT. SKIFF - DAY

     START on the battery bay. Hands are adapting the power cell to
     the skiffs older electrical system. Soon...

     Lights wink on throughout the ship.

                              FRY
               Okay, that should buy us a sys-check.
               But we'll need more cells.

                              JOHNS
               How many?

                              FRY
               15 6-gigs here...90 gigs total...other
               ship carries 20-gig cells, so...five.
               Five total to launch.

                              JOHNS
               25 kilos each, huh?

                              SHAZZA
               Old sand-cat outside. See if I can't get
               it up and chuggin'.

                              JOHNS
               Do it. And if you need an extra hand,
               tap our problem child out....
                         (looking out)
               Where's Riddick?


     EXT. SETTLEMENT - DAY

     He's walking the ghost town, finding dead gardens...upended
     chairs and furniture...broken skylights. Behind his back...

     Audrey and Pilgrim #3 (the youngest Chrislam) scurry through
     FRAME, stalking this curious monster in their midst.


     EXT. MOISTURE-RECOVERY UNIT - SETTLEMENT - DAY

     CLOSE on the other Chrislams, faces charged with anticipation
     while awaiting...

     The first drop of water. It appears at the bottom of a pipette.

     Tongues fight for it. Another drop forms in its place. Now
     another and another. It brings CHEERS.


     INT. MAIN ROOM - SETTLEMENT - DAY

     CLOSE on Paris' hands. Getting ready to celebrate, he unwraps
     crystal goblets...dusts off the refectory table...and rehangs an
     old Christmas garland. INTERCUT WITH...


     EXT. CORING ROOM - SETTLEMENT - DAY

     Hands digging in dirt.

     Covertly, Audrey and Pilgrim #3 watch Riddick digging near the
     entrance of a tall windowless structure.

     He excavates a pair of broken eyeglasses... a shattered light...
     and a child's tin robot, timeless. Riddick thumbs a solar panel
     clean. The robot's language program warbles to life:

                              ROBOT
               "...to all intruders. I am the guardian
               of this land. I will protect my masters
               at all cost. Death to all intruders..."

     Riddick stands and tries the doors. Locked. He peers through a
     small filthy window. Is there something moving inside? Nothing
     now. Riddick removes some windblown trash from a doorside sign.
     "Coring Room."

                              JOHNS (O.S.)
               Missin' the party. C'mon.

     It's Johns, keeping him on a short leash. Leaving, Riddick kicks
     a trash bin. Hard.

                              RIDDICK
               Missin' the party. C'mon.

     He leaves. HOLD on the trash bin a beat.


                              AUDREY (O.S.)
               Talkin' to me?


     INT. CORING ROOM - DAY

     PILGRIM'S POV: Of Audrey exiting the trash bin and running after
     Riddick and Johns.

     Pilgrim #3 is at the window of the coring room. He's found a way
     inside. By the window's feeble light, he starts exploring. Just
     visible at the center of this room is a vertical coring drill.


     INT. MAIN ROOM - SETTLEMENT - DAY

                              IMAM
               ...and for this, our gift of drink, we
               give thanks in the name of our Prophet,
               Muhammad, peace be upon him, and to our
               Lord, Jesus Christ of Nazareth, and to his
               father, Allah the Compassionate and the
               Merciful.

                              PARIS
                         (to himself)
               The strangest religion....

     Pilgrims finish pouring cloudy water into goblets. Riddick gets
     the last of it -- the part with sediment. SELECTED CLOSEUPS as
     they drink. Nothing ever tasted finer.

                              PARIS
               Perhaps we should toast our hosts. Who
               were these people, anyway? Miners?

                              SHAZZA
               Looks like geologists. Advance team,
               moves around from rock to rock.

                              JOHNS
               Musta crapped out here, huh?

                              AUDREY
               But why did they leave their ship?

     Silence. It's a question no one has chosen to deal with yet.
     Imam notices one water glass unspoken for.


     EXT. CORING ROOM - DAY

     CLOSE on the "Coring Room" sign. An attached solar panel begins
     moving, orienting toward sunlight. When it catches the full
     brunt of the suns' rays...

     STORM SHUTTERS unlatch on the roof.


     INT. CORING ROOM - DAY

     Pilgrim #3 hears SHOOTING LATCHES overhead. That sound brings
     another sound: A strange SKITTERING. The pilgrim looks up. Is
     there something in the rafters?


     INT. MAIN ROOM - SETTLEMENT - DAY

                              JOHNS
                         (answering Audrey)
               Well, just a skiff. Disposable, really.

                              PARIS
               Like an emergency life-raft, right?

                              SHAZZA
               Sure. Coulda had a real drop-ship take
               them off-planet. Long gone.

                              PARIS
               A toast to their ghosts, then....

     Goblets rise.

                              RIDDICK
               Didn't leave, these people. Whatever got
               Zeke got them. They're all dead.

     It's like he just pissed in the punchbowl.

                              RIDDICK (CONT'D)
               What, you don't really think they left
               with their clothes on the lines? Photos
               on the walls?

                              SHAZZA
               Maybe they had weight limits, you don't
               know.

                              RIDDICK
               I know you don't uncrate your emergency
               ship unless there's a fucking emergency.

                              JOHNS
               Rag it, Riddick. Nobody wants your
               theories on --

                              FRY
                         (to Riddick)
               So what happened? Where are they, then?

     Fry is the only one willing to look at reality -- or at least
     glance its way. At the window, Imam scans outside.

                              IMAM
               Has anyone seen the young one? Ali?

                              RIDDICK
                         (to Fry and Imam)
               Has anyone checked the coring room?


     INT. CORING ROOM - DAY

     Now the storm shutters start yawning open, spreading daylight
     over Pilgrim #3 and...

     The ceiling rafters. They're encrusted with thick nests of...
     something. The SKITTERING grows louder, more agitated.

     Sensing trouble, Pilgrim #3 hurries for a sliver of daylight in
     a wall -- the breach he entered through. He never gets there:

     Sunlight hits the first nest. It EXPLODES WITH LIFE.


     INT./EXT. MAIN ROOM - SETTLEMENT - DAY

     As Imam hears the SCREAM.

                              IMAM
               Ali....


     INT. CORING ROOM - DAY

     CHAOTIC SHOTS: More NESTS EXPLODE into individual creatures,
     winged hatchlings moving like bats in a fire, talons hacking and
     slashing. His exit blocked, Pilgrim #3 veers into...

     A dark supply room. He slams the door, MUMBLES A BLESSING and
     waits for the storm to pass. He's been cut -- but at least he's
     still alive.


     EXT. SETTLEMENT - DAY

     As the survivors run for the coring room.


     INT. MAIN ROOM - SETTLEMENT - DAY

     As Riddick stays behind to drink their water.


     INT. CORING ROOM - DAY

     HINGES ARE BLASTED AWAY. The door caves in. Imam shoulders
     past Johns to enter and find...

     The empty coring room.

                              IMAM
               Ali?

     A NOISE from the supply room. Is it Ali? Just too scared to
     come out? Imam opens the door...

     And hatchlings pour out.

     Moving with a gang-intelligence, they circle the room in a wave,
     soar high into the rafters -- then plunge into the coring shaft,
     SQUEALS VANISHING to infinity. Shocked silence, then...

     Pilgrim #3 tumbles to the ground. He's been shredded into bloody
     kite-tails. There was a nest inside the supply room.

     Imam falls on him in grief. Johns and Fry inch forward to peer
     down...

     The coring shaft. It's littered with human bones. The skeletons
     of the settlers. Scattered about and picked clean.


     EXT. SETTLEMENT - DAY

     Against a blue sunrise, the Chrislams hold a prayer service.
     Paris and Audrey attend. Riddick watches from afar.


     INT. CORING ROOM - DAY

                              SHAZZA
               Why was the door chained up? Why the
               bloody hell would they lock themselves in
               like that?

                              JOHNS
               Not sure, but tell you what: Chrislams
               better not be diggin' another grave out
               there.

                              RIDDICK (O.S.)
               Other buildings weren't secure...

     They turn. Riddick enters.

                              RIDDICK (CONT'D)
               ...so they ran here. Heaviest doors.
               Thought they'd be safe inside, but...
                         (looks down shaft)
               Someone forget to lock the back door.

     Shazza joins him at the shaft. Gazing on the human remains:

                              SHAZZA
               So that's what come of me Zeke. An' you
               saw it. You was right there.

     Riddick nods.

                              SHAZZA (CONT'D)
               You were tryin' to kill him too.

                              RIDDICK
                         (shrugging, "not
                          necessarily")
               Just wanted his O-2.
                         (a beat)
               Though I notice he tried to ghost my ass.
               When he shot up that stranger instead.

     Shazza can't deny it. She looks at him differently now, the man
     she once beat while in chains. She takes off her breather.

                              SHAZZA
               Take it.

                              RIDDICK
                         (suspicious)
               What, it's broken?

                              SHAZZA
               Startin' to acclimate, anyhow. Take it.

     Riddick accepts it awkwardly, sucks down some pure O2. Johns
     watches the exchange closely, not much liking the idea of Riddick
     being promoted to oxygen-breathing human.

                              JOHNS
                         (to Fry)
               Let's board this up and get the hell gone.
               They seem to stick to the dark, so if we
               stick to daylight, should be all --

                              FRY
               60 years ago.

                              JOHNS
               Wha'?

     Coring samples line the room, laid out on counters. Fry's been
     scrutinizing them.

                              FRY
               Core-samples are dated. Last one is 60
               years ago. This month.

                              SHAZZA
               Yeah? What's special about that?

                              FRY
               Dunno. Maybe nothing, but....

     But now Fry remembers...


     INT. LIVING QUARTERS - SETTLEMENT - DAY

     The orrery. The year-counter clicks over to "45" as...

     Fry opens the drive box and starts turning the main gear,
     accelerating the orbits.

     CLOSE on the counter. "56...57...58...59...60."

     They all see it: A giant ringed world eclipses the suns and
     plunges their planet into darkness. Persistent darkness.

                              JOHNS
               Are you fuckin' kidding me?

                              RIDDICK
               Not afraid of the dark, are you?


     EXT. SETTLEMENT - DAY

     Crossing the yard in wide strides:

                              FRY
               ...need those cells from the crash ship.
               Shit, still gotta check out the hull,
               patch the wings --

                              JOHNS
               Let's wait on the power cells.

                              FRY
               Wait for what? Until it's so dark we
               can't even find our way back to --

                              JOHNS
               We're not sure when it happens, so let's
               not --

                              FRY
               Get the fucking cells over here, Johns.
               What's the discussion?

     A beat.

                              JOHNS
               Ever tell you how Riddick escaped?


     INT. SKIFF - DAY

     Alone inside the skiff, Johns and Fry continue with more privacy.

                              FRY
                         (jarred)
               He can pilot?

                              JOHNS
               Hijacked a prison transport, made a
               helluva good run 'fore I tracked him down.

                              FRY
                         (with faint hope)
               Okay, maybe that's a good thing. Maybe I
               can use him to help with --

                              JOHNS
               He also figured out how to kill the pilot,
               Fry.

     A mental shiver.

                              FRY
               You said we were going to trust him now.
               You said there was a deal.

                              JOHNS
               That's what I said.

     He challenges her to read his mind.

                              FRY
               Oh, this is a dangerous game you're
               playing, Johns.

                              JOHNS
               May've noticed chains don't work on this
               guy. Only way we're truly safe is if he
               believes he's goin' free. But if he stops
               believin' --

                              FRY
               You mean, if he learns that you're gonna
               royally fuck him over.

                              JOHNS (CONT'D)
               -- we need a fail-safe. Bring the cells
               over at the last possible minute -- when
               the wings are ready, when we know we're
               ready to launch.

     Fry looks at him with new eyes.

                              FRY
               You know, he hasn't harmed any of us.
               Far as I can tell, he hasn't even lied
               to us. Just stick to the deal, Johns.
               Let him go if that's what it --

                              JOHNS
               He's a murderer. The law says he's gotta
               do his bid.

     Shaking her head, she looks off.

                              FRY
               Dancin' on razor blades here...

                              JOHNS
               I won't give him a chance to grab another
               ship -- or to slash another pilot's throat.


     EXT. SKIFF - SETTLEMENT - DAY

     Johns descends the gangway -- and finds Riddick erecting a field
     table in the shade of the skiff. He seems out of earshot. Now,
     anyway. As they trade looks, another flu-like shiver runs
     through Johns.

                              RIDDICK
               Bad sign. Shakin' like that in this heat.

     Johns moves on. The Chrislams appear, shouldering a roll of
     Vectran (wing-fabric material). They drop it on the table.
     Ready to cut bindings, Imam pats his hip for the knife that was
     just there.

                              RIDDICK
                         (looking after Johns)
               I'll cut.

     He has the knife.


     EXT. SETTLEMENT - DAY

     As Shazza and Audrey repair the sand-cat.


     EXT. SKIFF - DAY

     CLOSE on the knife slicing through the Vectran.

     Riddick hands the trim to Pilgrim #1. CAMERA FOLLOWS as he
     scampers onto the skiff...balance-beams over wing-struts...and
     delivers the piece to Imam, who stitches the fabric like an old
     Berber rug-weaver. Pilgrim #1 pauses to check on...

     The setting blue sun. Nothing unusual. Yet.


     INT. SKIFF - DAY

     The hatch closes, seals.

     CLOSE on a monitor. A "HULL INTEGRITY TEST" is underway. Fry
     scans rising pressure gauges.

                              RIDDICK (O.S.)
               Looks like we're a few shy....

     Fry whirls. Riddick is aboard, staring at the depleted battery
     bay. And he has Imam's blade.

                              RIDDICK (CONT'D)
               Power cells.

                              FRY
               They're coming.

                              RIDDICK
               Strange, not doin' a run-up on the main
               drive yet.
                         (half-beat)
               Strange unless he told you the particulars
               of my escape.

                              FRY
               I got the quick-and-ugly version.

                              RIDDICK
               An' now you're worried about a repeat of
               history?

                              FRY
               Entered our minds.

                              RIDDICK
               I asked what you thought.

                              FRY
               You scare me, Riddick. That's what you
               wanna hear, isn't it? There, I admit it,
               Can I get back to work now?

     She finds the courage to turn her back on him. Riddick moves
     closer -- and takes a beat to scan the controls. The cabin
     pressure builds.

                              RIDDICK
               Think Johns is an do-right man? You
               think I can trust him to cut me loose?

     A beat. Does Riddick already know? Is he testing her?

                              FRY
               Why, what'd you hear?

                              RIDDICK
               Well, guess if it was trickeration he'd
               just do me, huh? Then again...I am worth
               twice as much alive.
                         (reading her face)
               Didn't know? Johns ain't a cop. Oh, he's
               got that shiny badge an' all, but nah --
               he's just a merc and I'm just a payday.
               That's why he won't kill me. The creed is
               greed.

     It knocks her off stride, but...

                              FRY
               Save it, Riddick. We aren't gonna turn on
               each other -- no matter how hard you try.

     Riddick moves right up behind her.

                              RIDDICK
               I don't truly know what's gonna happen
               when the lights go out, Carolyn -- but I
               do know that once the dyin' starts, this
               little psycho family of ours is gonna rip
               itself apart. So you better find out the
               truth. Come nightfall, you better know
               exactly who's standing behind you.

     A monitor chirps the news: "HULL INTEGRITY --100%." EXHALING
     GASSES, the hatch opens automatically.

                              RIDDICK
               Oh, ask him 'bout those shakes. And ask
               why your crew-pal had to scream like that
               'fore he died.


     INT. PRIVATE ROOM - SETTLEMENT - DAY

     CLOSEUPS: Hands select a red-metal shotgun shell from a box...
     pull the shell open...remove a glass ampule hidden inside...drop
     the ampule into a injection syringe. The syringe touches an
     eager arm vein.

                              FRY (O.S.)
               Who are you? Really?

     Shirt off, Johns looks up. She's in the doorway.

                              FRY (CONT'D)
               You're not a real cop, are you? Just some
               mercenary who goes around talkin' about
               the law like --

                              JOHNS
               I never said I was.

                              FRY
               Never said you were a hype, either.

     She moves closer. Rummages through his stuff brazenly. Finds a
     shitload of red shells with the hidden ampules.

                              JOHNS
               You have a little caffeine in the morning,
               I have a little morphine. So what?

                              FRY
               And here you got two mornings every day.
               Wow, were you born lucky?

                              JOHNS
               Not a problem unless you're gonna make --

                              FRY
                         (lashing)
               You made it a problem when you let Owens
               die like that. When you had enough drugs
               to knock out a fucking mule-team.

                              JOHNS
               Owens was already dead. His brain just
               hadn't caught on to that fact.

                              FRY
               Anything else we should know about you,
               Johns? Christ, here I am lettin' you play
               games with our lives when --

     He catches her hands -- and moves them around his body, forcing
     her into an embrace. We understand why when we see a CLOSEUP
     of her hands: They find a jagged purple scar beside his spine.

                              JOHNS
               My first run-in with Riddick. Went for
               the sweet-spot and missed. They had to
               leave a piece of the shiv in there. I can
               feel it, sometimes, pressing against the
               cord.
                         (giving her hands back)
               So maybe the care and feeding of my
               nerve-endings is my business.

                              FRY
               You coulda helped. And you didn't.

     O.S., we hear the Chrislams JABBERING ARABIC and calling for
     "Captain, Captain...."

                              JOHNS
               Yeah, well, look to thine own ass first.
               Right, "captain"?

     It cuts deep.


     EXT. SETTLEMENT - DAY

     Fry and Johns move outside. The others have gathered, all eyes
     gang-locked on...

     An arch in the sky. Luminous, ominous, it grows from the horizon.

                              PARIS
               What do my eyes see?

                              FRY
               It's starting....

     They watch hypnotically as the arch rises, inching toward the two
     suns. Shazza shakes out of the trance first.

                              SHAZZA
                         (to Fry)
               If we need anything from the crash ship --
               I suggest we kick on. That sand-cat's
               solar.


     EXT. SETTLEMENT - DAY

     MULTIPLE SHOTS: Shazza cranking the sand-cat...hands snatching
     up lights, water, ropes...Chrislams piling aboard the sand-cat.

                              FRY
               LET'S GET THOSE CELLS!

     Sand-cat moving...Riddick jumping onto the rear bed....Paris and
     Audrey running, catching up.

                              SHAZZA
               We stay together! C'mon!


     INT. PRIVATE ROOM - SETTLEMENT - DAY

     Johns doubles back, grabs his shotgun shells, swings out the
     door...


     EXT. INCINERATOR - SETTLEMENT - DAY

     ...and catches up to the sand-cat. Riddick reels him aboard.

                              RIDDICK
               Don't wanna miss this.

                              AUDREY
               Lookit. Lookit!

     They turn back to see the rim of a giant planet. It's cresting
     over the horizon. The luminous arch is the planet's rings.


     EXT. RIBCAGE - THE GAUNTLET - DAY

     The sand-cat storms through the canyon. As it passes through the
     massive ribcage...

     The ROLL CAGE SMASHES OUT some low-bridge bones.


     EXT. CRASH SHIP - DAY

     The sand-cat reaches the crash ship. Bodies leap off. Paris
     steals a look at...

     The rising planet. It threatens to blot out suns, sky, universe.


     INT. BATTERY BAY - CRASH SHIP - DAY

     Johns yanks the first power cell and starts dragging it over the
     deck. Riddick yanks a second cell and, carrying it on his
     shoulder, passes Johns with a suck-my-ass grin. Johns shoulders
     his cell and stumbles after.


     EXT. CRASH SHIP - DAY

     Shazza wheels the sand-cat around, getting clearance between it
     and the ship.

     The Chrislams lash a scrap-metal sled to the sand-cat.

     Riddick drops the first cell onto the sled, Johns the second.
     They're racing the eclipse and each other.


     EXT. SKY - DAY TO DUSK

     As the rings of the planet eclipse the yellow sun.


     EXT. CRASH SHIP - DUSK

     It's like God just closed a blind: Daylight dims. The change in
     light brings a GROWING HIGH-PITCHED SOUND.

                              FRY
               Don't stop, don't stop....

     But Paris can't help himself. He squints to see...


     EXT. SPIRED HILLS - DUSK

     The spires. THE SOUND seems to come from there.


     EXT. SKY - DUSK

     As the rings eclipse the red sun.


     EXT. CRASH SHIP - DEEP DUSK

     A second darkness sweeps over the survivors. Now they all stop,
     beholding...


     EXT. SPIRED HILLS - DEEP DUSK

     Something pouring from the spire-tops. Backlit by coronal light,
     it first seems to be smoke or ash -- but soon we realize these
     are living things, HATCHLINGS SQUEALING IN DELIGHT over their
     first nightfall.


     EXT. CRASH SHIP - DEEP DUSK

                              JOHNS
               Jesus, how many can there....

     They keep coming, filling the sky with thick waves. Mercifully,
     the hatchlings seem to be moving away. But now one wave cleaves
     from another -- and does a quick about-face.

                              PARIS
               Just a suggestion, but perhaps we should
               flee.

                              FRY
               Cargo hold, everyone in the cargo hold.
               lesgo, lesgo, lesgo.

     They run. Reach the cargo hold. Turn back to see...

     Riddick and Shazza still coming. Hearing the SQUEALING WAVE
     descending on them...

     Riddick and Shazza hit to the dirt. Hatchlings torrent just
     inches overhead.

     CLOSE on Shazza. Horrified. Hard to breathe. Like being
     underwater.

     CLOSE on Riddick. He watches in awe, no more frightened that a
     kid lying on his back looking up at the stars. Experimenting, he
     eases a bone-shiv into the hatchlings. Instantly it's whittled
     down to nothing. It's like a river of razor blades.

     The hatchling keep coming. Shazza whips a panicky look at the
     cargo hold. Can she make it? Should she even try?

                              AUDREY
               Tell her to stay there. Stay down.
               SHAZZA, JUST STAY DOWN!

     Shazza starts worming toward the cargo hold. Suddenly the
     hatchings vanish. A beat. Is it safe? Shazza gets to her
     feet...

                              FRY
               No, no, NO, NO, NO....

     ...and the wave is back, enveloping Shazza.


     INT./EXT. CARGO HOLD - DEEP DUSK

     Standing in the mouth of the cargo container, the others get a
     last glimpse of Shazza as she flies by the doors, caught up in
     the funnel-cloud of hatchlings. Then she's simply gone.


     EXT. CRASH SHIP - DEEP DUSK

     Still on the ground, Riddick checks left and right like someone
     about to cross a busy street. Now he gets up, smacks his hands
     clean, strolls for the hold. Behind him...

     A rising GANG-CLICKING.

     CLOSE on Fry. She knows the sound better than anyone.


     EXT. SPIRED HILLS - DEEP DUSK

     The spires are crumbling, torn down from within.


     EXT. CRASH SHIP - DEEP DUSK

     Reaching the cargo hold, Riddick turns around for one last look.
     PUSH IN as he sheds goggles -- and looks at the world with his
     jaguar eyes.

     RIDDICK'S POV: In degraded image, we see the predators -- adult
     hatchlings -- emerge from the spires. They're large, mammalian,
     hammer-headed. They CLICK with echo-location, sounding out the
     world they haven't inhabited in 60 years.

                              FRY
               What is it? What's happening?

     RIDDICK'S POV: The predators launch from the hills, gliding,
     SOUNDING, searching.

                              RIDDICK
               Like I said. Ain't me you gotta worry
               about.


     EXT. SKY - DEEP DUSK TO NIGHT

     The rim of the planet overtakes both suns. The world goes dark.


     INT. CARGO HOLD - NIGHT

     Vault-like DOORS BOOM CLOSED.

     The survivors are locked inside the only secure part of the ship.
     Somehow they've been reduced to neanderthals huddling in their
     cave, listening to the howls of the sabertooths.

                              AUDREY
               What if...what if she's still out there...
               still alive....

                              JOHNS
               Well, I don't want to jump to conclusions
               here...but 'member that boneyard? These
               just might be the fuckers that killed
               every other living thing on this planet,
               okay? Chances of Shazza knockin' on that
               door anytime soon are just about zero
               squared.

                              FRY
                         (agreeing)
               I saw the cut-marks on the bones. Wasn't
               a natural die-off.

                              IMAM
               Quiet, please. Everyone.

     Imam is listening at the cargo door. The others pile up
     alongside, ears tuned like radar. CLICKING SWEEPS PAST outside.

                              AUDREY
                         (whispering)
               Why do they do that? Make that sound?

                              IMAM
               Perhaps the way they see. With sound,
               reflecting back.

                              FRY
                         (realizing)
               Echo-location. That's what it is....

     Now MORE CLICKING -- behind them. Lights whip around to find...

     Nothing. Only the door of an open container about halfway down
     the tunnel-like hold.

     A volley of looks. "How the fuck could one get in here?"

                              FRY
               Breach in the hull. I dunno.

     More CLICKING. Johns realizes they expect him to check it out.

                              JOHNS
               I'd rather piss glass.

                              RIDDICK
               Well, you got the big gauge.

                              JOHNS
               Wanna rag your fat mouth?

                              AUDREY
               Maybe it's just their beads again. Imam,
               are you still --

                              IMAM
               No, no, no, I do not believe --

                              JOHNS
               C'mon, man, you're drivin' everybody
               bugfuck with those things. Why don't you
               just lose the goddamn....

     More CLICKING -- along with the sound of TOPPLING CARGO.

                              RIDDICK
               Big beads.

     Butching up, Johns sucks on his breather and shimmies toward...

     The open container. Leading with his shotgun, he FIRES blindly
     around the door. Something SQUEALS -- then silence. Johns eases
     his head and a light around the door to spot...

     Hatchlings on the ground, blasted into dog food.

                              JOHNS
                         (to others)
               Okay. We're okay. Just some small ones
               that musta --

     Something WHOOSHES for his head, swinging like a scythe. It
     catches his shotgun, DISCHARGING IT, giving us...

     A flash-image of an adult predator. Up close.

     In one thin second, Johns is back with the others.

                              JOHNS
               Very big beads.

                              PARIS
               Not staying in here another....

     He goes for the main-door lever, ready to flee into the night.
     Fry lunges for him.

                              FRY
               Christ, you don't know what's out there!

                              PARIS
               I know what's in here!

                              IMAM
               Everybody come, this way and we should be
               safe. Hurry, please....


     INT. FIRST CONTAINER - CARGO HOLD - NIGHT

     Imam shepherds them into a container. The door slams closed.
     At first, only the sound of MOUTHS SUCKING BREATHERS. Then a
     SCRATCHING.

     Johns fumbles with a cutting torch. Gets it burning. Adjusts
     the gasses to illuminate...

     The door. Scythe-like blades are probing joints. Suddenly HEAVY
     BLOWS drive everyone back.

                              RIDDICK
                         (to Johns)
               Can you do sumpin' else with that?
               'Sides holding it in my fucking face?

     Taking the hint, Johns starts cutting the common wall between
     containers. It's a race between the sparks of his cutter and the
     blades of the predators.


     INT. SECOND CONTAINER - CARGO HOLD - NIGHT

     An burn-outline appears in the common wall. Johns kicks out the
     escape hatch. Audrey speed-crawls through first as...


     INT. FIRST CONTAINER - CARGO HOLD - NIGHT

     Predators shred into the container right behind them, CLICKING,
     sweeping, hunting.


     INT. THIRD/FOURTH CONTAINERS - CARGO HOLD - NIGHT

     SERIES OF SHOTS: Again and again, they burn a new escape hatch
     just as the predators break into the container being vacated,
     always entering darkness.


     INT. FIFTH CONTAINER - CARGO HOLD - NIGHT

     Inside their fifth container now, Johns torches away. Fry and
     Paris use cargo to block the entrance hole -- then block the
     cargo with their bodies.

     Riddick adds his weight -- until he notices pepper-shot in the
     cargo. Suspecting the worst, he leaves the others behind...

                              PARIS
               Hello, hello?

     ...and moves to the front of the container where darkness
     prevails. Something SQUISHES underfoot. He slips off goggles.

     RIDDICK'S POV: Of dead hatchlings on the floor. This is the
     open container, the one where Johns found predators.

     Sensing energy, Riddick lifts his face.

     RIDDICK'S POV: Of an adolescent predator. It squats atop cargo,
     eating a hatchling. A heavy bone-blade crowns its skull.

     Sensing Riddick, it sweeps the area with INQUISITIVE CLICKS.

     PREDATOR POV: Of Riddick.

     (NOTE: The PREDATOR POV is a crude image that gives impression
     without detail. We're "seeing" what the predator hears with
     echo-location. Think of a sonagram that strobes and wraps its
     subject in 3-D space.)

     Oblivious, the others kick out the new escape hatch. Audrey,
     Fry, and Johns worm through. Imam and Pilgrim #2 hang back.
     "Where's Riddick?"

     He's in a stare-down with a predator.

     Searching, Pilgrim #2 rounds a corner -- and finds his head
     caught in a vice-like grip.

                              RIDDICK
               Don't. Move.

     RIDDICK'S POV: As a second predator appears above them. This
     one reaches down with its scythe blade...

     And gently probes the two men. It wants know what they're made
     of.

     CLOSE on the pilgrim's shoes. Over-running with piss.

     More blades descend, moving over them like surgical instruments.
     One test-slices Riddick's shirt.


     INT. SIXTH CONTAINER - CARGO HOLD - NIGHT

     In the next container, Fry waits anxiously. Hissing through the
     escape hatch:

                              FRY
               Imam? Where are they?


     INT. FIFTH CONTAINER - CARGO HOLD - NIGHT

     CLOSE on a predator's scythe blade. It test-slices the pilgrim's
     skin. Blood wells up. All CLICKING CEASES.

                              IMAM (O.S.)
               Hasan?

                              FRY (O.S.)
               Riddick?

     TIGHT on the pilgrim -- more scared now that the clicking has
     stopped. Losing his nerve, he bolts.

                              RIDDICK
               No....

     The predators are on him, just blurs in the dark. DEATH-SCREAM.

     RIDDICK'S POV: A third predator appears above him.

     Making his move, Riddick darts around cargo and heads for the
     escape hatch as...

     Fry's light catches him square in the face. Blinded, Riddick
     HOWLS and stumbles forward. Fry's light leaps deeper to hit...

     The predator right behind him. With a similar reaction, the
     beast HOWLS and flails back.

     HOLD on Fry for a time-stopped moment. What stopped it? Was it
     really her? Suddenly a SHOTGUN EXPLODES beside her head. Jacked
     up, Johns is BLASTING shadows.

                              FRY
               Stop it, stop it, STOP IT!

                              JOHNS
               'Sokay, 'sokay. I killed it.

     They give him a look. "Sure you did." Suddenly a CARCASS SLAMS
     to the floor, sending everyone jumping back in a perfect splash-
     pattern. "Christ, he did kill one."

     Fry reclaims her dropped light and beams it on the carcass.
     Wherever the light strikes it, the flesh chars and steams.

                              FRY
               There....

                              PARIS
               Like the light is scalding it.

                              FRY
               It hurts them. Light actually hurts
               them....

     VULTURE SOUNDS from the two O.S. adolescents, fighting over the
     scraps of the pilgrim.

                              IMAM
               Is that...Hasan?

     Riddick nods.

                              JOHNS
               We'll burn a candle for him later. C'mon.


     INT. SIXTH CONTAINER - CARGO HOLD - NIGHT

     Cargo has been shoved against the door and walls. The survivors
     gather around Fry's handlight. Audrey -- tough little Audrey --
     has been reduced to a shivering lump of mush.

                              FRY
               ...one cutting torch...one handlight here,
               two more in the cabin...I think two
               more....

                              PARIS
               Spirits. Anything over 45 proof burns
               well.

                              FRY
               How many bottles?

                              PARIS
               Not sure. Ten?

                              FRY
               Those umbrellas, the ones that mist.
               Would they burn?
                         (reading his face)
               If you got a receipt?

                              PARIS
               Possibly.

                              FRY
               Awright. So maybe we'll have enough light.

                              JOHNS
               Enough for what?

     Now she challenges him to be the mind-reader.

                              JOHNS (CONT'D)
               Oh, lady. If you're in your right mind,
               I pray you go insane.

                              FRY
                         (to others)
               We can stick to the plan. If we get four
               cells back to the skiff, we're off this
               rock.

                              PARIS
               I hate to kill a beautiful theory with an
               ugly fact, but that sand-cat won't run at
               night.

                              FRY
               We'll have to carry the cells...drag
               them...whatever it takes.

     Troubled faces. Is it just our imagination? Or is the light on
     the floor growing dimmer?

                              AUDREY
               You mean...tonight? With all those things
               still out there?

                              PARIS
               Oh, sure. Why not? Sounds like a hoot.

                              JOHNS
               Back it up. How long can this last? Few
               minutes? Couple hours?

     No one knows for sure.

                              IMAM
               I had the impression...from the model...
               that the two planets were moving as one.
               That there would be...a lasting darkness.

                              JOHNS
               Those suns gotta come back sometime. And
               if these animals really are phobic about
               light, we just sit tight till then.

                              FRY
               I'm sure that's what someone else said.
               Locked inside that coring room.

     A persuasive thought. Eyes swing back to Audrey.

                              JOHNS
               Look, we gotta think about everyone now --
               the kid especially. How scared is she
               gonna be out there?

                              FRY
               Oh, don't use her like that, for a smoke
               screen.

                              JOHNS
               Smoke screen for what?

                              FRY
               For your own fear.

                              JOHNS
                         (eyes narrowing)
               Hey. Why don't you rag your hole for two
               seconds and let someone else come up with
               a plan that doesn't involve MASS SUICIDE?

     Two seconds pass.

                              FRY
               How much you weigh, Johns?

                              JOHNS
               What the hell's it matter?

                              FRY
               How much?

                              JOHNS
               79 kilos.

                              FRY
               Because you're 79 kilos of gutless white
               meat, and that's why you can't come up
               with a better plan.

     He makes a move for her. Riddick blocks. Johns' shotgun bumps
     the underside of Riddick's chin.

                              RIDDICK
               Think about that reward, Johns.

                              JOHNS
               I'm willing to take a cut in pay.

                              RIDDICK
               How 'bout a cut in your gut?

     Johns looks down. CAMERA DROPS to reveal the shiv Riddick holds,
     poised for evisceration.

                              JOHNS
               Oh, Trash Baby, you're gonna regret this.

                              IMAM
               Please...this solves nothing...please....

     Johns backs off first. The light grows dimmer.

                              FRY
                         (to Audrey)
               They're afraid of our light. That means
               we don't have to be so afraid of them.

                              IMAM
               And you're certain you can find the way
               back? Even in the dark?

                              FRY
               No, I'm not. But he can.

     She's pointing, of course, to Riddick.


     EXT. PLANET - NIGHT

     The eclipsing planet dominates half the sky. In whatever coronal
     light remains, we see clouds forming.


     EXT. CRASH SHIP - NIGHT

     Cargo doors crack open. Mixed for maximum flame, the cutter is
     pushed outside and swept around. Fry appears behind it.

     Moving like hostages, the survivors cross open ground, trying not
     to heed the PRIMAL SOUNDS beyond their light. Soon they reach...

     The main cabin. Blackness inside.

                              FRY
               Riddick.

     He lifts his goggles.

     RIDDICK'S POV: Checking the cabin. Finding a lot of wreckage
     but no life.

                              RIDDICK
               Looks clear.

     Johns shoulders ahead and crawls in first. Just as he stands up
     inside...

     A PREDATOR BUZZSAWS over his head, fleeing the cabin, taking off
     into the night.

                              JOHNS
               Fuck me. You said "clear."

                              RIDDICK
               Said "looks clear."

                              JOHNS
               Well, what's it look like now?

                              RIDDICK
                         (rechecking)
               Looks clear.

                              FRY
               Just get the goddamn lights on....

     They scramble aboard. Riddick TONGUE-CLICKS behind Johns.
     He isn't amused.


     INT. MAIN CABIN - CRASH SHIP - NIGHT

     PREP MONTAGE: We see the survivors powering up cabin lights...
     yanking three more cells from the battery bay...threading nylon
     cord through Paris' misting umbrellas, filling the reservoirs
     with high-octane liquor...swapping out O2 canisters.


     INT. MAIN CABIN - CRASH SHIP - NIGHT

     Reloading his shotgun, Johns finds himself shaking again. He
     unpockets a shell -- a red morphine shell -- and gives it a
     lover's look. Behind him...

                              FRY
               Ready, Johns.

     He palms the shell.

                              JOHNS
               He'll lead you over the first cliff.
               You know that, don't you?

                              FRY
               We're just burnin' light here.

                              JOHNS
               You give him the cells and the ship --
               and he will leave you. He will leave you
               all out there to die.

                              FRY
               I don't get it, Johns. What is so goddamn
               valuable in your life that you're worried
               about losing? Huh? Is there anything at
               all? Besides your next hype?
                         (no response)
               Got no right to be so scared. Neither one
               of us.


     INT. BATTERY BAY - CRASH SHIP - NIGHT

     As hands yank the last power cell.


     INT. MAIN CABIN - CRASH SHIP - NIGHT

     Cabin lights die. Still brooding, Johns finishes loading his
     shotgun in the dark.


     EXT. CRASH SHIP - NIGHT

     CLOSE on a burning wick. Alcohol mist shoots across the flame to
     create...

     A FIREBALL. Two umbrella torches, fabric already burned away,
     BELCH FIREBALLS into the night. By this light and more, we see...

     Imam chained into the first harness of the drag-sled. Beside
     him, Johns fumbles with a second harness. Hands help him into
     the chains. The hands belong to...

     Riddick. Both men recognize the irony of the prisoner helping
     his captor into chains.

                              FRY
                         (to all)
               Keep the light going. That's all we have
               to do to live through this. Just keep
               your light burning.

     Riddick loops a handlight over his neck, places it to shine light
     down his back. A beacon.

                              RIDDICK
                         (to Fry)
               Be runnin' about 10 paces ahead. I want
               light on my back -- but not in my eyes.
               And check your cuts. These things know
               our blood now.

     CLOSE on Audrey. Overhearing, she goes stone-faced.

                              FRY
               Riddick...was thinkin' we should make some
               kind of deal. Just in case, you know,
               this actually --

                              RIDDICK
                         (shaking head)
               Had it with deals.

                              FRY
               But I just wanted to say --

                              RIDDICK
               Nobody's gonna turn a murderer loose.
               I fuckin' knew better.

     It worries Fry. "If he doesn't expect to go free...."

                              RIDDICK (CONT'D)
               Been a long time since anyone's trusted
               me. That's somethin' right there.

                              FRY
               We can, can't we? Trust you?

                              RIDDICK
               Actually...
                         (completely genuine)
               That's what I been askin' myself.

     He walks away. HOLD on Fry -- wondering if she hasn't made a
     terrible, terrible mistake.


     EXT. NIGHT

     The drag-sled begins moving.

     SERIES OF TRACKING SHOTS: Riddick running point, goggles off,
     eyes flashing. Johns and Imam pulling the drag-sled like
     malamutes, handlights sweeping. Pilgrims #1 at the first side-
     guard position, Fry and Audrey at the second, each position
     carrying an umbrella torch, FIREBALLS BLAZING. Paris stumbling
     along at rear-point, sweeping the cutter back and forth, every
     shadow a threat. They are a train of light.

     CLOSE on the sled. Holding four power cells and eight bottles
     of booze.

     CLOSE on Fry. Looking down. Noting sand-cat tracks underfoot.


     EXT. NIGHT

     Below us run the survivors. CRANE UP AND AWAY so that their
     lights become insignificant...so that we include, in FOREGROUND,
     the silhouettes of gliding predators. They're following from
     above, awaiting their chance.


     EXT. NIGHT

     FRY'S POV: Of the ground. The sand-cat tracks have vanished.

                              JOHNS
               So you noticed too?

                              FRY
               Riddick. Riddick.

     The procession grinds to a halt. Everyone sucks hard on
     breathers as they muster inside the light.

                              FRY
               Where are the sand-cat tracks? Why aren't
               we still following them?

                              RIDDICK
               Saw something I didn't like.

                              JOHNS
               Such as.

                              RIDDICK
               Hard to tell, sometimes...even for me...
               but looked like a bunch of those big boys
               chewin' each other's gonads off. Thought
               we'd swing wide. Okay by you?

     Paris looks over his shoulder. "We went around what?" Nearby
     CLICKING breaks up the confrontation.

                              FRY
               Let's move.
                         (to Audrey)
               Just a detour. He'll get us there.

                              PARIS
               Can we switch?

                              FRY
               What, switch what?

                              PARIS
               I think I twisted my ankle running
               backwards like that. And I'm not sure I
               can....
                         (off their stares)
               Okay, that's a lie. I just don't want to
               be alone back there anymore. If you could
               just give me a few minutes up front here --

                              JOHNS
               She's the pilot, she should stay close to
               the cells.

                              PARIS
               Oh, so I'm disposable?

                              FRY
               I'll switch, I'll switch! Christ, just
               get this train moving!


     EXT. NIGHT

     They trundle on, Fry the new tail-gunner.

     At side guard, Paris relaxes a bit -- even though the CLICKING
     never seems far from earshot. A weak FIREBALL SPEWS from his
     torch. He checks the reservoir. Almost empty.

                              PARIS
               Light, please, need light here....

     Still moving, Johns and Imam train lights on Paris while he
     refuels. For a brief moment, Audrey strays from the light.

     PREDATOR'S POV: Dive-bombing the girl.

     A HIGH-VELOCITY CLICKING: It's like an incoming missile. Imam
     lunges at the last nanosecond...

     And flattens Audrey to the ground. Scythe blades swing...

     CHINKING the harness-chains on Imam's back.

     Johns whirls, BLASTS. Light-beams leap around. But the predator
     is long gone.

                              IMAM
                         (trembling)
               Please...have we been cut? Can someone
               tell me if....

     He finds his dropped light, thumbs the switch again and again.
     Broken.

     In the confusion, Paris has been left in the dark. Something
     slashes him from behind. It's like the night has claws.

                              PARIS
               Oh, sweet Jesus....

     The bottle drops.

     The blood flows.

     The CLICKING STOPS.

                              PARIS
               Oh, sweet Jesus, WILL YOU GET ME SOME
               LIGHT OVER HERE!

     Faces whip around. But before their lights can rescue him...

     Paris is gone, snatched away by a swooping blur.

     Light-beams jump fitfully, vainly.

     RIDDICK'S POV: Of predators feasting on Paris. Carrying a
     youngling on its back, a female predator arrives late and can't
     find a place at the trough. With shocking apathy, it whips the
     youngling off its back and begins devouring it. Other predators
     start in-fighting, killing themselves for food. POV PANS to a
     pair of predators, closer, SOUNDING out new prey. POV PANS
     AGAIN to include the object of their desire. Audrey.

     CLOSE on Riddick. Trying to figure it out.

     CLOSE on Audrey. Listening to the HORRIFIC FEEDING SOUNDS.
     Oblivious to all the attention she's getting.

                              FRY
               What do you see? Riddick?

                              RIDDICK
               Hunger. I see 60 years of hunger.


     EXT. SKY - NIGHT

     As clouds mass.


     EXT. NIGHT

     Into a rising wind, the survivors range on.

     Audrey now carries Paris' torch, refueled and COUGHING FIREBALLS
     at regular intervals. Fry seems to be handling rear-point fairly
     well, until...

     The cutter sputters and dies. She ditches it and takes the torch
     from Audrey.

                              FRY
               Bottle-count.

                              AUDREY
               Four fulls, one half. That mean we're
               halfway there? I hope?

     Good question. They've just been blindly following...

     The light on Riddick's back.

                              FRY
               Can we pick up the pace?

     Working like a mule, Johns growls to himself. "If you think you
     can do better...." Abruptly he slaps an arm across Imam's chest,
     spotting...

     A sled-track. In front of them.

     Fry hears a SHOTGUN RATCHET. She spins to see...

     Johns out of his chains. Moving forward. Jamming the shotgun
     into the back of Riddick's neck.

                              JOHNS
               We aren't completely stupid.

                              FRY
               Stay in the light! Everybody! Stay in
               the fucking --

                              IMAM
               We crossed our own tracks.

                              JOHNS
               He's running us 'round in circles. Look
               for yourself. Look!

                              FRY
               Riddick? What the hell are you --

                              RIDDICK
               Listen.

     Imagine a hundred Geiger-counters next to a truckload of
     plutonium. That's the SOUND that rides the wind now.

                              RIDDICK
               Canyon ahead. I circled once to buy some
               time to think.

                              FRY
               Think about what?

                              JOHNS
               About how to kill us and still get these
               cells to the skiff. Goddamnit, we're just
               doin' the heavy lifting for this prick!

                              RIDDICK
                         (answering Fry)
               About the girl.

                              FRY
               What about her?

                              RIDDICK
               What it's gonna be like when we hit that
               canyon. With her bleeding.

                              JOHNS
               What're you jaw-jackin' about? Girl's not
               cut.

                              RIDDICK
                         (agreeing)
               No. She's not.

     It hits Fry like a two-by-four. She looks at Audrey.

                              AUDREY
                         (confessing)
               I didn't want you to leave me there...
               back at the ship...that's why I didn't
               say anything....

                              FRY
               No, we'd never....Oh, God, honey, you
               shoulda told me sooner.

                              JOHNS
                         (finally getting it)
               Aw, this can't be happening to me....

                              RIDDICK
               They been nose-open for her ever since we
               left. They go off blood.

                              IMAM
               Well...we must keep her close, then.
               Here, she'll be safe if we put her
               between --

                              RIDDICK
                         (scanning)
               There is no "safe."

     An epic beat. The wind gusts...the FLAMES CHATTER...their ears
     fill with CANYON SOUNDS.

                              FRY
               It's not gonna work. We gotta go back.

     Johns brays.

                              JOHNS
               Hey, you're the one who got me out here,
               turned me into a goddamn sled dog. An'
               now you 'spect me to go back like a
               whipped dog?

                              FRY
               I was wrong. I admit it. My bad, okay?
               Now let's just go back to the ship.

                              JOHNS
               I dunno. Nice breeze, wide open spaces --
               you know, I'm startin' to enjoy myself out
               here.

                              FRY
               Are you fucking high again? Just listen
               to --

                              JOHNS
               No, no, you're right, Fry. What's to be
               afraid of? My life is a steamin' pile of
               meaningless toadshit anyhow. So I say
               mush on! Canyon's only couple hundred
               meters, after that we're in Skiff City!
               So why don't you just butch up, stuff a
               cork in that kid, and get --

                              IMAM
               She's the captain, we should listen to --

                              JOHNS
               Listen to her? Her? When she was willing
               to sacrifice us all?

     A beat. Eyes turn to Fry. She wants to protest -- but can't.

                              AUDREY
               What's he talkin' about?

                              JOHNS
               During the crash, she --

                              FRY
                         (a warning growl)
               This does not help us, Johns.

                              JOHNS
               -- she tried to blow the whole fucking
               passenger cabin, tried to kill us --

                              FRY
               Just shut up, okay?

                              JOHNS
               -- tried to kill us in our sleep. Paris
               had it right -- we are disposable. We're
               just walking ghosts to her.

                              FRY
               Would you RAG YOUR STUPID HOLE!

     She rushes him, ready to rip his eyes out. He shunts her aside.

                              JOHNS
               We're not alive because of her -- we're
               alive in spite of her.

     He swung below the belt -- and connected. Fry's chin quakes,
     her knees fail. The undertow of events finally pulls her down.

                              FRY
               We cannot go through there....

                              JOHNS
                         (lording)
               How much you weigh right now, Fry? Huh?

                              IMAM
                         (pushing him back)
               Fine, fine, you've made your point. We
               can all be so scared as you.

     Johns snatches a light away from Imam.

                              JOHNS
                         (to all)
               Verdict's in. The light moves forward.


     EXT. BONEYARD - NIGHT

     They trudge on, slower now, building reserves for the canyon-run.
     At rear-point, Fry follows like a broken rudder. Pilgrim #1 now
     draws the sled with Imam. And up ahead...


     EXT. BONEYARD - NIGHT

     Johns falls in step with Riddick.

                              JOHNS
               Ain't all of us gonna make it.

                              RIDDICK
               Just realized that, huh?

     CLICKING nearby. Johns BLASTS the night, driving the sound
     away -- and reminding everyone of who carries the Big Gauge.

                              JOHNS
               Six of us left. If we could get through
               that canyon and lose just one, that'd be
               quite a fucking feat, huh? A good thing,
               right?

                              RIDDICK
               Not if I'm the one.

                              JOHNS
               What if you're one of five?

     Riddick stares. "I'm listening."


     EXT. BONEYARD - NIGHT

                              AUDREY
               What're they doin' up there?

                              IMAM
               Talking about the canyon, I suppose.
               How to get us through.

     Overhearing, Fry looks. It's odd to see Johns and Riddick
     walking side by side, like equals. Like partners.


     EXT. BONEYARD - NIGHT

                              JOHNS
               Look, it's hellified stuff -- but no
               different than those battlefield doctors
               when they have to decide who lives and who
               dies. It's called "triage," okay?

                              RIDDICK
               Kept calling it "murder" when I did it.

                              JOHNS
               Either way, figure it's something you can
               grab onto.

                              RIDDICK
                         (doping it out)
               Sacrifice play. Hack up one body, leave
               it at start of the canyon. Like a bucket
               of chum.

                              JOHNS
               Trawl with it. There's a cable on the
               sled. We can drag the body behind us.

                              RIDDICK
               Nice embellishment.

                              JOHNS
               Don't wanna feed these land-sharks -- just
               keep 'em off our scent.

                              RIDDICK
                         (looking back)
               So which one caught your eye?

                              JOHNS
               Don' look, don' look, don' look....


     EXT. BONEYARD - NIGHT

     Fry spots Riddick's look -- and Johns' non-look.

                              FRY
               Imam. Slow down.

                              IMAM
               What?

                              FRY
               Don't stop, just slow down.  Little more
               space 'tween us and them.

                              IMAM
               I would rather we all stay--

                              FRY
               Do what I say. Please.


     EXT. BONEYARD - NIGHT

                              RIDDICK
               What's her name, anyway?

                              JOHNS
               What do you care?

     Riddick shrugs. "I don't."

                              JOHNS
               Then let's not name the Thanksgiving
               turkey, okay? I assume you still got a
               shiv.

                              RIDDICK
               What, you 'spect me to do it?

                              JOHNS
               What's one more to you? Like this is the
               one that sends you to Hell?

                              RIDDICK
               Oh, you're a piece of art, Johns. They
               oughtta hang you in a museum somewhere.
               Or forget the museum -- maybe they should
               just hang you.


     EXT. BONEYARD - NIGHT

     As Fry and the others keep slowing.


     EXT. BONEYARD - NIGHT

                              JOHNS
               Awright. You do the girl, I'll keep the
               others off your back.

     Riddick stops. Reconsiders.

                              JOHNS (CONT'D)
               Aw, don't tell me you're growin' scruples.

                              RIDDICK
                         (shakes head)
               Just wonderin' if we don't need a bigger
               piece of chum.

                              JOHNS
               Like who, Mr. Chrislam?

     EXTREMELY TIGHT on both men: In their eyes, we see the new
     partnership splintering apart: "Like Mr. Johns."

     Riddick makes a play for the shotgun. It BLASTS skyward.


     EXT. BONEYARD - NIGHT

     As the fight erupts:

                              FRY
               Bring the light!

                              AUDREY
               What're they doing? What're we --

                              FRY
               Leave the sled, let's go, go, go!


     EXT. BONEYARD - NIGHT

     FIGHT SCENE: Johns' light hits the ground, creating an arena of
     illumination. FAST CLICKING nearby. Still struggling, Riddick
     and Johns somehow manage to gang-aim the shotgun and BLAST THE
     CLICKING AWAY.

     The shotgun goes free. Johns lunges for it, but Riddick kicks it
     into the night. And then pulls his shiv.

                              RIDDICK
               Gotta stay in the light, Johns. That's
               the only rule.

     Johns circles inside the light. Fucking with him, Riddick starts
     poking and jabbing, backing him up against the wail of dark.
     Johns stumbles over something. A bone. A club.

     Riddick finds his own bone-club, and now they go at it like two
     cavemen. Riddick beats on Johns' club-hand, breaking fingers,
     forcing him to drop the bone. Just trying to get away now, Johns
     makes a desperate lunge for the light, but...

     Riddick shivs open his back.

                              RIDDICK
               Remember that moment?

     Gushing blood, Johns starts crawling pathetically with the light.
     Riddick dogs him.

                              RIDDICK
               Shoulda never took the chains off, Johns.
               You were one brave fuck, before. Now look
               at you. Oh, yeah, you were Billy Bad-ass
               with your gauge...with your chains....

     Johns finds the shotgun. "And I'm still Billy Bad-ass." He
     sweeps it around with the light, ready to kill...

     Blackness. Where'd Riddick go?

     CLICKING behind Johns. He whirls to see...

     Something big coming for him. Johns BLASTS IT back into the
     night, dropping the light as he does. Eyes in the back of his
     head, he whirls again and takes aim on...

     Another bull-rushing predator.

     Johns triggers a bad round. Crazed, he ratchets and levels the
     shotgun for another try. He's too late.

     BIG CLOSEUP as the ejected shell rolls to a stop. It's red.
     Johns loaded a morphine shell in the dark.

     RIDDICK'S POV: With Johns skewered by the armpits, the predator
     lifts him off the ground and "stares" with a deceptively gentle
     CLICKING-COOING SOUND.

     PREDATOR'S POV: Of Johns' final expression.

     RIDDICK'S POV: The predator rears back its head -- then slams
     forward, hitting Johns with the full force of its skull-blade,
     splitting him in two.


     EXT. NIGHT

     Fry, Imam, Audrey, Pilgrim #1. They're running, stumbling,
     trying to backtrack the sled marks. Checking for pursuit, Fry
     looks over her shoulder...

     And crashes into Riddick. He was just standing in the dark,
     waiting for them.

                              RIDDICK
               Back to the ship, huh?

                              FRY
               Get out of our way.

                              RIDDICK
               So everybody huddles together till the
               lights burn out? Until you can't see
               what's eating you? That the big plan?

                              IMAM
               Where's Mr. Johns?

                              RIDDICK
               Which half?

                              IMAM
               You mean....

     Conflicted, they all look back. Audrey starts to puddle up.

                              AUDREY
               Gonna lose everybody out here....

                              RIDDICK
               He died fast. And if we got any choice,
               that's the way we should all go out.
                         (to Audrey, softly)
               Don't you cry for Johns. Don't you dare.


     EXT. CANYON RIM - THE GAUNTLET - NIGHT

     BLACK SCREEN. We hear the canyon in full cry now -- CLICKING...
     BATTLING BONE-BLADES...MATING CRIES...the RENDING OF FLESH
     and SNAPPING OF TENDON. Far below, twin flames appear as the
     survivors reach the gauntlet. Predators perch in FOREGROUND,
     just hulking silhouettes "watching" from a canyon rim.


     EXT. START OF GAUNTLET - NIGHT

     They are but five: Fry, Riddick, Audrey, Imam, and Pilgrim #1.
     CLOSE on each face as they listen to the CANYON. There must be
     countless predators ahead.

                              FRY
               How many you see?

                              RIDDICK
               One or two.

                              FRY
               Audrey?

                              AUDREY
               Three full bottles. But almost time to
               refill.

                              FRY
               Doesn't seem like enough to turn back on,
               does it?

                              RIDDICK
               Only see one way. Turn the sled over and
               drag it like that, girl down low. Light
               up everything we got -- and run through
               like dogs on fire.

     A beat.

                              IMAM
                         (understanding)
               The sled as a shield....

                              FRY
               And what about the cells?

                              RIDDICK
               I'll take those.

     She looks at him hard.

                              FRY
               We're just here to carry your light,
               aren't we? Just the torch-bearers.

                              RIDDICK
               Let's drop back an' boot up.


     EXT. BONEYARD - NIGHT

     START on the power cells. They're been lashed together into one
     queue.

     Working amid the giant bones, Riddick crafts a new harness from
     the old straps. Close behind him, Imam is MUTTERING IN ARABIC.

                              RIDDICK
               What're you doin'?

                              IMAM
               Blessing you like the others.
                         (off his look)
               It's painless.

                              RIDDICK
               And pointless.

                              IMAM
                         (a beat)
               I see. Well, even if you don't believe
               in God, it doesn't mean He won't be --

                              RIDDICK
               You don't see.

     Riddick shrugs into the harness, snugs it down.

                              RIDDICK (CONT'D)
               'Cuz you don't spend half your life in
               lock-down with a horse-bit in your mouth
               and not believe. And you surely don't
               start out in a liquor store trash bin with
               an umbilical cord wrapped around your neck
               and not believe. Oh, absolutely I believe
               in God. And I absolutely hate the fucker.

                              IMAM
               He will be with us. Nonetheless.

                              RIDDICK
               Give my blessing to the girl. She needs
               a spare.


     EXT. START OF GAUNTLET - NIGHT

     The torches. Maxed out. Burning non-stop.

     Fry and Imam. Sled chains on. Lapping up O2. Each holding a
     torch.

     Pilgrim #1. Clutching a handlight.

     Audrey. Rolling under her sled-shield, becoming the turtle in a
     metal carapace.

     Riddick. Goggles on. He has no desire to see what horrors will
     surround them. There's just one path, anyway: Straight through.

                              RIDDICK
               As fast as you can.

                              FRY
               You sure you can keep --

                              RIDDICK
               As fast as you can.


     EXT. THE GAUNTLET - NIGHT

     SLEW OF SHOTS: Fry and Imam on the move, dragging the shield
     fast. Audrey speed-crawling beneath. Pilgrim #1 tripping along
     behind the shield. And Riddick behind them all, face already
     tortured, pulling 200 pounds of stubborn-mule cargo -- yet
     somehow keeping pace. The torch flames, stretched by the wind,
     flank them in fire.


     EXT. CANYON RIM - THE GAUNTLET - NIGHT

     As predators launch from the rim.


     EXT. THE GAUNTLET - NIGHT

     First come the hatchlings, streaming right into their faces --
     then veering away at the last second, repulsed by light. Next
     come FERAL SOUNDS overhead.

                              RIDDICK
               Don't look.

     Thin blue liquid spatters them.

                              RIDDICK
               Do not look up.

     More spattering. Fry looks up -- and stumbles when she beholds...

     A ceiling of predators. At the cusp of light, they dive and
     weave and dart, slashing each other in a rabid desire to SOUND
     OUT the humans below. It's like looking into a bucket of angry
     eels.

                              RIDDICK
               Keep going, keep going, keep going,
               keep going!

     His voice whips them like the Devil's coxswain. Chastened, Fry
     keeps her eyes down and speed up.

     More blue blood showers down -- followed by entrails dropping
     out of the sky. Could this be Hell itself?

                              IMAM
                         (a muttered mantra)
               "So dark the clouds around my way
                    I cannot see,
               But through the darkness I believe
                    God leadeth me.
               I gladly place my hand in His when
                    all is dim,
               And, closing my weary eyes, lean
                    hard on him...."

     Now WHOLE CORPSES ARE CRASHING DOWN around them, victims
     of in-fighting. Fry and Imam start slaloming through the ghastly
     mess.

     Pilgrim #1 passes too close to a corpse: A blade slices his leg,
     drawing blood. He keeps his mouth shut.


     EXT. CHOKE-POINT - THE GAUNTLET - NIGHT

     The passage narrows into a choke-point. Fry sees it first.

                              FRY
               Riddick? RIDDICK?

     Ahead, a clot of dead predators blocks the canyon.

                              AUDREY
               What? What is it?

                              RIDDICK
               It's a fucking staircase! Go over it!
               GO OVER IT!

     Steeling themselves, they start climbing.

     But Audrey, on all fours, has to discover the corpses with her
     hands. Then, taking exception at being walked on...

     One "corpse" snaps at her. Audrey recoils sideways...

     And tumbles down the mound of corpses. She's exposed.

     PREDATORS' POV: Rapid-fire images of Audrey. Flashes from 10
     different predators.

                              FRY
               Audrey!

     Audrey shakes out of it and scrambles for the shield just as...

     A predator kamikazes onto the shield, its bone-blades piercing
     the metal...

     And nearly skewering Audrey beneath.

     Caught in torchlight, steaming, the PREDATOR HOWLS as it tries
     to rip free of the shield.

     Beneath, Audrey hangs on and takes a thrashing.

     The predator tears clear, spins, pounces blindly at...

     Riddick, standing at light's edge. Stunningly, he catches the
     beast under its scythe blades, blunting the attack. The predator
     CLICKS MADLY at him.

     PREDATOR'S POV: Of Riddick's face.

     The predator rears back its head, ready to bisect Riddick with
     its skull-blade.

     Switchblade fast, Riddick drops a hand...

     ...yanks his shiv...

     ...and sweeps it over the belly of the beast. HOWLING, the
     predator falls, disemboweled.

     REACTION SHOTS of Fry and Imam. Stunned.

                              RIDDICK
               Didn't know who he was fuckin' with.

     They regroup. Imam's head swivels back and forth: They're one
     person short.

                              IMAM
               Suleiman!

                              RIDDICK
               Get the girl back under. Keep going.

                              IMAM
               SULEIMAN!

                              RIDDICK
               KEEP GOING OR I WILL!

     Suddenly Pilgrim #1 reappears, thrust back into the light by
     unseen forces. He's still alive -- but shouldn't be. He makes
     a feeble attempt to grab onto Imam, to anyone, but he's gone
     again before they can even react, jerked out of the light. Out
     of existence.


     EXT. THE GAUNTLET - NIGHT

     They flail on. And now, finally...finally....

     The canyon widens, opening up like some door to Heaven. The
     WORST SOUNDS fall behind. We can see it in their sweat-sheened
     faces: The faintest hope that maybe they've survived the Seventh
     Circle of Hell. But then...

     The TORCHES SPIT AND SPUTTER.

     Audrey hears PATTERING on the metal shield.

     Blood falls anew.

     One torch dies -- yet somehow comes back to life.

     Imam upturns a hand, checking the liquid for color. But this
     blood has no hue.

                              FRY
               Oh, no. No, no, no....

                              IMAM
               Rain.


     EXT. THE GAUNTLET - NIGHT

     RAIN MONTAGE: Water rilling, running, flowing over rocks and
     ground.


     EXT. THE GAUNTLET - NIGHT

     Caught in a downpour, the survivors slog to a stop. One torch
     goes out -- and won't relight.

                              RIDDICK
               So where the hell's God now, huh?
                         (no answer from Imam)
               I'll tell you where! He's up there
               PISSING ON ME!

                              FRY
               Riddick? How close?

     Riddick sheds goggles to look ahead. We don't know what he
     sees -- nor what he's thinking.

                              FRY
               Tell me the settlement is right there!
               RIDDICK, PLEASE!

                              RIDDICK
               We can't make it.

     HOLD on Fry's anguished face, rendered in dying torchlight.
     Somewhere behind, the AWFUL SOUNDS RETURN.

                              RIDDICK
               Here...hide here....

     He's found a crevice in the canyon wall.

                              RIDDICK
               Inside...inside....


     EXT. CREVICE - THE GAUNTLET - NIGHT

     They crawl into the fissure. The second torch dies behind them.


     EXT. THE GAUNTLET - NIGHT

     There's just one light left now -- the one Riddick wears on his
     back. By its glow, we watch him lift the shield, muscle it over
     to the crevice...


     EXT. CREVICE - THE GAUNTLET - NIGHT

     ...and slide it over the opening. A black beat.

                              AUDREY
                         (a beat)
               Why's he still out there?

     Fry's not sure. Is he protecting them? Or entombing them?


     EXT. MUDDY RISE - THE GAUNTLET - NIGHT

     Working like Sisyphus, Riddick hauls the cells up a muddy rise.
     He stops at the top, peers through the rain.

     RIDDICK'S POV: Of the settlement.

     Riddick disappears over the rise. The four cells follow,
     slithering through the mud like a serpent's tail.


     EXT. CREVICE - THE GAUNTLET - NIGHT

                              AUDREY
               He's not coming back, is he?

     Fry checks Imam's face. Did Riddick say anything to you?" Imam
     wags his head. A bleak beat -- before Fry realizes she can see
     his face.

                              FRY
               There's light in here.

     It's a soft glow from above. Imam climbs higher to discover
     small blue-white lights clinging to rocks. He plucks a few.

                              FRY
               What are they?

     CLOSE on the lights in Imam's palm. They writhe with life.

                              IMAM
               Larva....

                              AUDREY
               Glow worms....

                              FRY
                         (mind racing)
               How many bottles we got? Empty ones?


     INT. SKIFF - NIGHT

     Riddick boards the dark craft.

     Connects the power cells to the battery bay.

     Watches the ship come to life.


     EXT. CREVICE - THE GAUNTLET - NIGHT

     CLOSE on a liquor bottle. It's half full of glow-worms.

                              AUDREY
               More, more, we need more....

     They climb higher. Little by little, the bottle brightens their
     world.


     EXT. SKIFF - NIGHT

     Drenched in light, Riddick stands in the hatchway of the skiff,
     looking out into dark rain. Is he struggling with a decision?
     Or just savoring the safe harbor? Then very deliberately...

     Riddick smashes his handlight on the hull. He steps inside and
     closes the hatch behind him.


     EXT. MUDDY RISE - THE GAUNTLET - NIGHT

     Something claws its way up the rise. Standing, we see that it's
     Fry, a bottle of glow-worms strung around her neck. Ahead she
     spies...

     The settlement. Silhouetted by engine-light.


     EXT. SKIFF - NIGHT

     As the skiffs ENGINES WARM UP.


     INT. SKIFF - NIGHT

     As Riddick dabbles with flight controls.


     EXT. SETTLEMENT - NIGHT

     As Fry, running, splashes past buildings.


     EXT. CREVICE - THE GAUNTLET - NIGHT

     Audrey and Imam huddle around a bottle of glow-worms: This is
     all they could harvest. Presently SCRABBLING SOUNDS on the
     shield. Imam eases one eye to a small hole in the shield. He
     can't see much until...

     A blade rushes through the hole. Imam recoils hard, snatches up
     the glow-worm light to see...

     More predator blades exploring the edges of the shield. The
     light drives them away. For now.


     INT. SKIFF - NIGHT

     Riddick dims interior lights, activates exterior lights. He's
     actually startled by the sight of...

     Fry. Standing in the skiffs headbeams. Daring him to run her
     over.

     Eye-lock.

     Riddick opens the hatch.


     EXT. SKIFF - NIGHT

     They meet at opposite ends of the gangway -- Fry in the rain,
     Riddick in the light.

                              RIDDICK
               Strong survival instinct. Admire that in
               a woman.

                              FRY
               You're not leaving. Not until we go back
               for the others.

     He laughs at that.

                              FRY (CONT'D)
               I promised them we'd go back with more
               light. And that's exactly what we're
               gonna do..

                              RIDDICK
               Think you've mistaken me for somebody who
               gives a fuck.

                              FRY
               What, you're afraid?

                              RIDDICK
               Confusin' me with Johns now -- fear was
               his monkey. I only deal in life and
               death. All that stuff in between? Some
               shade of grey my eyes don't see.

                              FRY
               I trusted you, Riddick. Goddamn, I
               trusted that some part of you wanted to
               rejoin the human race.

                              RIDDICK
               Truthfully? I wouldn't know how.

     Fry realizes it's impossible to shame a shameless man. With
     desperation edging her voice:

                              FRY
               Then wait for me. I'll go back myself.
               Just give me more light for them.

     He tosses her a light. The broken one.

                              FRY
               Just come with me!

                              RIDDICK
               Got a better idea. Come with me.

     Fry's mouth moves but nothing comes out.

                              RIDDICK (CONT'D)
               They're already dead. Get on board.

                              FRY
               You're fuckin' with me. I know you are.

                              RIDDICK
               'Course I am -- but doesn't mean I won't
               leave you here. If you believe anything
               about me, better be that.

                              FRY
               No, you see, I promised them...I have
               to...I have to go and....

     She's bleeding resolve. Riddick can see it -- can smell it --
     and he keeps slashing away.

                              RIDDICK
               Step aboard, Carolyn.

                              FRY
                         (tortured)
               I can't....I can't....

                              RIDDICK
                         (approaching, extending
                          a hand)
               Here. Make it easy on you.

                              FRY
               Don't do this to me....

                              RIDDICK
               Just give me your hand.

                              FRY
               But they...they could still be....

                              RIDDICK
               No one's gonna blame you. C'mon. Take my
               hand and save yourself, Carolyn.

     A beat. She takes his hand -- and jerks him down the gangway.
     They sprawl through mud. She gets a knee on his neck.

                              FRY
               I will not give up on them! I Will not
               leave anyone on this rock with those
               fucking things, even if it means --

     In a blur, Riddick rolls and slaps a shiv on her neck. Is
     history repeating itself? Riddick's face, though, is strangely
     calm. Curious. Even gentle.

                              RIDDICK
               You'd die for them?

                              FRY
               I would try for them.

                              RIDDICK
               You barely know them.

                              FRY
               But I'm human. I know you view that as a
               weakness, but I'm sorry -- I do feel fear,
               theirs too. Goddamnit, Riddick -- yes.
               I would die for them.


     EXT. CREVICE - THE GAUNTLET - NIGHT

     MORE SCRABBLING at the shield. Imam cocks his blade back, ready
     to do battle with...

     Fry. She heaves the shield aside. Behind her, Riddick.

                              AUDREY
                         (big-eyed)
               You came for us....

                              RIDDICK
               Yeah, yeah -- we're all fuckin' amazed.
               Anyone not ready for this?


     EXT. THE GAUNTLET - NIGHT

     Protected by the meager light of two glow-worm bottles, the four
     remaining survivors head out.

                              RIDDICK
               Tighter, tighter....


     EXT. MUDDY RISE - THE GAUNTLET - NIGHT

                              RIDDICK
               Stop.

     They pile up awkwardly. Fry listens hard. Only RAINFALL.

                              FRY
               I don't hear --

     He covers her mouth.

     RIDDICK'S POV: Water has pooled at the base of the muddy rise.
     A predator drinks there.

                              RIDDICK
                         (on his breath)
               Doesn't see us...wait for it to leave....

     RIDDICK'S POV: Another predator lands to drink. Then another.
     Their backs are to us, but the pool is turning into a major
     gathering place.

     Soon they all can hear CLICKING above the RAIN. Their nightmare
     is far from over.

                              RIDDICK
               Get behind me.

     RIDDICK'S POV: Of a half-dozen predators shifting places at the
     pool. A slim gap appears.

                              RIDDICK
               When I go, we go. Full-throttle.

     CLOSE on their hands, gripping each other.

                              RIDDICK
               Ready...ready....

     RIDDICK'S POV: The gap between predators widens into a passage.
     A gauntlet within a gauntlet.

     Riddick runs. Linked like paper dolls, the others follow blindly.

     RIDDICK'S POV: Of a predator turning to "stare" over its
     shoulder.

     PREDATOR'S POV: Of Riddick bearing down fast.

     The survivors hit the water like lawn mowers on legs, crashing
     through, scattering water and predators alike, managing to
     reach...

     The muddy rise. Audrey loses her grip on the others...

     And starts back-sliding. She CRIES OUT, turning the head of...

     Riddick. He catches Audrey as her legs hit the pool. He muscles
     her back up the rise and heaves her over the top, sending her
     slip-sliding down the other side.

                              RIDDICK
               You know the way!

     Not waiting for him, Fry and Imam disappear over the rise.

     RIDDICK'S POV: Of the predators. Regrouping. Crawling up the
     rise at us.


     EXT. NIGHT

     Fry, Imam, and Audrey run hard, glow-worm lights bouncing wildly.

     RIDDICK'S POV: Chasing them.

     PREDATOR'S POV: Chasing Riddick.


     EXT. SETTLEMENT - NIGHT

     Fry, Imam, and Audrey reach the settlement. They spill around a
     corner and see...

     The light of the skiff.


     EXT. SETTLEMENT - NIGHT

     RIDDICK'S POV: Ahead of us, we see Fry, Imam, and Audrey
     vanishing around the corner. BREATHING LIKE A RACEHORSE, we
     follow in their steps, storming around the same corner. Suddenly
     a predator is right there, right in our face.

     PREDATOR'S POV: Of Riddick skidding to a stop. He snaps a look
     up.

     RIDDICK'S POV: Of another predator perched gargoyle-like on the
     building. It SPEED-CLICKS at us.

     PREDATOR'S POV: Of Riddick slowly pulling two shivs. Bracing
     himself. Ready to blade it out.


     EXT. SKIFF - NIGHT

     Imam and Audrey stagger aboard. Safe in the light of the
     headbeams, Fry turns back, panting, waiting.

     Waiting.

                              IMAM
               Captain....

     He wants her to board the skiff. Fry gives it another beat, eyes
     sweeping the dark rain. And just when we think it's over for
     Riddick -- TERRIBLE SCREAMS are heard from both man and predator:
     There's a helluva fight going on out there. Close out there.

     Fry snatches the glow-worms off Imam's neck...

     And plunges into the darkness, homing in on the SOUNDS until...

     A blade flashes in her face. She ducks and spots...

     Riddick. Bloody, muddy, he's down on his knees, still trying to
     fight off the shadow-beasts that swirl and slash all around him.
     Around them both.

                              FRY
               It's me, it's me, it's me!

     She gets the light around his neck. Now we see his face
     clearly -- and see a very human expression there: Fear. Fry
     grabs his armpits and tries to pull him up.

                              FRY
               C'mon, Riddick -- said I'd die for them,
               not you.

     He gets his feet under him. Gripping each other, they start
     moving, turning like dancers in a macabre waltz, hoping the
     predators can't fix on Riddick's blood.

                              FRY
               Just 10 steps...keep turning, keep
               turning...that's right...others're already
               'board, waitin' for us right now...five
               steps...c'mon, almost there, Riddick...
               almost there...we're almost --

     Something jolts them. ALL CLICKING STOPS.

     EXTREME CLOSEUPS: Searching each other's eyes. Someone just got
     slashed from behind, slashed bad. But who?

                              RIDDICK
               Not for me....

     In an eyeblink she's gone, ripped from his arms. There was no
     scream. No cry. No final words. Just...

     Blackness.


     EXT. PLANET'S ORBIT - NIGHT

     Out of the blackness, a spot of fire races toward us. It
     resolves into the skiff, fabric wings burning off as it hits
     escape velocity.


     INT. SKIFF - NIGHT

     CLOSE on a bloody hand. It toggles through nav-charts, plots a
     rendezvous with "Sol-Track 17B" shipping lane.

     In the cockpit, Riddick finds Audrey beside him. She stares
     hypnotically at the stars ahead.

                              RIDDICK
               Probably okay to talk to me now.

                              AUDREY
               Not sure where to go. I was just runnin'
               away when this whole thing started.
                         (a beat)
               Where you goin'?

                              RIDDICK
               Not sure. I was just runnin' away when
               this whole thing....

     Interior smiles. Stars sweep the windscreen as the skiff makes
     a course-correction. One very bright star comes into view.

                              RIDDICK
               Might interest you....

     Imam moves forward. Seeing, his face lifts.

                              IMAM
               New Mecca....

                              RIDDICK
               Think a soul could get lost there? With
               all those pilgrim-types?

                              IMAM
               It's more a place where souls are found,
               Mr. Riddick.

     As Riddick ponders the possibilities, we CUT TO...


     EXT. PLANET'S ORBIT - NEW DAWN

     The first sun flares out from behind the eclipsing planet. Its
     light feels cleansing. Renewing. Life-giving.

                                                            FADE OUT

	FADE IN
	
1	EXT. CONSTELLATION OF ORION - NIGHT

	Stars glitter like diamonds on the black velvet backdrop of space. 
	The Belt of Orion is center screen, but much nearer and larger 
	than ever seen by an Earth-bound astronomer.

	A speck of light appears in the lower left corner of the screen. 
	No spaceship can be seen, but only a glowworm, a solitary sperma-
	tosoan gliding through the womb of the universe. Over this we HEAR 
	the voice of an astronaut. He is concluding a report.

				ASTRONAUT'S VOICE
				(o.s.)	
			So ends my last signal until we reach
			our destination. We are now on automatic, 
			a mere hundred and five light years from 
			our base ... and at the mercy of com-
			puters. I've tucked in my crew for the 
			long sleep. I'll join them presently.

2	INT. CABIN OF SPACESHIP - ESTABLISHING SHOT - NIGHT

	The cabin is neither cramped nor spacious, but about the size of the 
	President's cabin in Air Force One. In the immediate f.g. is a console 
	of dials and switches flanked by four chairs. Only one of the chairs 
	is occupied. The astronaut's back is to CAMERA. There is a ladder 
	amidships which leads to an escape hatch. The after Dart of the cabin
	is obscured in darkness. We hear the MUSIC of a Mozart sonata emanating
 	from a phonograph of stereotape. The astronaut is speaking into a
 	microphone.

				ASTRONAUT
			Within the hour we shall complete	
			the sixth month of our flight from
			Cape Kennedy. By our time, that is ...

	He pauses, looking up at:

3	TWO LARGE CLOCKS - ON CABIN WALL

	One clock is marked SELF TIME, but instead of twelve numerals it has 
	twenty-four. One of the needles is moving very slowly.

	The other clock is labeled EARTH TIME, and its units, like those of a
 	tachometer, are given by hundreds and thousands.

	The largest needle of this clock makes one revolution every second.
 	Over this we hear:

				ASTRONAUT'S VOICE
				(o.s.)
			But according to Dr. Hasslein theory of 
			time in a vehicle traveling at close to 
			the speed of light, old Mother Earth has 
			aged a few thousand years since our de-
			parture -- while we have scarcely aged 
			at all.

4	CLOSE ON ASTRONAUT

	This is TAYLOR. He wears simple dungarees (or Churchill suit) and
 	comfortable boots. He seems calm and pensive. Extracting the butt of 
	a cigar from the breast pocket of his dungarees, he lights it, then
 	continues:

				TAYLOR 
			It may be so. This much is probable: the 
			men who sent us on this journey have long 
			since been moldering in forgotten graves; 
			and those, if any, who read this message 
			are a different breed. Hopefully, a 
			better one.

	He begins to roll up his left sleeve.

				TAYLOR 
			I leave the twentieth century without 
			regret. Who was it? Marshall? ... said 
			'Modern man is the missin 'a link between 
			the ape and the human being.'

	He removes the cigar from his mouth, turns to look out through one 
	of the portholes into the astral night.

				TAYLOR 
			One final thought -- nothing scientific, 
			purely personal. Seen from up here, 
			everything looks different ... Time bends 
			and space is boundless. It squashes a 
			man's ego. He begins to feel like no more 
			than a mote in the eye of eternity. And 
			he is nagged by a question: ahat if any-
			thing, will greet us on the end of man's 
			first journey to a star? Are we to believe 
			that throughout these thousands of galaxies, 
			these millions of stars, only one, that 
			speck of solar dust we call Earth, has 
			been graced -- or cursed -- by human life?
				(pause) 
			I have to doubt it.

	He extracts a hypodermic needle from his breast pocket and injects 
	it into the vein of his forearm. He continues speaking.

				TAYLOR 
				(sardonically) 
			That's about all. I wonder if Man, that 
			marvel of the universe, that glorious 
			paradox who has sent me to the unknown... 
			still makes war against his brother., and 
			lets his neighbor's children starve.

	Taylor withdraws the hypodermic needle from his vein and secures it in 
	a drawer of the console.

				TAYLOR 
			Well then, Earthmen: A missing link 
			salutes you. Bless you, my descendants.

	Taylor snuffs out the cigar butt and places it in the drawer beside the
 	hypodermic. Then, flicking a switch Au cut off the Mozart, he rises and 
	looks up again at:

5	THE CLOCK MARKED EARTH TIME

	The longest needle of this clock now makes nearly two revolutions per 
	second. The shortest needle points to the numeral 2105.

6	INT. CABIN - TRACKING WITH TAYLOR

	Space scientists have presumably solved the problem of weightlessness, 
	for Taylor walks the short distance from; the console to the after 
	section without particular effort. CAMERA FOLLOWS him, and we can now 
	see four glass capsules, or "caskets", in the rear of the cabin. Taylor 
	looks down at them.

7-	SEVERAL SHOTS - THE FOUR CASKETS - FROM TAYLOR'S P.O.V.
10
	One of them is open. The other three are occupied by astronauts: DODGE, 
	LANDON and STEWART. They, too, wear dungarees and boots. Dodge and 
	Landon are thirtyish, clean-shaven, virile -- America's finest. Stewart 
	is a handsome young woman, her hair bobbed short. Their eyes are closed 
	and they do not appear to be breathing -- yet no undertaker could make 
	them so alive.

11	ANOTHER ANGLE - FAVORING TAYLOR

	He grasps the handle of his own casket and slowly pulls himself into
 	it. Continuing SILENCE. CAMERA MOVES IN as Taylor Dulls the glass lid
 	shut and secures it. He adjusts two dials inside the capsule and lies
 	back, buckling his safety belt. CAMERA MOVES INTO A CLOSEUP of Taylor.
 	His eyes are open. He seems serene, even enraptured.

 	convey a sense of loneliness, of separation, and of the passage of
 	time.)

								DISSOLVE TO:

12-	A SERIES OF SHOTS - A DISTANT GLOBE (MINIATURE)
16	
	We see a strange and distant planet. At first the globe occupies but a 
	small area of the screen; but with each new VIEW it comes closer and
 	looms larger, as if" observed from a spaceship in a spiraling orbit of
 	descent.

	The topography of the planet bears little resemblance to our own. Much
 	of it is obscured by cloud cover; even more of-it appears to be
 	cratered desert of reddish hue. We can, however, make out a few narrow
 	"green belts" and a patch of blue water.

	In the FINAL SHOTS of this SEQUENCE we see the strange planet as it
 	would be observed from a spacecraft plummeting from twenty thousand
 	feet to one thousand feet. It appears that the ship will fall into a 
	vast lake surrounded by soaring sandstone pinnacles. The water is 
	blue-black, the pinnacles vermillion. (This is the Lake Powell
 	location, at Lone Rock.)

17	INT. SPACESHIP - FULL SHOT - DAY

	Four empty pilot seats are seen in f.g., the four glass caskets in 
	b.g. We HEAR the RHYTHMIC BLEAT of a WARNING SIGNAL, a RUSH OF WIND 
	as in a rapid descent, and perhaps the ROAR OF RETROJETS. Then, a 
	great CRASH as the craft hits water. The whole ship shudders on impact.
 	Loose equipment falls to the cabin floor. CAMERA MOVES DOWN the cabin
 	aisle as the ship begins to roll in the water and HOLDS on the four
	glass caskets. There are THREE LOUD METALLIC CLICKS as the glass 
	domes of the caskets swing open automatically.

18	CLOSE ON TAYLOR

	He now has a full beard. His eyes come open. Instantly alert, he 
	rises to a sitting position, gazing across at:

19	DODGE AND LANDON - FROM TAYLOR'S P.O.V.

	They, too, awaken and sit up, starring at Taylor. They, too, are
	bearded.

				TAYLOR'S VOICE 
				(o.s.)
			You all right?

	They nod.

20	BACK TO TAYLOR - CLOSE SHOT

	He glances at the casket beside his own.

				TAYLOR 
			Stewart?
				(struggling to his feet) 
			Stewart?

21	CLOSE-SHOT --THE FOURTH CASKET

	Its dome remains unopened. The young woman is a skeleton in a 
	Churchill suit.

22	REACTION SHOT - THE THREE ASTRONAUTS

	Dodge and Landon have joined Taylor and-stare at the grinning skull 
	of their dead comrade. A low, descending HUM of equipment is heard.
 	Simultaneously the lights begin to FADE. A moment later they brighten,
 	but not as much as before.

				TAYLOR 
			There goes our primary power. We're on 
			auxilliary.

	A slight CRACKING sound is heard. Taylor turns quickly away and o.s.:

23	REVERSE ANGLE - THE FORWARD CABIN

	A trickle of water has begun to seep through a ruptured seam in the
 	cabin. Taylor darts to a porthole and peers cut.

24	LONG SHOT - WHAT TAYLOR SEES:

	water 

	The porthole is no more than six inches above the line. In the 
	distance we discern a shoreline of red desert.

				TAYLOR'S VOICE 
				(o.s.)
			We're in the soup. We're sinking.

25	INT. CABIN - FULL SHOT

	The leak in the seam becomes a growing spray of water. Taylor 
	turns away from the porthole, calling:

				TAYLOR
			Dodge! Read the atmosphere!

	Dodge moves instantly to the ladder beneath an escape hatch and 
	mounts it. Taylor stumbles down the aisle of the rolling ship toward
 	the console and addresses Landon, who is still staring at Stewart's
	skeleton.

				TAYLOR
			Landon! Send a last signal.

				LANDON
				(dazed) 
			What signal?

				TAYLOR 
			To Earth! That we've landed!

	As Landon lurches toward the communications equipment in f.g.

								CUT TO:

26	EXT. TIM STRANGE PLANET - LONG PANORAMIC SHOT - LATE AFTERNOON (LONE
 	ROCK, LAKE POWELL)

	We are looking at a lifeless desert of sandstone buttes and pinnacles.
 	There is no sign of vegetation anywhere. CAMERA PANS DOWN to a body 
	of water that could be the bay of an inland sea. The deep blue of the
 	sea contrasts sharply to the red sands of the shoreline. CAMERA HOLDS
 	on the stricken spaceship, wallowing like a beached whale a hundred
 	yards offshore. The portholes of the craft are beneath the water, and
 	only its roof and the tail fin of its tail assembly are visible. The
 	red-hot skin of the ship vaporizes the water around it.

	Suddenly a snorkel-like tube sprouts from the escape hatch, which is 
	located amidships.

27	INT. CABIN - CLOSE ON CLOSED ESCAPE HATCH

	Dodge, standing halfway up the ladder., has fastened a kit of gauges 
	to the end of the snorkel tube. He reads the dials, removes the kit,
 	sniffs the air in the tube and then, taking a deep breath, announces:

				DODGE 
			It's breathable.

				TAYLOR'S VOICE 
				(o.s.) 
			Okay! Blow the hatch before we lose 
			auxilliary power.

	Dodge reaches for a control mechanism near the escape hatch.

28	CLOSE ON TAYLOR AND LANDON

	The spray of water coming through the ruptured seam is increasing. 
	The LIGHTS DIM again and the SOUND of the warning signal FADES. While
	Landon fiddles with the radio, Taylor tries to get the tape recorder
 	rolling, but all we hear are scrambled and unintelligible noises.

				LANDON
			It's no use ... there she goes.

				TAYLOR
			Forget it. Abandon ship.

29	WIDER ANGLE - TIM CABIN

	The escape hatch is now open. Taylor darts over to the ladder and
 	passes a folded life raft up to Dodge. When Landon reaches the ladder,
 	Taylor hands him two neatly packed rucksacks, and Landon climbs 
	through the escape hatch. Taylor is about to follow with a third
 	rucksack, then turns and crosses the cabin for a last look at:

30	THE TWO CLOCKS - FROM TAYLOR'S P.O.V.

	Both clocks have stopped: the red needle of the clock labeled SELF 
	TIME rests on the numeral 18; the red needle of the clock marked 
	EARTH TIME rests on the numeral 3975.

31	EXT. TOP OF SPACECRAFT - MED. SHOT

	Dodge inflates the raft with a cartridge of compressed air and 
	tosses it into the water. He and Landon jump into the water and 
	climb onto the raft as Taylor emerges from the hatch, Taylor slips 
	into the water and climbs onto the raft. He and Landon begin to 
	paddle toward shore, while Dodge immediately opens another kit and 
	takes a sample of the water.	

32	CLOSE ON THE MEN IN THE RAFT

				DODGE
				(half to himself) 
			Briny...twenty-five percent salinity. 
			Near the saturation point.

				LANDON
				(looking back)
			She's still sinking...

33	THE SPACESHIP - FROM THEIR P.O.V.

	Only the radio antenna and the tip of the tail fin remain visible.

				LANDON'S VOICE 
				(o.s.)
			Going ... going...

 	The craft vanishes beneath the water.

34	CLOSE ON THE MEN IN THE RAFT

	Dodge is still busy with his kit. Landon is still looking back, but 
	Taylor doesn't bother to turn his head.

				LANDON 
			Gone.

				TAYLOR
				(flatly)
			We're here to stay.

35	ANOTHER ANGLE - MOVING WITH THE RAFT

	They gaze at the forbidding sandstone battlements as they near the
 	shore.

				LANDON  
			Well? Where are we? Have any notion, 
			skipper?

				TAYLOR 
				(confidently) 
			We're some three hundred and twenty 
			light years from Earth. On an unnamed 
			planet in orbit around a star in the 
			constellation of Orion. 
				(looks off at 
				the "sun") 
			That could be Bellatrix.

36	THE SUN - FROM THEIR P.O.V.

	Low on the horizon, seen through a dense envelope of dust particles.

				DODGE'S VOICE
				(o.s.)
			Too red for Bellatrix.

37	BACK TO ASTRONAUTS IN RAFT

	Landon glances skeptically at Taylor.

				LANDON 
			You didn't have time to check the 
			tapes, so you don't really know, 
			do you?
				(as Taylor ignores
				him) 
			What went wrong?
				(sardonically)
			We weren't programmed to land
			in water.

				DODGE 
				(grinning) 
			The question, Landon, is not so much 
			where we are as when we are.

				TAYLOR 
			(stands up in raft) 
			We've had a nice snooze. Let's start 
			earning all our back pay.

38	WIDER ANGLE - THE BEACH

	As the three astronauts step out into shallow water and pull the 
	raft ashore.

				TAYLOR 
			Take your soil test, Dodge. I'll 
			check the equipment.

	Dodge moves inland about ten yards, removes a small hand drill 
	from his belt, extends the rod of the drill three feet and begins 
	to take some subsoil samplings. Taylor begins to examine the contents
	of the three rucksacks. Landon sits down on the beach., hands around 
	his knees, gazing moodily at the sunken spaceship. During this and 
	succeeding scenes we sense that Dodge's obsession with scientific 
	inquiry leaves him immune to fear: Landon is possibly more courageous 
	and certainly more "human," for he has many fears to control: while 
	Taylor -- detached, cool and misanthropic -- is something of an enigma.

				TAYLOR 
				(calls Dodge) 
			Got your sensors?

				DODGE 
			Yo!

				TAYLOR 
			Geiger counter?

				DODGE 
			Yo!

				TAYLOR
				(taking inventory) 
			One pistol... twenty-four rounds of 
			ammo. two medical kits.. one camera... 
			one TX9.
				(loudly to the
				others) 
			We've enough food and water for three 
			days.

				DODGE
			But how long is a day?

				TAYLOR 
			Good question.
				(turning) 
			Landon -- check your communications 
			kit.

39	ANOTHER ANGLE - FAVORING LANDON

	He seems not to have heard.

				TAYLOR
				(sharply)
			Landon! Join the expedition.

				LANDON
				(rising)
			Sorry... 
				(crossing to his kit)
			I was thinking of Stewart. What
			d'you suppose happened?

				TAYLOR
				(flatly)
			Air leak. Died in her sleep.

				LANDON 
			You don't seem very cut up about 
			it.

				TAYLOR 
			It's a little late for a wake. She's 
			been dead nearly a year.

				LANDON 
			Then we've been away from Earth for 
			eighteen months.

				TAYLOR 
			By our time.
				(smiling at Landon)
			You've turned gray.

	Landon involuntarily touches the gray hair of his temple as Taylor 
	adds lightly:

				TAYLOR 
			Apart from that, you look pretty chipper 
			for a man who's two thousand and thirty 
			one years old.
				(casually) 
			I read the clocks. They bear out Hasslein's 
			hypothesis. We've been away from Earth for 
			two thousand years, give or take a decade.
				(pause) 
			Still can't accept it, huh?

				LANDON
				long pause) 
			You know it.

				TAYLOR 
			Because time has wiped out everyone and 
			everything you cared for -- they're dust.

				LANDON 
			Prove it. If we can't get back, it's still 
			just a theory.

				TAYLOR
			It's a fact, Landon. Buy it. You'll sleep 
			better.

	Dodge enters scene. A handful of reddish sand dribbles through his 
	fingers.

				DODGE 
			Nothing will grow here .... there's just a 
			trace of hydrocarbons, and most of the 
			nitrogen is locked into nitrates.

				TAYLOR
			Any sign of dangerous ionization?

				DODGE
			No.

				TAYLOR 
				(rising) 
			Okay. If there's no life here, we've got 
			just seventy-two hours to find it. That's 
			when the groceries run out.

	He picks up one of the rucksacks and puts it on. The others follow 
	suit.

				DODGE
			Which direction?

				TAYLOR
				(decisively, pointing
				west) 
			That way.

				DODGE
			Any particular reason?

				TAYLOR 
			None at all.

	He moves out. Dodge follows. CAMERA PANS with them. They have gone 
	only a few paces when Taylor looks back over his shoulder and halts.

40	REVERSE ANGLE - FEATURING LANDON

	Landon is squatting in the sand, sticking something into the soil. 
	It is a small American flag, the size of a handkerchief.

41	REVERSE  ANGLE - FEATURING TAYLOR AND DODGE

	Mirth bubbles up in Taylor's throat. He explodes with wild laughter. 
	He is still laughing as they move out.

59	ANOTHER PART OF THE CANYON (OCHRE DUNES AREA) - GROUP
	SHOT - DAY

	Several huge boulders are dislodged, and the three astronauts run.
	wildly to escape the falling rocks. When the avalanche ends, they 
	sprawl on the lifeless sands, breathing heavily and drenched with
 	sweat, surrounded by enormous boulders. Taylor looks about him.

				TAYLOR
			Everybody all right?

	Murmurs of assent from Dodge and Landon. Taylor rummages through a
 	limp rucksack, comes up with some empty food cartons,rummages again,
 	coming up with a cigar butt.

				TAYLOR 
			Water check.    

	Dodge takes a plastic canteen from another rucksack and inspects it.

				DODGE 
			Eight ounces.

	Dodge lies back and looks up at the sky.

				DODGE 
			It doesn't add up. There's a mantle of 
			dust around this planet and yet it's 
			as humid as a jungle. Thunder and 
			lightning and yet no rain. Cloud cover 
			every night and that strange luminosity, 
			and yet no moon.

	Landon also looks up at the sky.

				LANDON
			If only we could get a fix.

				TAYLOR 
				(needling him) 
			What would you learn? I've told you 
			where you are and when you are.

				DODGE 
				(gently) 
			Taylor -- quit riding him.

				TAYLOR 
				(harshly, to Landon) 
			You're more than three hundred light 
			years from your precious planet. Your 
			loved ones have been dead and forgotten 
			for twenty centuries. Even if you could 
			get back, they'd think you were 
			something that fell out of a tree.

				LANDON 
				(wearily)
			All right --

				TAYLOR 
			There's only one reality left. We're 
			here and it's now. You get ahold of that 
			and hang on tight, or you might as well 
			be dead.

				LANDON 
				(quietly) 
			I'm prepared to die.

	Taylor turns to Dodge, throws up his hands.

				TAYLOR 
			He's prepared to die! Doesn't that make 
			you misty? Chalk up another victory for 
			the human spirit!

	Dodge rises and moves off, o.s., either embarrassed by this colloquy
 	or unwilling to hear it again. Taylor, cigar clamped between his
 	teeth, spins toward Landon.

				TAYLOR 
			Straighten me out on something. Why did 
			you come along at all? You volunteered. 
			Why?
				(a beat; no answer) 
			I'll tell you. They nominated you for the 
			Big One and you couldn't turn it down. Not 
			without losing your All-American standing

				LANDON
				(hard) 
			Climb off me, will you!

				TAYLOR 
			And the glory, don't forget that. There's 
			a life-sized bronze statue of you somewhere. 
			It's probably turned green by now, and nobody 
			can read the name plate. But never let it be 
			said we forget our heroes.

				LANDON
			Taylor.	I'm telling you --

				TAYLOR
			Oh, and one last item. Immortality.
			You wanted to go on forever.
				(pause) 
			Well, you damn near made it. Except for 
			Dodge and me, you've lived longer than 
			anybody. And with Stewart dead, it looks 
			like we're the last of the strain. You got 
			what you wanted, kid. How does it taste?

	Silence.	Taylor lies down, spent of his venom, pillowing
	his head on a rucksack.

				LANDON
				(softly)
			Okay. You read me well enough.
			Why can't I read you?

				TAYLOR 
			Don't bother

				LANDON 
				(looking off) 
			Dodge ... he's not like me at all. But
 			he makes sense. Held walk naked into a 
			live volcano if he thought he could learn 
			something no other man knew. I understand 
			why  he's here. But you...You're no seeker. 
			You're negative.

				TAYLOR
			But I'm not prepared to die.

				LANDON 
				(heatedly) 
			I'd like to know why not. You thought 
			life on Earth was meaningless. You despised 
			people. So what did you do? You ran away.

	Taylor's eyes are closed. He is silent for a moment. When he speaks,
 	his tone is soft, reflective.

				TAYLOR 
			No, not quite, Landon. I'm a bit of a 
			seeker myself. But my dreams are a lot 
			emptier than yours. 
				(pause) 
			I can't get rid of the idea that somewhere 
			in the Universe there must be a creature 
			superior to man.

60	ANOTHER ANGLE - FEATURING DODGE

	It is a tiny desert flower, no more than an inch high.

			Life. 

	He digs gently around the roots of the plant with a small instrument.

								QUICK DISSOLVE T0:

67	EXT. A DRY WASH - CLOSE GROUP SHOT - DAY

	Blooming tamarisks border a. dry stream bed. Taylor and Landon hover 
	over Dodge, who is probing the soil with his drill. Their dungarees and 
	faces are caked with dust.

				DODGE
			It's a stream bed., no doubt about 
			it -- but bone dry.

	Landon strightens up and looks off, startled by something he sees.

				LANDON 
			Look. . .

68	LONG SHOT - A CLIFF BEYOND THE TAMARISKS

	with the astronauts in f.g. In the distance, on the skyline, we can 
 	make out a long row of wooden crosses. Some animal or vegetable matter 
	appears to be tied to the crosses.

				LANDON 
			Scarecrows?

				TAYLOR 
			Let's take a look.

	Taylor plunges into the thicket of tamarisks, followed by Dodge and 
	Landon. Their view of the cliff is momentarily obscured. CAMERA HOLDS 
	on the distant crosses. For an instant only, three "creatures" again 
	appear on the skyline near the crosses. Then they vanish.

69	REVERSE ANGLE - THE ASTRONAUTS

	as they emerge from the tamarisk thicket-nearer to the base of the-
	cliff. They halt and look up at:

70	THE CROSSES - ANGLING UP - FROM ASTRONAUT'S P.O.V.

	We can now see the pelts of unrecognizable animals have been bound to 
	the crosses and, thus mounted in a long row, seem to make a boundary
	or serve as a warning. The living bipeds are no longer visible.

71	BACK TO THE ASTRONAUTS

	Dodge and Landon are still looking up at the strange crosses, but 
	Taylor is scanning the terrain at the base of the cliff. The sound of 
	rushing water can be heard.

				TAYLOR
				(half to himself)
			Never mind the scarecrows.

	He breaks into a run, CAMERA PANNING with him as he moves toward a 
	declivity in the face of the cliff.

72	MOVING SHOT - DODGE AND LANDON

	Agonized with thirst, they follow Taylor.

	He scrambles up a rock-strewn gorge and looks off at the terrain 	
	beyond.

75	EXT. A WATERFALL - FROM TAYLOR'S P.O.V.

	The cascade is not spectacular, but the vegetation around it is 
	startlingly lush. (This location is not at Lake Powell, but at the 
	Ranch).

76	CLOSEUP - TAYLOR

	His parched lips break into a smile.

								QUICK DISSOLVE TO:

77	EXT. WATERFALL AND POOL - FULL SHOT - DAY

	The cascade has formed a cool and inviting pool. Thick foliage grows to 
	its very edge. Dodge is on his hands and knees, testing the liquid with 
	his kit. The others wait expectantly.

				DODGE 
			It's loaded with minerals, but safe.

	Without further ado Landon ducks his face into the pool. Dodge scoops
	up water in his hands and drinks. Taylor	follows suit.

				LANDON
				(coming up for air) 
			Can we take a dip?

				TAYLOR
				(looks around)
			Okay.

	Landon and Dodge immediately remove their boots, strip down and plunge 
	into the pool. But Taylor does not yet disrobe. Alert and curious, he 
	strolls along the bank of the pool, looking around.

82	TAYLOR IN WATER

	as he swims across.

				LANDON'S VOICE 
				(o.s.) 
			Hey, Taylor! Look at this --

	Dodge and Taylor climb out of the pool and squat beside Landon.

83	CLOSE SHOT - WHAT THEY SEE:

	The print of a large five-toad foot is clearly visible in the wet sand.

84	GROUP SHOT - THE THREE ASTRONAUTS

	Taylor rises and walks slowly toward the underbrush, scanning the 
	ground for other sports.

								CUT TO:

85	THE OTHER SIDE OF THE POOL - FULL PANNING SHOT

	Our view of the astronauts beyond the cascade in b.g. is partially 
	obscured by broad-leafed foliage directly in front of CAMERA, which 
	PANS SLOWLY away from the waterfall and HOLDS on the astronauts' 
	clothing at the edge of the pool. Suddenly and inexplicably a pair of 
	dungarees slithers away into the underbrush. A few seconds pass. Now a 
	pair of bronzed and brawny shoulders fill the SCREEN, blocking our 
	view.

86	REVERSE ANGLE - CLOSE ON A HUMAN FACE IN HEAVY FOLIAGE

	Or is it human? The hair is matted, the face bearded, the jaw 
	prognathous, the orbital rim prominent.

87	ANOTHER ANGLE - AT EDGE OF POOL

	A brown thick-fingered hand appears from behind heavy foliage and 
	plucks at a boot. The boot vanishes.

88	BACK TO THE ASTRONAUTS - ON OTHER SIDE OF POOL

	Dodge is standing near Taylor and looking back at the spot where they 
	left their clothing. Suddenly he seizes Taylor's arm and points 
	silently at the far bank of the pool. 

89	WHAT THEY SEE:

	Another pair of dungarees slithers into the underbrush and disappears.

90	REVERSE ANGLE - FULL PANNING SHOT - THE ASTRONAUTS

	Led by Taylor, they dive back into the pool and swim to the other bank. 
	Emerging from the water, they look around in bewilderment. Taylor makes 
	hand signals to indicate absolute silence and a reconnaissance. The 
	three astronauts fan out and move cautiously into the jungle (or rain 
	forest).

95	EXT. A SMALL CLEARING - FAVORING THE THREE ASTRONAUTS

	who stop at the edge of the clearing, startled by

96	WHAT THEY SEE:

	a number of primitive bipeds, male and female, scarcely visible behind 
	trees and bushes on the other side of the clearing -- here a face, 
	there a portion of a head and torso. Throughout this sequence, the   
	primitives are never seen clearly or at close range.

97	BACK TO THE AST40IONAUTS

	reacting. They speak in whispers.
	
				LANDON
			My God..they look almost human.

				DODGE 
			They -- there's a herd of them.

				TAYLOR
			Show them we're friendly.

	CAMERA PULLS BACK as Taylor advances a few steps into the clearing, 
	extending his empty hands and beaming like a politician.

				TAYLOR 
				(warmly)
			Greetings!

98	REVERSE - THE STRANGE CREATURES - FROM TAYLOR'S P.O.V.

	There are perhaps a dozen of them. They shrink back as Taylor advances 
	-- hostile, frightened or both. We now see that some of them are 
	clutching articles of the astronauts' clothing and equipment. Taylor 
	stops, stares at them glumly.

				TAYLOR
			No cigar.

				LANDON
			Try telling them our names.

	Taylor grimaces at Landon.

				TAYLOR
			Well, if we're looking for an icebreaker...
				(turning to the creatures)
			Listen, folks .....

	More shrinking back by the frightened primitives.

				DODGE 
				(softly) 
			I'm afraid they aren't having any.

	A pistol goes off with a deafening crash, and the primitive creatures 
	scatter in panicky flight. After a while, quiet returns to the jungle.

106	EXT. A JUNGLE PATH - THE ASTRONAUTS

	They examine the remnants of their clothing and equipment and start to
	don whatever is able to be worn. Taylor puts on what remains of a 
	ripped pair of trousers; Dodge starts to improvise from the remnants of 
	the kit (it is a torn shelter half). Landon, like Taylor, has the 
	remains of his pants.

				DODGE 
			They didn't leave much did they?

				LANDON 
			Shall we follow them?

				TAYLOR 
			Haven't much choice.

	As they walk off down the jungle path.

107	EXT. A GROVE OF FRUIT TREES - ESTABLISHING SHOT - DAY

	This need not be a cultivated grove. A few trees (peach or apricot or 
	avocado, it matters not) grow wild in a pleasant glade. Nor is the 
	grove extensive. The three astronauts sit under a tree in f.g.; the 
	primitives sit under a clump, of trees some fifty yards away. Each camp 
	is feeding and warily watching the other. In the distance beyond the 
	fruit trees is an open grassy plain or cultivated field.

108	THE PRIMITIVES - FROM LANDON'S P.O.V.

	They too are sitting under trees, munching fruit. There are no more 
	than a dozen altogether.

109	BACK TO ASTRONAUTS - CLOSE GROUP SHOT

				TAYLOR
			Well, at least they haven't
			tried to bite us.

				DODGE
			Blessed are the vegetarians.

110	THE OTHER CAMP - FEATURING A YOUNG WOMAN

	Squatting on her haunches, eating fruit, gazing back at Taylor. Her 
	hair is long and black, her skin nut brown, her face hauntingly lovely 
	and hauntingly stupid. This is NOVA.

111	BACK TO ASTRONAUTS

	Landon looks o.s. at the primitives.

				LANDON
			We got off at the wrong stop.

				TAYLOR
			You're our optimist Look at the bright 
			side. If that's the best there is 
			around here, in six months we'll be 
			running this planet.

				DODGE
				(suddenly)
			Look...

112	THE PRIMITIVES - THEIR P.O.V.

	They appear to be agitated although neither we nor the astronauts 
	have yet heard or seen any cause for alarm. The primitives get to 
	their feet, sniffing, listening

113	CLOSE GROUP SHOT - THE ASTRONAUTS

	Puzzled and alarmed by the primitives' behavior, they too get to 
	their feet.

				LANDON
			Think they'll attack us?

	Taylor turns, looks back at:

114	THE DISTANT JUNGLE (OR FOREST)

	From which they recently emerged. There is no sign of life.

115	LONG PANNING SHOT - THE PRIMITIVES

	They suddenly run laterally across the grove, heading  back toward
	their jungle. A rumble becomes audible	it is the SOUND of HOOFBEATS.

116	VERY LONG SHOT - THE JUNGLE (OR FOREST)

	Twelve "horsemen" suddenly emerge from the trees, riding abreast at a 
	canter, like a squadron of cavalry about to charge. The horses look 
	huge. So do the riders, but at this distance we cannot identify them.

117	LONG PANNING SHOT - THE PRIMITIVES

	Cut off from their natural habitat, they reverse direction and flee 
	toward the tall grasses of the savanna (or cultivated field).

118	LONG SHOT - THE RIDERS

	With an exultant battle cry they break into a gallop. The hunt is on.

119	CLOSE GROUP SHOT - THE THREE ASTRONAUTS

	Stupefied, frozen in place.

120 	LONG SHOT - THE RIDERS

	Coming closer. We HEAR a rifle shot, then a flurry of shots.

121	MED. SHOT.

	A bullet spanks into the fruit trees above their heads. They run, 
	CAMERA PANNING with them as they race toward the tall grass in deep 
	b.g.

122-	A SERIES OF FLASH SHOTS - THE HUNT IN THE SAVANNA
124
	As the "horsemen" close in on the creatures fleeing on foot.

125	MED. CLOSE SHOT - A RIDER

	He reins in, raises his rifle and fires. For the first time, we se that 
	he is a GORILLA. He wears a simple quasi-military uniform -- tunic, 
	trousers and boots.

126	FLASH SHOT - DODGE

	Running through the high grass. He is shot in the back and falls.

127	FLASH SHOT - TAYLOR

	He drops at the side of his fallen comrade.

128	CLOSE TWO SHOT - ANGLING DOWN ON DODGE

	As Taylor rolls him over. Dodge is dead.

129	WIDER ANGLE SHOT - THE SAVANNA - FEATURING A LINE OF BEATERS

	The beaters are all GORILLAS. They carry long sticks and nets, and 
	their task is to flush out the terrified primitives cowering in the 
	tall grass.

130-	A SERIES OF SHOTS - THE HUNTERS AND THE HUNTED:
135	
	(a)	Landon flees from one rider only to be cut off by another. 
		He stumbles and a rearing stallion tramples him.
	
	(b)	A third mounted gorilla flings a net over a running female. 
		She is hopelessly entangled. This is Nova.
	
	(c)	Landon lies unconscious on the grassy plain, an ugly gash 
		on his forehead.
	
	(d)	Taylor crawls through the tall grass on his hands and knees. 
		A rider crosses his path without seeing him.
	
	(e)	The beaters close in on Taylor, blocking his escape route.
	
	(f)	Taylor changes direction and decides to run for it.

136	EXT, SAVANNA - PANNING WITH TAYLOR

	Bent low, he flees through the tall grass. A SHOT rings out. Taylor 
	falls.

137	CLOSE ON TAYLOR

	Lying on his back. His fingers go to his throat. Blood appears between 
	his fingers. He opens his mouth in pain, but no sound comes forth, as 
	Taylor sinks into unconsciousness.

								DISSOLVE TO:

138	EXT. GROVE - FULL SHOT - THE HUNTERS - DAY

	The hunting party has reassembled here beneath the fruit trees. Some of 
	the gorillas have dismounted; others are still on horseback. In the 
	middle distance is a crude horse-drawn wagon. The sides and top of the 
	wagon form a wire cage. Three captive males and one female are visible 
	within the cage. Dodge and Landon are nowhere to be seen. Two gorilla 
	porters enter scene, dragging a male human corpse by the ankles, as two 
	other bearers enter scene with a living burden on a long carrying pole. 
	Taylor dangles from the pole, held aloft by the bonds around his wrists 
	and ankles. CAMERA PANS with the two gorillas as they dump Taylor into 
	the wagon and close the tail gate.

141	CLOSE ON TAYLOR - WITHIN WAGON CAGE

	His throat is smeared with blood. His eyelids flutter as he regains 
	consciousness.

142	CLOSE SHOT - WHAT TAYLOR SEES:

	Three primitive males bound hand and foot. They seem docile in
 	captivity. The female, Nova, clasps bound wrists around her bound 
	ankles and gazes blankly at Taylor. There is a JOLT of MOVEMENT as the
 	wagon gets underway

143	CLOSE ON TAYLOR

	With a great effort he raises himself on one elbow and looks out from 
	the cage.

144	TRUCKING WITH THE WAGON - WHAT TAYLOR SEES:

	A gorilla hunter stands over a dead man, one foot planted he chest of 
	his kill and his rifle butt resting on the on   abdomen. Facing him is 
	another gorilla with an old-fashioned camera on a tripod.

				APE PHOTOGRAPHER
			Smile.

	The hunter bares his teeth.

145 	CLOSE ON TAYLOR

	He faints.

								FADE IN

146	INT. A SURGERY - ANGLING DOWN ON TWO OPERATING TABLES NIGHT

	The surgery is dimly-lit. (If possible we should be unaware of the 
	source of illumination.) Taylor lies strapped to the nearer table. He 
	appears to be unconscious. The young female captive, Nova, is strapped 
	to the table beside him. She is conscious. Taylor is receiving a direct 
	blood transfusion from her.

	Hovering over Taylor are a NURSE and a surgeon named GALEN. Both are 
	chimpanzees. Galen wears a bloody surgical apron, the nurse a white 
	smock. Galen is removing a filthy bandage from Taylor's neck. A door 
	behind them opens and DR. ZIRA, an animal psychologist,	enters. She, 
	too, is a chimpanzee and wears a smock like the nurse's.

				ZIRA 
			Which one was wearing the strange 
			clothes?

				GALEN
			Him.

	Zira looks down at Taylor.

				ZIRA
			Will he live?

				GALEN 
				(irritably) 
			I don't know. This beast lost a lot 
			of blood.

	Galen paws through a tray of surgical instruments. The equipment is 	
	obsolescent and the room untidy -- like that of a callous small-town 
	veterinarian.

				GALEN
				(to Nurse )
			There's no probe here. Find one!

				NURSE
			Yes, sir.

	She exits. Zira runs a forefinger across a dusty table.Her voice is 
	soft and well-modulated.

				ZIRA
			This place is dirty, doctor.

				GALEN 
				(defensively) 
			These animals are dirty, doctor. They 
			stink, and they carry communicable 
			diseases. Why aren't they cleaned up 
			before they're brought here?

147	CLOSE TWO SHOT - TAYLOR AND NOVA

	His eyes come open. Over this we hear:

				ZIRA'S VOICE 
				(o.s.) 
			You don't sound happy in your work.

				GALEN'S VOICE 
				(o.s.) 
			I'm nothing more than a vet in this 
			laboratory...

	Taylor feebly turns his head and looks at Nova. She returns his gaze 
	with an unchanged empty stare. We sense that Taylor realizes her blood 
	is flowing into his veins. Over this we hear:

				GALEN'S VOICE 
				(o.s.) 
			You promised to speak to Dr. Zaius 
			about me.

				ZIRA'S VOICE 
				(o.s.) 
			I did. But you know how he looks down 
			his nose at chimpanzees.

	Taylor rolls his eyes toward the apes. Weak as he is,we see his 
	astonishment at hearing them talk.

148	BACK TO GROUP AROUND OPERATING TABLE

	as the Nurse reenters with a probe and hands it to Dr. Galen, who 
	protests to Zira:

				GALEN 
			But the quota system's been abolished! 
			You made it. Why can't I?

 				ZIRA
			What do you mean, made it? I'm an 
			animal psychologist, that's all. We 
			don't have any authority.

				GALEN 
			You do pretty well when it comes to 
			getting space and equipment.

				ZIRA 
			That's because Dr. Zaius realizes our 
			work has value.

				GALEN
			Hmph.

				ZIRA 
			The foundations of scientific brain 
			surgery are being laid right here - 
			in studies of cerebral function in 
			these animals.

				GALEN 
			They're still dirty. And their bite is 
			septic. Look at that ...

	He shows Zira infected teeth marks on the back of his left hand.

				GALEN 
				(to Nurse) 
			Hold his head.

	The Nurse complies, gripping Taylor's skull with both hands. Galen 
	leans down and begins to probe the throat wound. Taylor passes out.

149	INT. A ROW OF CAGES - ANIMAL LABORATORY - TRACKING SHOT DAY

	The cages are no larger than small jail cells. There are four of them. 
	Bars, not walls, divide the cages, so that all four are visible. Each 
	of the first three cages is occupied by a primitive male. At the moment 
	the first two are quiet -- dozing or scratching apathetically. The 
	third occupant is stolidly regarding a half-dozen brightly colored 
	hollow wooden boxes, or blocks, Of varying sizes and proportions on the 
	floor of his cage. He is trying to stack the boxes in such a way as to 
	reach a banana dangling from a cord twelve feet overhead. He has 
	correctly selected the first two large, sturdy blocks for his tower 
	under the banana -- but the tall third block is too unstable on its 
	small base to support the broad-based fourth block.

149-A	CLOSE - TAYLOR

	Taylor, Looking much stronger, sits on a pile of dirty straw in the 
	fourth cage. There is a clean bandage around his throat. He watches the 
	block-building primitive with contemptous amusement.

	Both the third and fourth blocks tumble to the floor when the primitive 
	tries to mount his tower. He stands there, staring dully at the 
	scattered blocks, then up at the unattainable banana.

149-B	MED. - THE	LABORATORY
	
	A door at the end of the aisle opens and a gorilla named JULIUS enters, 
	dressed in a keeper's uniform. He quickly closes the door, snatches up 
	a broom, starts sweeping. Julius is obviously late for work. Taylor 
	struggles to his feet, moves to the bars of the cage, tries to call 
	out.

				TAYLOR 
				(soundlessly) 
			Hey! Hey!

	The three other primitives move toward the bars of their cages. Julius 
	barks at them.

				JULIUS
			Simmer down!
				(points at Taylor) 
			You especially.

	The third primitive goes back to stacking his blocks. Julius comes up 
	to Taylor's cage, indicates a like set of blocks strewn across its 
	floor, extends his broom handle to whack the banana overhead.

				JULIUS 
			Better give it a try, stupid. Unless 
			you like going hungry.

	He returns to his sweeping. Taylor glowers at him. A moment later, the 
	door at the end of the aisle opens and Dr. Zira enters.

				JULIUS
			Good morning, Dr. Zira.

				ZIRA 
			Good morning, Julius. How's our patient 
			today?

				JULIUS 
			No change. The minute you open the door, 
			he goes into his act.

	She starts down the aisle toward Taylor's cage. He grasps the bars, 
	awaiting her anxiously. As she passes the second cage, the primitive in 
	it shakes the bars, jumps up and down. His tongue is hanging out. Zira 
	smiles, stops, digs into the pocket of her smock.

				ZIRA 
				(playfully) 
			Well, what do we want this morning? Do 
			we want something? Speak! Come on, speak!

	The primitive continues to jump up and down energetically. Zira takes a 
	cube of sugar from her pocket, holds it up for his inspection.

				ZIRA
			Do we want some sugar, old-timer?

	The man eagerly sticks his hand through the bars. She drops the cube in 
	his hands. He jams it into his mouth.

				JULIUS 
				(concerned) 
			You could get hurt doing that, Doctor.

				ZIRA
			Don't be silly. He's perfectly tame.

	She moves toward Taylor's cage, Julius behind her.

				JULIUS 
			They're all tame until they take a 
			chunk out of you.

150	CLOSE SHOT - FEATURING TAYLOR - ZIRA AND JULIUS

	Taylor starts to open his mouth as Zira comes up to the bars.

				ZIRA
			Well, Bright Eyes, is our throat
			feeling better?

				TAYLOR
				(frantic mouthing)
			Listen, listen -- I can speak --

	He winces, puts his hand to the bandage.

				ZIRA
				(sympathetically)
			Awww, it still hurts, doesn't it?

				JULIUS 
			See? He keeps pretending he can 
			talk.

	Taylor glares at Julius, slams the bars.

				TAYLOR
				(mouthing)
			I'm not pretending! I can talk!

	Zira hurriedly takes a pen and notebook from the breast Docket of her 
	smock, starts to scribble.

				ZIRA
				(excitedly)
			Did you see that? It's remarkable!

				JULIUS
			Huh?

				ZIRA
			He's trying to form words.

				JULIUS
			Well, you know what they say.
			Human see, human do.

	Taylor is staring in silent fascination at the open and notebook.He 
	stops mouthing, points at them.

				JULIUS
			Now what?

	Taylor gestures for Zira to come closer to the bars.

				ZIRA
			He seems to want something.

	She advances tentatively toward the cage.

				JULIUS
			I'd be careful, doctor.

	Taylor suddenly reaches through the bars, tries to snatch the pen and 
	notebook from Zira. Julius instantly jabs his broom handle through the 
	bars, hitting Taylor in the ribs.

				JULIUS 
			What did I tell you! 
				(to Taylor) 
			Try that again, I'll break your arm!

	Zira draws back, looking at Taylor in surprise.

151	CLOSER - TAYLOR

	His face is twisted in frustration.

				TAYLOR
				(mouthing)
			What's the matter with you? I can
			talk! Can't you see that?

	Over this a door is heard opening o.s., and Julius' voice, nervous, 
	deferential:

				JULIUS' VOICE 
				(o.s.)
			Good morning, Your Excellency.

	Taylor looks o.s.

161	BOOM SHOT - THE THREE APES - FROM TAYLOR'S P.O.V.

	Julius and Zira cross to a stout, imposing orangutan who has just 
	entered the laboratory. Julius bows to him. This is DR. ZAIUS. Like the 
	other apes, he wears a simple tunic and trousers, but his garments are 
	of a Costlier material, and several decorations are woven into the sash 
	of his tunic.

				ZIRA 
				(bubbling) 
			Dr. Zaius, I'm so glad you could come. 
			He's over here.

	Zaius crosses with them to Taylor's cage. Beneath his austere manner, 
	we sense tension, worry. Zira looks up at Taylor, her tone an appeal.

				ZIRA
			Bright Eyes, show him! Go ahead!
			Do your trick!

	Taylor just glares at her.

				ZIRA
			Speak! Go on.	Speak again.

				TAYLOR
				(silent mouthing) 
			My - name - isn't - Bright Eyes It's 
			Taylor!

				ZIRA 
			There! Can you believe it? I looks 
			like he's talking.

				ZAIUS 
				(evenly) 
			Yes, amusing. A man who acts like an ape.

	Taylor turns to Zaius.

				TAYLOR 
				(silent mouthing) 
			I'm not acting! I can talk! How much 
			proof do you want?

				ZIRA 
				(thunderstruck) 
			Dr. Zaius, I could have sworn he was 
			answering you!

				ZAIUS 
				(nodding, but unmoved) 
			He shows a definite gift for mimicry.

	Zira wiggles her fingers excitedly.

				ZIRA
			I wonder how held score on a Hopkins
			manual dexterity test?

	Zaius' voice is quiet, but there is steel in it.

				ZAIUS
			An animal?

				JULIUS
			Look!

	Taylor is frantically wiggling his fingers.

				ZIRA
			He's moving his fingers!

				ZAIUS
			Of course. He saw you moving yours.

				ZIRA
			But perhaps he understood --

161-A	CLOSE - TAYLOR 

	He is pleading silently as Zaius' voice is heard over the SHOT.

				ZAIUS' VOICE 
				(o.s., hard) 
			Man has no understanding, Dr. Zira. 
			He can be taught a few simple tricks. 
			Nothing more.

				ZIRA'S VOICE
				(o.s.)
			I beg to disagree. According to my exper-
			iments --

161-B	CLOSE - ZAIUS

	A warning burns out of his eyes as he stares at Taylor.

				ZAIUS 
			A word to the wise, Dr. Zira. Experimental 
			brain surgery on these creatures is one 
			thing. I'm all for it.

161-C	CLOSER - TAYLOR

	Fear clouds his eyes. Abruptly, he stops moving his lips.

161-D	MED. THE GROUP

	Zaius sees the effect his words have had on Taylor. He turns to Zira, 
	goes on in a more detached tone.

				ZAIUS 
	But your behavioral studies are another matter entirely. To suggest 
	that we can learn something about simian nature from a study of man is 
	nonsense. Besides, men are a nuisance. They outgrow their own food 
	supply in the forest and migrate to our green belts and ravage our 
	crops. 
				(looking casually 
				at Taylor) 
	The sooner they're exterminated, the better.

	He turns toward the door. A disappointed Zira follows him. Zaius looks 
	back at Taylor just before going out.

				ZAIUS
			It's a question of simian survival.

161-E	CLOSE - TAYLOR

	He stares after Zaius, than looks away, slumps to the floor. A pause, 
	then a VOICE is heard.

				APE GUARD
			Is this the one you wanted, Doctor?

				ZIRA'S VOICE 
				(o.s.)
			Yes, thank you.
				(pause, her voice 
				much closer) 
			Bright Eyes?

	Taylor looks up.

				ZIRA'S VOICE 
				(o.s.)
			I've got a present for you.

161-F	ANOTHER ANGLE - THE CAGE

	Standing outside the cage, held on a leash by an APE GUARD  is Nova. 
	She looks at Taylor without expression. Zira gestures at JULIUS.

				ZIRA
			Put her in with him.

	Julius unlocks the cage door-, leads Nova inside, removes her leash and 
	collar. Taylor has gotten to his feet. Julius goes out, locking the 
	door behind him. Nova hesitates, then slowly reaches out, takes 
	Taylor's hand. Zira beams at them.

170	EXT.-  EXERCISE YARD - ANIMAL COMPOUND - ESTABLISHING SHOT DAY

	It is nothing elaborate, A wire fence encloses a dirt yard. This 
	compound is situated on the outskirts of Apetown and the town is 
	visible in the distance.

	There are about a dozen adult human captives within the enclosure, no 
	more than a third of them females. Some of them trudge around the dusty 
	yard like convicts in a penitentiary. Others squat against the sun-
	drenched wall.

	A big male suddenly runs to the fence and tries to climb it. Several 
	guides, armed with whips and torches, immediately close in on him. The 
	primitive recoils in fear from a fiery torch and rejoins the captives' 
	circle.

171	CLOSER ANGLE - THE YARD - FEATURING TAYLOR

	He plods sullenly back and forth across the rear of the yard, 
	occasionally glancing off toward the approaches to the compound. Nova 
	is at his heels. He ignores her. Once again he looks off, stops 
	suddenly. Nova bumps into him. He turns, impatiently shoos her away, 
	then looks o.s., again.

172	ZIRA AND COMPANION - TAYLOR'S P.O.V.

	Zira can be seen approaching with a young chimpanzee, DR. CORNELIUS. He 
	wears a simple smock over his tunic and trousers. Cornelius glances 
	surreptitiously around, covertly takes Zira's hand.

				CORNELIUS
			Do you have to work tonight?

				ZIRA 
			No.

				CORNELIUS 
			Neither do I.

	He gives her a quick peck on the cheek.

173	CLOSER - TAYLOR

	He drifts toward the fence, Nova behind him.

174	MED. SHOT - ZIRA AND CORNELIUS

	They come up to the fence. Zira nods toward Taylor.

				ZIRA 
			That's Bright Eyes. The one I was telling 
			you about.

				CORNELIUS 
			What's so special about him?

				ZIRA
			Watch.
				(to Taylor)
			Hello, Bright Eyes. How's our
			throat today?

	Taylor stares at her impassively, then looks around to a that no guards 
	are watching, hunkers down, begins to scratch in the dust. Nova extends 
	unclean fingers to touch the bandage on his throat. Taylor flinches, 
	pushes her hand away. Nova touches a bluish bruise on the inside of her 
	own forearm, then searches for a similar bruise on Taylor's forearm.

				ZIRA 
				(excited)
			Look -- she remembers.

				CORNELIUS
			Remembers what?

				ZIRA
			The blood transfusion.

				CORNELIUS 
				(peeved)
			Zira, come on. You know they

			Oh oh. Here comes Number One.

	Taylor looks up and o.s., quickly rises.

A-175	MED. SHOT - TAYLOR

	He has stepped back from the marks he made in the-dust, is watching 
	Zaius with concern.

			The project will require my support, of

176	MED. CLOSE SHOT - ANGLING DOWN ON TAYLOR AND NOVA

	A primitive male squats down to see what Taylor has marked on the 
	ground. In letters a foot high he has written:

			I CAN WRITE

	Nova, at once petulant and playful, erases the WRITE with a bare foot. 
	Taylor angrily flings her aside. This violence provokes the primitive 
	male, who snarls at Taylor and cuffs him. Over this we HEAR from a 
	distance:

				CORNELIUS' VOICE
				(o.s.)
			I hope I can count on it, sir.

				ZAIUS' VOICE
				(o.s)
			A friendly warning, Cornelius --
		 	when you're digging for artifacts,
			don't bury your reputation.

	Taylor slugs the snarling male, who wades in, trying to bite him.

				A VOICE
				(o.s.)
			Guards!

177	WIDER ANGLE - THE FIGHT

	Two gorilla guards rush in to break up the fight. One of them lashes 
	out with his whip. The other pokes his torch at Taylor. Its flame 
	brushes his arm. Taylor opens his mouth, gives a silent yell of pain, 
	shrinks back. Zira runs to the fence.

				ZIRA 
				(to guards) 
			Stop! You've hurt him! Take them inside!

	Prodding the malcreants with their torches, the two guards herd them 
	toward a doorway in the wall. Zira hurries around the side of the fence 
	and o.s.

178	MED. SHOT - ZAIUS, CORNELIUS, HUNT CLUB LEADER

	Zaius' extended foot appears beneath the bottom wire of the fence. The 
	foot wipes out the letters.

180	CLOSEUP - ZAIUS

	His face is a mask.

181	INT. TAYLOR'S CAGE - MED. SHOT - DAY

	He is slumped against the bars of the cell, gingerly touching a large, 
	reddening blotch on his arm. Julius watches him uncertainly from a few 
	yards away . In the b.g., the outside door opens and Zira rushes in, 
	hurries down the aisle.

				JULIUS 
			What happened?

				ZIRA 
			Those fools and their torches! Do you 
			have any ointment?

				JULIUS 
			I'll see.

	He moves to a cabinet at the other end of the laboratory, rummages 
	through some drawers.

182	MED. SHOT - ZIRA - FROM TAYLOR'S P.O.V.

	Zira comes up to Taylor's cage, studies him solicitously.

				ZIRA
			I'm sorry, Bright Eyes.

183	ANOTHER ANGLE - TO INCLUDE TAYLOR

	He looks steadily at Zira, who is only an arm's length away. CAMERA 
	MOVES IN on them. Suddenly Taylor reaches out, snatching the pen and 
	notebook from the pocket of her smock. Zira leaps back with a cry. 
	Julius grabs a club, races up to the cage, unlocks the door.

				JULIUS
			I told you what you'd get!

184	WIDER ANGLE - TO INCLUDE THEM ALL

	Taylor is scribbling furiously on a sheet of note paper. The guard 
	moves in, his club upraised.

				ZIRA
				(pleading)
			Julius, don't. It doesn't matter.

	Julius swings his-club at Taylor's head. Taylor lifts his right arm to 
	ward off the blow, and the stick strikes him sharply on the hand. He 
	drops the pen and notebook. The guard swings again, driving Taylor to 
	the wall. Then Julius retrieves the stolen articles.

185	ANOTHER ANGLE - FAVORING ZIRA

	The guard returns her pen and notebook with the comment:

				JULIUS 
			Natural born thieves, aren't they?

	Zira glances at the notebook. Her face clouds.

186	INSERT - WHAT SHE READS:

	A hasty, almost illegible scrawl:

		MY NAME IS TAYLOR.

187	CLOSEUP - ZIRA

	Her eyes afire with a wild surmise.

188	TWO SHOT - ZIRA AND JULIUS

	Her eyes never leave Taylor as she tells the guard:

				ZIRA 
			Get me a collar and leash. I'm 
			taking him to the infirmary.

				JULIUS 
			He's vicious, Doctor. Besides, it's 
			against the rules.

				ZIRA 
			Do as I say.

	The guard shrugs and moves Off 0.3. Zira beckons to Taylor. He comes 
	forward to the bars of the cage.

				ZIRA 
				(sotto voce) 
			You wouldn't hurt me, would 
			you... Taylor?

189	INT. DR. CORNELIUS' OFFICE - ESTABLISHING SHOT - DAY

	The office is simple, almost Spartan. There are books but no bric-a-
	brac; several painted portraits of Great Apes but no tape recorder or 
	other modern office equipment. Taylor sits at a desk, scribbling 
	furiously on a sheet of paper. His leash has been removed, but not his 
	collar. Zira stands at his elbow. Cornelius paces nervously up and 
	down, reading a sheaf of notes Taylor has already written.

				CORNELIUS
				(stubbornly)
			It's a stunt. Humans don't write.

				ZIRA
			Dear, you're a scientist. Don't
			you believe your own eyes?

				CORNELIUS
				(to Taylor)
			Where did you learn to do this?

190	ANOTHER ANGLE - THE OFFICE

	Taylor scribbles something on a small desk pad, rips off the page, 
	hands it to Cornelius.

				CORNELIUS 
			Jefferson Public School, Fort Wayne, 
			Indiana?

	He looks at Taylor narrowly. Taylor nods.

				CORNELIUS 
				(sardonically) 
			Back on that planet you say you came from? 
				(Taylor nods again) 
			Um-hm. 
				(to Zira) 
			He may be intelligent, but he's also mad.

	Taylor scribbles something else on the pad, hands it to Zira, points at 
	Cornelius.

				ZIRA
				(reads aloud)
			'And you're a fool'.

	She smiles. Cornelius bristles.

				CORNELIUS
			Now, just a minute --

				ZIRA
			Oh, Cornelius, be quiet.

	Taylor has resumed writing. He hands the sheet to Zira, who reads 
	aloud.

				ZIRA 
			'Dodge was killed in the hunt. What 
			happened to Landon?' 
				(looking at Taylor) 
			I don't know.

				CORNELIUS 
				(scornfully) 
			And they fell out of the sky with you?

	Taylor writes quickly, hands the note to Zira.

				ZIRA
				(reading)
			'Not fell -- flew!'

	Taylor impatiently begins to fold a sheet of paper.

				CORNELIUS
			Flight is a scientific impossibility.

				ZIRA
			And even if it weren't, why fly?
			Where would it get you?

	Taylor points to the floor and mouths the word "Here." He flings the 
	paper plane he has just fashioned into the air. It describes a graceful 
	arc around the room and lands at the feet of Cornelius, who slowly 
	picks it up, then exchanges a long glance with Zira.

				CORNELIUS
				(softly)
			Well, now...

	Taylor scribbles on a piece of paper, hands it to Zira.

				ZIRA
				(reading)
			'Do you have maps?'

	Cornelius puts the paper plane on his desk, crosses to a wall map 
	designed like a window shade. He pulls it down Taylor and Zira join him 
	at the map.

191	CLOSE ON MAP

	It's not a map of the whole planet, of course, but only of that portion 
	known to the apes. Therefore it has the antique and fragmentary aspect 
	of a map drawn by some Babylonian cartographer.

	A swatch of blue at the right margin indicates a sea. In the southwest 
	quadrant are the "greenbelts" of the ape civilization, looking on the 
	map like jade stones strung on crescent-shaped necklace. Rubyidots in 
	the lade indicate ape communities. The northwest quadrant, colored 
	brown, is apparently uninhabited. East of the green belts is a patch of 
	green savanna, and next to it the darker green of a jungle. The eastern 
	quadrants are rendered in yellow, and except for a blue lake, appear to 
	be lifeless desert and barren mountain. This area is marked FORBIDDEN 
	ZONE.

	Using a pointer, Cornelius orients Taylor, indicating a red dot in the 
	middle of the green belt.

				CORNELIUS
			We are here ...
				(moving pointer)
			You were captured about here.

	Taylor studies the map, then pointing at the lake in the eastern 
	desert, he goes into a brief charade, dramatizing the astronauts' 
	landing and trek.

				ZIRA 
				(interpreting his 
				movements) 
			You fell in the water here? ... you came 
			ashore ... you marched across the desert ... 
			the mountains ... many days and nights ... 
			and reached the jungle.

	Taylor nods, smiles gratefully.

				CORNELIUS
				(flatly)
			Out - of - the - question!.

	Taylor slams his fist against the wall in frustration.

				ZIRA 
				(annoyed) 
			Cornelius, why do you insist on 
			provoking him?

				CORNELIUS 
				(tapping map) 
		No creature can survive in that part of 
		the Forbidden Zone. I've been there. I've 
		seen it.

192	WIDER ANGLE - THE THREESOME

	Taylor strides to the desk, writes something, hands it to Zira.

				ZIRA
				(reading)
			'Then how do you account for me?,

				CORNELIUS 
			I don't. And I'm not going to try.

				ZIRA 
			But what about your theory? The existence 
			of someone like Taylor might prove it.

				CORNELIUS 
				(shushing her) 
			Zira, are you trying to get my head cut 
			off?

				ZIRA 
			Don't be foolish. If it's true, they'll 
			have to accept it.

				CORNELIUS 
			No, they won't -

	Taylor touches Zira on the arm, makes a gesture of inquiry.

				ZIRA 
			Cornelius has developed a brilliant 
			hypothesis -

				CORNELIUS
				(quickly)
			It's probably wrong --

				ZIRA 
			-- that the ape evolved from a lower order 
			of primate, possibly man. In his trip to 
			the Forbidden Zone he discovered traces of a 
			culture older than recorded time -

				CORNELIUS
			The evidence was very meager --

				ZIRA
			You didn't think so then.

				CORNELIUS 
			That was before Dr. Zaius and half the 
			Academy said the idea was heresy.

				ZIRA 
			How can scientific truth be heresy? What 
			if Taylor is exactly the proof you needed? 
			A mutation. A missing link between the 
			unevolved primate and the ape -

	Taylor bangs his fist on the desk, mouths the word "No!" scribbles 
	something on a piece of paper.

				CORNELIUS 
			He's touchy, isn't he?

	Taylor thrusts the sheet at Zira, who reads it aloud.

				ZIRA
			'I am not a missing link.'

				CORNELIUS 
			Because if he is a missing link, it means 
			the Sacred Scrolls aren't worth their 
			parchment.

				ZIRA 
			Well, maybe they're not.

				CORNELIUS
			No, thank you'. I won't get into
			that battle.

				ZIRA
			Oh, Cornelius, show some strength!

				CORNELIUS 
			Zira, listen to me. We've got a fine 
			future ahead of us. Marriage. Stimulating 
			careers. I'm up for a raise --

	At that moment 	there is a. loud RAP at the door o.s. All turn.

193	REVERSE ANGLE - TO INCLUDE THE DOOR

	Dr. Zaius enters with another portly figure, DR. MAXIMUS. Like Zaius., 
	Maximus is an orangutan.

				CORNELIUS
				(flustered)
			Dr. Zaius --

				ZAIUS
				(not unkindly) 	
			Did you forget our appointment, 
			Cornelius?

				CORNELIUS
			Oh., no., sir. I was just assembling 
			my notes.

				ZAIUS 
			You know Dr. Maximus, our Commissioner 
			for Animal Affairs?

				CORNELIUS 
			Certainly, sir. It's a pleasure to see 
			you again.

	He hurries to his desk, starts gathering papers. Maximus notes Taylor 
	with distaste.

				MAXIMUS
			What is that?

				ZIRA
			A man, Dr. Maximus.

				MAXIMUS 
			I know it's a man. And you know the 
			rules. No animals outside the compound, 
			and most certainly not without a leash.

194	ANOTHER ANGLE - THE OFFICE - FAVORING ZAIUS

	During the ensuing exchange, Zaius wanders idly through the office. He 
	glances at the scattered handwritten notes, but does not read them. 
	Meanwhile a rattled Zira replies to Maximus.

				ZIRA
			Yes, Sir. But this -- creature
			is a special case.

				MAXIMUS
			Why special?

				ZIRA 
			We're -- conducting a new experiment.

				ZAIUS 
			Wouldn't it more properly be done in 
			your office?

				ZIRA
			Yes, Sir.

				MAXIMUS 
				(calling)
			Guards?

	The gorilla GUARDS enter from outside.

				MAXIMUS
			Return this beast to the compound.

195	ANOTHER ANGLE - FAVORING TAYLOR

	He regards the apes with hostility as they cross to him. One picks up 
	his leash. Over THE SHOT we hear:

				ZAIUS' VOICE
				(o.s.) 
			What's this?

196	REVERSE ANGLE - FEATURING ZAIUS

	Zira stiffens, looking at Zaius. He is holding the paper plane
	fashioned by Taylor.

				ZIRA
			A toy. It floats on the air.
				(faint defiance)
			Try it.

				CORNELIUS
				(a warning)
			Zira....

	Zaius looks down at the paper plane in his hand, then back to Zira. He 
	smiles tolerantly.

				ZAIUS
			Nonsense.

	He crumples the paper plane into a b all., drops it on the desk. The 
	ape hooks the leash to Taylor's collar, starts leading him out. Zira 
	follows them.

								DISSOLVE TO:

197 	INT. CAGES - ANIMAL COMPOUND - FULL SHOT - DAY

	The caged primitives are asleep. Julius, the keeper, dozes in a chair 
	outside Taylor's cage. CAMERA PIVOTS MOVING IN ON Taylor, who is lying 
	on his side, also asleep. Nova is curled up behind him. At the sound of 
	a door opening, she comes instantly awake, sitting up and clutching 
	Taylor's arm. He comes groggily awake, raising his head in time to 
	hear:

				JULIUS' VOICE
				(o.s.)
			What's up, Lieutenant?

198	REVERSE ANGLE - WHAT TAYLOR SEES:

	TWO GORILLA OFFICERS have just entered the compound. They wear side 
	arms. Julius has just risen from his  chair.

				APE LIEUTENANT 
			We're taking Number Four over to surgery 
			in five minutes. Have him ready.

				JULIUS 
			How come? The beast's throat is nearly 
			healed.

				LIEUTENANT 
				(snickering) 
			It's not his throat this time. The vet's 
			going to geld him.

199	CLOSEUP - TAYLOR

	He stiffens but does not move. The apes, of course, speak freely in 
	front of him, believing the animal cannot understand.

				JULIUS' VOICE 
				(o.s.) 
			Dr. Zira won't like it. She wants this 
			pair to mate.

200	BACK TO THE APES - FROM TAYLOR'S P.O.V.

	As the Lieutenant replies:

				LIEUTENANT 
			These orders came from Dr. Zaius himself. 
			There's nothing she can do about it.

	The two gorillas exit. The guard crosses to a wall peg for a collar and 
	'Leash.

201	CLOSE TWO SHOT - TAYLOR AND NOVA

	Pushing Nova aside, Taylor rises.

202	MED. SHOT - THE CAGE

	As Julius unlocks the door and cautiously approaches Taylor, carrying 
	the collar and leash.

				JULIUS 
				(murmuring) 
			If only you knew, Bright Eyes, what 
			they're going to do ... 
				(raising collar) 
			Stand still now...don't give me any 
			trouble.

	The heel of Taylor's right palm crashes into the keeper's, chin, nearly 
	snapping his neck. Julius falls unconscious. Taylor leans over him, 
	taking his night stick and a set of keys on his belt.

203	REVERSE ANGLE - TO INCLUDE NOVA AND MALE IN ADJACENT CAGE

	The male has awakened. He stares stupidly at Taylor. Nova is 
	whimpering, little strange cries of fear. Taylor moves o.s.

204	ANOTHER ANGLE - PANNING WITH TAYLOR

	He leaves the cage, moves swiftly to the nearby door and exits.

205	INT. A DARK CORRIDOR - FULL SHOT - DAY

	Barefoot, Taylor silently pads down the corridor to a locked door.

206	CLOSE ON A DOOR

	Which is visible because of a beam of sunlight from the half-open door
 	of a guard room. We HEAR a murmur of ape voices and LAUGHTER. Taylor 
	fumbles with the keys, finds one that fits the lock and opens the door.

207	EXT. ANIMAL COMPOUND - MED. SHOT - TAYLOR - DAY

	He emerges, quietly locking the door behind him. Two tethered horses
	can be seen in deep b.g., and another gust of LAUGHTER can be heard 
	from the nearby guard room. Taylor looks off.

208	LONG SHOT - WHAT TAYLOR SEES:

	As already established, the animal compound is situated on the 
	outskirts of the apes' community. The strange skyline of the town can 
	be seen in the distance.

209	PANNING WITH TAYLOR

	He starts to cross an open field outside the compound. At that moment 
	we HEAR a shrill police WHISTLE from the guard room. Taylor breaks into 
	a run.

210	REVERSE ANGLE - THE COMPOUND

	As the two gorilla officers emerge from the building and run toward 
	their horses.

211	EXT. A DIRT ROAD - LONG SHOT - TAYLOR

	He runs down the road, starts across the long causeway that bisects a 
	small lake, looking over his shoulder.

								QUICK DISSOLVE TO:

212	EXT. APETOWN - LONG ESTABLISHING SHOT - DAY

	The community we sue at the end of the causeway is small and arcane. 
	There are no power lines, no street lamps -- indeed, no streets as 
	such, but only a small cluster of buildings around a pleasant mall. The 
	architecture of the buildings is faintly derivative of the simpler and 
	less rococo work of Antonio Gaudi -- columns and pillars of brick or
 	exterior masonry look like the trunks and branches of great trees and 
	suggest an arboreal past.

	A small number of apes are visible on the mall:

	Taylor darts behind the buttress of a building, casing the situation. 
	He looks back at:

213	EXT. LAKE AND CAUSEWAY - LONG SHOT - MORNING

	The two mounted gorilla-police can be seen on the causeway, galloping 
	straight toward CAMERA. It is evident they will soon spot Taylor.

214	BACK TO TAYLOR - CLOSE SHOT

	He retreats from the buttress to a dark archway and vanishes inside the 
	building.

215	INT. A DARK VESTIBULE - MOVING WITH TAYLOR

	The vestibule is nothing, no set required, a dark space through which 
	Taylor moves toward a shaft of light. We HEAR faintly the discordant 
	chords of an organ. Or is it an organ? At any rate,a strange and 
	melancholy tune. Taylor arrives at a font.

216	INT. A TEMPLE - PANNING WITH TAYLOR

	He appears out of darkness into half-light. The rear of the temple is 
	obscure. Taylor darts behind a screen. Crouching there, he observes:

217	A FUNERAL CEREMONY IN THE TEMPLE - MED. LONG SHOT

	The temple itself is small and austere. There is no altar, but against 
	a plain backdrop we see a statue of the Lawgiver, a Great Ape holding a 
	book. Below the Lawgiver is an ORANGUTAN MINISTER clothed in black 
	robes. He stands in front of a closed coffin. A dozen mourners, seated 
	on comfortable wicker chairs, form a semi-circle around the coffin. The 
	ape ladies wear cowls.

				MINISTER 
			Weep if you must, but make an end of 
			sorrow. He lives again. Yes, he has 
			found peace in Heaven.

218	CLOSEUP - TAYLOR

	Crouching, listening, wide-eyed.

				MINISTER'S VOICE 
				(o.s.) 
			He was a model for us all, a gorilla to 
			remember; hunter, warrior, defender of 
			the Faith.

219	BACK TO FUNERAL CEREMONY - FROM TAYLOR'S P.O.V.

	As the minister continues his eulogy, a small ape boy detaches himself 
	(as children will) from the group of mourners and comes marching up the 
	aisle toward the rear of the temple.

				MINISTER 
			Cherished husband, beloved father, 
			generous master -- yes, he was a font 
			of simian kindness.

220 	REVERSE ANGLE - SHOOTING AT TAYLOR

	Who is still crouching behind the screen in deep b.g. The small fry is 
	coming closer. Over this we hear:

				MINISTER'S VOICE
				(o.s.)
			The dear departed once said to me:
			'I never met an ape I didn't like'...

	The small fry spots Taylor.

				CHILD
				(shrill soprano)
			Look!. It's a man!

	The mourners' heads turn. Taylor slinks toward the vestibule.

221	ANOTHER ANGLE - FEATURING THE MINISTER

	He is aghast.

				MINISTER
			In Heaven's name ...
				(aside to ushers)
			Get rid of that creature.

	Two ushers rise, moving past CAMERA and o.s.

222	EXT. TEMPLE - CLOSE ON VESTIBULE DOOR

	Staying close on the temple wall, Taylor moves stealthily away from the 
	vestibule door. The two ape ushers appear.

				FIRST USHER 
				(pointing) 	
			There he is:

	They move toward Taylor.

223	FLASH SHOT - TAYLOR

	He runs out onto the mall.

224	FULL SHOT - THE MALL

	Taylor belatedly sees that he is running straight toward his two
 	mounted pursuers. Darting off in another direction, he races past 
	startled pedestrians.

225	REACTION SHOT - TWO CHIMP PEDESTRIANS

	They do a slow take.

				FIRST CHIMP
			You see what I saw?

				SECOND CHIMP
			Must've escaped from the zoo.

226	MED. SHOT - A MOUNTED COP

	He has spotted Taylor. Drawing a folded net from his saddlebag, he 
	swings it overhead (like a cowboy with a lariat) and gallops off in 
	pursuit of the man.

227-	SEVERAL SHOTS - TAYLOR AND PURSUING MOUNTIE
231

	Taylor runs frantically from building to building, rounding corners, 
	vanishing momentarily and reappearing on another part of the mall. At 
	one point the mountie nearly overtakes him and flings his net, which 
	falls short. Taylor runs on.

232	EXT. AN AMPHITHEATER - LOW ANGLE SHOT (FROM GROUND LEVEL)

	It is an open-air structure, like a Greek theater, located near the 
	central mail. Steeply tiered, it seats no more than fifty apes. The 
	dais in the pit is some fifteen feet above ground level.

	Taylor enters scene, running toward the amphitheater. Changing 
	direction, he darts into what appears to be an access tunnel. A moment 
	later the pursuing cop rides into' scene, dismounts and walks toward 
	the amphitheater, looking around for Taylor.

233	EXT. AMPHITHEATER - HIGH ANGLE SHOT (FROM TOPMOST TIER)

	Taylor suddenly emerges from the access tunnel and runs up a ramp 
	encircling the amphitheater. (A retaining wall shields him from the 
	view of the apes.) Pausing for breath at the top of the ramp, Taylor 
	crouches behind the uppermost tier of seats and peers down:

	THE AMPHITHEATER - FROM TAYLOR'S P.O.V.

	The cop looks around, spots Taylor at the top tier, and starts up after 
	him.

235-	OUT
237

238	EXT. TOP OF AMPHITHEATER - PANNING WITH TAYLOR

	He starts to run back down the ramp, but is suddenly confronted by his 
	original pursuer (the dismounted cop coming up the ramp. Reversing 
	direction, Taylor runs around the rim of the amphitheater and vanishes 
	into an exit tunnel. The cop blows his whistle, summoning another cop, 
	who joins him in the chase.

239-	ANOTHER PART OF THE MALL - A SWIFT SEQUENCE OF SHOTS
244

	In which we see the fugitive, his pursuers and the reactions of ape 
	shoppers and workers.

245-	EXT. OPEN-AIR MARKET - SEVERAL SHOTS
248

	A market has been set up on one side of the mall, where street vendors 
	behind carts or tables hawk their wares: fruits, vegetables, wearing 
	apparel, etc. As Taylor runs frantically through the market place, 
	several apes join the chase. In the ensuing pandemonium, like the 
	proverbial Chinese fire drill, several tables are overturned.

249	EXT. A BUILDING - CLOSE ON AN ARCHWAY

	Taylor runs into scene, pauses, panting, and looks back at his 
	pursuers. Then he darts through the archway into the building.

250	INT. BUILDING - TRACKING WITH TAYLOR - DAY

	For the moment he is the sole visitor in this wing. His pace slows to a 
	walk as he and we observe fleetingly the specimens in what is a simian 
	museum: Possibly several stuffed and unfamiliar animals; primitive 
	artifacts and fossils; possibly the skeleton of a dog, a cat, etc. Over 
	this we hear a shrill police WHISTLE.

251	FLASH SHOT - TAYLOR

	He runs again.

252	MED. SHOT - AN APE MOTHER AND CHILD

	Looking at the stuffed animals as Taylor races past. The mother gives a 
	startled SCREAM.

253	REACTION SHOT - A MUSEUM GUARD

	He starts after the fugitive.

254	ANOTHER PART OF THE MUSEUM - FEATURING TAYLOR

	He runs past displays of other stuffed animals toward CAMERA and halts 
	abruptly in close f.g., shocked by:

255	WHAT HE SEES: 	DODGE

	stuffed and mounted, Dodge bares his teeth at the world.

256	CLOSEUP - TAYLOR

	Reacting in horror. He hears another police WHISTLE and the echoing 
	FOOTSTEPS of approaching guards, which mufffle his strangled gasp:

				TAYLOR
			Dodge ...

	Taylor vanishes in a BLUR of movement.

								CUT TO:

257	EXT. THE MALL - APETOWN - FULL SHOT FROM ON HIGH - DAY

	Order has been restored in the open-air market. Taylor bursts suddenly 
	into view from a building on the far side of the mall, running in panic 
	from ape guards in close pursuit. A mounted policeman spots him and 
	heads him off. Changing direction, Taylor is intercepted by another 
	mounted Gorilla. And then a third.

	CAMERA HOLDS, ANGLING DOWN on the center of the mall. We are witnessing 
	a hideous game: "baiting the man."  The mounted police do not shoot or 
	club Taylor, for he cannot escape -- but they circle him, their long 
	whips CRACKING over his head.

258	CLOSER ANGLE - THE CIRCLE AROUND TAYLOR - FAVORING A MOUNTIE

	who unfolds his net, swings it overhead and flings it at Taylor. This 
	time he bags his quarry. Taylor gives up. Spent, docile, entangled in 
	the net, he stands stock-still in the center of the mall. Guards and 
	civillians on foot join the circle around the man at bay. They regard 
	him warily.

259	CLOSE SHOT - DR. ZIRA

	She pushes through the simian crowd around Taylor and hurries to his 
	side.

260	CLOSE TWO SHOT - TAYLOR AND ZIRA

	She paws at the net, crying impulsively:

				ZIRA
			Taylor, why'd you run away?

	Zira removes the net from his face. Panting with exhaustion, Taylor 
	flicks a wild glance at her. He looks demented.

261	WIDER ANGLE - TO INCLUDE TWO GORILLA OFFICERS

	who approach Taylor and Zira. (They are the same gorillas introduced in 
	Scene 198.) One of them carries a collar and leash. The other presents 
	an I.D. card to Zira.

				LIEUTENANT 
			Security police.

				ZIRA
				(promptly)
			I'm in charge of this man. 

				LIEUTENANT 
			No longer, madame. He is now in the 
			custody of the Ministry of Science.

	His colleague moves toward Taylor with a muzzle.

262	CLOSE SHOT - FEATURING TAYLOR

	He speaks at last, his voice hoarse but audible.

				TAYLOR
			Get away from me, you dirty ape!

263	FULL SHOT - THE SIMIANS AROUND TAYLOR

	The arresting officer steps back involuntarily. All the apes freeze,
	staring at the speaking animal with mute astonishment as we:

								FADE OUT

								FADE IN

264	INT. CAGES - CLOSE SHOT - TAYLOR AND NOVA - DAY

	The compound is dimly lit. Taylor, the bandage now gone from his 
	throat, is back in his old cage. The other cages, however, are empty -- 
	their occupants presumably having been moved to the surgery or the zoo. 
	He is seated on a pile of straw in the rear corner, Nova's head cradled 
	on his lap. Idly he strokes her coarse hair. There is a dull glow of 
	madness in his eyes, and his manner is one of abstract soliloquy, like 
	a man talking to a dog.

				TAYLOR 
			...and that's when I decided to take 
			up astronautical engineering., you see. I 
			was halfway through college and I...
				(he breaks off) 
			It's an old trick! The silent treatment. 
			Four weeks and three days, and not a word 
			from anyone. Not Zira.,or Cornelius...or 
			that damn Julius. No one'll listen... 
			only you. You...Nova. NO-VAH.

	His manner is now more direct, and educative., but she stares in blank 
	comprehension. She brushes his moving lips with her fingers. He shrugs 
	wryly.

				TAYLOR 
			Yeah...me Tarzan, you Jane. That's all 
			right ... I had a puppy once that never 
			barked. He just licked my hand.
				(pause) 
			He's dead now. They're all dead. Everything... 
			I think maybe they'll kill me, too. Are they 
			afraid of me? I can't hurt them... but I 
			threaten them somehow. Threaten their faith 
			in simian superiority. Yeah ... you're right. 
			They'll have to kill me.

	Faint footsteps are heard o.s. Taylor and Nova look in the direction of 
	the sound. A sudden stream of water shoots through the bars and strikes 
	Taylor in the chest.

265	WIDER ANGLE - WHAT THEY SEE:

	An ape GUARD has a high pressure hose trained on Taylor. It forces him 
	back toward the rear of the cage. Julius, whip in hand, unlocks the 
	cage, steps inside. He unlimbers the whip., cracks it-'in Nova's 
	direction. She recoils. The jet of water hold Taylor at bay. Julius 
	grabs Nova, begins to pull her toward the door of the cage. Taylor 
	tries to fight his way through the water toward Julius.

				TAYLOR
			Let her alone!

	Julius swings the whip. It cracks against Taylor's legs, biting into
	the skin. Taylor stumbles, falls to one knee

				TAYLOR 
			Where are you taking her? What are you 
			going to do?

	Julius drags and pushes the girl through the door, slamming and locking 
	it behind him. Taylor, fights through the stream of water, flings 	
	himself against the bars.

				TAYLOR
				(raging) 
			Take your hands off her, you black 
			monster! You filth!

	Julius shoves Nova across the aisle to a cage opposite Taylor's, locks 
	her inside.

				TAYLOR 
			Why are you doing this? Say something,
			you hairy scum!

	Julius gestures toward the ape guard

				JULIUS
			Turn it off!

	The ape guard shuts off the hose.

				TAYLOR
			Answer me!

	Julius strides over to Taylor's cage.

				JULIUS 
				(fiercely) 
			Shut up! The reason no one'll talk to 
			you is because you're a freak!

				TAYLOR
			Where's Dr. Zira? Why--?

				JULIUS
			I said shut up!

	He slashes viciously with his whip handle against Taylor's fingers. 
	Taylor yells in pain. Julius and the ape guard start out of the 
	compound.

				TAYLOR
				(wildly)
			Ape! Apes wearing clothes!
			It's a madhouse! A madhouse!

	He sinks to the floor as the apes go out.
	
266	OUT

267	FULL SHOT - CAGE 

	Taylor looks desolately through the bars across to Nova's cage. She 
	eyes him sadly.

				TAYLOR
				(gently)
			Now I don't even have you.
				(pause)
			Imagine me -- needing someone. Back on 
			Earth there was nobody. Women, yes. 
			Lots of them. Love making  ithout love. 
			That's the kind of world it was turning 
			into, with the help of cynics like myself. 
			So I left it -- because there was no one 
			dear enough to keep me there.
				(pause)
			Did I tell you about Stewart?
				(Looking away) 
			There was a lovely girl. The most precious 
			cargo we brought along. If human life could 
			survive here, she was to be the new Eve.
				(morosely) 
			It's probably just as well she didn't live 
			to see this.

	He looks at Nova. She stretches her hands through the bars toward him.

				TAYLOR
			I wonder if it's Love between us. 
				(looks around, 
				smiles ironically) 
			What a place to find it.

C-267	FULL SHOT - THE CAGE

	Two gorilla officers enter, carrying torches. (These are the same apes 
	introduced in Scene 198.) One carries a double set of manacles. Julius 
	comes to meet them. The Lieutenant takes the two sets of manacles from 
	the other officer, hands them to Julius, whispers something. Julius 
	comes over and unlocks the door of Taylor's cage. He advances to 
	Taylor, who does not move, bends down and clamps the manacles around 
	each of his ankles. Then he straightens, lifts Taylor's arms, pulls his 
	wrists together, snaps on the cuffs.

D-267	WIDER ANGLE - THE CAGE

	Taylor looks across at Nova, blows her a kiss. Julius leads him out of 
	the cage, takes his leash from a snaps it onto Taylor's collar, hands 
	the other end to the Lieutenant. Nova and Julius watch in silence as 
	Taylor is led down the aisle and out the door.

							DISSOLVE TO:

273	INT. INQUIRY ROOM - ESTABLISHING SHOT - DAY

	Taylor, wearing his manacles, is seated at a table in the otherwise 
	deserted chamber. There is an empty chair on either side of him. Across 
	the room stands a dais with three rude, high-backed chairs. There is a 
	small table directly below the dais. A third table stands at right 
	angles to the dais. Taylor looks around the empty room. A door is 
	opened by a gorilla BAILIFF, and Zira and Cornelius come into the room, 
	sit down on each side of Taylor. A moment later, DR.HONORIUS, the 
	Prosecutor and a CLERK enter, take their seats at the third table.

				TAYLOR 
				(softly) 
			Where have you been? Why didn't you come 
			to see me?

				ZIRA
			Shhhh!

				TAYLOR
			What is this?

				ZIRA
			A hearing.

				CORNELIUS 
				(hissing)
			Be clever. Be quiet,

				BAILIFF	
			All rise!

	Everyone gets up as THE PRESIDENT, Dr. Zaius and Dr. Maximus enter and 
	mount the dais. The President takes the center chair; the other two 
	flanking him.

				BAILIFF
			Be seated.

	All sit down.

				PRESIDENT 
				(pounds gavel once) 
			This ad hoc Tribunal of the National 
			Academy is now in session. President of 
			the Academy presiding. On my right, Dr. 
			Maximus, Commissioner for Animal Affairs. 
			On my left, Dr. Zaius, Minister of Science 
			and Chief Defender of the Faith... 
				(glancing at Prosecutor) 
			Appearing for the State, Dr. Honorius, 
			Deputy Minister of Justice.

	Honorius rises and bows.

				PRESIDENT
				(raps gavel once)
			Let it be clear at the outset that all 
			matters pertaining to this inquiry are 
			confidential, and anyone discussing them
			outside this chamber will be held in 
			contempt of the Tribunal.
				(a beat)
			You may proceed, Dr. Honorius.

				ZIRA 
				(rising) 
			By your leave, Mr. President -- the 
			Tribunal has not yet defined the purpose 
			of this inquiry.

	The President appears to be taken aback. He glances at his colleagues.

				MAXIMUS 
			You asked for the opportunity to present 
			your case. Surely you must know why you're 
			here.

				ZIRA 
			My own purpose is to save this exceptional 
			creature from mutilation.

				MAXIMUS
				(promptly)
			And our purpose is to settle custodial and 
			jurisdictional questions concerning this 
			beast, and determine what's to be done with 
			him.

				ZIRA 
			At the very least, this man has the right 
			to know whether there's a charge against 
			him.

				HONORIUS 
				(rising) 
			Objection. The accused is indeed a man. 
			Therefore, he has no rights under ape law.

				PRESIDENT
			Well, Dr. Zira? This is a man, is he not?

274	CLOSE GROUP SHOT - THE DEFENDANT'S TABLE

	Sensing that the President has given them an opening, Zira smiles 
	confidently.

				ZIRA
			He is unlike any man you have ever seen - 
			as we hope to prove.

				PRESIDENT'S VOICE 
				(o.s.) 
			Answer the question. Is he a man?

				CORNELIUS 
				(tentatively) 	
			Sir? The question is the point at issue: 
			Is he a man? Or a deviate? Or a freak of 
			nature?

				HONORIUS' VOICE
				(o.s.) 
			Objection!

275	FULL SHOT - THE INQUIRY ROOM

	As the Prosecutor continues:

				PRESIDENT 
			Sustained. In all fairness, Dr. Zira, 
			you must admit the accused is a nonape, 
			and therefore has no rights under ape law.

				ZIRA
				(rising)	
			Then why is he called the accused Your 
			Honors must think him guilty of something.

	Honorius seems confounded. Zaius takes over.

				ZAIUS
			This man is not being tried. He is being 
			disposed of.
				(pointing at
				Zira and Cornelius) 
			It is scientific heresy that is actually 
			on trial here.

				MAXIMUS
			Well put, Dr. Zaius. Let us warn
			our friends that they endanger their
			own careers by defending this animal.

276	CLOSE SHOT - THE DEFENSE

	Both Cornelius and Zira appear shaken by this threat. Sensing their 
	predicament, Taylor rises impatiently.

				TAYLOR
			Then I'll defend myself.

277	FULL SHOT - THE INQUIRY ROOM

	Although the judges and Prosecutor have been told that this man can 
	speak, they react in stunned silence to the first sound of his voice. 
	Flustered, the President bangs his gavel.

				PRESIDENT
			Dr. Zira -- tell Bright Eyes to 
			sit down.

				TAYLOR 
			My name is Taylor.

	The President refuses to address Taylor directly. Checking a document, 
	he speaks to Zira.

				PRESIDENT
			It says here that his name is Bright 
			Eyes. You gave him that name yourself.

				TAYLOR 
				(voice rising) 
			This hearing is absurd! Let me tell 
			my story...

				PRESIDENT
				(pounds gavel)
			Bailiff! Make the animal be quiet.

	The Bailiff quickly crosses to Taylor and shoves him roughly into his 
	chair.

				PRESIDENT 
			State your case, Mr. Prosecutor.

				HONORIUS 
			Learned Judges: My case is simple. It is 
			based on our first Article of Faith: that 
			the Almighty created the ape in his own 
			image; that He gave him a soul and a mind; 
			that He set him apart from the beasts of 
			the jungle, and made him the lord of the 
			planet.

278	CLOSE GROUP SHOT - THE DEFENDANT'S TABLE

	Taylor has begun to write something on a sheet of paper. Zira and 
	Cornelius remain attentive to:

				HONORIUS' VOICE 
				(o.s.) 
			These sacred truths are self-evident. The 
			proper study of apes is apes. But certain 
			young cynics have chosen to study man - 
			yes, perverted scientists who advance on 
			insidious theory called 'evolution.'

279	FULL SHOT - THE INQUIRY ROOM

	As the Prosecutor continues:

				HONORIUS 
			There is a conspiracy afoot to undermine 
			the very cornerstone of our Faith

				PRESIDENT
			Come to the point, Dr. Honorius.

				HONORIUS 
			Directly, Mr. President. This wretched man, 
			the accused, is only a pawn in the conspiracy.
			We know that he was wounded in the throat at 
			the time of his capture. The State charges 
			that Dr. Zira and a corrupt surgeon named 
			Galen experimented on this wounded animal, 
			tampering with his brain and throat tissues 
			to create a speaking monster ...

				ZIRA
				(on her feet)
			ThatÕs a lie!

				PRESIDENT
				(pounding gavel)
			Mind your tongue, madame.

				ZIRA
			Did we create his mind too? Not only 
			can this man speak. He can write. He can 
			reason.

				HONORIUS
		He can reason? With the Tribunal's permission, 
		let me expose this hoax by direct examination.

				PRESIDENT
		Proceed. But don't turn this hearing into a 
		farce.

	Honorius crosses to the defendant's table and favors Taylor with an 	
	evil smile.

				HONORIUS 
			Tell the court, Bright Eyes -- what is 
			the second Article of Faith?

				TAYLOR 
			I admit, I know nothing of your culture.

				HONORIUS 
			Of course he doesn't know our culture - 
			because he cannot think.
				(to Taylor) 
			Tell us why all apes are created equal.

				TAYLOR 
			Some apes, it seems, are more equal than 
			others.

				HONORIUS 
			Ridiculous. That answer is a contradiction 
			in terms. Tell us, Bright Eyes, why do men 
			have no souls? What is the proof that a 
			divine spark exists in the simian brain?

				TAYLOR
				(hands paper to Zira) 
			Show this to the President.

	Zira moves toward the dais. Honorius returns to his own table.

				ZIRA 
			Since the defendant is forbidden to speak 
			in his own defense, he asks that this 
			statement be read into the record.

				PRESIDENT 
			Read it yourself.

				ZIRA
				(reading aloud) 
			'I have come to you from a planet in a 
			different solar system. I am an explorer 
			in space, with no hostile intentions against 
			your civilization. On my planet it was the 
			primate Man who evolved Into a thinking 
			animal, while the apes remained..."

				PRESIDENT
				(rapping gavel) 
			Stop right there. Bring me that paper.

	Zira crosses to the dais, handing the statement to the President. He 
	glances at it, laughs derisively and passes it to Zaius.

				PRESIDENT
				(to Zira)
			This is a joke in very poor taste.

				ZIRA
			Is it a joke to seek the truth about 
			this man?

				ZAIUS
				(glancing at document) 
			Dr. Zira -- you state here that a ship 
			from outer space sank in an inland sea 
			of our eastern desert.

				ZIRA
			I do not state it, sir. The prisoner does.

				ZAIUS 
			Do you believe him?

				ZIRA
				(uneasily) 
			Like you, I find it difficult.

				ZAIUS 
			But how convenient that the proof of 
			his arrival has vanished?
				(glancing again
				at document) 
			You also state that Bright Eyes had two 
			intelligent companions at the time of 
			his capture.

				ZIRA
			This is his assertion.

				ZAIUS
			Where are they now?

				TAYLOR
				(blurting it out)
			One is in a museum!

				PRESIDENT
				(pounding gavel)
			Dr. Zira! Silence that man!

	Returning to her table, Zira gestures to Taylor to remain silent.

				ZAIUS
			How sad. Stuffed and mounted, eh? Dead 
			men, like sunken ships, can tell no 
			stories. And his other companion?

				ZIRA
			He doesn't know.

				ZAIUS
			Mr. President, I believe the Prosecutor 
			has reassembled all he surviving humans 
			captured in the hunt along with Bright Eyes.

				HONORIUS 
			That's true, Dr. Zaius. My witnesses -- 	
			correction -- my exhibits are on display in 
			the amphitheater.

				PRESIDENT 
			Very well. I suggest we go and look at them.

	The President rises, starts out, followed by the others. Taylor is 
	last, being led on a leash by the bailiff.

280 	OUT

281	EXT. AMPHITHEATER - FULL SHOT - DAY

	The inquiry group files through a door into the amphitheater. Two APES 
	stand guard over a number of leashed and nearly naked human beings in 
	the center of the pit below the dais. There are three primitive males, 
	the female Nova -- and Landon. He is dirty and bearded, but his hair is 
	cropped close.

282	CLOSE - TAYLOR

	He turns to Zira, his eyes shining with vindication.

				TAYLOR 
				(a whisper) 
			It's him...Landon.

				ZIRA
			Which one?

				TAYLOR 
			Second from the left.

283	FULL SHOT - THE AMPHITHEATER

	Zaius glances at the accused.

				ZAIUS 
			Well...do you acknowledge kinship with 
			any of these creatures?

				TAYLOR
			With one of them.

				ZAIUS 
			Identify him, then. Speak to him.

	Taylor moves forward for a few paces, stops.

				TAYLOR
			Landon?

284	CLOSER SHOT - FEATURING LANDON - FROM TAYLOR'S P.O.V.

	Landon looks catatonic. His face is in shadow

285	WIDER ANGLE - TO INCLUDE TAYLOR

	Stunned by Landon's imbecility.

				TAYLOR 
			John ... it's me, Taylor.

	Taylor steps forward to grasp his arm. There is still no response. 
	Taylor takes Landon's head in his hands and looks at his face. There is 
	a fresh scar running from his forehead to the top of his cranium.

286	FULL SHOT - THE AMPHITHEATER

	As Taylor whirls on Zira.

				TAYLOR 
			You! ... You knew about this?

				ZIRA
			No, I swear -- I never saw this
			man before.

				TAYLOR
				(whirling on Zaius) 
			You did this to him! You've removed his 
			frontal lobes!

				PRESIDENT
			Silence!
				(turning)
			Bailiff, take the prisoner inside!

	The bailiff Jerks brutally on Taylor's leash, pulling him toward the 
	door leading under the amphitheater.

A-286	INT. INQUIRY ROOM - MED. SHOT - DAY

	The bailiff enters, dragging Taylor behind him, shoves him into his 
	chair. Moments later the other apes enter the room. All take their 
	seats but Zaius. Taylor glares at him furiously.

				ZAIUS 
				(calmly) 
			Mr. President, a word of explanation: the 
			creature in question suffered a skull 
			fracture during the hunt. Two fine 
			veternary surgeons under my direction 
			were able to save his life. But the beast 
			could not speak, of course. Nor will he
			ever speak

	Taylor leaps from his chair, livid with rage, approaches the dais.

				TAYLOR 
			You destroyed his memory! His mind! His 
			identity! And, you want to do the same to 
			me!

				PRESIDENT 
				(pounding gavel) 
			Bailiff! Stop this outburst! Gag that
			monstrosity!

	The bailiff and a husky guard seize Taylor, who continues shouting:

				TAYLOR 
			You barbarians!

	The powerful guard twists Taylor's arms behind his back and the bailiff 
	lashes his wrists together. Then the bailiff gags Taylor. His voice is
	cut off as the bailiff ties the twisted kerchief around his open mouth.
	The guard holds Taylor's leash during the rest of this scene.

	Meanwhile, Cornelius has risen to his feet. His tone is firm, but 
	conciliatory.

				CORNELIUS
			May it please the Tribunal: I for one 
			grant that this being cannot have come 
			from another planet. But this much is 
			certain -- he comes from somewhere in the
			Forbidden Zone. He has described the region  
			to us, and described it accurately, for I 
			have been there.

				PRESIDENT 
			You visited the Forbidden Zone?

				CORNELIUS 
			Why, yes, sir. A year ago. With the special 
			permission of the Academy.

				ZAIUS 
				(to President) 
			He exceeded his orders. His travel permit 
			was promptly revoked.

				CORNELIUS 
			Yes, sir, so it was -- thanks to you. But 
			not before I discovered evidence of a simian 
			culture that existed long before the Sacred 
			Scrolls were written ...

				HONORIUS 
			Objection! These remarks are profane and irrelevant.

				PRESIDENT
			Sustained.
				(to Cornelius) 
			Your archeological theories have no bearing 
			on the disposition of this creature.

				ZAIUS
				(softly)	
			Let them talk, Mr President. Let them talk.

				ZIRA 
				(rising) 
			Sirs: our theories have a bearing on his 
			identity.

				PRESIDENT
			How so?

				ZIRA 
			Let us assume, as common sense dictates, 
			that the prisoner's story is false. But if 
			he does not come from another planet, then 
			surely he sprang from our own. Yes, sprang.
				(a beat) 
			As an animal psychologist, I have found no 
			physiological defect to explain why humans 
			are mute.

				HONORIUS
			Objection!

				PRESIDENT
			Sustained.

				ZIRA
				(plunging on) 
			Their speech organs are adequate. The flaw 
			lies not in anatomy but in the brain.

				HONORIUS
			Objection!

				PRESIDENT
			Sustained.

				ZIRA
				(voice rising) 
			Sustain all objections, but face the truth!

	Cornelius has regained his courage. Rising to Zira's support, he points 
	at Taylor.

				CORNELIUS 
			Yes! Behold this marvel, this living paradox, 
			this missing link in an evolutionary chain!

				PRESIDENT
				(pounding gavel) 
			Silence!
				(Puffing with rage) 
			You have gone too far.

				ZAIUS
				(calmly) 
			There you are, Mr. President. I warned you 
			these two would use this hearing as a forum 
			for subversion.

				MAXIMUS 
			You were right! The advocates of heresy have 
			revealed themselves.

				ZAIUS 
			Mr. President, I think an indictment is 
			in order.

				HONORIUS 	
				(promptly) 
			Yes, sir. The State charges Doctors Zira 
			and Cornelius with contempt of this Tribunal, 
			malicious mischief and scientific heresy.

				PRESIDENT 
			Be it so ordered. The Tribunal will examine 
			all the evidence presented here and in due 
			time render a verdict on the proposed 
			indictment and on the disposition of the 
			deviate in question. 
				(pounds gavel once) 
			This hearing is adjourned.

	All rise. The guard drags Taylor from the inquiry room. Zira and 
	Cornelius stand there, stunned by the entrapment into which Zaius has 
	maneuvered them.

287-
289 	OUT

								DISSOLVE TO:

290	INT. A SMALL OFFICE - CLOSE ON DR. ZAIUS - NIGHT

	The office is as unadorned and Spartan as that of Cornelius  -- in 
	fact, with minor changes in decor, the same set can be used. There are 
	many thick leatherbound books on this scholar's desk. Zaius is reading 
	one of them and taking notes. He looks up as someone KNOCKS at the 
	door.

291	REVERSE ANGLE - SHOOTING PAST ZAIUS

	The two agents push Taylor through the doorway.

				ZAIUS 
			Wait outside.

	The officers withdraw, closing the door. Collared, wrists manacled, 
	Taylor stands facing the desk.

				ZAIUS 
			The verdict is in. At the moment your 
			simian friends -- and  sponsors -- are 
			free on bail. But they'll soon be brought 
			to trial for heresy.

292	ANOTHER ANGLE - FAVORING ZAIUS

	who falls silent, as if this were the only news of import. We note at 
	once a change In Zaius' tone and attitude. He no longer treats Taylor 
	like a freak animal, but addresses him as an imaginative adversary who 
	must be intimidated by the threat of terror.

				TAYLOR
			What about me?

				ZAIUS
				(offhandedly) 
			Oh, your case was preordained. In a way, 
			you performed a service for the State ...
				(smiling) 
			Because your hearing made it possible 
			for us to expose Zira and Cornelius.
				(a beat) 
			And now the Tribunal has placed you in 
			my custody for...final disposition. Do 
			you know what that means?

				TAYLOR
			No.

				ZAIUS
			Emasculation, to begin with. Then 
			experimental surgery. On the speech 
			centers. On the brain. Ultimately, a 
			kind of living death.

	Taylor stiffens but says nothing. Zaius lets this prospect sink in, 
	then continues.

				ZAIUS
			However, it's within my power to grant
			You a reprieve.  That is why I summoned 
			you here tonight.
				(a beat) 
			Tell me who and what you really are and 
			where you come from, and no veterinary 
			will touch you.

				TAYLOR	 
			I told the truth at that 'hearing'of yours.

				ZAIUS
			You lied. Where is your tribe?

				TAYLOR 
			My tribe, as you call it, lives on another 
			planet in a distant solar system.

				ZAIUS 
			Then how is it we speak the same language?
				(suddenly intense) 
			Even in your lies, some truth slips 
			through! That mythical community you're 
			supposed to come from -- Fort Wayne'?

				TAYLOR 
			What about it?

				ZAIUS 
			A fort! Unconsciously, you chose a name 
			that was belligerent.
				(more calmly) 
			Where were you nurtured?

				TAYLOR 
			I take it you don't believe the prosecutor's 
			charge -- that I'm a monster created by 
			Dr. Zira.

				ZAIUS
			Certainly not.	You're a mutant.

				TAYLOR 
			That's exactly what Zira and Cornelius 
			claim. You're talking heresy, doctor.

				ZAIUS
				(smiling) 
			Of course.

				TAYLOR
				(growing bolder) 
			All right, suppose I am a mutant? Why 
			does the appearance of one mutant send 
			you into a panic?

				ZAIUS 
			Because you're not unique. There was the 
			one you call Landon --

				TAYLOR
			Then you admit --

				ZAIUS 
			I admit that where there's one mutant there's 
			probably another. And another. A nest of them. 
			Where's your nest, Taylor? Where are your women?

				TAYLOR
				(pause)
			Thank you for calling me Taylor.
				(more firmly)
			Dr. Zaius, I know who I am. Who are you? How 
			did this upside down civilization ever get 
			started?

				ZAIUS
				(strangely calm) 
			You may well call it upside down, since you 
			occupy its lowest level. And deservedly.
				(pause) 
			The eastern desert has never been explored -- 
			because we've always assumed that no life can 
			exist there.
				(a beat) 
			Save yourself, Taylor. Tell me -- is there 
			another jungle beyond the Forbidden Zone?

				TAYLOR 
			I don't know.

				ZAIUS 
			If you are protecting others of your kind, 
			it will cost you your identity.

				TAYLOR 
			I'm not protecting anybody! That hearing 
			was a farce. What have I done?

				ZAIUS 
			You're a menace! A walking pestilence. I 
			do know who you are, Taylor. As I know 
			that others of your kind must live in the 
			Forbidden Zone.
				(decisively) 
			You have just six hours to make a full 
			confession. After that I'll employ surgery 
			to obtain one.
				(calling off) 
			Guards!

	The two burly security agents open the door and enter.

				ZAIUS 
			Take this creature back to his cage.

	The guards seize Taylor, start to shove him toward the doorway. He 
	twists around, faces Zaius.

				TAYLOR
			All right, you can cut me to pieces. It's 
			within your power.
				(with force)
			But know this, doctor. You do it because 
			you're afraid of me. You do it from fear!

	Zaius jerks his head silently toward the door. The apes drag Taylor 
	through it.

								DISSOLVE TO:

293	INT. ADJACENT CAGES - MED. SHOT - NIGHT

	A few hours have passed. Nova is watching Taylor from her cage across 
	the aisle. He sits on the pile of straw. There is an ugly welt on his 
	cheek made by the security officer's whip. FOOTSTEPS are heard. Taylor 
	and Nova look up and off.

294	REVERSE ANGLE - WHAT THEY SEE:

	A solemn, teen-age chimp named LUCIUS appears outside the cage. The 
	guard Julius rises from his chair.

				LUCIUS
			Are you Julius?

				JULIUS
			What do you want?

				LUCIUS
			I'm from the Office of Animal Affairs. 
				(indicating Taylor)
			This male's to be transferred to the zoo.

				JULIUS
			At this hour? Who says so?

	Taylor enters scene, coming over to the cage bars as Lucius continues 
	gravely, with just a note of disdain.

				LUCIUS 
			Don't they tell you anything? The Anti-
			vivisectionist Society is up in arms. They're 
			going to save this beast from those butchers 
			in the lab. If he can speak he belongs in the 
			public zoo. 
				(taking off) 
			But what'll probably happen is that some 
			money-mad grown-up will put him in a circus. 
			And then we'll have to pay to see what 
			rightfully should have --

				JULIUS 	
			Stop making speeches and show me the order.

	Lucius hands the guard a document. It is dark here, so Julius crosses 
	to a beam of light near the bars and studies the document. Lucius, 
	behind the guard's back, signals frantically for Taylor to seize or 
	strike the guard. Taylor is slow to understand. Lucius shakes his
	head impatiently.

				JULIUS  
				(peering at document)
			This order's no good. It must be counter-
			signed by Dr. Zaius --

	Lucius suddenly gives Julius a violent shove. The guard's head crashes 
	against the bars and he is stunned.

				LUCIUS
			Hit him!

	Taylor complies  bringing down the heel of his fist on the nape of the 
	guard's neck. Julius collapses. The youngster immediately squats down, 
	gags him, and begins to bind him hand and foot. CAMERA MOVES IN.

				TAYLOR 
			Who are you?

				LUCIUS
				(looking up,coolly) 
			So you can talk.
				(as he works) 
			I'm Dr. Zira's nephew. This abduction was 
			her idea. You're not really going to the 
			zoo. That's just our cover story in case 
			we're stopped.
				(off again) 
			Although I do feel that if it ever came 
			down to a question of whether something 
			like you should be public or private 
			property --

				TAYLOR
			Come on. Get me out of here.

	Taking the guard's keys, Lucius rises and unlocks the cage. Nova enters 
	the scene, coming to the bars of her cage.

295	CLOSE TWO SHOT - TAYLOR AND NOVA

	He gazes at her, tense with indecision. She flashes an imploring smile, 
	a mute appeal that cannot be denied. Over this we hear:

				LUCIUS' VOICE 
				(o.s.)
			We've got to move fast.

296	WIDER ANGLE - TO INCLUDE LUCIUS

	as Taylor leaves his cage.

				TAYLOR
			She comes along too.

				LUCIUS
			Zira doesn't want your female.

				TAYLOR
			I want her.

				LUCIUS
				(a shrug)
			If you insist. But I'm not taking
			any orders --

				TAYLOR
			Fine. Just let her out.

	Lucius unlocks Nova's cage. She comes out quickly, takes Taylor's hand. 
	They follow Lucius out of the compound.

297	EXT. ANIMAL COMPOUND - MED. SHOT - NIGHT

	A horse-drawn caged wagon (like that used in the hunt) stands near the 
	building. Zira waits at the rear of the wagon. Lucius, Taylor and Nova 
	emerge from a doorway or archway and join her. Zira notes Nova's
 	presence with disapproval. They speak in undertones.

				ZIRA
				(to Lucius) 
			I told you not to bring the other one.

				LUCIUS 
			He wouldn't leave her.

				ZIRA
				(with a sigh)
			All right...
				(to the humans)
			Get in...hurry.  Put this on.

				TAYLOR
			Listen-

				ZIRA 
			Taylor -- just keep quiet and we may get 
			away with this. Remember that men all 
			look alike to most apes. 

	Taylor and Nova comply, climbing into the cage. Lucius closes the 
	tailgate. Lucius and Zira move to the front of the wagon and climb 
	aboard. Lucius takes the reins. As they move off:

								WIPE TO:

298	EXT. LAKE AND CAUSEWAY - LONG HIGH ANGLE SHOT - NIGHT

	As previously established, the animal compound is on the outskirts of 
	Apetown. The abductors must cross the causeway on their route of 
	escape. In the distance, near the gazebo, we can see the lights of 
	several torches.

	The caged wagon rolls into scene and out onto the causeway. At the same 
	time a mounted gorilla leading two pack animals appears on the far side 
	of the causeway, coming toward CAMERA. Lucius stops the wagon.

299	CLOSE TWO SHOT - LUCIUS AND ZIRA - ON THE WAGON

				LUCIUS
				(apprehensively)
			Gorilla hunters ...

				ZIRA 
			Keep moving. We can't turn back now.

300	BOOM SHOT - THE CAUSEWAY

	As the mounted hunter nears the wagon, we can see two bodies slung 
	across the backs of the pack animals.

301	FLASH SHOT - TAYLOR AND NOVA - IN WAGON CAGE

	They look out at:

302	THE PASSING HORSES - FROM THEIR P.O.V.

	The bodies on the horses are naked human corpses.

303	MED. LONG SHOT - THE CAUSEWAY - REVERSE ANGLE

	In immediate f.g., near the gazebo, is a similar wagon. It has lost a 
	wheel, and its rear axle lies on the edge of the causeway. Two naked 
	primitive males can be dimly seen within the cage. Four or five armed 
	gorilla hunters stand near the wagon: two of them carry torches; the 
	others are passing a jug from hand to hand-.

	The leader of the Hunt Club, still on horseback, holds up his hand as 
	the lab wagon approaches.

				LEADER 
			Hold it!

	Lucius obeys. The hunters on foot swarm around his wagon as their 
	leader calls authoritatively:

				LEADER 
			Ah, Doctor Zira! Our wagon broke down! I'm 
			afraid we'll have to commandeer yours.

304	CLOSER ANGLE - THE LAB WAGON

	as the Hunt Club Leader rides over, recognizing the animal 
	psychologist.

				ZIRA 
			You can't! I've two sick humans in the 
			cage. We're taking them to the chief vet 
			at the zoo ...

				LEADER 
				(indicating his 
				own wagon) 
			We bagged two live ones today. I'll have 
			to ask you to take them along.

	He moves to the rear of the wagon.

				ZIRA 
				(following him; 
				frantically) 
			No, no, my animals are diseased... Leave 
			them alone! They're diseased, I tell you!

	Lucius jumps down and runs toward the rear of the wagon.

305	REVERSE ANGLE - REAR OF WAGON

	The hunters have opened the tailgate and are shining their torches on 
	the humans. They sound ready for sport.

				FIRST HUNTER 
			Give him a taste of fire!

	One of the hunters points his torch at Taylor, who, quite naturally, 
	shrinks back as Lucius runs into scene.

				LUCIUS
			Stand back! He's dangerous!

				FIRST HUNTER
			Why?

				ZIRA
			He's rabid! His bite is fatal!

				FIRST HUNTER
			You serious?

				LUCIUS
			You would die in agony! 
				(with appropriate gestures)
			Frothing at the mouth!

	The hunters fall back. Lucius promptly locks the tailgate and he and 
	Zira run back to the front of the wagon. Lucius snaps the reins and the 
	wagon moves off. The hunters follow it a few paces, pausing near their 
	mounted leader.

				FIRST HUNTER 
			They treat those animals better than they 
			treat us.

				LEADER 
			I still say the only good human is a dead 
			human.

	The fugitives' wagon recedes beyond the gazebo, as we:

								DISSOLVE TO:

306	EXT. AN OPEN RANGE - LONG SHOT - DAWN

	The horse-drawn wagon is silhouetted-against the dawn light, bumping 
	across a semi-arid plain studded with mesquite and sage. (This SCENE 
	can be SHOT either on the Navajo reservation near Page or on the 
	Ranch).

								DISSOLVE TO:

307	EXT. SAVANNA (OR CULTIVATED FIELDS) - LONG SHOT - MORNING

	This is the same area described on page 24, where the hunt occurred. As 
	the wagon rolls along a dirt track, the tall grasses of the savanna (or 
	cultivated field) can be seen in b.g.

308	CLOSE TWO SHOT - TAYLOR AND NOVA - IN WAGON CAGE

	Taylor is dozing, but the girl is alert and nervous. She peers out at 
	the field, apparently recognizing or remembering this terrain. She 
	nudges Taylor, waking him.

309	EXT. GROVE OF WILD FRUIT TREES - LONG PANNING SHOT - DAY

	This, too, is the location described on page 24. CAMERA PANS with the 
	wagon as it rolls into the grove and HOLDS on three horses. Cornelius 
	sits astride one horse; the other two nags are heavily burdened with 
	packs and saddlebags.

310	CLOSER ANGLE - THE GROVE - FAVORING CORNELIUS

	He dismounts as Zira and Lucius jump down from the wagon
	and hurry toward him. Cornelius and his fiancee embrace and kiss 
	lightly, ape-fashion.

				CORNELIUS
			How did it go?

				ZIRA 
			There was one bad moment -- some hunters 
			stopped us.

				LUCIUS   
				(calmly)  
			I pursuaded them our beasts had rabies.

311	CLOSE TWO SHOT - TAYLOR AND NOVA - IN CAGED WAGON

	The apes discussing the abduction are out of earshot. Exasperated to be 
	thus ignored and caged, Taylor kicks the tailgate, shouting:

				TAYLOR 
			Let me out of here!

312	WIDER ANGLE - TO INCLUDE THE GROUP

	Lucius hurries back to unlock the tailgate. Taylor gets out of the 
	wagon, stretching his stiffened joints. Nova follows suit. During the 
	ensuing exchange the girl seems strangely agitated, pacing to and fro, 
	her eyes scanning the grove and fields in search of someone or 
	something.

				CORNELIUS
				(approaching)
			Well, Taylor -- we're all fugitives now.

				TAYLOR
			Do you have any weapons?

				CORNELIUS
			The best. But we won't need them.

				TAYLOR
			Just the same, I want one.

	He moves toward one of the horses. Cornelius starts after him.

				CORNELIUS 
			Look here, Taylor. I'm in charge of this 
			expedition --

	Taylor takes a rifle from one of the packs, examines it.

				TAYLOR
			Fair enough. But you're no longer in 
			charge of me. And I don't mean to be 
			captured again.

	Zira and Lucius have come up.

				CORNELIUS 
				(peeved) 	
			As you wish.

				TAYLOR 
			Zaius seems to think there might be 
			another jungle beyond the Forbidden Zone. 
			That's what  we'll try for. What about you?

				ZIRA 
			Cornelius and I have been indicted for 
			heresy. Unless we can prove our theories, 
			we don't stand a chance of acquittal.

				TAYLOR 
			You're going back to the Forbidden Zone?

				CORNELIUS	
			To the diggings I worked at a year ago. 
			It's a three day ride across the eastern 
			desert, near where you claim you landed 
			from that planet of yours.

				TAYLOR
			You still don't believe me, do you?

				CORNELIUS 
				(shrugs) 
			It's a long detour to Dead Lake. What 
			would we find?

	Taylor makes a helpless gesture, realizing that he cannot present sure 
	proof.

				TAYLOR 
			Nothing much. The remnants of a life raft. 
			Maybe a small flag. The emblem of my 
			countrymen.

				CORNELIUS 
			Sorry, Taylor. The terrain around that lake 
			is poisonous. There is no fresh water, no 
			vegetation. Nothing.

				TAYLOR
			I know ... Nevertheless, I thank you
			for saving us. You'll be in trouble for 
			going there.

				ZIRA 
				(a smile) 
			We've been in trouble since the moment we 
			met you.

	Nova seizes Taylor's arm to get his attention. Trying to communicate,
 	she makes whimpering sounds and points at:

313-
314	OMIT

315	THE DISTANT JUNGLE - AS SEEN FROM THE GROVE

	This is the same view of the jungle that Taylor saw when the gorilla
 	hunters emerged from the trees. (Page 25)

				ZIRA'S VOICE 
				(o.s.)
			What's she pointing at?

316	BACK TO TAYLOR AND THE OTHERS

	Taylor smiles at Nova, gives her a reassuring shrug.

				TAYLOR 
			That's the way home. And she knows it.

	Nova turns away, still holding Taylor's arm, tries to lead him toward 
	the jungle.

				TAYLOR
				(sharply)
			Nova!	
				(she turns; he shakes
				his head, says gently)
			We can't stay there. It's not safe.

	She looks at him sadly.

				ZIRA 
			We'd better get started. If the mounted 
			police pick up our trail, they'll come 
			this far at least.

				CORNELIUS
			Right. 
			(to Lucius) 	
		Let's put the water and provisions in 
		the wagon.

	He and Lucius move off toward the horses.

				ZIRA
				(indicating Nova)
			Are you going to take her with you?

				TAYLOR
			Yes.

				ZIRA 
			Actually, you're a different breed. 
			This creature will never evolve.

				TAYLOR
			Maybe not.

				ZIRA 
				(smiling) 
			You want her that much?

				TAYLOR 
				(testily) 
			You threw us together, remember? And you 
			guessed right. Men, like apes, get 
			despondent without a mate.

	He walks off to help Lucius and Cornelius. Nova tags along behind him 
	as we:

A-316	THE GROUP MOVES ACROSS A PLATEAU

								DISSOLVE TO:

317	EXT. DRY WASH AND TAMARISKS - FEATURING SCARECROWS - DAY

	The caravan is crossing, in a reverse direction, the route taken by the 
	astronauts on page 17. The three apes are on horseback. Taylor and Nova 
	follow in the wagon. They are nearing the row of sinister scarecrows on 
	the bluff above the dry wash.

318	MED. SHOT - THE THREE MOUNTED APES

	They halt briefly and look up at the crosses. Lucius is impressed.

				LUCIUS 
			Who put them up?

				ZIRA
			The Hunt Club.

				LUCIUS 
			To scare off humans?

				CORNELIUS
			To scare us, too. We're entering
			the Forbidden Zone.

	They move off again, riding across the dry wash.

319	TWO SHOT - TAYLOR AND NOVA - SEATED ON THE WAGON

	They, too, have stopped and are looking up at the scarecrows. Nova is 
	plainly terrified. She grabs Taylor's arm, whimpers.

				TAYLOR 
			Don't worry. You'll be safe with me.
				(sudden smile) 
			Here. It's time you learned to earn 
			your keep.

	He hands the reins to Nova. She just sits there. He demonstrates.

				TAYLOR
			You can do it. Like this ...

	Nova flicks the reins, reacting in wide-eyed, open-mouthed disbelief as 
	the horse obeys her.

								DISSOLVE TO:

320	EXT. DESERT PLATEAU - LONG HIGH ANGLE SHOT - DAY FOR NIGHT

	The party is traversing a red desert to the east of Dead Lake. Great 
	sandstone monoliths rise from the desert floor. From this vantage point 
	the horses look no bigger than ants.

								DISSOLVE TO:

321	EXT. RIM OF A DEEP GORGE - HELICOPTER SHOT - DAY

	This is terrain never before seen in this picture. (Lake Powell 
	location, a few miles northeast of Wahweap). The party can be seen on 
	the rim of a flat desert tableland that falls away abruptly to a vast, 
	irregular river of deep blue water. Taylor, Cornelius and Lucius are 
	unloading the wagon and repacking their provisions and equipment on the 
	backs of horses. Zira watches them.

A-321	CLOSER ANGLE - THE GROUP

	Zira wanders off, falls to her knees.

				LUCIUS
			Something's wrong with your mate.

	Taylor looks off. He and the others move quickly to Nova, CAMERA 
	PANNING with them.

B-321	CLOSE GROUP SHOT - AROUND NOVA

	She has been retching. Taylor lifts her up. She is faint with nausea. 
	Zira squats down beside them.

				ZIRA 
			Let me handle this. 
				(ruefully, to Taylor) 
			You may be smarter than I am, but I'm 
			the veterinary on this planet.

	Assisting Nova to her feet, Zira leads her off toward the wagon.

C-321	MED. SHOT - CORNELIUS, TAYLOR AND LUCIUS.

	Taylor watches the departing females, then looks down at the river.

				TAYLOR
			Where does the river lead?

				CORNELIUS 
			It empties into a sea some miles from 
			here. That's where the cave is.

D-321	LONG SHOT - THE RIVER - FROM THEIR P.O.V..

	The river winds o.s. between the sheer sandstone Cliffs rising from 
	either bank.

				TAYLOR'S VOICE
				(o.s.)
			And beyond that?

E-321	THREE SHOT - TAYLOR, LUCIUS AND CORNELIUS

				CORNELIUS 
			Don't know. At high tide you can't ride 
			along the shore, and we had no boats on 
			the last expedition.

				TAYLOR 
			You've never told me why this region's 
			called the Forbidden Zone.

				CORNELIUS 
			No one really knows. It's an ancient 
			taboo. Set forth in the Sacred Scrolls. 
			The Lawgiver pronounced the area deadly.

				LUCIUS 
			Shouldn't we be moving on?

				TAYLOR
			I'm for that.

	They start toward the horses and wagon.

F-321	GROUP SHOT - NEAR WAGON

	Zira is looking curiously at Nova, who stands in the shade leaning 
	against the wagon as the males enter the scene. Nova's nausea has 
	passed, and she comes smiling to Taylor.

				TAYLOR 
			What's the diagnosis, doctor? A touch 
			of the sun?

				ZIRA
			She's not sick at all.
				(a beat)
			She's pregnant.

G-321	CLOSEUP - TAYLOR

	Consternation slowly gives way to wonder. He grins.

				TAYLOR
			So I'm not an altogether
			different breed, you see?

322-
325	THE DESCENT OF THE GORGE - SEVERAL SHOTS - DAY

	To reach the camp site -- a beach at the base of the gorge -- the party 
	must lead the horses along a narrow trail that zigzags down the face of 
	the sandstone cliffs. They have abandoned the wagon.

								DISSOLVE TO:

326	EXT. ARCHEOLOGICAL CAMP - ESTABLISHING SHOT - DAY

	Sand bars and two narrow beaches are in evidence here. The camp itself 
	consists of several lean-tos against the cliff wall. Above the camp, 
	reached by ladders connected to scaffolding, is the mouth of a cave. 
	Zira is cleaning up the breakfast things; Zaius and Lucius are sorting 
	out equipment.

A-326	CLOSER ANGLE - TAYLOR AND ZIRA

	A small bowl of water rests on the ground in front of Taylor He has 
	nearly finished shaving himself with a sharp hunting knife. Nova 
	watches, a look of fascinated approval on her face. Taylor rinses off 
	his knife, starts to dry it. Nova reaches out, gently strokes his 
	smooth -- if nicked -- chin.

				TAYLOR 
				(smiling) 
			You like it?

	Lucius and Cornelius come up, Zira with them.

				LUCIUS 
				(disapprovingly) 
			Why did you do that? Scrape off your 
			hair?

				TAYLOR
			In my world -- before I left it - 
			only youngsters of your age wore un-
			scraped hair.

				CORNELIUS 
				(to Taylor, quizzically) 
			It makes you look somehow ... less 
			intelligent.

	Taylor grins wryly at Cornelius, picks up his rifle.

				TAYLOR 
			When are you going to show me what's 
			in the cave?

				CORNELIUS 
			Right now, if you like.

	They cross the beach to the ladders, when suddenly they hear the sound 
	of horses. They look o.s.

B-326	WHAT THEY SEE:

	Dr. Zaius and five armed and mounted apes have come around the corner 
	of the beach and ride toward them through the rocks.

C-326	MEDIUM - THE GROUP

	Taylor scrambles up onto the lower scaffold. Lucius runs to a lean-to, 
	scoops up his rifle.

				CORNELIUS
			Lucius -- don't fire at them.

	The party rides up.

				ZAIUS 
			You're all under arrest! 
				(to Lucius) 
			You seditious scoundrel. Drop that 
			rifle.

327-	OUT

349	FLASH SHOT - LUCIUS

	He wavers, lowering his piece.

350	WIDER ANGLE - TO INCLUDE BOTH GROUPS

	Zaius' gorillas ride forward a few paces, but halt again as Taylor 
	shouts:

				TAYLOR 
			Stop right there.

				ZAIUS 
			Don't be a fool. You're outnumbered 
			and outgunned.

	Taylor aims at Zaius and calls out:

				TAYLOR 
			If there's any shooting, Dr. Zaius, 
			you'll be the first to die. Depend 
			on it.

				CORNELIUS 
				(protesting) 
			Taylor, you're not in command here. 
			Put down that gun.

				TAYLOR
			Shut up.

	Silence.	Zaius knows Taylor isn't bluffing.

				ZAIUS
			Very well.
				(to his followers) 
			Lower your weapons.

	They obey. Taylor calls again:

				TAYLOR 
				(pointing) 
			Tell them to move around the point. 
			Out of range.

	Zaius turns and whispers to his apes. They rein about and ride away 
	through the rocks. Zaius dismounts and approaches the fugitives alone. 
	He is unarmed.

351	CLOSER ANGLE - THE GROUP

	As Zaius draws nearer) Lucius lowers his rifle. But Taylor keeps his at 
	the ready.

				CORNELIUS 
				(uncertainly) 
			How did you know we'd come here?

				ZAIUS 
			It wasn't difficult. Only an apostate 
			or a lunatic would flee to the Forbidden 
			Zone. 
				(a glance at Taylor) 
			I see you brought along the female of 
			your species.
				(Taylor nods) 
			I didn't realize a man could be monogamous.

				TAYLOR
			On this planet -- it's easy.

	Zaius laughs derisively, then turns to the apes.

				ZAIUS 
				(evenly) 
			I ask you to reconsider the rash course 
			you've taken. If you're convicted of heresy, 
			the most you'll get is two years. But if 
			you persist in pointing guns in my direction, 
			you'll hang for high treason.

				CORNELIUS 
				(respectfully) 
			We've never meant to be treasonable, sir.
 				(pointing off) 
			But up there, in the face of that Cliff, 
			is a vast cave -- and in that cave a 
			fabulous treasure of fossils and artifacts.

				ZAIUS 
			I've seen some of your fossils and artifacts. 
			They're worthless.

				TAYLOR
				(derisively) 
			And that's your Minister of Science. Honor-
			bound to expand the frontiers of knowledge.

				ZIRA
				(worried)	
			Taylor, please --

				TAYLOR 
			Except that he's also the Chief Defender 
			of the Faith.

				ZAIUS
				(loftily) 
			There is no contradiction between faith 
			and science. True science.

				TAYLOR
				(suddenly angered) 
			All right, let's see if you're willing 
			to put that statement to a test.

				CORNELIUS 
			Taylor, I'd rather you -

				TAYLOR
			No. You saved me from this fanatic. Maybe 
			I can pay you back.

				ZAIUS
				(calmly)
			What is your proposal?

				TAYLOR 
			When were the Sacred Scrolls written?

				ZAIUS 
			Twelve hundred years ago.

				TAYLOR 
			Very well. If Zira and Cornelius can prove 
			that those scrolls don't tell the whole 
			truth of your history; if they can show you 
			definite evidence of another culture from an 
			unrecorded past -- will you exonerate them?

				ZAIUS
			Of course.

				TAYLOR
			Okay.Up to the cave.

	He gestures toward the path leading to it. Zaius, Zira, and Cornelius 
	start upward. Lucius starts to follow them.

				TAYLOR 
			Sorry, Lucius. You'll have to stay here 
			and guard the horses.

				LUCIUS 
			Always giving orders. Just like every 
			other adult.

				TAYLOR
			Relax. You'll see it all later.

	He pats the barrel of Lucius' gun, in the manner of a stern but 
	benevolent non-com, then starts up the trail with Nova at his heels. 
	Lucius, unused to taking commands from an animal, scowls after him, 
	then shrugs, adjusting to the Idea.

355	OUT

356 	EXT. WESTERN WALL OF GORGE - LONG SHOT - ANGLING UP
	AFTERNOON

	The sun hovers over the lofty rim of the lake like a great red balloon. 
	The wall of the gorge, in shadow, is a darker hue.

357	EXT.  EASTERN WALL OF GORGE - LONG SHOT - ANGLING UP

	The crenelated east wall, looking like a red cathedral, is aglow with 
	sunlight. So is the mouth of the cave as the three apes, Taylor and 
	Nova pass through it and o.s.

358	INT. CAVERN - BOOM SHOT - DAY

	Nature has formed a vaulted room here. It need not be enormous, but 
	should be as weird and fantastic as production capabilities permit. 
	There is an ape-made excavation in the floor of the cave, some ten feet 
	square and eight feet deep. Some small objects lie on the rim of the 
	excavation. Zaius, Cornelius, Zira, Taylor and Nova enter from the 
	outside.

	(AUTHOR'S NOTE: The effect should be an eyeful. I wish to create an 
	illusion of sunlight penetrating this cave, flooding it with direct, 
	refracted illumination, transforming it into a kaleidoscopic cavern.)

				ZAIUS
			Present your evidence, Cornelius.

	Cornelius clambers down into the pit, followed by Zira. Taylor bends 
	down, examines some of the artifacts lined along the edge of the 
	excavation. Nova sits beside him.

				CORNELIUS 
				(pointing) 
			It was at this level I discovered traces 
			of an early ape creature -- stage of 
			primitive barbarism, really -- dating back 
			roughly thirteen hundred years. It was here 
			I found cutting tools and arrowheads of 
			quartz and the fossilized bones of 
			carnivorous gorillas.

	CAMERA (ON BOOM) MOVES IN SLOWLY as Cornelius continues:

				CORNELIUS 
			But the artifacts lying at your feet 
			were found here, at this level. And 
			that's the paradox. The more ancient 
			culture is the more advanced. Admittedly, 
			many of these objects are unidentified, 
			but clearly they were fashioned by beings 
			with a knowledge of metallurgy.

	CAMERA KEEPS MOVING IN on the group in and around the excavation as 
	Cornelius continues:

				CORNELIUS 
			Indeed, the very fact that these tools 
			are unknown to us could suggest a culture 
			in certain ways almost equal to our own. 
			Some of the evidence is uncontestable ...

				ZAIUS
				(interrupting) 
			Don't speak to me in absolutes. The 
			evidence is contestable.

				CORNELIUS
			I apologize.

				ZAIUS 
			To begin with, your methods of dating 
			the past are crude, to say the least. There 
			are geologists on my staff who would laugh at 
			your speculations.

				TAYLOR 
			Perhaps that's why they're on your staff.

	Zaius flicks a hostile glance at Taylor, then looks down at the 
	artifacts. He nudges them with his foot.

				ZAIUS 
			Secondly, if these 'tools' as you call 
			them, are unidentified, why are they 
			introduced as 'evidence' of anything?

				ZIRA 
				(promptly) 
			But there's the doll, sir.

				ZAIUS
			What?

				CORNELIUS
				(pointing)
			Right there. The human doll.

	Zaius deigns to stoop and pick it up.

359	CLOSE ON DOLL - IN ZAIUS' HAND

	It is only a porcelain fragment, but the head is intact, and it is 
	unmistakably the form of a human child.

				ZAIUS	
			What does this prove? My grand-
			daughter plays with human dolls.

360	FULL SHOT - THE EXCAVATION - INCLUDING TAYLOR

	Exasperated, Zira turns to the man for confirmation.

				ZIRA 
			Taylor! Tell him.

				TAYLOR 
			He has a point. On my planet children 
			often play with ape dolls.

	Zaius idly tosses the doll to the ground near Nova. She picks it up, 
	studies it.

361	GROUP SHOT - THE THREE APES

	Cornelius tries again.

				CORNELIUS 
			A doll alone proves nothing. True. But 
			the doll was found beside the jawbone 
			of a man -- and no trace of simian fossils 
			has turned up in this deposit.

				ZAIUS 
			Your conclusion is premature. Have you 
			forgotten your Scripture? The Thirteenth 
			Scroll?
				(quoting from memory) 
			'And Proteus brought the upright beast 
			into the garden, and chained him to a tree, 
			and the children made sport of him.'

				CORNELIUS
				(impatiently)
			No sir, I haven't forgotten.

				ZAIUS
			Well? For a time the ancients kept humans 
			as household pets.	Until the Lawgiver 
			proved that man could not be tamed. Keep 
			digging Cornelius. You'll find evidence of
			the master of this house: an ape.	

A-361	ANOTHER ANGLE - TO INCLUDE TAYLOR AND NOVA

	As Zira again appeals to the man.

				ZIRA 
			Are you going to let that pass without 
			an answer?

	Taylor, who has been toying with objects in the dirt, looks up.

				TAYLOR 
			Yes. I have to agree. From all you've 
			found so far, his position's as good as 
			yours.

				CORNELIUS
				(annoyed)
			What are you doing there?

				TAYLOR 
			Reconstructing a life. Care to have a 
			look?

	Cornelius and Zira cross the pit and Zaius walks around the rim of the 
	excavation.

B-361	MED. CLOSE SHOT - FAVORING TAYLOR AND NOVA

	As the apes come close. A number of artifacts have been arranged in 
	front of Taylor.

				TAYLOR
				(to Cornelius) 
			These were found near the human doll, 
			right?
				(Cornelius nods) 
			Well, whoever owned them was in pretty 
			bad shape.

	He picks up the twisted fragment of a pair of spectacles.

				TAYLOR
			Defective eyesight..

	As Taylor continues his monologue, he picks up the other objects one by 
	one.

				TAYLOR 
			He wore false teeth. 
				(pause) 
			He suffered from a hernia and used 
			this truss to hold up his insides ...
				(pause)  
			And toward the end, these little rings 
			of stainless steel enclosed a prefab-
			ricated valve in his failing heart.

	Taylor pauses. Zaius picks up two of the steel rings, studies them.

				TAYLOR 
			I don't say he was a man like an Earthman, 
			but I'd call him a close relative, for 
			he was plagued by most of man's ills. 
				(to Zaius pointedly) 
			Yet, fragile as he was, he came before you 
			-- and was superior to you.

				ZAIUS 
				(a calm smile) 
			That's lunacy. I can give an alternate 
			description for everyone of those objects 
			that's equally as inventive as yours. But 
			it would be conjecture, not proof.

362	WIDER ANGLE - TO INCLUDE TAYLOR AND NOVA

	She is poking her finger inside the decapitated head of the doll. From 
	it comes a distorted SOUND.

				DOLL'S HEAD 
			Mamma! Mamma! Mamma!.

	The apes stare at the doll in astonishment. Taylor snatches the doll 
	from Nova, brandishes it at the astonished Zaius.

				TAYLOR 
			Dr. Zaius! Would an ape make a human 
			doll that talks?

	Zaius looks at him, speechless. At that moment the CRACK of a distant 
	rifle shot reverberates through the cavern. All present freeze, 
	listening.

				ZIRA
			Lucius....

363-
364	OUT

365	FULL SHOT - THE CAVERN - REVERSE ANGLE

	Taylor alone is armed. Raising his rifle, he glowers at Zaius.

				TAYLOR
			You louse!

	Cornelius is already crossing the pit. He climbs out arid races toward 
	the mouth of the cave. Taylor runs after him. Zira and Nova hurry after 
	Taylor.

366	MED. SHOT - ZAIUS

	Expressionless, he looks down at the doll, then moves toward the mouth 
	of the cave.

367	EXT. TRAIL FROM CAVE TO CAMP - ANGLING UP

	Cornelius emerges from mouth of the cave and runs down the trail toward 
	CAMERA. He halts in f.g., looking down at:

368	THE CAMP SITE - AS SEEN FROM THE TRAIL

	Two of Zaius' gorillas have disarmed Lucius and are clubbing him with
	their rifle butts. Two other mounted apes are driving the scientists' 
	horses back beyond the trees.

369	EXT. THE TRAIL - AS SEEN FROM THE BEACH

	Cornelius, Taylor, Nova and Zira (in that order) can be seen high 
	above, descending the trail. CAMERA PULLS BACK TO DISCLOSE A GORILLA 
	SNIPER in immediate f.g., crouching behind a boulder near the water. He 
	sights his rifle at the man on the trail. Taylor is still too distant 
	to make a sure target, and so the sniper waits.

370	CLOSER ANGLE - TAYLOR ON THE TRAIL

	This portion of the trail has no cover or concealment. Unaware of the 
	sniper, Taylor looks down at the camp as he makes his descent.

371	LONG SHOT - TAYLOR - AS SEEN IN THE SNIPER'S SIGHTS

	The gorilla fires.

372	CLOSE SHOT - TAYLOR

	The bullet ricochets off the rock wall a foot above his head. Taylor 
	scans the terrain bewlow, looking for the sniper. Nova comes to his 
	side, pointing at:

373	THE SNIPER - FROM THEIR P.O.V.

	His head is visible behind the boulder as he reloads his piece	.

374	FLASH SHOT

	He aims and fires.

375	FLASH SHOT - THE SNIPER

	Taylor has missed him, but the sniper ducks behind the boulder.

376	THE TRAIL - PANNING WITH TAYLOR AND NOVA

	Taylor takes her hand and they race back up the trail to where Zira is 
	standing. Outcroppings of rock offer some  cover here. Taylor pushes 
	Nova down behind a rock and signals for Zira to follow suit.

377	CLOSE GROUP SHOT - TAYLOR, NOVA AND ZIRA

	The sniper's SECOND SHOT rings out. Instead of returning the fire, 
	Taylor looks up the rail at:

378	ZAIUS - FRO14 TAYLOR'S P.O.V.

	He is standing impassively on the trail a short distance below the 
	mouth of the cave.

379	FLASH SHOT - TAYLOR

	Bent low, he comes charging up the trail toward Zaius. The sniper's 
	THIRD SHOT splatters rock fragments around him.

380	REVERSE ANGLE - THE TRAIL - ANGLING UP

	Zaius starts to retreat to the cave, but stumbles and falls on some 
	loose shale. No sooner has Zaius regained his feet than Taylor 
	overtakes him. Seizing the ape around the neck with his left arm. 
	Taylor drives the muzzle of his pistol into Zaius' kidney. He spins 
	Zaius around, using him as a shield.

381	CLOSE TWO SHOT - ZAIUS AND TAYLOR

	Taylor releases the pressure on Zaius' throat but keeps the gun pointed 
	at his back.

			TAYLOR
		Tell him to pull back!

			ZAIUS 
			(a hoarse cry)
		Cease fire! Withdraw!

	His command echoes from the west wall of the canyon.

382	LONG SHOT - THE FLOOR OF THE GORGE - FROM THEIR P.O.V.

	The sniper emerges from behind a boulder near the shore, and walks off 
	along the beach.

383	BACK TO TAYLOR AND ZAIUS 

	Taylor lift's the muzzle of his rifle and presses it against the back
	of Zaius' head.

				TAYLOR
			I ought to kill you right now.
				(nudging him) 
			Let's go.

	They move off down the trail.

384	EXT. ARCHEOLOGICAL CAMP - MED. SHOT - DAY

	Zira rushes down the trail to Lucius, who is sprawled on the ground. He 
	has a bloody nose and a lump on his forehead. Nova and Cornelius come 
	next, then Taylor, prodding Zaius ahead of him at gun point. Lucius 
	appears to be more humiliated than hurt.

				LUCIUS 
			They took me by surprise. Sneaked
			up on me while I was watering the
			horses. What's happened to honor?
				(pause, glum) 
			I got off one round to warn you.

				CORNELIUS
				(gloomingly)
			They've taken everything.

				TAYLOR	
			Not everything. They left a hostage.
				(a pause)
			How do you feel, Lucius?

				LUCIUS
			Disillusioned... 
				(turning on)
			But vindicated! I've been right all 
			along. You can't trust the older 
			generation. It's a matter of values --

				TAYLOR
				(gently)
			All right, all right. Will You do me 
			a favor? No orders.

				LUCIUS
				(pause) 
			What is it?

				TAYLOR 
			I want you to go around the bend and 
			tell those gorillas their leader is my 
			prisoner.

				LUCIUS
				(thoughtfull pause)
			Yes, I can do that.

				TAYL0R
			Good. Say I want a week's supply of food 
			for the woman and myself. A horse. A spade.
			And fifty rounds of ammunition.

				LUCIUS
			What if they won't agree to your terms?

				TAYLOR
			Then tell them Dr. Zaius won't leave 
			here alive.

				ZIRA 
				(shocked) 
			Taylor, you can't.

				ZAIUS
				(Calmly)
			Oh yes he can. He's a born killer.
			(to Lucius)
		Deliver the message.

	Lucius looks to Taylor for confirmation. Taylor nods. The young ape 
	hurries away through the rocks. Taylor crosses to a useless saddle, 
	picks up a coil of rope, gestures at Zaius, indicating a nearby tree.

				TAYLOR
			Sit down. Over there.

	Zaius squats on the ground beside the tree. Taylor sets his rifle 
	against the trunk, fashions a noose and places it around Zaius' neck.
	Then, using an ingenious combination of knots, he ties Zaius' hands 
	behind his back, and finally fastens the rope around the base of the 
	tree.

				TAYLOR
				(as he works)
			Now, 	Minister of Science - let me explain 
			certain principle stress and strain. If 
			you exert pressure to remove these bonds, 
			you'll choke yourself to death. It'll be 
			suicide, you see?

	Zira and Cornelius look down at the captive mandarin. Their rebellious 
	spirit has evaporated, and they are clearly afraid.

				ZIRA	
			Taylor, please -- don't treat him that 
			way.

				TAYLOR
			Why not?

				ZIRA 
			It's humiliating.

				TAYLOR 
			Wasn't I humiliated? By all of you? 
			Didn't you lead me around on a leash?

				CORNELIUS 
			That was different. We thought you 
			were .... inferior.

				TAYLOR 
				(wintry smile) 
			And now you know the truth. 
				(to Zaius) 
			Cornelius has beaten you, Doctor. He 
			proved it. Man preceded you here. You 
			owe him your science, your language, 
			whatever knowledge you have.

				ZAIUS 
				(quietly) 
			Then answer this: If ran was superior, 
			why didn't he survive?

				TAYLOR
				(shrugging) 
			He might have been wiped out by a plague. 
			Natural catastrophe. Like a fiery storm 
			of meteors. From the looks of this part 
			of your planet, I'd say that was a fair bet.

				ZIRA,
				(weakly)
			But we can't be sure.

				TAYLOR
				(indicating Zaius)
			He is. He knew all the time. Long before 
			your discovery, he knew.
				(to Zaius) 
			Defender of the Faith. Guardian of the 
			terrible secret. Isn't that right, doctor?

385-
388 	OUT

389	REVERSE ANGLE -	CIRCLE - FAVORING ZAIUS

	As Zira and Cornelius look at him expectantly.

				ZAIUS 
			What I know of man was written long ago 
			-- set down by the wisest ape of all --
			our Lawgiver.
				(to Cornelius)
			Open my breast pocket.

	Cornelius crosses to Zaius, and takes a small book bound in black 
	leather from the breast pocket of his tunic.

				ZAIUS 
			Read it to him: the twentythird Scroll, 
			ninth Verse.

	Cornelius thumbs through the book, finds the citation and reads aloud:

				CORNELIUS 
			'Beware the beast man, for he is the 
			devil's pawn. Alone among God's primates, 
			he kills for sport, or lust or greed. 
			Yes, he will murder his brother to possess 
			his brother's land. Let him not breed 
			in great numbers, for he will make a desert 
			of his home and yours. Shun him. Drive him 
			back into his jungle lair: For he is the 
			harbinger of death'.

	Cornelius falls silent and looks down at Zaius.

				ZAIUS 
				(quietly) 
			I found nothing in the cave to alter that 
			conception of man. And I still live by its 
			injunction.

A-389	ANOTHER ANGLE - THE GROUP

	Lucius hurries out of the rocks leading a saddled horse. Zaius' five 
	mounted gorillas appear behind him. Taylor calls out to them:

				TAYLOR
			Stay where you 	are!

	Lucius comes up with the horse. Taylor checks the provisions in the 
	saddlebags. Lucius is frowning.

				LUCIUS 
			They think you're behaving foolishly. I 
			must say I agree. Where will you go?

				TAYLOR
				(nodding o.s.) 
			I'll start by following the shoreline.
				(a smile) 
			And my nose.

				ZIRA
			But suppose you find nothing but a 
			wasteland. How will you survive?

				ZAIUS 
				(firmly) 
			He won't survive. 
				(all look at him) 
			Do you know what sort of life awaits 
			you out there, Taylor? That of an animal. 
			If you aren't eventually hunted down and 
			killed by apes, some jungle beast will 
			devour you.

				TAYLOR 
			Then there is another jungle?

				ZAIUS 
				(shrugs; then, 
				sardonically) 
			Of course, you could return with us. Our 
			society might find a place for you and 
			your mate.

				TAYLOR
			Sure.	In a cage.

				ZAIUS 
			Where else, but in a cage, does man 
			belong?

				TAYLOR
			No, thanks. I'll take freedom.

	Taylor mounts the horse, extends a helping hand to Nova, who vault's 
	nimbly onto the horse's rump. Taylor looks at Zira and Cornelius.

				TAYLOR
			Would you like to come along?

				ZIRA
			We can't.

				TAYLOR
			It's better than going to prison for 
			heresy.

				CORNELIUS
			They can't convict us of that. You 
			proved our innocence. Besides...
				(indicating Zaius)
			... his culture is our culture.

				TAYLOR 
			Good luck then.

	He reaches down, grasps Cornelius' hand, then grins crookedly.

				TAYLOR 
			Dr. Zira, I'd like to kiss you 
			good-bye.

				ZIRA 
			All right, but.... 
				(tears in her eyes) 
			...you're so damned ugly!

	Taylor smiles, leans down, kisses her.

				ZIRA 
				(softly) 
			Go with God, Taylor. 
				(half smile) 
			That's an old expression. it comes 
			from both ape and man.

				TAYLOR
			God bless you.

	He extends his hand to Lucius, who takes it.

				TAYLOR
			Lucius.

				LUCIUS
			I think you're making a mistake.

				TAYLOR 
			That's the boy. Keep 'em flying.

				LUCIUS
			What?

				TAYLOR 
			The flags of discontent. It's the only 
			way anything ever gets changed. 
				(to Zaius) 
			Don't try to follow us. 
				(pats stock of 
				his rifle) 
			I'm pretty handy with things like this.

				ZAIUS 
			Of that I'm sure. All my life I've 
			awaited your coming and dreaded it. 
			Like death itself.

	Taylor looks piercingly at Zaius, more troubled than offended.

				TAYLOR 
			Why? From the first, I've terrified you, 
			Doctor. And in spite of every sign that 
			I'm an intelligent being who means no 
			harm, you continue to hate and fear me. 
			Why?

				ZAIUS 
				(calmly, 
				without rancor) 
			Because you are a man. And you were right 
			-- I have always known about man. From the 
			evidence, I believe his wisdom must walk 
			hand in hand with his idiocy. His emotions 
			must rule his brain. He must be a warlike 
			animal who gives battle to everything around 
			him -- even himself.

				TAYLOR 
			What evidence? No weapons were found in 
			the cave.

				ZAIUS 
			The Forbidden Zone was once a paradise. 
			Your breed made a desert of it, ages ago.

				TAYLOR 
				(he waits, 
				then wearily) 
			We're back at the beginning. I still don't 
			know the why. A planet where apes evolved 
			from men. A world turned wrong side up.  
			A puzzle with one piece missing.

				ZAIUS 
				(softly) 
			Don't look for it, Taylor. You may not 
			like what you find.

B-389	WIDER ANGLE - TAYLOR AND THE GROUP

	Taylor shakes his head, still baffled, digs his heels into the horse's 
	flank. It canters off along the sandy shore.	Zira, Cornelius and 
	Lucius sadly watch the departure.

				ZAIUS 
			Untie me!

	Cornelius moves quickly to remove the rope from Zaius' neck. Behind 
	them, the five mounted gorillas gallop forward. Zaius gets up, waves 
	them to a halt.

				ZAIUS 
			No, no! Let him go!

C-389	MOVING SHOT - TAYLOR AND NOVA ON HORSEBACK

	Taylor looks back, sees that Zaius has stopped the mounted apes, slows 
	his horse to a trot, smiles at Nova.

390-	OUT
405

406	MED. SHOT - THE APES

	Zaius watches as Taylor's horse moves farther away along the beach. 
	Then he turns to an ape called MARCUS.

				ZAIUS 
				(quietly) 
			Fetch your explosives. We're going 
			to seal the cave.

				MARCUS
			Yes, sir.

	He remounts his horse and rides o.s.

				CORNELIUS
				(aghast) 
			Seal the cave?

				ZAIUS
			That's correct. And you will both stand 
			trial for heresy.

				ZIRA
			But the proof? The doll?

				ZAIUS 
			In a few minutes there will be no doll. 
			There can't be. 
				(honest regret) 
			I'm sorry.

	Cornelius throws himself at Zaius.

				CORNELIUS
			You mustn't! You gave your 'word!

	Zaius looks emptily at one of his apes.

 				ZAIUS
			What I do, I do with no pleasure. Silence 
			him.

	A hairy hand is clapped over Cornelius' mouth. He is dragged off, 
	struggling, kicking. Julius, unafraid, glares at Zaius.

				LUCIUS 
			Dr. Zaius, this is inexcusable! Why must 
			knowledge stand still? What about the 
			future?

	Zaius looks benevolently at Julius.

				ZAIUS
			I may just have saved it for you.

	Julius and Zira look at each other, befuddled. Once more their eyes 
	follow the retreating figures of Taylor and Nova. The beach separating 
	the water from the canyon becomes narrower as they move downstream.

				LUCIUS
			What will he find out there, doctor?

A-406	CLOSEUP - ZAIUS

	His face is A mask, his tone enigmatic.

				ZAIUS
			His destiny.

B-406	WIDER ANGLE - TIE APES P.O.V.

	A moment later, as they watch, Taylor and Nova vanish around the bend.

407-	OUT
408
		
409	EXT. PALISADE AND BEACH - LONG HIGH ANGLE SHOT - DAY

	Taylor and Nova are already far downstream. There is a striking change 
	in the terrain. The area is still desolate,but some vegetation can be
 	seen on the palisade above the narrow beach, and the river has widened 
	to form a vast tidal basin where it meets the sea.

	A NOTE ON PRODUCTION: If feasible at new location site, this scene 
	should be shot at high tide, so that the water laps at the base of the 
	cliffs, making a passage difficult and risky.

410	CLOSER ANGLE - PANNING WITH TAYLOR AND NOVA ON HORSEBACK

	He is alert, sniffing the salt air, sizing up the situation. Hearing 
	the CRIES of birds, he reins in and looks' up.

411	SKY SHOT - CIRCLING BIRDS

	Sea gulls are soaring overhead.

412	TWO SHOT - TAYLOR AND NOVA ON HORSEBACK

	His expression is expectant, searching. Nova emits a whimper of 
	anticipation, pointing off.

413	LONG SHOT - WHAT THEY SEE:

	A verdant forest atop a distant palisade. Their view of the beach below
	the forest, is cut off by a rocky promontory in the middle distance.

414	CLOSE SHOT - NOVA AND TAYLOR

	He smiles at her hopefully.

				TAYLOR
			Yes, Nova -- I see it.
				(looks again at
				forest)
			In my old profession green meant
			safe. Green meant go.

	The horse moves off at a trot, CAMERA PANNING. But they have gone only 
	a short distance when they hear the distant THUNDER of an EXPLOSION. 
	Taylor reins in and looks back.

415	VERY LONG SHOT - A CLOUD OF SMOKE

	A column of smoke and dust rises from the exploded cave far upstream.

416	BACK TO TAYLOR AND NOVA

	Frowning with concern, Taylor gazes for a moment at the smoke, then 
	decides this is no time to linger. He digs his heels into the horse's
	flanks and they move off at a canter, riding toward the promontory that 
	splits the beach. They are nearing the promontory that blocks their 
	view of the beach beyond.

417-	OUT
418

419	CLOSER ANGLE - TRACKING WITH TAYLOR AND NOVA.

	As they round the promontory, the tip of a strange rock formation comes 
	into view. it appears to be jutting from the sea.

420	REACTION SHOT - TAYLOR

	He reins in momentarily, baffled by what he sees. Then he rides on.

421	THE STRANGE FORMATION - AS SEEN BY TAYLOR

	An immense column juts from the beach at a thirty-degree angle. We can 
	now see that it is not rock, but metal. Green metallic tints show 
	through its gray salt-stained surface. As we draw closer, the object 
	takes on the appearance of a massive arm, its top shaped like a hand
	holding a torch.

422	REVERSE ANGLE - FAVORING TAYLOR

	Frowning with consternation. His horse proceeds at a slow walk.

423	TRACKING WITH TAYLOR - WHAT HE SEES:

	Near the base of the column, where the shore and water meet, are a row 
	of metal spikes. From this angle they look like tank traps.

A-423	CLOSER - TAYLOR

	Dumbfounded, he slides from his saddle, approaches the  spikes. Nova 
	dismounts and follows him.

				TAYLOR
				(a cry of agony)
			My God!

	He falls to his knees, buries his head in his hands. CAMERA SLOWLY 
	DRAWS BACK AND UP to a HIGH ANGLE SHOT disclosing what Taylor has 
	found. Half-buried in the sand and washed by the waves is the Statue of 
	Liberty.

	FADE IN
	
1	EXT. CONSTELLATION OF ORION - NIGHT

	Stars glitter like diamonds on the black velvet backdrop of space. 
	The Belt of Orion is center screen, but much nearer and larger 
	than ever seen by an Earth-bound astronomer.

	A speck of light appears in the lower left corner of the screen. 
	No spaceship can be seen, but only a glowworm, a solitary sperma-
	tosoan gliding through the womb of the universe. Over this we HEAR 
	the voice of an astronaut. He is concluding a report.

				ASTRONAUT'S VOICE
				(o.s.)	
			So ends my last signal until we reach
			our destination. We are now on automatic, 
			a mere hundred and five light years from 
			our base ... and at the mercy of com-
			puters. I've tucked in my crew for the 
			long sleep. I'll join them presently.

2	INT. CABIN OF SPACESHIP - ESTABLISHING SHOT - NIGHT

	The cabin is neither cramped nor spacious, but about the size of the 
	President's cabin in Air Force One. In the immediate f.g. is a console 
	of dials and switches flanked by four chairs. Only one of the chairs 
	is occupied. The astronaut's back is to CAMERA. There is a ladder 
	amidships which leads to an escape hatch. The after Dart of the cabin
	is obscured in darkness. We hear the MUSIC of a Mozart sonata emanating
 	from a phonograph of stereotape. The astronaut is speaking into a
 	microphone.

				ASTRONAUT
			Within the hour we shall complete	
			the sixth month of our flight from
			Cape Kennedy. By our time, that is ...

	He pauses, looking up at:

3	TWO LARGE CLOCKS - ON CABIN WALL

	One clock is marked SELF TIME, but instead of twelve numerals it has 
	twenty-four. One of the needles is moving very slowly.

	The other clock is labeled EARTH TIME, and its units, like those of a
 	tachometer, are given by hundreds and thousands.

	The largest needle of this clock makes one revolution every second.
 	Over this we hear:

				ASTRONAUT'S VOICE
				(o.s.)
			But according to Dr. Hasslein theory of 
			time in a vehicle traveling at close to 
			the speed of light, old Mother Earth has 
			aged a few thousand years since our de-
			parture -- while we have scarcely aged 
			at all.

4	CLOSE ON ASTRONAUT

	This is TAYLOR. He wears simple dungarees (or Churchill suit) and
 	comfortable boots. He seems calm and pensive. Extracting the butt of 
	a cigar from the breast pocket of his dungarees, he lights it, then
 	continues:

				TAYLOR 
			It may be so. This much is probable: the 
			men who sent us on this journey have long 
			since been moldering in forgotten graves; 
			and those, if any, who read this message 
			are a different breed. Hopefully, a 
			better one.

	He begins to roll up his left sleeve.

				TAYLOR 
			I leave the twentieth century without 
			regret. Who was it? Marshall? ... said 
			'Modern man is the missin 'a link between 
			the ape and the human being.'

	He removes the cigar from his mouth, turns to look out through one 
	of the portholes into the astral night.

				TAYLOR 
			One final thought -- nothing scientific, 
			purely personal. Seen from up here, 
			everything looks different ... Time bends 
			and space is boundless. It squashes a 
			man's ego. He begins to feel like no more 
			than a mote in the eye of eternity. And 
			he is nagged by a question: ahat if any-
			thing, will greet us on the end of man's 
			first journey to a star? Are we to believe 
			that throughout these thousands of galaxies, 
			these millions of stars, only one, that 
			speck of solar dust we call Earth, has 
			been graced -- or cursed -- by human life?
				(pause) 
			I have to doubt it.

	He extracts a hypodermic needle from his breast pocket and injects 
	it into the vein of his forearm. He continues speaking.

				TAYLOR 
				(sardonically) 
			That's about all. I wonder if Man, that 
			marvel of the universe, that glorious 
			paradox who has sent me to the unknown... 
			still makes war against his brother., and 
			lets his neighbor's children starve.

	Taylor withdraws the hypodermic needle from his vein and secures it in 
	a drawer of the console.

				TAYLOR 
			Well then, Earthmen: A missing link 
			salutes you. Bless you, my descendants.

	Taylor snuffs out the cigar butt and places it in the drawer beside the
 	hypodermic. Then, flicking a switch Au cut off the Mozart, he rises and 
	looks up again at:

5	THE CLOCK MARKED EARTH TIME

	The longest needle of this clock now makes nearly two revolutions per 
	second. The shortest needle points to the numeral 2105.

6	INT. CABIN - TRACKING WITH TAYLOR

	Space scientists have presumably solved the problem of weightlessness, 
	for Taylor walks the short distance from; the console to the after 
	section without particular effort. CAMERA FOLLOWS him, and we can now 
	see four glass capsules, or "caskets", in the rear of the cabin. Taylor 
	looks down at them.

7-	SEVERAL SHOTS - THE FOUR CASKETS - FROM TAYLOR'S P.O.V.
10
	One of them is open. The other three are occupied by astronauts: DODGE, 
	LANDON and STEWART. They, too, wear dungarees and boots. Dodge and 
	Landon are thirtyish, clean-shaven, virile -- America's finest. Stewart 
	is a handsome young woman, her hair bobbed short. Their eyes are closed 
	and they do not appear to be breathing -- yet no undertaker could make 
	them so alive.

11	ANOTHER ANGLE - FAVORING TAYLOR

	He grasps the handle of his own casket and slowly pulls himself into
 	it. Continuing SILENCE. CAMERA MOVES IN as Taylor Dulls the glass lid
 	shut and secures it. He adjusts two dials inside the capsule and lies
 	back, buckling his safety belt. CAMERA MOVES INTO A CLOSEUP of Taylor.
 	His eyes are open. He seems serene, even enraptured.

		
	(NOTE: Credits will appear here over a series of shots designed to
 	convey a sense of loneliness, of separation, and of the passage of
 	time.)

								DISSOLVE TO:

12-	A SERIES OF SHOTS - A DISTANT GLOBE (MINIATURE)
16	
	We see a strange and distant planet. At first the globe occupies but a 
	small area of the screen; but with each new VIEW it comes closer and
 	looms larger, as if" observed from a spaceship in a spiraling orbit of
 	descent.

	The topography of the planet bears little resemblance to our own. Much
 	of it is obscured by cloud cover; even more of-it appears to be
 	cratered desert of reddish hue. We can, however, make out a few narrow
 	"green belts" and a patch of blue water.

	In the FINAL SHOTS of this SEQUENCE we see the strange planet as it
 	would be observed from a spacecraft plummeting from twenty thousand
 	feet to one thousand feet. It appears that the ship will fall into a 
	vast lake surrounded by soaring sandstone pinnacles. The water is 
	blue-black, the pinnacles vermillion. (This is the Lake Powell
 	location, at Lone Rock.)

17	INT. SPACESHIP - FULL SHOT - DAY

	Four empty pilot seats are seen in f.g., the four glass caskets in 
	b.g. We HEAR the RHYTHMIC BLEAT of a WARNING SIGNAL, a RUSH OF WIND 
	as in a rapid descent, and perhaps the ROAR OF RETROJETS. Then, a 
	great CRASH as the craft hits water. The whole ship shudders on impact.
 	Loose equipment falls to the cabin floor. CAMERA MOVES DOWN the cabin
 	aisle as the ship begins to roll in the water and HOLDS on the four
	glass caskets. There are THREE LOUD METALLIC CLICKS as the glass 
	domes of the caskets swing open automatically.

18	CLOSE ON TAYLOR

	He now has a full beard. His eyes come open. Instantly alert, he 
	rises to a sitting position, gazing across at:

19	DODGE AND LANDON - FROM TAYLOR'S P.O.V.

	They, too, awaken and sit up, starring at Taylor. They, too, are
	bearded.

				TAYLOR'S VOICE 
				(o.s.)
			You all right?

	They nod.

20	BACK TO TAYLOR - CLOSE SHOT

	He glances at the casket beside his own.

				TAYLOR 
			Stewart?
				(struggling to his feet) 
			Stewart?

21	CLOSE-SHOT --THE FOURTH CASKET

	Its dome remains unopened. The young woman is a skeleton in a 
	Churchill suit.

22	REACTION SHOT - THE THREE ASTRONAUTS

	Dodge and Landon have joined Taylor and-stare at the grinning skull 
	of their dead comrade. A low, descending HUM of equipment is heard.
 	Simultaneously the lights begin to FADE. A moment later they brighten,
 	but not as much as before.

				TAYLOR 
			There goes our primary power. We're on 
			auxilliary.

	A slight CRACKING sound is heard. Taylor turns quickly away and o.s.:

23	REVERSE ANGLE - THE FORWARD CABIN

	A trickle of water has begun to seep through a ruptured seam in the
 	cabin. Taylor darts to a porthole and peers cut.

24	LONG SHOT - WHAT TAYLOR SEES:

	water 

	The porthole is no more than six inches above the line. In the 
	distance we discern a shoreline of red desert.

				TAYLOR'S VOICE 
				(o.s.)
			We're in the soup. We're sinking.

25	INT. CABIN - FULL SHOT

	The leak in the seam becomes a growing spray of water. Taylor 
	turns away from the porthole, calling:

				TAYLOR
			Dodge! Read the atmosphere!

	Dodge moves instantly to the ladder beneath an escape hatch and 
	mounts it. Taylor stumbles down the aisle of the rolling ship toward
 	the console and addresses Landon, who is still staring at Stewart's
	skeleton.

				TAYLOR
			Landon! Send a last signal.

				LANDON
				(dazed) 
			What signal?

				TAYLOR 
			To Earth! That we've landed!

	As Landon lurches toward the communications equipment in f.g.

								CUT TO:

26	EXT. TIM STRANGE PLANET - LONG PANORAMIC SHOT - LATE AFTERNOON (LONE
 	ROCK, LAKE POWELL)

	We are looking at a lifeless desert of sandstone buttes and pinnacles.
 	There is no sign of vegetation anywhere. CAMERA PANS DOWN to a body 
	of water that could be the bay of an inland sea. The deep blue of the
 	sea contrasts sharply to the red sands of the shoreline. CAMERA HOLDS
 	on the stricken spaceship, wallowing like a beached whale a hundred
 	yards offshore. The portholes of the craft are beneath the water, and
 	only its roof and the tail fin of its tail assembly are visible. The
 	red-hot skin of the ship vaporizes the water around it.

	Suddenly a snorkel-like tube sprouts from the escape hatch, which is 
	located amidships.

27	INT. CABIN - CLOSE ON CLOSED ESCAPE HATCH

	Dodge, standing halfway up the ladder., has fastened a kit of gauges 
	to the end of the snorkel tube. He reads the dials, removes the kit,
 	sniffs the air in the tube and then, taking a deep breath, announces:

				DODGE 
			It's breathable.

				TAYLOR'S VOICE 
				(o.s.) 
			Okay! Blow the hatch before we lose 
			auxilliary power.

	Dodge reaches for a control mechanism near the escape hatch.

28	CLOSE ON TAYLOR AND LANDON

	The spray of water coming through the ruptured seam is increasing. 
	The LIGHTS DIM again and the SOUND of the warning signal FADES. While
	Landon fiddles with the radio, Taylor tries to get the tape recorder
 	rolling, but all we hear are scrambled and unintelligible noises.

				LANDON
			It's no use ... there she goes.

				TAYLOR
			Forget it. Abandon ship.

29	WIDER ANGLE - TIM CABIN

	The escape hatch is now open. Taylor darts over to the ladder and
 	passes a folded life raft up to Dodge. When Landon reaches the ladder,
 	Taylor hands him two neatly packed rucksacks, and Landon climbs 
	through the escape hatch. Taylor is about to follow with a third
 	rucksack, then turns and crosses the cabin for a last look at:

30	THE TWO CLOCKS - FROM TAYLOR'S P.O.V.

	Both clocks have stopped: the red needle of the clock labeled SELF 
	TIME rests on the numeral 18; the red needle of the clock marked 
	EARTH TIME rests on the numeral 3975.

31	EXT. TOP OF SPACECRAFT - MED. SHOT

	Dodge inflates the raft with a cartridge of compressed air and 
	tosses it into the water. He and Landon jump into the water and 
	climb onto the raft as Taylor emerges from the hatch, Taylor slips 
	into the water and climbs onto the raft. He and Landon begin to 
	paddle toward shore, while Dodge immediately opens another kit and 
	takes a sample of the water.	

32	CLOSE ON THE MEN IN THE RAFT

				DODGE
				(half to himself) 
			Briny...twenty-five percent salinity. 
			Near the saturation point.

				LANDON
				(looking back)
			She's still sinking...

33	THE SPACESHIP - FROM THEIR P.O.V.

	Only the radio antenna and the tip of the tail fin remain visible.

				LANDON'S VOICE 
				(o.s.)
			Going ... going...

 	The craft vanishes beneath the water.

34	CLOSE ON THE MEN IN THE RAFT

	Dodge is still busy with his kit. Landon is still looking back, but 
	Taylor doesn't bother to turn his head.

				LANDON 
			Gone.

				TAYLOR
				(flatly)
			We're here to stay.

35	ANOTHER ANGLE - MOVING WITH THE RAFT

	They gaze at the forbidding sandstone battlements as they near the
 	shore.

				LANDON  
			Well? Where are we? Have any notion, 
			skipper?

				TAYLOR 
				(confidently) 
			We're some three hundred and twenty 
			light years from Earth. On an unnamed 
			planet in orbit around a star in the 
			constellation of Orion. 
				(looks off at 
				the "sun") 
			That could be Bellatrix.

36	THE SUN - FROM THEIR P.O.V.

	Low on the horizon, seen through a dense envelope of dust particles.

				DODGE'S VOICE
				(o.s.)
			Too red for Bellatrix.

37	BACK TO ASTRONAUTS IN RAFT

	Landon glances skeptically at Taylor.

				LANDON 
			You didn't have time to check the 
			tapes, so you don't really know, 
			do you?
				(as Taylor ignores
				him) 
			What went wrong?
				(sardonically)
			We weren't programmed to land
			in water.

				DODGE 
				(grinning) 
			The question, Landon, is not so much 
			where we are as when we are.

				TAYLOR 
			(stands up in raft) 
			We've had a nice snooze. Let's start 
			earning all our back pay.

38	WIDER ANGLE - THE BEACH

	As the three astronauts step out into shallow water and pull the 
	raft ashore.

				TAYLOR 
			Take your soil test, Dodge. I'll 
			check the equipment.

	Dodge moves inland about ten yards, removes a small hand drill 
	from his belt, extends the rod of the drill three feet and begins 
	to take some subsoil samplings. Taylor begins to examine the contents
	of the three rucksacks. Landon sits down on the beach., hands around 
	his knees, gazing moodily at the sunken spaceship. During this and 
	succeeding scenes we sense that Dodge's obsession with scientific 
	inquiry leaves him immune to fear: Landon is possibly more courageous 
	and certainly more "human," for he has many fears to control: while 
	Taylor -- detached, cool and misanthropic -- is something of an enigma.

				TAYLOR 
				(calls Dodge) 
			Got your sensors?

				DODGE 
			Yo!

				TAYLOR 
			Geiger counter?

				DODGE 
			Yo!

				TAYLOR
				(taking inventory) 
			One pistol... twenty-four rounds of 
			ammo. two medical kits.. one camera... 
			one TX9.
				(loudly to the
				others) 
			We've enough food and water for three 
			days.

				DODGE
			But how long is a day?

				TAYLOR 
			Good question.
				(turning) 
			Landon -- check your communications 
			kit.

39	ANOTHER ANGLE - FAVORING LANDON

	He seems not to have heard.

				TAYLOR
				(sharply)
			Landon! Join the expedition.

				LANDON
				(rising)
			Sorry... 
				(crossing to his kit)
			I was thinking of Stewart. What
			d'you suppose happened?

				TAYLOR
				(flatly)
			Air leak. Died in her sleep.

				LANDON 
			You don't seem very cut up about 
			it.

				TAYLOR 
			It's a little late for a wake. She's 
			been dead nearly a year.

				LANDON 
			Then we've been away from Earth for 
			eighteen months.

				TAYLOR 
			By our time.
				(smiling at Landon)
			You've turned gray.

	Landon involuntarily touches the gray hair of his temple as Taylor 
	adds lightly:

				TAYLOR 
			Apart from that, you look pretty chipper 
			for a man who's two thousand and thirty 
			one years old.
				(casually) 
			I read the clocks. They bear out Hasslein's 
			hypothesis. We've been away from Earth for 
			two thousand years, give or take a decade.
				(pause) 
			Still can't accept it, huh?

				LANDON
				long pause) 
			You know it.

				TAYLOR 
			Because time has wiped out everyone and 
			everything you cared for -- they're dust.

				LANDON 
			Prove it. If we can't get back, it's still 
			just a theory.

				TAYLOR
			It's a fact, Landon. Buy it. You'll sleep 
			better.

	Dodge enters scene. A handful of reddish sand dribbles through his 
	fingers.

				DODGE 
			Nothing will grow here .... there's just a 
			trace of hydrocarbons, and most of the 
			nitrogen is locked into nitrates.

				TAYLOR
			Any sign of dangerous ionization?

				DODGE
			No.

				TAYLOR 
				(rising) 
			Okay. If there's no life here, we've got 
			just seventy-two hours to find it. That's 
			when the groceries run out.

	He picks up one of the rucksacks and puts it on. The others follow 
	suit.

				DODGE
			Which direction?

				TAYLOR
				(decisively, pointing
				west) 
			That way.

				DODGE
			Any particular reason?

				TAYLOR 
			None at all.

	He moves out. Dodge follows. CAMERA PANS with them. They have gone 
	only a few paces when Taylor looks back over his shoulder and halts.

40	REVERSE ANGLE - FEATURING LANDON

	Landon is squatting in the sand, sticking something into the soil. 
	It is a small American flag, the size of a handkerchief.

41	REVERSE  ANGLE - FEATURING TAYLOR AND DODGE

	Mirth bubbles up in Taylor's throat. He explodes with wild laughter. 
	He is still laughing as they move out.

59	ANOTHER PART OF THE CANYON (OCHRE DUNES AREA) - GROUP
	SHOT - DAY

	Several huge boulders are dislodged, and the three astronauts run.
	wildly to escape the falling rocks. When the avalanche ends, they 
	sprawl on the lifeless sands, breathing heavily and drenched with
 	sweat, surrounded by enormous boulders. Taylor looks about him.

				TAYLOR
			Everybody all right?

	Murmurs of assent from Dodge and Landon. Taylor rummages through a
 	limp rucksack, comes up with some empty food cartons,rummages again,
 	coming up with a cigar butt.

				TAYLOR 
			Water check.    

	Dodge takes a plastic canteen from another rucksack and inspects it.

				DODGE 
			Eight ounces.

	Dodge lies back and looks up at the sky.

				DODGE 
			It doesn't add up. There's a mantle of 
			dust around this planet and yet it's 
			as humid as a jungle. Thunder and 
			lightning and yet no rain. Cloud cover 
			every night and that strange luminosity, 
			and yet no moon.

	Landon also looks up at the sky.

				LANDON
			If only we could get a fix.

				TAYLOR 
				(needling him) 
			What would you learn? I've told you 
			where you are and when you are.

				DODGE 
				(gently) 
			Taylor -- quit riding him.

				TAYLOR 
				(harshly, to Landon) 
			You're more than three hundred light 
			years from your precious planet. Your 
			loved ones have been dead and forgotten 
			for twenty centuries. Even if you could 
			get back, they'd think you were 
			something that fell out of a tree.

				LANDON 
				(wearily)
			All right --

				TAYLOR 
			There's only one reality left. We're 
			here and it's now. You get ahold of that 
			and hang on tight, or you might as well 
			be dead.

				LANDON 
				(quietly) 
			I'm prepared to die.

	Taylor turns to Dodge, throws up his hands.

				TAYLOR 
			He's prepared to die! Doesn't that make 
			you misty? Chalk up another victory for 
			the human spirit!

	Dodge rises and moves off, o.s., either embarrassed by this colloquy
 	or unwilling to hear it again. Taylor, cigar clamped between his
 	teeth, spins toward Landon.

				TAYLOR 
			Straighten me out on something. Why did 
			you come along at all? You volunteered. 
			Why?
				(a beat; no answer) 
			I'll tell you. They nominated you for the 
			Big One and you couldn't turn it down. Not 
			without losing your All-American standing

				LANDON
				(hard) 
			Climb off me, will you!

				TAYLOR 
			And the glory, don't forget that. There's 
			a life-sized bronze statue of you somewhere. 
			It's probably turned green by now, and nobody 
			can read the name plate. But never let it be 
			said we forget our heroes.

				LANDON
			Taylor.	I'm telling you --

				TAYLOR
			Oh, and one last item. Immortality.
			You wanted to go on forever.
				(pause) 
			Well, you damn near made it. Except for 
			Dodge and me, you've lived longer than 
			anybody. And with Stewart dead, it looks 
			like we're the last of the strain. You got 
			what you wanted, kid. How does it taste?

	Silence.	Taylor lies down, spent of his venom, pillowing
	his head on a rucksack.

				LANDON
				(softly)
			Okay. You read me well enough.
			Why can't I read you?

				TAYLOR 
			Don't bother

				LANDON 
				(looking off) 
			Dodge ... he's not like me at all. But
 			he makes sense. Held walk naked into a 
			live volcano if he thought he could learn 
			something no other man knew. I understand 
			why  he's here. But you...You're no seeker. 
			You're negative.

				TAYLOR
			But I'm not prepared to die.

				LANDON 
				(heatedly) 
			I'd like to know why not. You thought 
			life on Earth was meaningless. You despised 
			people. So what did you do? You ran away.

	Taylor's eyes are closed. He is silent for a moment. When he speaks,
 	his tone is soft, reflective.

				TAYLOR 
			No, not quite, Landon. I'm a bit of a 
			seeker myself. But my dreams are a lot 
			emptier than yours. 
				(pause) 
			I can't get rid of the idea that somewhere 
			in the Universe there must be a creature 
			superior to man.

67	EXT. A DRY WASH - CLOSE GROUP SHOT - DAY

	Blooming tamarisks border a. dry stream bed. Taylor and Landon hover 
	over Dodge, who is probing the soil with his drill. Their dungarees and 
	faces are caked with dust.

				DODGE
			It's a stream bed., no doubt about

	Landon strightens up and looks off, startled by something he sees.

				LANDON 
			Look. . .

68	LONG SHOT - A CLIFF BEYOND THE TAMARISKS

	with the astronauts in f.g. In the distance, on the skyline, we can 
 	make out a long row of wooden crosses. Some animal or vegetable matter 
	appears to be tied to the crosses.

				LANDON 
			Scarecrows?

				TAYLOR 
			Let's take a look.

	Taylor plunges into the thicket of tamarisks, followed by Dodge and 
	Landon. Their view of the cliff is momentarily obscured. CAMERA HOLDS 
	on the distant crosses. For an instant only, three "creatures" again 
	appear on the skyline near the crosses. Then they vanish.

69	REVERSE ANGLE - THE ASTRONAUTS

	as they emerge from the tamarisk thicket-nearer to the base of the-
	cliff. They halt and look up at:

70	THE CROSSES - ANGLING UP - FROM ASTRONAUT'S P.O.V.

	We can now see the pelts of unrecognizable animals have been bound to 
	the crosses and, thus mounted in a long row, seem to make a boundary
	or serve as a warning. The living bipeds are no longer visible.

71	BACK TO THE ASTRONAUTS

				DODGE 
			It's loaded with minerals, but safe.

	Without further ado Landon ducks his face into the pool. Dodge scoops
	up water in his hands and drinks. Taylor	follows suit.

				LANDON
				(coming up for air) 
			Can we take a dip?

				TAYLOR
				(looks around)
			Okay.

84	GROUP SHOT - THE THREE ASTRONAUTS

	Taylor rises and walks slowly toward the underbrush, scanning the 
	ground for other sports.

								CUT TO:

85	THE OTHER SIDE OF THE POOL - FULL PANNING SHOT

	Our view of the astronauts beyond the cascade in b.g. is partially 
	obscured by broad-leafed foliage directly in front of CAMERA, which 
	PANS SLOWLY away from the waterfall and HOLDS on the astronauts' 
	clothing at the edge of the pool. Suddenly and inexplicably a pair of 
	dungarees slithers away into the underbrush. A few seconds pass. Now a 
	pair of bronzed and brawny shoulders fill the SCREEN, blocking our 
	view.

86	REVERSE ANGLE - CLOSE ON A HUMAN FACE IN HEAVY FOLIAGE

	Or is it human? The hair is matted, the face bearded, the jaw 
	prognathous, the orbital rim prominent.

87	ANOTHER ANGLE - AT EDGE OF POOL

	A brown thick-fingered hand appears from behind heavy foliage and 
	plucks at a boot. The boot vanishes.

88	BACK TO THE ASTRONAUTS - ON OTHER SIDE OF POOL

	Dodge is standing near Taylor and looking back at the spot where they 
	left their clothing. Suddenly he seizes Taylor's arm and points 
	silently at the far bank of the pool. 

89	WHAT THEY SEE:

	Another pair of dungarees slithers into the underbrush and disappears.

90	REVERSE ANGLE - FULL PANNING SHOT - THE ASTRONAUTS

	Led by Taylor, they dive back into the pool and swim to the other bank. 
	Emerging from the water, they look around in bewilderment. Taylor makes 
	hand signals to indicate absolute silence and a reconnaissance. The 
	three astronauts fan out and move cautiously into the jungle (or rain 
	forest).

91-
93	EXT. - JUNGLE (OR RAIN FOREST) - SEVERAL SHOTS - MOVING WITH THE 
	ASTRONAUT'S

	Little sunlight penetrates this dense vegetation. These SHOTS are 
	INTERCUT with:

94	WHAT THE ASTRONAUTS SEE:

	fleeting forms as yet unidentified; trembling foliage; brown shadows 
	against a green backdrop.

95	EXT. A SMALL CLEARING - FAVORING THE THREE ASTRONAUTS

	who stop at the edge of the clearing, startled by

96	WHAT THEY SEE:

	a number of primitive bipeds, male and female, scarcely visible behind 
	trees and bushes on the other side of the clearing -- here a face, 
	there a portion of a head and torso. Throughout this sequence, the   
	primitives are never seen clearly or at close range.

97	BACK TO THE AST40IONAUTS

	reacting. They speak in whispers.
	
				LANDON
			My God..they look almost human.

				DODGE 
			They -- there's a herd of them.

				TAYLOR
			Show them we're friendly.

	CAMERA PULLS BACK as Taylor advances a few steps into the clearing, 
	extending his empty hands and beaming like a politician.

				TAYLOR 
				(warmly)
			Greetings!

98	REVERSE - THE STRANGE CREATURES - FROM TAYLOR'S P.O.V.

	There are perhaps a dozen of them. They shrink back as Taylor advances 
	-- hostile, frightened or both. We now see that some of them are 
	clutching articles of the astronauts' clothing and equipment. Taylor 
	stops, stares at them glumly.

				TAYLOR
			No cigar.

				LANDON
			Try telling them our names.

	Taylor grimaces at Landon.

				TAYLOR
			Well, if we're looking for an icebreaker...
				(turning to the creatures)
			Listen, folks .....

	More shrinking back by the frightened primitives.

				DODGE 
				(softly) 
			I'm afraid they aren't having any.

	A pistol goes off with a deafening crash, and the primitive creatures 
	scatter in panicky flight. After a while, quiet returns to the jungle.

106	EXT. A JUNGLE PATH - THE ASTRONAUTS

	They examine the remnants of their clothing and equipment and start to
	don whatever is able to be worn. Taylor puts on what remains of a 
	ripped pair of trousers; Dodge starts to improvise from the remnants of 
	the kit (it is a torn shelter half). Landon, like Taylor, has the 
	remains of his pants.

				DODGE 
			They didn't leave much did they?

				LANDON 
			Shall we follow them?

				TAYLOR 
			Haven't much choice.

	As they walk off down the jungle path.

107	EXT. A GROVE OF FRUIT TREES - ESTABLISHING SHOT - DAY

	This need not be a cultivated grove. A few trees (peach or apricot or 
	avocado, it matters not) grow wild in a pleasant glade. Nor is the 
	grove extensive. The three astronauts sit under a tree in f.g.; the 
	primitives sit under a clump, of trees some fifty yards away. Each camp 
	is feeding and warily watching the other. In the distance beyond the 
	fruit trees is an open grassy plain or cultivated field.

108	THE PRIMITIVES - FROM LANDON'S P.O.V.

	They too are sitting under trees, munching fruit. There are no more 
	than a dozen altogether.

109	BACK TO ASTRONAUTS - CLOSE GROUP SHOT

				TAYLOR
			Well, at least they haven't
			tried to bite us.

				DODGE
			Blessed are the vegetarians.

110	THE OTHER CAMP - FEATURING A YOUNG WOMAN

	Squatting on her haunches, eating fruit, gazing back at Taylor. Her 
	hair is long and black, her skin nut brown, her face hauntingly lovely 
	and hauntingly stupid. This is NOVA.

111	BACK TO ASTRONAUTS

	Landon looks o.s. at the primitives.

				LANDON
			We got off at the wrong stop.

				TAYLOR
			You're our optimist Look at the bright 
			side. If that's the best there is 
			around here, in six months we'll be 
			running this planet.

				DODGE
				(suddenly)
			Look...

112	THE PRIMITIVES - THEIR P.O.V.

	They appear to be agitated although neither we nor the astronauts 
	have yet heard or seen any cause for alarm. The primitives get to 
	their feet, sniffing, listening

113	CLOSE GROUP SHOT - THE ASTRONAUTS

	Puzzled and alarmed by the primitives' behavior, they too get to 
	their feet.

				LANDON
			Think they'll attack us?

	Taylor turns, looks back at:

114	THE DISTANT JUNGLE (OR FOREST)

	From which they recently emerged. There is no sign of life.

115	LONG PANNING SHOT - THE PRIMITIVES

	They suddenly run laterally across the grove, heading  back toward
	their jungle. A rumble becomes audible	it is the SOUND of HOOFBEATS.

116	VERY LONG SHOT - THE JUNGLE (OR FOREST)

	Twelve "horsemen" suddenly emerge from the trees, riding abreast at a 
	canter, like a squadron of cavalry about to charge. The horses look 
	huge. So do the riders, but at this distance we cannot identify them.

117	LONG PANNING SHOT - THE PRIMITIVES

	Cut off from their natural habitat, they reverse direction and flee 
	toward the tall grasses of the savanna (or cultivated field).

118	LONG SHOT - THE RIDERS

	With an exultant battle cry they break into a gallop. The hunt is on.

119	CLOSE GROUP SHOT - THE THREE ASTRONAUTS

	Stupefied, frozen in place.

120 	LONG SHOT - THE RIDERS

	Coming closer. We HEAR a rifle shot, then a flurry of shots.

121	MED. SHOT.

	A bullet spanks into the fruit trees above their heads. They run, 
	CAMERA PANNING with them as they race toward the tall grass in deep 
	b.g.

	As the "horsemen" close in on the creatures fleeing on foot.

125	MED. CLOSE SHOT - A RIDER

	He reins in, raises his rifle and fires. For the first time, we se that 
	he is a GORILLA. He wears a simple quasi-military uniform -- tunic, 
	trousers and boots.

126	FLASH SHOT - DODGE

	Running through the high grass. He is shot in the back and falls.

127	FLASH SHOT - TAYLOR

	He drops at the side of his fallen comrade.

129	WIDER ANGLE SHOT - THE SAVANNA - FEATURING A LINE OF BEATERS

	The beaters are all GORILLAS. They carry long sticks and nets, and 
	their task is to flush out the terrified primitives cowering in the 
	tall grass.

130-	A SERIES OF SHOTS - THE HUNTERS AND THE HUNTED:

	(c)	Landon lies unconscious on the grassy plain, an ugly gash 
		on his forehead.
	
	(d)	Taylor crawls through the tall grass on his hands and knees. 
		A rider crosses his path without seeing him.
	
	(e)	The beaters close in on Taylor, blocking his escape route.
	
	(f)	Taylor changes direction and decides to run for it.

136	EXT, SAVANNA - PANNING WITH TAYLOR

	Bent low, he flees through the tall grass. A SHOT rings out. Taylor 
	falls.

137	CLOSE ON TAYLOR

	Lying on his back. His fingers go to his throat. Blood appears between 
	his fingers. He opens his mouth in pain, but no sound comes forth, as 
	Taylor sinks into unconsciousness.

								DISSOLVE TO:

138	EXT. GROVE - FULL SHOT - THE HUNTERS - DAY

	The hunting party has reassembled here beneath the fruit trees. Some of 
	the gorillas have dismounted; others are still on horseback. In the 
	middle distance is a crude horse-drawn wagon. The sides and top of the 
	wagon form a wire cage. Three captive males and one female are visible 
	within the cage. Dodge and Landon are nowhere to be seen. Two gorilla 
	porters enter scene, dragging a male human corpse by the ankles, as two 
	other bearers enter scene with a living burden on a long carrying pole. 
	Taylor dangles from the pole, held aloft by the bonds around his wrists 
	and ankles. CAMERA PANS with the two gorillas as they dump Taylor into 
	the wagon and close the tail gate.

141	CLOSE ON TAYLOR - WITHIN WAGON CAGE

	His throat is smeared with blood. His eyelids flutter as he regains 
	consciousness.

142	CLOSE SHOT - WHAT TAYLOR SEES:

	Three primitive males bound hand and foot. They seem docile in
 	captivity. The female, Nova, clasps bound wrists around her bound 
	ankles and gazes blankly at Taylor. There is a JOLT of MOVEMENT as the
 	wagon gets underway

143	CLOSE ON TAYLOR

	With a great effort he raises himself on one elbow and looks out from 
	the cage.

144	TRUCKING WITH THE WAGON - WHAT TAYLOR SEES:

	A gorilla hunter stands over a dead man, one foot planted he chest of 
	his kill and his rifle butt resting on the on   abdomen. Facing him is 
	another gorilla with an old-fashioned camera on a tripod.

				APE PHOTOGRAPHER

	The hunter bares his teeth.

145 	CLOSE ON TAYLOR

	He faints.

								FADE IN

146	INT. A SURGERY - ANGLING DOWN ON TWO OPERATING TABLES NIGHT

	The surgery is dimly-lit. (If possible we should be unaware of the 
	source of illumination.) Taylor lies strapped to the nearer table. He 
	appears to be unconscious. The young female captive, Nova, is strapped 
	to the table beside him. She is conscious. Taylor is receiving a direct 
	blood transfusion from her.

	Hovering over Taylor are a NURSE and a surgeon named GALEN. Both are 
	chimpanzees. Galen wears a bloody surgical apron, the nurse a white 
	smock. Galen is removing a filthy bandage from Taylor's neck. A door 
	behind them opens and DR. ZIRA, an animal psychologist,	enters. She, 
	too, is a chimpanzee and wears a smock like the nurse's.

				ZIRA 
			Which one was wearing the strange 
			clothes?

				GALEN
			Him.

	Zira looks down at Taylor.

				ZIRA
			Will he live?

				GALEN 
				(irritably) 
			I don't know. This beast lost a lot 
			of blood.

	Galen paws through a tray of surgical instruments. The equipment is 	
	obsolescent and the room untidy -- like that of a callous small-town 
	veterinarian.

				GALEN
				(to Nurse )
			There's no probe here. Find one!

				NURSE
			Yes, sir.

	She exits. Zira runs a forefinger across a dusty table.Her voice is 
	soft and well-modulated.

				ZIRA
			This place is dirty, doctor.

				GALEN 
				(defensively) 
			These animals are dirty, doctor. They 
			stink, and they carry communicable 
			diseases. Why aren't they cleaned up 
			before they're brought here?

147	CLOSE TWO SHOT - TAYLOR AND NOVA

	His eyes come open. Over this we hear:

				ZIRA'S VOICE 
				(o.s.) 
			You don't sound happy in your work.

				GALEN'S VOICE 
				(o.s.) 
			I'm nothing more than a vet in this 
			laboratory...

	Taylor feebly turns his head and looks at Nova. She returns his gaze 
	with an unchanged empty stare. We sense that Taylor realizes her blood 
	is flowing into his veins. Over this we hear:

				GALEN'S VOICE 
				(o.s.) 
			You promised to speak to Dr. Zaius 
			about me.

				ZIRA'S VOICE 
				(o.s.) 
			I did. But you know how he looks down 
			his nose at chimpanzees.

	Taylor rolls his eyes toward the apes. Weak as he is,we see his 
	astonishment at hearing them talk.

148	BACK TO GROUP AROUND OPERATING TABLE

	as the Nurse reenters with a probe and hands it to Dr. Galen, who 
	protests to Zira:

				GALEN 
			But the quota system's been abolished! 
			You made it. Why can't I?

 				ZIRA
			What do you mean, made it? I'm an 
			animal psychologist, that's all. We 
			don't have any authority.

				GALEN 
			You do pretty well when it comes to 
			getting space and equipment.

				ZIRA 
			That's because Dr. Zaius realizes our 
			work has value.

				GALEN
			Hmph.

				ZIRA 
			The foundations of scientific brain 
			surgery are being laid right here - 
			in studies of cerebral function in 
			these animals.

				GALEN 
			They're still dirty. And their bite is 
			septic. Look at that ...

	He shows Zira infected teeth marks on the back of his left hand.

				GALEN 
				(to Nurse) 
			Hold his head.

	The Nurse complies, gripping Taylor's skull with both hands. Galen 
	leans down and begins to probe the throat wound. Taylor passes out.

149	INT. A ROW OF CAGES - ANIMAL LABORATORY - TRACKING SHOT DAY

	The cages are no larger than small jail cells. There are four of them. 
	Bars, not walls, divide the cages, so that all four are visible. Each 
	of the first three cages is occupied by a primitive male. At the moment 
	the first two are quiet -- dozing or scratching apathetically. The 
	third occupant is stolidly regarding a half-dozen brightly colored 
	hollow wooden boxes, or blocks, Of varying sizes and proportions on the 
	floor of his cage. He is trying to stack the boxes in such a way as to 
	reach a banana dangling from a cord twelve feet overhead. He has 
	correctly selected the first two large, sturdy blocks for his tower 
	under the banana -- but the tall third block is too unstable on its 
	small base to support the broad-based fourth block.

149-A	CLOSE - TAYLOR

	Taylor, Looking much stronger, sits on a pile of dirty straw in the 
	fourth cage. There is a clean bandage around his throat. He watches the 
	block-building primitive with contemptous amusement.

	Both the third and fourth blocks tumble to the floor when the primitive 
	tries to mount his tower. He stands there, staring dully at the 
	scattered blocks, then up at the unattainable banana.

149-B	MED. - THE	LABORATORY
	
	A door at the end of the aisle opens and a gorilla named JULIUS enters, 
	dressed in a keeper's uniform. He quickly closes the door, snatches up 
	a broom, starts sweeping. Julius is obviously late for work. Taylor 
	struggles to his feet, moves to the bars of the cage, tries to call 
	out.

				TAYLOR 
				(soundlessly) 
			Hey! Hey!

	The three other primitives move toward the bars of their cages. Julius 
	barks at them.

				JULIUS
			Simmer down!
				(points at Taylor) 
			You especially.

	The third primitive goes back to stacking his blocks. Julius comes up 
	to Taylor's cage, indicates a like set of blocks strewn across its 
	floor, extends his broom handle to whack the banana overhead.

				JULIUS 
			Better give it a try, stupid. Unless 
			you like going hungry.

	He returns to his sweeping. Taylor glowers at him. A moment later, the 
	door at the end of the aisle opens and Dr. Zira enters.

				JULIUS
			Good morning, Dr. Zira.

				ZIRA 
			Good morning, Julius. How's our patient 
			today?

				JULIUS 
			No change. The minute you open the door, 
			he goes into his act.

	She starts down the aisle toward Taylor's cage. He grasps the bars, 
	awaiting her anxiously. As she passes the second cage, the primitive in 
	it shakes the bars, jumps up and down. His tongue is hanging out. Zira 
	smiles, stops, digs into the pocket of her smock.

				ZIRA 
				(playfully) 
			Well, what do we want this morning? Do 
			we want something? Speak! Come on, speak!

	The primitive continues to jump up and down energetically. Zira takes a 
	cube of sugar from her pocket, holds it up for his inspection.

				ZIRA
			Do we want some sugar, old-timer?

	The man eagerly sticks his hand through the bars. She drops the cube in 
	his hands. He jams it into his mouth.

				JULIUS 
				(concerned) 
			You could get hurt doing that, Doctor.

				ZIRA
			Don't be silly. He's perfectly tame.

	She moves toward Taylor's cage, Julius behind her.

				JULIUS 
			They're all tame until they take a 
			chunk out of you.

150	CLOSE SHOT - FEATURING TAYLOR - ZIRA AND JULIUS

	Taylor starts to open his mouth as Zira comes up to the bars.

				ZIRA
			Well, Bright Eyes, is our throat
			feeling better?

				TAYLOR
				(frantic mouthing)
			Listen, listen -- I can speak --

	He winces, puts his hand to the bandage.

				ZIRA
				(sympathetically)
			Awww, it still hurts, doesn't it?

				JULIUS 
			See? He keeps pretending he can 
			talk.

	Taylor glares at Julius, slams the bars.

				TAYLOR
				(mouthing)
			I'm not pretending! I can talk!

	Zira hurriedly takes a pen and notebook from the breast Docket of her 
	smock, starts to scribble.

				ZIRA
				(excitedly)
			Did you see that? It's remarkable!

				JULIUS
			Huh?

				ZIRA
			He's trying to form words.

				JULIUS
			Well, you know what they say.
			Human see, human do.

	Taylor is staring in silent fascination at the open and notebook.He 
	stops mouthing, points at them.

				JULIUS
			Now what?

	Taylor gestures for Zira to come closer to the bars.

				ZIRA
			He seems to want something.

	She advances tentatively toward the cage.

				JULIUS
			I'd be careful, doctor.

	Taylor suddenly reaches through the bars, tries to snatch the pen and 
	notebook from Zira. Julius instantly jabs his broom handle through the 
	bars, hitting Taylor in the ribs.

				JULIUS 
			What did I tell you! 
				(to Taylor) 
			Try that again, I'll break your arm!

	Zira draws back, looking at Taylor in surprise.

151	CLOSER - TAYLOR

	His face is twisted in frustration.

				TAYLOR
				(mouthing)
			What's the matter with you? I can
			talk! Can't you see that?

	Over this a door is heard opening o.s., and Julius' voice, nervous, 
	deferential:

161	BOOM SHOT - THE THREE APES - FROM TAYLOR'S P.O.V.

	Julius and Zira cross to a stout, imposing orangutan who has just 
	entered the laboratory. Julius bows to him. This is DR. ZAIUS. Like the 
	other apes, he wears a simple tunic and trousers, but his garments are 
	of a Costlier material, and several decorations are woven into the sash 
	of his tunic.

				ZIRA 
				(bubbling) 
			Dr. Zaius, I'm so glad you could come. 
			He's over here.

	Zaius crosses with them to Taylor's cage. Beneath his austere manner, 
	we sense tension, worry. Zira looks up at Taylor, her tone an appeal.

				ZIRA
			Bright Eyes, show him! Go ahead!
			Do your trick!

	Taylor just glares at her.

				ZIRA
			Speak! Go on.	Speak again.

				TAYLOR
				(silent mouthing) 
			My - name - isn't - Bright Eyes It's 
			Taylor!

				ZIRA 
			There! Can you believe it? I looks 
			like he's talking.

				ZAIUS 
				(evenly) 
			Yes, amusing. A man who acts like an ape.

	Taylor turns to Zaius.

				TAYLOR 
				(silent mouthing) 
			I'm not acting! I can talk! How much 
			proof do you want?

				ZIRA 
				(thunderstruck) 
			Dr. Zaius, I could have sworn he was 
			answering you!

				ZAIUS 
				(nodding, but unmoved) 
			He shows a definite gift for mimicry.

	Zira wiggles her fingers excitedly.

				ZIRA
			I wonder how held score on a Hopkins
			manual dexterity test?

	Zaius' voice is quiet, but there is steel in it.

				ZAIUS
			An animal?

				JULIUS
			Look!

	Taylor is frantically wiggling his fingers.

				ZIRA
			He's moving his fingers!

				ZAIUS
			Of course. He saw you moving yours.

				ZIRA
			But perhaps he understood --

161-A	CLOSE - TAYLOR 

	He is pleading silently as Zaius' voice is heard over the SHOT.

				ZAIUS' VOICE 
				(o.s., hard) 
			Man has no understanding, Dr. Zira. 
			He can be taught a few simple tricks. 
			Nothing more.

				ZIRA'S VOICE
				(o.s.)
			I beg to disagree. According to my exper-
			iments --

161-B	CLOSE - ZAIUS

	A warning burns out of his eyes as he stares at Taylor.

				ZAIUS 
			A word to the wise, Dr. Zira. Experimental 
			brain surgery on these creatures is one 
			thing. I'm all for it.

161-C	CLOSER - TAYLOR

	Fear clouds his eyes. Abruptly, he stops moving his lips.

161-D	MED. THE GROUP

	Zaius sees the effect his words have had on Taylor. He turns to Zira, 
	goes on in a more detached tone.

				ZAIUS 
	But your behavioral studies are another matter entirely. To suggest 
	that we can learn something about simian nature from a study of man is 
	nonsense. Besides, men are a nuisance. They outgrow their own food 
	supply in the forest and migrate to our green belts and ravage our 
	crops. 
				(looking casually 
				at Taylor) 
	The sooner they're exterminated, the better.

	He turns toward the door. A disappointed Zira follows him. Zaius looks 
	back at Taylor just before going out.

				ZAIUS
			It's a question of simian survival.

161-E	CLOSE - TAYLOR

	He stares after Zaius, than looks away, slumps to the floor. A pause, 
	then a VOICE is heard.

				APE GUARD
			Is this the one you wanted, Doctor?

				ZIRA'S VOICE 
				(o.s.)
			Yes, thank you.
				(pause, her voice 
				much closer) 
			Bright Eyes?

	Taylor looks up.

				ZIRA'S VOICE 
				(o.s.)
			I've got a present for you.

161-F	ANOTHER ANGLE - THE CAGE

	Standing outside the cage, held on a leash by an APE GUARD  is Nova. 
	She looks at Taylor without expression. Zira gestures at JULIUS.

				ZIRA
			Put her in with him.

	Julius unlocks the cage door-, leads Nova inside, removes her leash and 
	collar. Taylor has gotten to his feet. Julius goes out, locking the 
	door behind him. Nova hesitates, then slowly reaches out, takes 
	Taylor's hand. Zira beams at them.

	It is nothing elaborate, A wire fence encloses a dirt yard. This 
	compound is situated on the outskirts of Apetown and the town is 
	visible in the distance.

	There are about a dozen adult human captives within the enclosure, no 
	more than a third of them females. Some of them trudge around the dusty 
	yard like convicts in a penitentiary. Others squat against the sun-
	drenched wall.

	A big male suddenly runs to the fence and tries to climb it. Several 
	guides, armed with whips and torches, immediately close in on him. The 
	primitive recoils in fear from a fiery torch and rejoins the captives' 
	circle.

171	CLOSER ANGLE - THE YARD - FEATURING TAYLOR

	He plods sullenly back and forth across the rear of the yard, 
	occasionally glancing off toward the approaches to the compound. Nova 
	is at his heels. He ignores her. Once again he looks off, stops 
	suddenly. Nova bumps into him. He turns, impatiently shoos her away, 
	then looks o.s., again.

172	ZIRA AND COMPANION - TAYLOR'S P.O.V.

	Zira can be seen approaching with a young chimpanzee, DR. CORNELIUS. He 
	wears a simple smock over his tunic and trousers. Cornelius glances 
	surreptitiously around, covertly takes Zira's hand.

				CORNELIUS
			Do you have to work tonight?

				ZIRA 
			No.

				CORNELIUS 
			What's so special about him?

			Watch.
				(to Taylor)
			Hello, Bright Eyes. How's our

	Taylor stares at her impassively, then looks around to a that no guards 
	are watching, hunkers down, begins to scratch in the dust. Nova extends 
	unclean fingers to touch the bandage on his throat. Taylor flinches, 
	pushes her hand away. Nova touches a bluish bruise on the inside of her 
	own forearm, then searches for a similar bruise on Taylor's forearm.

				ZIRA 
				(excited)
			Look -- she remembers.

				CORNELIUS
			Remembers what?

				ZIRA
			The blood transfusion.

				CORNELIUS 
				(peeved)
			Zira, come on. You know they
			can't --
				(he stops, looking off)
			Oh oh. Here comes Number One.

	Taylor looks up and o.s., quickly rises.

175	ANOTHER ANGLE - THE YARD - FEATURING DR. ZAIUS

	Who is approaching the two scientists from deep b.g. Zaius is followed 
	by a huge and much decorated gorilla Whom we recognize as the Leader of 
	the Hunt Club.
	
				ZIRA
				(in a whisper, to
				Cornelius)
			Something's bothering him. He's
			been prying around the lab for the last 
			two days ...

				ZIRA  
				(as Zaius comes 
				nearer) 
			Good morning, Dr. Zaius. You know Dr. 
			Cornelius, my fiance.

	Cornelius bows respectfully. Zaius is patronizingly polite.

				ZAIUS
			Oh, yes -- the young ape with
			a shovel. I hear you're planning
			another archeological expedition.

A-175	MED. SHOT - TAYLOR

	He has stepped back from the marks he made in the-dust, is watching 
	Zaius with concern.

				CORNELIUS' VOICE 
				(o.s.)
			Yes, sir. If the academy agrees.

				ZAIUS' VOICE
				(o.s.) 
			The project will require my support, of 
			course.

176	MED. CLOSE SHOT - ANGLING DOWN ON TAYLOR AND NOVA

	A primitive male squats down to see what Taylor has marked on the 
	ground. In letters a foot high he has written:

			I CAN WRITE

	Nova, at once petulant and playful, erases the WRITE with a bare foot. 
	Taylor angrily flings her aside. This violence provokes the primitive 
	male, who snarls at Taylor and cuffs him. Over this we HEAR from a 
	distance:

				CORNELIUS' VOICE
				(o.s.)
			I hope I can count on it, sir.

				ZAIUS' VOICE
				(o.s)
			A friendly warning, Cornelius --
		 	when you're digging for artifacts,
			don't bury your reputation.

	Taylor slugs the snarling male, who wades in, trying to bite him.

				A VOICE
				(o.s.)
			Guards!

177	WIDER ANGLE - THE FIGHT

	Two gorilla guards rush in to break up the fight. One of them lashes 
	out with his whip. The other pokes his torch at Taylor. Its flame 
	brushes his arm. Taylor opens his mouth, gives a silent yell of pain, 
	shrinks back. Zira runs to the fence.

				ZIRA 
				(to guards) 
			Stop! You've hurt him! Take them inside!

	Prodding the malcreants with their torches, the two guards herd them 
	toward a doorway in the wall. Zira hurries around the side of the fence 
	and o.s.

178	MED. SHOT - ZAIUS, CORNELIUS, HUNT CLUB LEADER

				ZAIUS 
			Cornelius, if you have a moment today, I'd 
			like to discuss this expedition of yours 
			in more detail.

				CORNELIUS 
				(eagerly) 
			Certainly, sir. I'll get my notes and come 
			right over.

	He exits hurriedly. The Hunt Club Leader turns to Zaius.

				HUNT CLUB LEADER 
			I don't understand these animal psychologists. 
			What's Dr. Zira trying to prove? 

				ZAIUS
			That man can be domesticated.

	The hunter guffaws. Zaius turns away and looks down at:

179	THE DUST UNDERFOOT

	Just beyond the fence we can make out the letters:

			I CAN

	Zaius' extended foot appears beneath the bottom wire of the fence. The 
	foot wipes out the letters.

180	CLOSEUP - ZAIUS

	His face is a mask.

181	INT. TAYLOR'S CAGE - MED. SHOT - DAY

	He is slumped against the bars of the cell, gingerly touching a large, 
	reddening blotch on his arm. Julius watches him uncertainly from a few 
	yards away . In the b.g., the outside door opens and Zira rushes in, 
	hurries down the aisle.

				JULIUS 
			What happened?

				ZIRA 
			Those fools and their torches! Do you 
			have any ointment?

				JULIUS 
			I'll see.

	He moves to a cabinet at the other end of the laboratory, rummages 
	through some drawers.

182	MED. SHOT - ZIRA - FROM TAYLOR'S P.O.V.

	Zira comes up to Taylor's cage, studies him solicitously.

				ZIRA
			I'm sorry, Bright Eyes.

183	ANOTHER ANGLE - TO INCLUDE TAYLOR

	He looks steadily at Zira, who is only an arm's length away. CAMERA 
	MOVES IN on them. Suddenly Taylor reaches out, snatching the pen and 
	notebook from the pocket of her smock. Zira leaps back with a cry. 
	Julius grabs a club, races up to the cage, unlocks the door.

				JULIUS
			I told you what you'd get!

184	WIDER ANGLE - TO INCLUDE THEM ALL

	Taylor is scribbling furiously on a sheet of note paper. The guard 
	moves in, his club upraised.

				ZIRA
				(pleading)
			Julius, don't. It doesn't matter.

	Julius swings his-club at Taylor's head. Taylor lifts his right arm to 
	ward off the blow, and the stick strikes him sharply on the hand. He 
	drops the pen and notebook. The guard swings again, driving Taylor to 
	the wall. Then Julius retrieves the stolen articles.

185	ANOTHER ANGLE - FAVORING ZIRA

	The guard returns her pen and notebook with the comment:

				JULIUS 
			Natural born thieves, aren't they?

	Zira glances at the notebook. Her face clouds.

186	INSERT - WHAT SHE READS:

	A hasty, almost illegible scrawl:

		MY NAME IS TAYLOR.

187	CLOSEUP - ZIRA

	Her eyes afire with a wild surmise.

188	TWO SHOT - ZIRA AND JULIUS

	Her eyes never leave Taylor as she tells the guard:

				ZIRA 
			Get me a collar and leash. I'm 
			taking him to the infirmary.

				JULIUS 
			He's vicious, Doctor. Besides, it's 
			against the rules.

				ZIRA 
			Do as I say.

	The guard shrugs and moves Off 0.3. Zira beckons to Taylor. He comes 
	forward to the bars of the cage.

				ZIRA 
				(sotto voce) 
			You wouldn't hurt me, would 
			you... Taylor?

189	INT. DR. CORNELIUS' OFFICE - ESTABLISHING SHOT - DAY

	The office is simple, almost Spartan. There are books but no bric-a-
	brac; several painted portraits of Great Apes but no tape recorder or 
	other modern office equipment. Taylor sits at a desk, scribbling 
	furiously on a sheet of paper. His leash has been removed, but not his 
	collar. Zira stands at his elbow. Cornelius paces nervously up and 
	down, reading a sheaf of notes Taylor has already written.

				CORNELIUS
				(stubbornly)
			It's a stunt. Humans don't write.

				ZIRA
			Dear, you're a scientist. Don't
			you believe your own eyes?

				CORNELIUS
				(to Taylor)
			Where did you learn to do this?

190	ANOTHER ANGLE - THE OFFICE

	Taylor scribbles something on a small desk pad, rips off the page, 
	hands it to Cornelius.

				CORNELIUS 
			Jefferson Public School, Fort Wayne, 
			Indiana?

	He looks at Taylor narrowly. Taylor nods.

				CORNELIUS 
				(sardonically) 
			Back on that planet you say you came from? 
				(Taylor nods again) 
			Um-hm. 
				(to Zira) 
			He may be intelligent, but he's also mad.

	Taylor scribbles something else on the pad, hands it to Zira, points at 
	Cornelius.

				ZIRA
				(reads aloud)
			'And you're a fool'.

	She smiles. Cornelius bristles.

				CORNELIUS
			Now, just a minute --

				ZIRA
			Oh, Cornelius, be quiet.

	Taylor has resumed writing. He hands the sheet to Zira, who reads 
	aloud.

				ZIRA 
			'Dodge was killed in the hunt. What 
			happened to Landon?' 
				(looking at Taylor) 
			I don't know.

				CORNELIUS 
				(scornfully) 
			And they fell out of the sky with you?

	Taylor writes quickly, hands the note to Zira.

				ZIRA
				(reading)
			'Not fell -- flew!'

	Taylor impatiently begins to fold a sheet of paper.

				CORNELIUS
			Flight is a scientific impossibility.

				ZIRA
			And even if it weren't, why fly?
			Where would it get you?

	Taylor points to the floor and mouths the word "Here." He flings the 
	paper plane he has just fashioned into the air. It describes a graceful 
	arc around the room and lands at the feet of Cornelius, who slowly 
	picks it up, then exchanges a long glance with Zira.

				CORNELIUS
				(softly)
			Well, now...

	Taylor scribbles on a piece of paper, hands it to Zira.

				ZIRA
				(reading)
			'Do you have maps?'

	Cornelius puts the paper plane on his desk, crosses to a wall map 
	designed like a window shade. He pulls it down Taylor and Zira join him 
	at the map.

191	CLOSE ON MAP

	It's not a map of the whole planet, of course, but only of that portion 
	known to the apes. Therefore it has the antique and fragmentary aspect 
	of a map drawn by some Babylonian cartographer.

	A swatch of blue at the right margin indicates a sea. In the southwest 
	quadrant are the "greenbelts" of the ape civilization, looking on the 
	map like jade stones strung on crescent-shaped necklace. Rubyidots in 
	the lade indicate ape communities. The northwest quadrant, colored 
	brown, is apparently uninhabited. East of the green belts is a patch of 
	green savanna, and next to it the darker green of a jungle. The eastern 
	quadrants are rendered in yellow, and except for a blue lake, appear to 
	be lifeless desert and barren mountain. This area is marked FORBIDDEN 
	ZONE.

	Using a pointer, Cornelius orients Taylor, indicating a red dot in the 
	middle of the green belt.

				CORNELIUS
			We are here ...
				(moving pointer)
			You were captured about here.

	Taylor studies the map, then pointing at the lake in the eastern 
	desert, he goes into a brief charade, dramatizing the astronauts' 
	landing and trek.

				ZIRA 
				(interpreting his 
				movements) 
			You fell in the water here? ... you came 
			ashore ... you marched across the desert ... 
			the mountains ... many days and nights ... 
			and reached the jungle.

	Taylor nods, smiles gratefully.

				CORNELIUS
				(flatly)
			Out - of - the - question!.

	Taylor slams his fist against the wall in frustration.

				ZIRA 
				(annoyed) 
			Cornelius, why do you insist on 
			provoking him?

				CORNELIUS 
				(tapping map) 
		No creature can survive in that part of 
		the Forbidden Zone. I've been there. I've 
		seen it.

192	WIDER ANGLE - THE THREESOME

	Taylor strides to the desk, writes something, hands it to Zira.

				ZIRA
				(reading)
			'Then how do you account for me?,

				CORNELIUS 
			I don't. And I'm not going to try.

				ZIRA 
			But what about your theory? The existence 
			of someone like Taylor might prove it.

				CORNELIUS 
				(shushing her) 
			Zira, are you trying to get my head cut 
			off?

				ZIRA 
			Don't be foolish. If it's true, they'll 
			have to accept it.

				CORNELIUS 
			No, they won't -

	Taylor touches Zira on the arm, makes a gesture of inquiry.

				ZIRA 
			Cornelius has developed a brilliant 
			hypothesis -

				CORNELIUS
				(quickly)
			It's probably wrong --

				ZIRA 
			-- that the ape evolved from a lower order 
			of primate, possibly man. In his trip to 
			the Forbidden Zone he discovered traces of a 
			culture older than recorded time -

				CORNELIUS
			The evidence was very meager --

				ZIRA
			You didn't think so then.

				CORNELIUS 
			That was before Dr. Zaius and half the 
			Academy said the idea was heresy.

				ZIRA 
			How can scientific truth be heresy? What 
			if Taylor is exactly the proof you needed? 
			A mutation. A missing link between the 
			unevolved primate and the ape -

	Taylor bangs his fist on the desk, mouths the word "No!" scribbles 
	something on a piece of paper.

				CORNELIUS 
			He's touchy, isn't he?

	Taylor thrusts the sheet at Zira, who reads it aloud.

				ZIRA
			'I am not a missing link.'

				CORNELIUS 
			Because if he is a missing link, it means 
			the Sacred Scrolls aren't worth their 
			parchment.

				ZIRA 
			Well, maybe they're not.

				CORNELIUS
			No, thank you'. I won't get into
			that battle.

				ZIRA
			Oh, Cornelius, show some strength!

				CORNELIUS 
			Zira, listen to me. We've got a fine 
			future ahead of us. Marriage. Stimulating 
			careers. I'm up for a raise --

	At that moment 	there is a. loud RAP at the door o.s. All turn.

193	REVERSE ANGLE - TO INCLUDE THE DOOR

	Dr. Zaius enters with another portly figure, DR. MAXIMUS. Like Zaius., 
	Maximus is an orangutan.

				CORNELIUS
				(flustered)
			Dr. Zaius --

				ZAIUS
				(not unkindly) 	
			Did you forget our appointment, 
			Cornelius?

				CORNELIUS
			Oh., no., sir. I was just assembling 
			my notes.

				ZAIUS 
			You know Dr. Maximus, our Commissioner 
			for Animal Affairs?

				CORNELIUS 
			Certainly, sir. It's a pleasure to see 
			you again.

	He hurries to his desk, starts gathering papers. Maximus notes Taylor 
	with distaste.

				MAXIMUS
			What is that?

				ZIRA
			A man, Dr. Maximus.

				MAXIMUS 
			I know it's a man. And you know the 
			rules. No animals outside the compound, 
			and most certainly not without a leash.

194	ANOTHER ANGLE - THE OFFICE - FAVORING ZAIUS

	During the ensuing exchange, Zaius wanders idly through the office. He 
	glances at the scattered handwritten notes, but does not read them. 
	Meanwhile a rattled Zira replies to Maximus.

				ZIRA
			Yes, Sir. But this -- creature
			is a special case.

				MAXIMUS
			Why special?

				ZIRA 
			We're -- conducting a new experiment.

				ZAIUS 
			Wouldn't it more properly be done in 
			your office?

				ZIRA
			Yes, Sir.

				MAXIMUS 
				(calling)
			Guards?

	The gorilla GUARDS enter from outside.

				MAXIMUS
			Return this beast to the compound.

195	ANOTHER ANGLE - FAVORING TAYLOR

	He regards the apes with hostility as they cross to him. One picks up 
	his leash. Over THE SHOT we hear:

				ZAIUS' VOICE
				(o.s.) 
			What's this?

196	REVERSE ANGLE - FEATURING ZAIUS

	Zira stiffens, looking at Zaius. He is holding the paper plane
	fashioned by Taylor.

				ZIRA
			A toy. It floats on the air.
				(faint defiance)
			Try it.

				CORNELIUS
				(a warning)
			Zira....

	Zaius looks down at the paper plane in his hand, then back to Zira. He 
	smiles tolerantly.

				ZAIUS
			Nonsense.

	He crumples the paper plane into a b all., drops it on the desk. The 
	ape hooks the leash to Taylor's collar, starts leading him out. Zira 
	follows them.

								DISSOLVE TO:

197 	INT. CAGES - ANIMAL COMPOUND - FULL SHOT - DAY

	The caged primitives are asleep. Julius, the keeper, dozes in a chair 
	outside Taylor's cage. CAMERA PIVOTS MOVING IN ON Taylor, who is lying 
	on his side, also asleep. Nova is curled up behind him. At the sound of 
	a door opening, she comes instantly awake, sitting up and clutching 
	Taylor's arm. He comes groggily awake, raising his head in time to 
	hear:

				JULIUS' VOICE
				(o.s.)
			What's up, Lieutenant?

198	REVERSE ANGLE - WHAT TAYLOR SEES:

	TWO GORILLA OFFICERS have just entered the compound. They wear side 
	arms. Julius has just risen from his  chair.

				APE LIEUTENANT 
			We're taking Number Four over to surgery 
			in five minutes. Have him ready.

				JULIUS 
			How come? The beast's throat is nearly 
			healed.

				LIEUTENANT 
				(snickering) 
			It's not his throat this time. The vet's 
			going to geld him.

199	CLOSEUP - TAYLOR

	He stiffens but does not move. The apes, of course, speak freely in 
	front of him, believing the animal cannot understand.

				JULIUS' VOICE 
				(o.s.) 
			Dr. Zira won't like it. She wants this 
			pair to mate.

200	BACK TO THE APES - FROM TAYLOR'S P.O.V.

	As the Lieutenant replies:

				LIEUTENANT 
			These orders came from Dr. Zaius himself. 
			There's nothing she can do about it.

	The two gorillas exit. The guard crosses to a wall peg for a collar and 
	'Leash.

201	CLOSE TWO SHOT - TAYLOR AND NOVA

	Pushing Nova aside, Taylor rises.

202	MED. SHOT - THE CAGE

	As Julius unlocks the door and cautiously approaches Taylor, carrying 
	the collar and leash.

				JULIUS 
				(murmuring) 
			If only you knew, Bright Eyes, what 
			they're going to do ... 
				(raising collar) 
			Stand still now...don't give me any 
			trouble.

	The heel of Taylor's right palm crashes into the keeper's, chin, nearly 
	snapping his neck. Julius falls unconscious. Taylor leans over him, 
	taking his night stick and a set of keys on his belt.

203	REVERSE ANGLE - TO INCLUDE NOVA AND MALE IN ADJACENT CAGE

	The male has awakened. He stares stupidly at Taylor. Nova is 
	whimpering, little strange cries of fear. Taylor moves o.s.

204	ANOTHER ANGLE - PANNING WITH TAYLOR

	He leaves the cage, moves swiftly to the nearby door and exits.

205	INT. A DARK CORRIDOR - FULL SHOT - DAY

	Barefoot, Taylor silently pads down the corridor to a locked door.

206	CLOSE ON A DOOR

	Which is visible because of a beam of sunlight from the half-open door
 	of a guard room. We HEAR a murmur of ape voices and LAUGHTER. Taylor 
	fumbles with the keys, finds one that fits the lock and opens the door.

207	EXT. ANIMAL COMPOUND - MED. SHOT - TAYLOR - DAY

	He emerges, quietly locking the door behind him. Two tethered horses
	can be seen in deep b.g., and another gust of LAUGHTER can be heard 
	from the nearby guard room. Taylor looks off.

208	LONG SHOT - WHAT TAYLOR SEES:

	As already established, the animal compound is situated on the 
	outskirts of the apes' community. The strange skyline of the town can 
	be seen in the distance.

209	PANNING WITH TAYLOR

	He starts to cross an open field outside the compound. At that moment 
	we HEAR a shrill police WHISTLE from the guard room. Taylor breaks into 
	a run.

210	REVERSE ANGLE - THE COMPOUND

	As the two gorilla officers emerge from the building and run toward 
	their horses.

211	EXT. A DIRT ROAD - LONG SHOT - TAYLOR

	He runs down the road, starts across the long causeway that bisects a 
	small lake, looking over his shoulder.

								QUICK DISSOLVE TO:

212	EXT. APETOWN - LONG ESTABLISHING SHOT - DAY

	The community we sue at the end of the causeway is small and arcane. 
	There are no power lines, no street lamps -- indeed, no streets as 
	such, but only a small cluster of buildings around a pleasant mall. The 
	architecture of the buildings is faintly derivative of the simpler and 
	less rococo work of Antonio Gaudi -- columns and pillars of brick or
 	exterior masonry look like the trunks and branches of great trees and 
	suggest an arboreal past.

	A small number of apes are visible on the mall:

	Taylor darts behind the buttress of a building, casing the situation. 
	He looks back at:

213	EXT. LAKE AND CAUSEWAY - LONG SHOT - MORNING

	The two mounted gorilla-police can be seen on the causeway, galloping 
	straight toward CAMERA. It is evident they will soon spot Taylor.

214	BACK TO TAYLOR - CLOSE SHOT

	He retreats from the buttress to a dark archway and vanishes inside the 
	building.

215	INT. A DARK VESTIBULE - MOVING WITH TAYLOR

	The vestibule is nothing, no set required, a dark space through which 
	Taylor moves toward a shaft of light. We HEAR faintly the discordant 
	chords of an organ. Or is it an organ? At any rate,a strange and 
	melancholy tune. Taylor arrives at a font.

216	INT. A TEMPLE - PANNING WITH TAYLOR

	He appears out of darkness into half-light. The rear of the temple is 
	obscure. Taylor darts behind a screen. Crouching there, he observes:

217	A FUNERAL CEREMONY IN THE TEMPLE - MED. LONG SHOT

	The temple itself is small and austere. There is no altar, but against 
	a plain backdrop we see a statue of the Lawgiver, a Great Ape holding a 
	book. Below the Lawgiver is an ORANGUTAN MINISTER clothed in black 
	robes. He stands in front of a closed coffin. A dozen mourners, seated 
	on comfortable wicker chairs, form a semi-circle around the coffin. The 
	ape ladies wear cowls.

				MINISTER 
			Weep if you must, but make an end of 
			sorrow. He lives again. Yes, he has 
			found peace in Heaven.

218	CLOSEUP - TAYLOR

	Crouching, listening, wide-eyed.

				MINISTER'S VOICE 
				(o.s.) 
			He was a model for us all, a gorilla to 
			remember; hunter, warrior, defender of 
			the Faith.

219	BACK TO FUNERAL CEREMONY - FROM TAYLOR'S P.O.V.

	As the minister continues his eulogy, a small ape boy detaches himself 
	(as children will) from the group of mourners and comes marching up the 
	aisle toward the rear of the temple.

				MINISTER 
			Cherished husband, beloved father, 
			generous master -- yes, he was a font 
			of simian kindness.

220 	REVERSE ANGLE - SHOOTING AT TAYLOR

	Who is still crouching behind the screen in deep b.g. The small fry is 
	coming closer. Over this we hear:

				MINISTER'S VOICE
				(o.s.)
			The dear departed once said to me:
			'I never met an ape I didn't like'...

	The small fry spots Taylor.

				CHILD
				(shrill soprano)
			Look!. It's a man!

	The mourners' heads turn. Taylor slinks toward the vestibule.

221	ANOTHER ANGLE - FEATURING THE MINISTER

	He is aghast.

				MINISTER
			In Heaven's name ...
				(aside to ushers)
			Get rid of that creature.

	Two ushers rise, moving past CAMERA and o.s.

222	EXT. TEMPLE - CLOSE ON VESTIBULE DOOR

	Staying close on the temple wall, Taylor moves stealthily away from the 
	vestibule door. The two ape ushers appear.

				FIRST USHER 
				(pointing) 	
			There he is:

	They move toward Taylor.

223	FLASH SHOT - TAYLOR

	He runs out onto the mall.

224	FULL SHOT - THE MALL

	Taylor belatedly sees that he is running straight toward his two
 	mounted pursuers. Darting off in another direction, he races past 
	startled pedestrians.

225	REACTION SHOT - TWO CHIMP PEDESTRIANS

	They do a slow take.

				FIRST CHIMP
			You see what I saw?

				SECOND CHIMP
			Must've escaped from the zoo.

226	MED. SHOT - A MOUNTED COP

	He has spotted Taylor. Drawing a folded net from his saddlebag, he 
	swings it overhead (like a cowboy with a lariat) and gallops off in 
	pursuit of the man.

227-	SEVERAL SHOTS - TAYLOR AND PURSUING MOUNTIE
231

	Taylor runs frantically from building to building, rounding corners, 
	vanishing momentarily and reappearing on another part of the mall. At 
	one point the mountie nearly overtakes him and flings his net, which 
	falls short. Taylor runs on.

232	EXT. AN AMPHITHEATER - LOW ANGLE SHOT (FROM GROUND LEVEL)

	It is an open-air structure, like a Greek theater, located near the 
	central mail. Steeply tiered, it seats no more than fifty apes. The 
	dais in the pit is some fifteen feet above ground level.

	Taylor enters scene, running toward the amphitheater. Changing 
	direction, he darts into what appears to be an access tunnel. A moment 
	later the pursuing cop rides into' scene, dismounts and walks toward 
	the amphitheater, looking around for Taylor.

233	EXT. AMPHITHEATER - HIGH ANGLE SHOT (FROM TOPMOST TIER)

	Taylor suddenly emerges from the access tunnel and runs up a ramp 
	encircling the amphitheater. (A retaining wall shields him from the 
	view of the apes.) Pausing for breath at the top of the ramp, Taylor 
	crouches behind the uppermost tier of seats and peers down:

	THE AMPHITHEATER - FROM TAYLOR'S P.O.V.

	The cop looks around, spots Taylor at the top tier, and starts up after 
	him.

235-	OUT
237

238	EXT. TOP OF AMPHITHEATER - PANNING WITH TAYLOR

	He starts to run back down the ramp, but is suddenly confronted by his 
	original pursuer (the dismounted cop coming up the ramp. Reversing 
	direction, Taylor runs around the rim of the amphitheater and vanishes 
	into an exit tunnel. The cop blows his whistle, summoning another cop, 
	who joins him in the chase.

239-	ANOTHER PART OF THE MALL - A SWIFT SEQUENCE OF SHOTS
244

	In which we see the fugitive, his pursuers and the reactions of ape 
	shoppers and workers.

245-	EXT. OPEN-AIR MARKET - SEVERAL SHOTS
248

	A market has been set up on one side of the mall, where street vendors 
	behind carts or tables hawk their wares: fruits, vegetables, wearing 
	apparel, etc. As Taylor runs frantically through the market place, 
	several apes join the chase. In the ensuing pandemonium, like the 
	proverbial Chinese fire drill, several tables are overturned.

249	EXT. A BUILDING - CLOSE ON AN ARCHWAY

	Taylor runs into scene, pauses, panting, and looks back at his 
	pursuers. Then he darts through the archway into the building.

250	INT. BUILDING - TRACKING WITH TAYLOR - DAY

	For the moment he is the sole visitor in this wing. His pace slows to a 
	walk as he and we observe fleetingly the specimens in what is a simian 
	museum: Possibly several stuffed and unfamiliar animals; primitive 
	artifacts and fossils; possibly the skeleton of a dog, a cat, etc. Over 
	this we hear a shrill police WHISTLE.

251	FLASH SHOT - TAYLOR

	He runs again.

252	MED. SHOT - AN APE MOTHER AND CHILD

	Looking at the stuffed animals as Taylor races past. The mother gives a 
	startled SCREAM.

253	REACTION SHOT - A MUSEUM GUARD

	He starts after the fugitive.

254	ANOTHER PART OF THE MUSEUM - FEATURING TAYLOR

	He runs past displays of other stuffed animals toward CAMERA and halts 
	abruptly in close f.g., shocked by:

255	WHAT HE SEES: 	DODGE

	stuffed and mounted, Dodge bares his teeth at the world.

256	CLOSEUP - TAYLOR

	Reacting in horror. He hears another police WHISTLE and the echoing 
	FOOTSTEPS of approaching guards, which mufffle his strangled gasp:

				TAYLOR
			Dodge ...

	Taylor vanishes in a BLUR of movement.

								CUT TO:

257	EXT. THE MALL - APETOWN - FULL SHOT FROM ON HIGH - DAY

	Order has been restored in the open-air market. Taylor bursts suddenly 
	into view from a building on the far side of the mall, running in panic 
	from ape guards in close pursuit. A mounted policeman spots him and 
	heads him off. Changing direction, Taylor is intercepted by another 
	mounted Gorilla. And then a third.

	CAMERA HOLDS, ANGLING DOWN on the center of the mall. We are witnessing 
	a hideous game: "baiting the man."  The mounted police do not shoot or 
	club Taylor, for he cannot escape -- but they circle him, their long 
	whips CRACKING over his head.

258	CLOSER ANGLE - THE CIRCLE AROUND TAYLOR - FAVORING A MOUNTIE

	who unfolds his net, swings it overhead and flings it at Taylor. This 
	time he bags his quarry. Taylor gives up. Spent, docile, entangled in 
	the net, he stands stock-still in the center of the mall. Guards and 
	civillians on foot join the circle around the man at bay. They regard 
	him warily.

259	CLOSE SHOT - DR. ZIRA

	She pushes through the simian crowd around Taylor and hurries to his 
	side.

260	CLOSE TWO SHOT - TAYLOR AND ZIRA

	She paws at the net, crying impulsively:

				ZIRA
			Taylor, why'd you run away?

	Zira removes the net from his face. Panting with exhaustion, Taylor 
	flicks a wild glance at her. He looks demented.

261	WIDER ANGLE - TO INCLUDE TWO GORILLA OFFICERS

	who approach Taylor and Zira. (They are the same gorillas introduced in 
	Scene 198.) One of them carries a collar and leash. The other presents 
	an I.D. card to Zira.

				LIEUTENANT 
			Security police.

				ZIRA
				(promptly)
			I'm in charge of this man. 

				LIEUTENANT 
			No longer, madame. He is now in the 
			custody of the Ministry of Science.

	His colleague moves toward Taylor with a muzzle.

262	CLOSE SHOT - FEATURING TAYLOR

	He speaks at last, his voice hoarse but audible.

				TAYLOR
			Get away from me, you dirty ape!

263	FULL SHOT - THE SIMIANS AROUND TAYLOR

	The arresting officer steps back involuntarily. All the apes freeze,
	staring at the speaking animal with mute astonishment as we:

								FADE OUT

								FADE IN

264	INT. CAGES - CLOSE SHOT - TAYLOR AND NOVA - DAY

	The compound is dimly lit. Taylor, the bandage now gone from his 
	throat, is back in his old cage. The other cages, however, are empty -- 
	their occupants presumably having been moved to the surgery or the zoo. 
	He is seated on a pile of straw in the rear corner, Nova's head cradled 
	on his lap. Idly he strokes her coarse hair. There is a dull glow of 
	madness in his eyes, and his manner is one of abstract soliloquy, like 
	a man talking to a dog.

				TAYLOR 
			...and that's when I decided to take 
			up astronautical engineering., you see. I 
			was halfway through college and I...
				(he breaks off) 
			It's an old trick! The silent treatment. 
			Four weeks and three days, and not a word 
			from anyone. Not Zira.,or Cornelius...or 
			that damn Julius. No one'll listen... 
			only you. You...Nova. NO-VAH.

	His manner is now more direct, and educative., but she stares in blank 
	comprehension. She brushes his moving lips with her fingers. He shrugs 
	wryly.

				TAYLOR 
			Yeah...me Tarzan, you Jane. That's all 
			right ... I had a puppy once that never 
			barked. He just licked my hand.
				(pause) 
			He's dead now. They're all dead. Everything... 
			I think maybe they'll kill me, too. Are they 
			afraid of me? I can't hurt them... but I 
			threaten them somehow. Threaten their faith 
			in simian superiority. Yeah ... you're right. 
			They'll have to kill me.

	Faint footsteps are heard o.s. Taylor and Nova look in the direction of 
	the sound. A sudden stream of water shoots through the bars and strikes 
	Taylor in the chest.

265	WIDER ANGLE - WHAT THEY SEE:

	An ape GUARD has a high pressure hose trained on Taylor. It forces him 
	back toward the rear of the cage. Julius, whip in hand, unlocks the 
	cage, steps inside. He unlimbers the whip., cracks it-'in Nova's 
	direction. She recoils. The jet of water hold Taylor at bay. Julius 
	grabs Nova, begins to pull her toward the door of the cage. Taylor 
	tries to fight his way through the water toward Julius.

				TAYLOR
			Let her alone!

	Julius swings the whip. It cracks against Taylor's legs, biting into
	the skin. Taylor stumbles, falls to one knee

				TAYLOR 
			Where are you taking her? What are you 
			going to do?

	Julius drags and pushes the girl through the door, slamming and locking 
	it behind him. Taylor, fights through the stream of water, flings 	
	himself against the bars.

				TAYLOR
				(raging) 
			Take your hands off her, you black 
			monster! You filth!

	Julius shoves Nova across the aisle to a cage opposite Taylor's, locks 
	her inside.

				TAYLOR 
			Why are you doing this? Say something,
			you hairy scum!

	Julius gestures toward the ape guard

				JULIUS
			Turn it off!

	The ape guard shuts off the hose.

				TAYLOR
			Answer me!

	Julius strides over to Taylor's cage.

				JULIUS 
				(fiercely) 
			Shut up! The reason no one'll talk to 
			you is because you're a freak!

				TAYLOR
			Where's Dr. Zira? Why--?

				JULIUS
			I said shut up!

	He slashes viciously with his whip handle against Taylor's fingers. 
	Taylor yells in pain. Julius and the ape guard start out of the 
	compound.

				TAYLOR
				(wildly)
			Ape! Apes wearing clothes!
			It's a madhouse! A madhouse!

	He sinks to the floor as the apes go out.
	
266	OUT

267	FULL SHOT - CAGE 

	Taylor looks desolately through the bars across to Nova's cage. She 
	eyes him sadly.

				TAYLOR
				(gently)
			Now I don't even have you.
				(pause)
			Imagine me -- needing someone. Back on 
			Earth there was nobody. Women, yes. 
			Lots of them. Love making  ithout love. 
			That's the kind of world it was turning 
			into, with the help of cynics like myself. 
			So I left it -- because there was no one 
			dear enough to keep me there.
				(pause)
			Did I tell you about Stewart?
				(Looking away) 
			There was a lovely girl. The most precious 
			cargo we brought along. If human life could 
			survive here, she was to be the new Eve.
				(morosely) 
			It's probably just as well she didn't live 
			to see this.

	He looks at Nova. She stretches her hands through the bars toward him.

				TAYLOR
			I wonder if it's Love between us. 
				(looks around, 
				smiles ironically) 
			What a place to find it.

C-267	FULL SHOT - THE CAGE

	Two gorilla officers enter, carrying torches. (These are the same apes 
	introduced in Scene 198.) One carries a double set of manacles. Julius 
	comes to meet them. The Lieutenant takes the two sets of manacles from 
	the other officer, hands them to Julius, whispers something. Julius 
	comes over and unlocks the door of Taylor's cage. He advances to 
	Taylor, who does not move, bends down and clamps the manacles around 
	each of his ankles. Then he straightens, lifts Taylor's arms, pulls his 
	wrists together, snaps on the cuffs.

D-267	WIDER ANGLE - THE CAGE

	Taylor looks across at Nova, blows her a kiss. Julius leads him out of 
	the cage, takes his leash from a snaps it onto Taylor's collar, hands 
	the other end to the Lieutenant. Nova and Julius watch in silence as 
	Taylor is led down the aisle and out the door.

268-	OUT
272

							DISSOLVE TO:

273	INT. INQUIRY ROOM - ESTABLISHING SHOT - DAY

	Taylor, wearing his manacles, is seated at a table in the otherwise 
	deserted chamber. There is an empty chair on either side of him. Across 
	the room stands a dais with three rude, high-backed chairs. There is a 
	small table directly below the dais. A third table stands at right 
	angles to the dais. Taylor looks around the empty room. A door is 
	opened by a gorilla BAILIFF, and Zira and Cornelius come into the room, 
	sit down on each side of Taylor. A moment later, DR.HONORIUS, the 
	Prosecutor and a CLERK enter, take their seats at the third table.

				TAYLOR 
				(softly) 
			Where have you been? Why didn't you come 
			to see me?

				ZIRA
			Shhhh!

				TAYLOR
			What is this?

				ZIRA
			A hearing.

				CORNELIUS 
				(hissing)
			Be clever. Be quiet,

				BAILIFF	
			All rise!

	Everyone gets up as THE PRESIDENT, Dr. Zaius and Dr. Maximus enter and 
	mount the dais. The President takes the center chair; the other two 
	flanking him.

				BAILIFF
			Be seated.

	All sit down.

				PRESIDENT 
				(pounds gavel once) 
			This ad hoc Tribunal of the National 
			Academy is now in session. President of 
			the Academy presiding. On my right, Dr. 
			Maximus, Commissioner for Animal Affairs. 
			On my left, Dr. Zaius, Minister of Science 
			and Chief Defender of the Faith... 
				(glancing at Prosecutor) 
			Appearing for the State, Dr. Honorius, 
			Deputy Minister of Justice.

	Honorius rises and bows.

				PRESIDENT
				(raps gavel once)
			Let it be clear at the outset that all 
			matters pertaining to this inquiry are 
			confidential, and anyone discussing them
			outside this chamber will be held in 
			contempt of the Tribunal.
				(a beat)
			You may proceed, Dr. Honorius.

				ZIRA 
				(rising) 
			By your leave, Mr. President -- the 
			Tribunal has not yet defined the purpose 
			of this inquiry.

	The President appears to be taken aback. He glances at his colleagues.

				MAXIMUS 
			You asked for the opportunity to present 
			your case. Surely you must know why you're 
			here.

				ZIRA 
			My own purpose is to save this exceptional 
			creature from mutilation.

				MAXIMUS
				(promptly)
			And our purpose is to settle custodial and 
			jurisdictional questions concerning this 
			beast, and determine what's to be done with 
			him.

				ZIRA 
			At the very least, this man has the right 
			to know whether there's a charge against 
			him.

				HONORIUS 
				(rising) 
			Objection. The accused is indeed a man. 
			Therefore, he has no rights under ape law.

				PRESIDENT
			Well, Dr. Zira? This is a man, is he not?

274	CLOSE GROUP SHOT - THE DEFENDANT'S TABLE

	Sensing that the President has given them an opening, Zira smiles 
	confidently.

				ZIRA
			He is unlike any man you have ever seen - 
			as we hope to prove.

				PRESIDENT'S VOICE 
				(o.s.) 
			Answer the question. Is he a man?

				CORNELIUS 
				(tentatively) 	
			Sir? The question is the point at issue: 
			Is he a man? Or a deviate? Or a freak of 
			nature?

				HONORIUS' VOICE
				(o.s.) 
			Objection!

275	FULL SHOT - THE INQUIRY ROOM

	As the Prosecutor continues:

				PRESIDENT 
			Sustained. In all fairness, Dr. Zira, 
			you must admit the accused is a nonape, 
			and therefore has no rights under ape law.

				ZIRA
				(rising)	
			Then why is he called the accused Your 
			Honors must think him guilty of something.

	Honorius seems confounded. Zaius takes over.

				ZAIUS
			This man is not being tried. He is being 
			disposed of.
				(pointing at
				Zira and Cornelius) 
			It is scientific heresy that is actually 
			on trial here.

				MAXIMUS
			Well put, Dr. Zaius. Let us warn
			our friends that they endanger their
			own careers by defending this animal.

276	CLOSE SHOT - THE DEFENSE

	Both Cornelius and Zira appear shaken by this threat. Sensing their 
	predicament, Taylor rises impatiently.

				TAYLOR
			Then I'll defend myself.

277	FULL SHOT - THE INQUIRY ROOM

	Although the judges and Prosecutor have been told that this man can 
	speak, they react in stunned silence to the first sound of his voice. 
	Flustered, the President bangs his gavel.

				PRESIDENT
			Dr. Zira -- tell Bright Eyes to 
			sit down.

				TAYLOR 
			My name is Taylor.

	The President refuses to address Taylor directly. Checking a document, 
	he speaks to Zira.

				PRESIDENT
			It says here that his name is Bright 
			Eyes. You gave him that name yourself.

				TAYLOR 
				(voice rising) 
			This hearing is absurd! Let me tell 
			my story...

				PRESIDENT
				(pounds gavel)
			Bailiff! Make the animal be quiet.

	The Bailiff quickly crosses to Taylor and shoves him roughly into his 
	chair.

				PRESIDENT 
			State your case, Mr. Prosecutor.

				HONORIUS 
			Learned Judges: My case is simple. It is 
			based on our first Article of Faith: that 
			the Almighty created the ape in his own 
			image; that He gave him a soul and a mind; 
			that He set him apart from the beasts of 
			the jungle, and made him the lord of the 
			planet.

278	CLOSE GROUP SHOT - THE DEFENDANT'S TABLE

	Taylor has begun to write something on a sheet of paper. Zira and 
	Cornelius remain attentive to:

				HONORIUS' VOICE 
				(o.s.) 
			These sacred truths are self-evident. The 
			proper study of apes is apes. But certain 
			young cynics have chosen to study man - 
			yes, perverted scientists who advance on 
			insidious theory called 'evolution.'

279	FULL SHOT - THE INQUIRY ROOM

	As the Prosecutor continues:

				HONORIUS 
			There is a conspiracy afoot to undermine 
			the very cornerstone of our Faith

				PRESIDENT
			Come to the point, Dr. Honorius.

				HONORIUS 
			Directly, Mr. President. This wretched man, 
			the accused, is only a pawn in the conspiracy.
			We know that he was wounded in the throat at 
			the time of his capture. The State charges 
			that Dr. Zira and a corrupt surgeon named 
			Galen experimented on this wounded animal, 
			tampering with his brain and throat tissues 
			to create a speaking monster ...

				ZIRA
				(on her feet)
			ThatÕs a lie!

				PRESIDENT
				(pounding gavel)
			Mind your tongue, madame.

				ZIRA
			Did we create his mind too? Not only 
			can this man speak. He can write. He can 
			reason.

				HONORIUS
		He can reason? With the Tribunal's permission, 
		let me expose this hoax by direct examination.

				PRESIDENT
		Proceed. But don't turn this hearing into a 
		farce.

	Honorius crosses to the defendant's table and favors Taylor with an 	
	evil smile.

				HONORIUS 
			Tell the court, Bright Eyes -- what is 
			the second Article of Faith?

				TAYLOR 
			I admit, I know nothing of your culture.

				HONORIUS 
			Of course he doesn't know our culture - 
			because he cannot think.
				(to Taylor) 
			Tell us why all apes are created equal.

				TAYLOR 
			Some apes, it seems, are more equal than 
			others.

				HONORIUS 
			Ridiculous. That answer is a contradiction 
			in terms. Tell us, Bright Eyes, why do men 
			have no souls? What is the proof that a 
			divine spark exists in the simian brain?

				TAYLOR
				(hands paper to Zira) 
			Show this to the President.

	Zira moves toward the dais. Honorius returns to his own table.

				ZIRA 
			Since the defendant is forbidden to speak 
			in his own defense, he asks that this 
			statement be read into the record.

				PRESIDENT 
			Read it yourself.

				ZIRA
				(reading aloud) 
			'I have come to you from a planet in a 
			different solar system. I am an explorer 
			in space, with no hostile intentions against 
			your civilization. On my planet it was the 
			primate Man who evolved Into a thinking 
			animal, while the apes remained..."

				PRESIDENT
				(rapping gavel) 
			Stop right there. Bring me that paper.

	Zira crosses to the dais, handing the statement to the President. He 
	glances at it, laughs derisively and passes it to Zaius.

				PRESIDENT
				(to Zira)
			This is a joke in very poor taste.

				ZIRA
			Is it a joke to seek the truth about 
			this man?

				ZAIUS
				(glancing at document) 
			Dr. Zira -- you state here that a ship 
			from outer space sank in an inland sea 
			of our eastern desert.

				ZIRA
			I do not state it, sir. The prisoner does.

				ZAIUS 
			Do you believe him?

				ZIRA
				(uneasily) 
			Like you, I find it difficult.

				ZAIUS 
			But how convenient that the proof of 
			his arrival has vanished?
				(glancing again
				at document) 
			You also state that Bright Eyes had two 
			intelligent companions at the time of 
			his capture.

				ZIRA
			This is his assertion.

				ZAIUS
			Where are they now?

				TAYLOR
				(blurting it out)
			One is in a museum!

				PRESIDENT
				(pounding gavel)
			Dr. Zira! Silence that man!

	Returning to her table, Zira gestures to Taylor to remain silent.

				ZAIUS
			How sad. Stuffed and mounted, eh? Dead 
			men, like sunken ships, can tell no 
			stories. And his other companion?

				ZIRA
			He doesn't know.

				ZAIUS
			Mr. President, I believe the Prosecutor 
			has reassembled all he surviving humans 
			captured in the hunt along with Bright Eyes.

				HONORIUS 
			That's true, Dr. Zaius. My witnesses -- 	
			correction -- my exhibits are on display in 
			the amphitheater.

				PRESIDENT 
			Very well. I suggest we go and look at them.

	The President rises, starts out, followed by the others. Taylor is 
	last, being led on a leash by the bailiff.

280 	OUT

281	EXT. AMPHITHEATER - FULL SHOT - DAY

	The inquiry group files through a door into the amphitheater. Two APES 
	stand guard over a number of leashed and nearly naked human beings in 
	the center of the pit below the dais. There are three primitive males, 
	the female Nova -- and Landon. He is dirty and bearded, but his hair is 
	cropped close.

282	CLOSE - TAYLOR

	He turns to Zira, his eyes shining with vindication.

				TAYLOR 
				(a whisper) 
			It's him...Landon.

				ZIRA
			Which one?

				TAYLOR 
			Second from the left.

283	FULL SHOT - THE AMPHITHEATER

	Zaius glances at the accused.

				ZAIUS 
			Well...do you acknowledge kinship with 
			any of these creatures?

				TAYLOR
			With one of them.

				ZAIUS 
			Identify him, then. Speak to him.

	Taylor moves forward for a few paces, stops.

				TAYLOR
			Landon?

284	CLOSER SHOT - FEATURING LANDON - FROM TAYLOR'S P.O.V.

	Landon looks catatonic. His face is in shadow

285	WIDER ANGLE - TO INCLUDE TAYLOR

	Stunned by Landon's imbecility.

				TAYLOR 
			John ... it's me, Taylor.

	Taylor steps forward to grasp his arm. There is still no response. 
	Taylor takes Landon's head in his hands and looks at his face. There is 
	a fresh scar running from his forehead to the top of his cranium.

286	FULL SHOT - THE AMPHITHEATER

	As Taylor whirls on Zira.

				TAYLOR 
			You! ... You knew about this?

				ZIRA
			No, I swear -- I never saw this
			man before.

				TAYLOR
				(whirling on Zaius) 
			You did this to him! You've removed his 
			frontal lobes!

				PRESIDENT
			Silence!
				(turning)
			Bailiff, take the prisoner inside!

	The bailiff Jerks brutally on Taylor's leash, pulling him toward the 
	door leading under the amphitheater.

A-286	INT. INQUIRY ROOM - MED. SHOT - DAY

	The bailiff enters, dragging Taylor behind him, shoves him into his 
	chair. Moments later the other apes enter the room. All take their 
	seats but Zaius. Taylor glares at him furiously.

				ZAIUS 
				(calmly) 
			Mr. President, a word of explanation: the 
			creature in question suffered a skull 
			fracture during the hunt. Two fine 
			veternary surgeons under my direction 
			were able to save his life. But the beast 
			could not speak, of course. Nor will he
			ever speak

	Taylor leaps from his chair, livid with rage, approaches the dais.

				TAYLOR 
			You destroyed his memory! His mind! His 
			identity! And, you want to do the same to 
			me!

				PRESIDENT 
				(pounding gavel) 
			Bailiff! Stop this outburst! Gag that
			monstrosity!

	The bailiff and a husky guard seize Taylor, who continues shouting:

				TAYLOR 
			You barbarians!

	The powerful guard twists Taylor's arms behind his back and the bailiff 
	lashes his wrists together. Then the bailiff gags Taylor. His voice is
	cut off as the bailiff ties the twisted kerchief around his open mouth.
	The guard holds Taylor's leash during the rest of this scene.

	Meanwhile, Cornelius has risen to his feet. His tone is firm, but 
	conciliatory.

				CORNELIUS
			May it please the Tribunal: I for one 
			grant that this being cannot have come 
			from another planet. But this much is 
			certain -- he comes from somewhere in the
			Forbidden Zone. He has described the region  
			to us, and described it accurately, for I 
			have been there.

				PRESIDENT 
			You visited the Forbidden Zone?

				CORNELIUS 
			Why, yes, sir. A year ago. With the special 
			permission of the Academy.

				ZAIUS 
				(to President) 
			He exceeded his orders. His travel permit 
			was promptly revoked.

				CORNELIUS 
			Yes, sir, so it was -- thanks to you. But 
			not before I discovered evidence of a simian 
			culture that existed long before the Sacred 
			Scrolls were written ...

				HONORIUS 
			Objection! These remarks are profane and irrelevant.

				PRESIDENT
			Sustained.
				(to Cornelius) 
			Your archeological theories have no bearing 
			on the disposition of this creature.

				ZAIUS
				(softly)	
			Let them talk, Mr President. Let them talk.

				ZIRA 
				(rising) 
			Sirs: our theories have a bearing on his 
			identity.

				PRESIDENT
			How so?

				ZIRA 
			Let us assume, as common sense dictates, 
			that the prisoner's story is false. But if 
			he does not come from another planet, then 
			surely he sprang from our own. Yes, sprang.
				(a beat) 
			As an animal psychologist, I have found no 
			physiological defect to explain why humans 
			are mute.

				HONORIUS
			Objection!

				PRESIDENT
			Sustained.

				ZIRA
				(plunging on) 
			Their speech organs are adequate. The flaw 
			lies not in anatomy but in the brain.

				HONORIUS
			Objection!

				PRESIDENT
			Sustained.

				ZIRA
				(voice rising) 
			Sustain all objections, but face the truth!

	Cornelius has regained his courage. Rising to Zira's support, he points 
	at Taylor.

				CORNELIUS 
			Yes! Behold this marvel, this living paradox, 
			this missing link in an evolutionary chain!

				PRESIDENT
				(pounding gavel) 
			Silence!
				(Puffing with rage) 
			You have gone too far.

				ZAIUS
				(calmly) 
			There you are, Mr. President. I warned you 
			these two would use this hearing as a forum 
			for subversion.

				MAXIMUS 
			You were right! The advocates of heresy have 
			revealed themselves.

				ZAIUS 
			Mr. President, I think an indictment is 
			in order.

				HONORIUS 	
				(promptly) 
			Yes, sir. The State charges Doctors Zira 
			and Cornelius with contempt of this Tribunal, 
			malicious mischief and scientific heresy.

				PRESIDENT 
			Be it so ordered. The Tribunal will examine 
			all the evidence presented here and in due 
			time render a verdict on the proposed 
			indictment and on the disposition of the 
			deviate in question. 
				(pounds gavel once) 
			This hearing is adjourned.

	All rise. The guard drags Taylor from the inquiry room. Zira and 
	Cornelius stand there, stunned by the entrapment into which Zaius has 
	maneuvered them.

287-
289 	OUT

								DISSOLVE TO:

290	INT. A SMALL OFFICE - CLOSE ON DR. ZAIUS - NIGHT

	The office is as unadorned and Spartan as that of Cornelius  -- in 
	fact, with minor changes in decor, the same set can be used. There are 
	many thick leatherbound books on this scholar's desk. Zaius is reading 
	one of them and taking notes. He looks up as someone KNOCKS at the 
	door.

291	REVERSE ANGLE - SHOOTING PAST ZAIUS

	The two agents push Taylor through the doorway.

				ZAIUS 
			Wait outside.

	The officers withdraw, closing the door. Collared, wrists manacled, 
	Taylor stands facing the desk.

				ZAIUS 
			The verdict is in. At the moment your 
			simian friends -- and  sponsors -- are 
			free on bail. But they'll soon be brought 
			to trial for heresy.

292	ANOTHER ANGLE - FAVORING ZAIUS

	who falls silent, as if this were the only news of import. We note at 
	once a change In Zaius' tone and attitude. He no longer treats Taylor 
	like a freak animal, but addresses him as an imaginative adversary who 
	must be intimidated by the threat of terror.

				TAYLOR
			What about me?

				ZAIUS
				(offhandedly) 
			Oh, your case was preordained. In a way, 
			you performed a service for the State ...
				(smiling) 
			Because your hearing made it possible 
			for us to expose Zira and Cornelius.
				(a beat) 
			And now the Tribunal has placed you in 
			my custody for...final disposition. Do 
			you know what that means?

				TAYLOR
			No.

				ZAIUS
			Emasculation, to begin with. Then 
			experimental surgery. On the speech 
			centers. On the brain. Ultimately, a 
			kind of living death.

	Taylor stiffens but says nothing. Zaius lets this prospect sink in, 
	then continues.

				ZAIUS
			However, it's within my power to grant
			You a reprieve.  That is why I summoned 
			you here tonight.
				(a beat) 
			Tell me who and what you really are and 
			where you come from, and no veterinary 
			will touch you.

				TAYLOR	 
			I told the truth at that 'hearing'of yours.

				ZAIUS
			You lied. Where is your tribe?

				TAYLOR 
			My tribe, as you call it, lives on another 
			planet in a distant solar system.

				ZAIUS 
			Then how is it we speak the same language?
				(suddenly intense) 
			Even in your lies, some truth slips 
			through! That mythical community you're 
			supposed to come from -- Fort Wayne'?

				TAYLOR 
			What about it?

				ZAIUS 
			A fort! Unconsciously, you chose a name 
			that was belligerent.
				(more calmly) 
			Where were you nurtured?

				TAYLOR 
			I take it you don't believe the prosecutor's 
			charge -- that I'm a monster created by 
			Dr. Zira.

				ZAIUS
			Certainly not.	You're a mutant.

				TAYLOR 
			That's exactly what Zira and Cornelius 
			claim. You're talking heresy, doctor.

				ZAIUS
				(smiling) 
			Of course.

				TAYLOR
				(growing bolder) 
			All right, suppose I am a mutant? Why 
			does the appearance of one mutant send 
			you into a panic?

				ZAIUS 
			Because you're not unique. There was the 
			one you call Landon --

				TAYLOR
			Then you admit --

				ZAIUS 
			I admit that where there's one mutant there's 
			probably another. And another. A nest of them. 
			Where's your nest, Taylor? Where are your women?

				TAYLOR
				(pause)
			Thank you for calling me Taylor.
				(more firmly)
			Dr. Zaius, I know who I am. Who are you? How 
			did this upside down civilization ever get 
			started?

				ZAIUS
				(strangely calm) 
			You may well call it upside down, since you 
			occupy its lowest level. And deservedly.
				(pause) 
			The eastern desert has never been explored -- 
			because we've always assumed that no life can 
			exist there.
				(a beat) 
			Save yourself, Taylor. Tell me -- is there 
			another jungle beyond the Forbidden Zone?

				TAYLOR 
			I don't know.

				ZAIUS 
			If you are protecting others of your kind, 
			it will cost you your identity.

				TAYLOR 
			I'm not protecting anybody! That hearing 
			was a farce. What have I done?

				ZAIUS 
			You're a menace! A walking pestilence. I 
			do know who you are, Taylor. As I know 
			that others of your kind must live in the 
			Forbidden Zone.
				(decisively) 
			You have just six hours to make a full 
			confession. After that I'll employ surgery 
			to obtain one.
				(calling off) 
			Guards!

	The two burly security agents open the door and enter.

				ZAIUS 
			Take this creature back to his cage.

	The guards seize Taylor, start to shove him toward the doorway. He 
	twists around, faces Zaius.

				TAYLOR
			All right, you can cut me to pieces. It's 
			within your power.
				(with force)
			But know this, doctor. You do it because 
			you're afraid of me. You do it from fear!

	Zaius jerks his head silently toward the door. The apes drag Taylor 
	through it.

								DISSOLVE TO:

293	INT. ADJACENT CAGES - MED. SHOT - NIGHT

	A few hours have passed. Nova is watching Taylor from her cage across 
	the aisle. He sits on the pile of straw. There is an ugly welt on his 
	cheek made by the security officer's whip. FOOTSTEPS are heard. Taylor 
	and Nova look up and off.

294	REVERSE ANGLE - WHAT THEY SEE:

	A solemn, teen-age chimp named LUCIUS appears outside the cage. The 
	guard Julius rises from his chair.

				LUCIUS
			Are you Julius?

				JULIUS
			What do you want?

				LUCIUS
			I'm from the Office of Animal Affairs. 
				(indicating Taylor)
			This male's to be transferred to the zoo.

				JULIUS
			At this hour? Who says so?

	Taylor enters scene, coming over to the cage bars as Lucius continues 
	gravely, with just a note of disdain.

				LUCIUS 
			Don't they tell you anything? The Anti-
			vivisectionist Society is up in arms. They're 
			going to save this beast from those butchers 
			in the lab. If he can speak he belongs in the 
			public zoo. 
				(taking off) 
			But what'll probably happen is that some 
			money-mad grown-up will put him in a circus. 
			And then we'll have to pay to see what 
			rightfully should have --

				JULIUS 	
			Stop making speeches and show me the order.

	Lucius hands the guard a document. It is dark here, so Julius crosses 
	to a beam of light near the bars and studies the document. Lucius, 
	behind the guard's back, signals frantically for Taylor to seize or 
	strike the guard. Taylor is slow to understand. Lucius shakes his
	head impatiently.

				JULIUS  
				(peering at document)
			This order's no good. It must be counter-
			signed by Dr. Zaius --

	Lucius suddenly gives Julius a violent shove. The guard's head crashes 
	against the bars and he is stunned.

				LUCIUS
			Hit him!

	Taylor complies  bringing down the heel of his fist on the nape of the 
	guard's neck. Julius collapses. The youngster immediately squats down, 
	gags him, and begins to bind him hand and foot. CAMERA MOVES IN.

				TAYLOR 
			Who are you?

				LUCIUS
				(looking up,coolly) 
			So you can talk.
				(as he works) 
			I'm Dr. Zira's nephew. This abduction was 
			her idea. You're not really going to the 
			zoo. That's just our cover story in case 
			we're stopped.
				(off again) 
			Although I do feel that if it ever came 
			down to a question of whether something 
			like you should be public or private 
			property --

				TAYLOR
			Come on. Get me out of here.

	Taking the guard's keys, Lucius rises and unlocks the cage. Nova enters 
	the scene, coming to the bars of her cage.

295	CLOSE TWO SHOT - TAYLOR AND NOVA

	He gazes at her, tense with indecision. She flashes an imploring smile, 
	a mute appeal that cannot be denied. Over this we hear:

				LUCIUS' VOICE 
				(o.s.)
			We've got to move fast.

296	WIDER ANGLE - TO INCLUDE LUCIUS

	as Taylor leaves his cage.

				TAYLOR
			She comes along too.

				LUCIUS
			Zira doesn't want your female.

				TAYLOR
			I want her.

				LUCIUS
				(a shrug)
			If you insist. But I'm not taking
			any orders --

				TAYLOR
			Fine. Just let her out.

	Lucius unlocks Nova's cage. She comes out quickly, takes Taylor's hand. 
	They follow Lucius out of the compound.

297	EXT. ANIMAL COMPOUND - MED. SHOT - NIGHT

	A horse-drawn caged wagon (like that used in the hunt) stands near the 
	building. Zira waits at the rear of the wagon. Lucius, Taylor and Nova 
	emerge from a doorway or archway and join her. Zira notes Nova's
 	presence with disapproval. They speak in undertones.

				ZIRA
				(to Lucius) 
			I told you not to bring the other one.

				LUCIUS 
			He wouldn't leave her.

				ZIRA
				(with a sigh)
			All right...
				(to the humans)
			Get in...hurry.  Put this on.

				TAYLOR
			Listen-

				ZIRA 
			Taylor -- just keep quiet and we may get 
			away with this. Remember that men all 
			look alike to most apes. 

	Taylor and Nova comply, climbing into the cage. Lucius closes the 
	tailgate. Lucius and Zira move to the front of the wagon and climb 
	aboard. Lucius takes the reins. As they move off:

								WIPE TO:

298	EXT. LAKE AND CAUSEWAY - LONG HIGH ANGLE SHOT - NIGHT

	As previously established, the animal compound is on the outskirts of 
	Apetown. The abductors must cross the causeway on their route of 
	escape. In the distance, near the gazebo, we can see the lights of 
	several torches.

	The caged wagon rolls into scene and out onto the causeway. At the same 
	time a mounted gorilla leading two pack animals appears on the far side 
	of the causeway, coming toward CAMERA. Lucius stops the wagon.

299	CLOSE TWO SHOT - LUCIUS AND ZIRA - ON THE WAGON

				LUCIUS
				(apprehensively)
			Gorilla hunters ...

				ZIRA 
			Keep moving. We can't turn back now.

300	BOOM SHOT - THE CAUSEWAY

	As the mounted hunter nears the wagon, we can see two bodies slung 
	across the backs of the pack animals.

301	FLASH SHOT - TAYLOR AND NOVA - IN WAGON CAGE

	They look out at:

302	THE PASSING HORSES - FROM THEIR P.O.V.

	The bodies on the horses are naked human corpses.

303	MED. LONG SHOT - THE CAUSEWAY - REVERSE ANGLE

	In immediate f.g., near the gazebo, is a similar wagon. It has lost a 
	wheel, and its rear axle lies on the edge of the causeway. Two naked 
	primitive males can be dimly seen within the cage. Four or five armed 
	gorilla hunters stand near the wagon: two of them carry torches; the 
	others are passing a jug from hand to hand-.

	The leader of the Hunt Club, still on horseback, holds up his hand as 
	the lab wagon approaches.

				LEADER 
			Hold it!

	Lucius obeys. The hunters on foot swarm around his wagon as their 
	leader calls authoritatively:

				LEADER 
			Ah, Doctor Zira! Our wagon broke down! I'm 
			afraid we'll have to commandeer yours.

304	CLOSER ANGLE - THE LAB WAGON

	as the Hunt Club Leader rides over, recognizing the animal 
	psychologist.

				ZIRA 
			You can't! I've two sick humans in the 
			cage. We're taking them to the chief vet 
			at the zoo ...

				LEADER 
				(indicating his 
				own wagon) 
			We bagged two live ones today. I'll have 
			to ask you to take them along.

	He moves to the rear of the wagon.

				ZIRA 
				(following him; 
				frantically) 
			No, no, my animals are diseased... Leave 
			them alone! They're diseased, I tell you!

	Lucius jumps down and runs toward the rear of the wagon.

305	REVERSE ANGLE - REAR OF WAGON

	The hunters have opened the tailgate and are shining their torches on 
	the humans. They sound ready for sport.

				FIRST HUNTER 
			Give him a taste of fire!

	One of the hunters points his torch at Taylor, who, quite naturally, 
	shrinks back as Lucius runs into scene.

				LUCIUS
			Stand back! He's dangerous!

				FIRST HUNTER
			Why?

				ZIRA
			He's rabid! His bite is fatal!

				FIRST HUNTER
			You serious?

				LUCIUS
			You would die in agony! 
				(with appropriate gestures)
			Frothing at the mouth!

	The hunters fall back. Lucius promptly locks the tailgate and he and 
	Zira run back to the front of the wagon. Lucius snaps the reins and the 
	wagon moves off. The hunters follow it a few paces, pausing near their 
	mounted leader.

				FIRST HUNTER 
			They treat those animals better than they 
			treat us.

				LEADER 
			I still say the only good human is a dead 
			human.

	The fugitives' wagon recedes beyond the gazebo, as we:

								DISSOLVE TO:

306	EXT. AN OPEN RANGE - LONG SHOT - DAWN

	The horse-drawn wagon is silhouetted-against the dawn light, bumping 
	across a semi-arid plain studded with mesquite and sage. (This SCENE 
	can be SHOT either on the Navajo reservation near Page or on the 
	Ranch).

								DISSOLVE TO:

307	EXT. SAVANNA (OR CULTIVATED FIELDS) - LONG SHOT - MORNING

	This is the same area described on page 24, where the hunt occurred. As 
	the wagon rolls along a dirt track, the tall grasses of the savanna (or 
	cultivated field) can be seen in b.g.

308	CLOSE TWO SHOT - TAYLOR AND NOVA - IN WAGON CAGE

	Taylor is dozing, but the girl is alert and nervous. She peers out at 
	the field, apparently recognizing or remembering this terrain. She 
	nudges Taylor, waking him.

309	EXT. GROVE OF WILD FRUIT TREES - LONG PANNING SHOT - DAY

	This, too, is the location described on page 24. CAMERA PANS with the 
	wagon as it rolls into the grove and HOLDS on three horses. Cornelius 
	sits astride one horse; the other two nags are heavily burdened with 
	packs and saddlebags.

310	CLOSER ANGLE - THE GROVE - FAVORING CORNELIUS

	He dismounts as Zira and Lucius jump down from the wagon
	and hurry toward him. Cornelius and his fiancee embrace and kiss 
	lightly, ape-fashion.

				CORNELIUS
			How did it go?

				ZIRA 
			There was one bad moment -- some hunters 
			stopped us.

				LUCIUS   
				(calmly)  
			I pursuaded them our beasts had rabies.

311	CLOSE TWO SHOT - TAYLOR AND NOVA - IN CAGED WAGON

	The apes discussing the abduction are out of earshot. Exasperated to be 
	thus ignored and caged, Taylor kicks the tailgate, shouting:

				TAYLOR 
			Let me out of here!

312	WIDER ANGLE - TO INCLUDE THE GROUP

	Lucius hurries back to unlock the tailgate. Taylor gets out of the 
	wagon, stretching his stiffened joints. Nova follows suit. During the 
	ensuing exchange the girl seems strangely agitated, pacing to and fro, 
	her eyes scanning the grove and fields in search of someone or 
	something.

				CORNELIUS
				(approaching)
			Well, Taylor -- we're all fugitives now.

				TAYLOR
			Do you have any weapons?

				CORNELIUS
			The best. But we won't need them.

				TAYLOR
			Just the same, I want one.

	He moves toward one of the horses. Cornelius starts after him.

				CORNELIUS 
			Look here, Taylor. I'm in charge of this 
			expedition --

	Taylor takes a rifle from one of the packs, examines it.

				TAYLOR
			Fair enough. But you're no longer in 
			charge of me. And I don't mean to be 
			captured again.

	Zira and Lucius have come up.

				CORNELIUS 
				(peeved) 	
			As you wish.

				TAYLOR 
			Zaius seems to think there might be 
			another jungle beyond the Forbidden Zone. 
			That's what  we'll try for. What about you?

				ZIRA 
			Cornelius and I have been indicted for 
			heresy. Unless we can prove our theories, 
			we don't stand a chance of acquittal.

				TAYLOR 
			You're going back to the Forbidden Zone?

				CORNELIUS	
			To the diggings I worked at a year ago. 
			It's a three day ride across the eastern 
			desert, near where you claim you landed 
			from that planet of yours.

				TAYLOR
			You still don't believe me, do you?

				CORNELIUS 
				(shrugs) 
			It's a long detour to Dead Lake. What 
			would we find?

	Taylor makes a helpless gesture, realizing that he cannot present sure 
	proof.

				TAYLOR 
			Nothing much. The remnants of a life raft. 
			Maybe a small flag. The emblem of my 
			countrymen.

				CORNELIUS 
			Sorry, Taylor. The terrain around that lake 
			is poisonous. There is no fresh water, no 
			vegetation. Nothing.

				TAYLOR
			I know ... Nevertheless, I thank you
			for saving us. You'll be in trouble for 
			going there.

				ZIRA 
				(a smile) 
			We've been in trouble since the moment we 
			met you.

	Nova seizes Taylor's arm to get his attention. Trying to communicate,
 	she makes whimpering sounds and points at:

313-
314	OMIT

315	THE DISTANT JUNGLE - AS SEEN FROM THE GROVE

	This is the same view of the jungle that Taylor saw when the gorilla
 	hunters emerged from the trees. (Page 25)

				ZIRA'S VOICE 
				(o.s.)
			What's she pointing at?

316	BACK TO TAYLOR AND THE OTHERS

	Taylor smiles at Nova, gives her a reassuring shrug.

				TAYLOR 
			That's the way home. And she knows it.

	Nova turns away, still holding Taylor's arm, tries to lead him toward 
	the jungle.

				TAYLOR
				(sharply)
			Nova!	
				(she turns; he shakes
				his head, says gently)
			We can't stay there. It's not safe.

	She looks at him sadly.

				ZIRA 
			We'd better get started. If the mounted 
			police pick up our trail, they'll come 
			this far at least.

				CORNELIUS
			Right. 
			(to Lucius) 	
		Let's put the water and provisions in 
		the wagon.

	He and Lucius move off toward the horses.

				ZIRA
				(indicating Nova)
			Are you going to take her with you?

				TAYLOR
			Yes.

				ZIRA 
			Actually, you're a different breed. 
			This creature will never evolve.

				TAYLOR
			Maybe not.

				ZIRA 
				(smiling) 
			You want her that much?

				TAYLOR 
				(testily) 
			You threw us together, remember? And you 
			guessed right. Men, like apes, get 
			despondent without a mate.

	He walks off to help Lucius and Cornelius. Nova tags along behind him 
	as we:

A-316	THE GROUP MOVES ACROSS A PLATEAU

								DISSOLVE TO:

317	EXT. DRY WASH AND TAMARISKS - FEATURING SCARECROWS - DAY

	The caravan is crossing, in a reverse direction, the route taken by the 
	astronauts on page 17. The three apes are on horseback. Taylor and Nova 
	follow in the wagon. They are nearing the row of sinister scarecrows on 
	the bluff above the dry wash.

318	MED. SHOT - THE THREE MOUNTED APES

	They halt briefly and look up at the crosses. Lucius is impressed.

				LUCIUS 
			Who put them up?

				ZIRA
			The Hunt Club.

				LUCIUS 
			To scare off humans?

				CORNELIUS
			To scare us, too. We're entering
			the Forbidden Zone.

	They move off again, riding across the dry wash.

319	TWO SHOT - TAYLOR AND NOVA - SEATED ON THE WAGON

	They, too, have stopped and are looking up at the scarecrows. Nova is 
	plainly terrified. She grabs Taylor's arm, whimpers.

				TAYLOR 
			Don't worry. You'll be safe with me.
				(sudden smile) 
			Here. It's time you learned to earn 
			your keep.

	He hands the reins to Nova. She just sits there. He demonstrates.

				TAYLOR
			You can do it. Like this ...

	Nova flicks the reins, reacting in wide-eyed, open-mouthed disbelief as 
	the horse obeys her.

								DISSOLVE TO:

320	EXT. DESERT PLATEAU - LONG HIGH ANGLE SHOT - DAY FOR NIGHT

	The party is traversing a red desert to the east of Dead Lake. Great 
	sandstone monoliths rise from the desert floor. From this vantage point 
	the horses look no bigger than ants.

								DISSOLVE TO:

321	EXT. RIM OF A DEEP GORGE - HELICOPTER SHOT - DAY

	This is terrain never before seen in this picture. (Lake Powell 
	location, a few miles northeast of Wahweap). The party can be seen on 
	the rim of a flat desert tableland that falls away abruptly to a vast, 
	irregular river of deep blue water. Taylor, Cornelius and Lucius are 
	unloading the wagon and repacking their provisions and equipment on the 
	backs of horses. Zira watches them.

A-321	CLOSER ANGLE - THE GROUP

	Zira wanders off, falls to her knees.

				LUCIUS
			Something's wrong with your mate.

	Taylor looks off. He and the others move quickly to Nova, CAMERA 
	PANNING with them.

B-321	CLOSE GROUP SHOT - AROUND NOVA

	She has been retching. Taylor lifts her up. She is faint with nausea. 
	Zira squats down beside them.

				ZIRA 
			Let me handle this. 
				(ruefully, to Taylor) 
			You may be smarter than I am, but I'm 
			the veterinary on this planet.

	Assisting Nova to her feet, Zira leads her off toward the wagon.

C-321	MED. SHOT - CORNELIUS, TAYLOR AND LUCIUS.

	Taylor watches the departing females, then looks down at the river.

				TAYLOR
			Where does the river lead?

				CORNELIUS 
			It empties into a sea some miles from 
			here. That's where the cave is.

D-321	LONG SHOT - THE RIVER - FROM THEIR P.O.V..

	The river winds o.s. between the sheer sandstone Cliffs rising from 
	either bank.

				TAYLOR'S VOICE
				(o.s.)
			And beyond that?

E-321	THREE SHOT - TAYLOR, LUCIUS AND CORNELIUS

				CORNELIUS 
			Don't know. At high tide you can't ride 
			along the shore, and we had no boats on 
			the last expedition.

				TAYLOR 
			You've never told me why this region's 
			called the Forbidden Zone.

				CORNELIUS 
			No one really knows. It's an ancient 
			taboo. Set forth in the Sacred Scrolls. 
			The Lawgiver pronounced the area deadly.

				LUCIUS 
			Shouldn't we be moving on?

				TAYLOR
			I'm for that.

	They start toward the horses and wagon.

F-321	GROUP SHOT - NEAR WAGON

	Zira is looking curiously at Nova, who stands in the shade leaning 
	against the wagon as the males enter the scene. Nova's nausea has 
	passed, and she comes smiling to Taylor.

				TAYLOR 
			What's the diagnosis, doctor? A touch 
			of the sun?

				ZIRA
			She's not sick at all.
				(a beat)
			She's pregnant.

G-321	CLOSEUP - TAYLOR

	Consternation slowly gives way to wonder. He grins.

				TAYLOR
			So I'm not an altogether
			different breed, you see?

322-
325	THE DESCENT OF THE GORGE - SEVERAL SHOTS - DAY

	To reach the camp site -- a beach at the base of the gorge -- the party 
	must lead the horses along a narrow trail that zigzags down the face of 
	the sandstone cliffs. They have abandoned the wagon.

								DISSOLVE TO:

326	EXT. ARCHEOLOGICAL CAMP - ESTABLISHING SHOT - DAY

	Sand bars and two narrow beaches are in evidence here. The camp itself 
	consists of several lean-tos against the cliff wall. Above the camp, 
	reached by ladders connected to scaffolding, is the mouth of a cave. 
	Zira is cleaning up the breakfast things; Zaius and Lucius are sorting 
	out equipment.

A-326	CLOSER ANGLE - TAYLOR AND ZIRA

	A small bowl of water rests on the ground in front of Taylor He has 
	nearly finished shaving himself with a sharp hunting knife. Nova 
	watches, a look of fascinated approval on her face. Taylor rinses off 
	his knife, starts to dry it. Nova reaches out, gently strokes his 
	smooth -- if nicked -- chin.

				TAYLOR 
				(smiling) 
			You like it?

	Lucius and Cornelius come up, Zira with them.

				LUCIUS 
				(disapprovingly) 
			Why did you do that? Scrape off your 
			hair?

				TAYLOR
			In my world -- before I left it - 
			only youngsters of your age wore un-
			scraped hair.

				CORNELIUS 
				(to Taylor, quizzically) 
			It makes you look somehow ... less 
			intelligent.

	Taylor grins wryly at Cornelius, picks up his rifle.

				TAYLOR 
			When are you going to show me what's 
			in the cave?

				CORNELIUS 
			Right now, if you like.

	They cross the beach to the ladders, when suddenly they hear the sound 
	of horses. They look o.s.

B-326	WHAT THEY SEE:

	Dr. Zaius and five armed and mounted apes have come around the corner 
	of the beach and ride toward them through the rocks.

C-326	MEDIUM - THE GROUP

	Taylor scrambles up onto the lower scaffold. Lucius runs to a lean-to, 
	scoops up his rifle.

				CORNELIUS
			Lucius -- don't fire at them.

	The party rides up.

				ZAIUS 
			You're all under arrest! 
				(to Lucius) 
			You seditious scoundrel. Drop that 
			rifle.

327-	OUT

349	FLASH SHOT - LUCIUS

	He wavers, lowering his piece.

350	WIDER ANGLE - TO INCLUDE BOTH GROUPS

	Zaius' gorillas ride forward a few paces, but halt again as Taylor 
	shouts:

				TAYLOR 
			Stop right there.

				ZAIUS 
			Don't be a fool. You're outnumbered 
			and outgunned.

	Taylor aims at Zaius and calls out:

				TAYLOR 
			If there's any shooting, Dr. Zaius, 
			you'll be the first to die. Depend 
			on it.

				CORNELIUS 
				(protesting) 
			Taylor, you're not in command here. 
			Put down that gun.

				TAYLOR
			Shut up.

	Silence.	Zaius knows Taylor isn't bluffing.

				ZAIUS
			Very well.
				(to his followers) 
			Lower your weapons.

	They obey. Taylor calls again:

				TAYLOR 
				(pointing) 
			Tell them to move around the point. 
			Out of range.

	Zaius turns and whispers to his apes. They rein about and ride away 
	through the rocks. Zaius dismounts and approaches the fugitives alone. 
	He is unarmed.

351	CLOSER ANGLE - THE GROUP

	As Zaius draws nearer) Lucius lowers his rifle. But Taylor keeps his at 
	the ready.

				CORNELIUS 
				(uncertainly) 
			How did you know we'd come here?

				ZAIUS 
			It wasn't difficult. Only an apostate 
			or a lunatic would flee to the Forbidden 
			Zone. 
				(a glance at Taylor) 
			I see you brought along the female of 
			your species.
				(Taylor nods) 
			I didn't realize a man could be monogamous.

				TAYLOR
			On this planet -- it's easy.

	Zaius laughs derisively, then turns to the apes.

				ZAIUS 
				(evenly) 
			I ask you to reconsider the rash course 
			you've taken. If you're convicted of heresy, 
			the most you'll get is two years. But if 
			you persist in pointing guns in my direction, 
			you'll hang for high treason.

				CORNELIUS 
				(respectfully) 
			We've never meant to be treasonable, sir.
 				(pointing off) 
			But up there, in the face of that Cliff, 
			is a vast cave -- and in that cave a 
			fabulous treasure of fossils and artifacts.

				ZAIUS 
			I've seen some of your fossils and artifacts. 
			They're worthless.

				TAYLOR
				(derisively) 
			And that's your Minister of Science. Honor-
			bound to expand the frontiers of knowledge.

				ZIRA
				(worried)	
			Taylor, please --

				TAYLOR 
			Except that he's also the Chief Defender 
			of the Faith.

				ZAIUS
				(loftily) 
			There is no contradiction between faith 
			and science. True science.

				TAYLOR
				(suddenly angered) 
			All right, let's see if you're willing 
			to put that statement to a test.

				CORNELIUS 
			Taylor, I'd rather you -

				TAYLOR
			No. You saved me from this fanatic. Maybe 
			I can pay you back.

				ZAIUS
				(calmly)
			What is your proposal?

				TAYLOR 
			When were the Sacred Scrolls written?

				ZAIUS 
			Twelve hundred years ago.

				TAYLOR 
			Very well. If Zira and Cornelius can prove 
			that those scrolls don't tell the whole 
			truth of your history; if they can show you 
			definite evidence of another culture from an 
			unrecorded past -- will you exonerate them?

				ZAIUS
			Of course.

				TAYLOR
			Okay.Up to the cave.

	He gestures toward the path leading to it. Zaius, Zira, and Cornelius 
	start upward. Lucius starts to follow them.

				TAYLOR 
			Sorry, Lucius. You'll have to stay here 
			and guard the horses.

				LUCIUS 
			Always giving orders. Just like every 
			other adult.

				TAYLOR
			Relax. You'll see it all later.

	He pats the barrel of Lucius' gun, in the manner of a stern but 
	benevolent non-com, then starts up the trail with Nova at his heels. 
	Lucius, unused to taking commands from an animal, scowls after him, 
	then shrugs, adjusting to the Idea.

352-
355	OUT

356 	EXT. WESTERN WALL OF GORGE - LONG SHOT - ANGLING UP
	AFTERNOON

	The sun hovers over the lofty rim of the lake like a great red balloon. 
	The wall of the gorge, in shadow, is a darker hue.

357	EXT.  EASTERN WALL OF GORGE - LONG SHOT - ANGLING UP

	The crenelated east wall, looking like a red cathedral, is aglow with 
	sunlight. So is the mouth of the cave as the three apes, Taylor and 
	Nova pass through it and o.s.

358	INT. CAVERN - BOOM SHOT - DAY

	Nature has formed a vaulted room here. It need not be enormous, but 
	should be as weird and fantastic as production capabilities permit. 
	There is an ape-made excavation in the floor of the cave, some ten feet 
	square and eight feet deep. Some small objects lie on the rim of the 
	excavation. Zaius, Cornelius, Zira, Taylor and Nova enter from the 
	outside.

	(AUTHOR'S NOTE: The effect should be an eyeful. I wish to create an 
	illusion of sunlight penetrating this cave, flooding it with direct, 
	refracted illumination, transforming it into a kaleidoscopic cavern.)

				ZAIUS
			Present your evidence, Cornelius.

	Cornelius clambers down into the pit, followed by Zira. Taylor bends 
	down, examines some of the artifacts lined along the edge of the 
	excavation. Nova sits beside him.

				CORNELIUS 
				(pointing) 
			It was at this level I discovered traces 
			of an early ape creature -- stage of 
			primitive barbarism, really -- dating back 
			roughly thirteen hundred years. It was here 
			I found cutting tools and arrowheads of 
			quartz and the fossilized bones of 
			carnivorous gorillas.

	CAMERA (ON BOOM) MOVES IN SLOWLY as Cornelius continues:

				CORNELIUS 
			But the artifacts lying at your feet 
			were found here, at this level. And 
			that's the paradox. The more ancient 
			culture is the more advanced. Admittedly, 
			many of these objects are unidentified, 
			but clearly they were fashioned by beings 
			with a knowledge of metallurgy.

	CAMERA KEEPS MOVING IN on the group in and around the excavation as 
	Cornelius continues:

				CORNELIUS 
			Indeed, the very fact that these tools 
			are unknown to us could suggest a culture 
			in certain ways almost equal to our own. 
			Some of the evidence is uncontestable ...

				ZAIUS
				(interrupting) 
			Don't speak to me in absolutes. The 
			evidence is contestable.

				CORNELIUS
			I apologize.

				ZAIUS 
			To begin with, your methods of dating 
			the past are crude, to say the least. There 
			are geologists on my staff who would laugh at 
			your speculations.

				TAYLOR 
			Perhaps that's why they're on your staff.

	Zaius flicks a hostile glance at Taylor, then looks down at the 
	artifacts. He nudges them with his foot.

				ZAIUS 
			Secondly, if these 'tools' as you call 
			them, are unidentified, why are they 
			introduced as 'evidence' of anything?

				ZIRA 
				(promptly) 
			But there's the doll, sir.

				ZAIUS
			What?

				CORNELIUS
				(pointing)
			Right there. The human doll.

	Zaius deigns to stoop and pick it up.

359	CLOSE ON DOLL - IN ZAIUS' HAND

	It is only a porcelain fragment, but the head is intact, and it is 
	unmistakably the form of a human child.

				ZAIUS	
			What does this prove? My grand-
			daughter plays with human dolls.

360	FULL SHOT - THE EXCAVATION - INCLUDING TAYLOR

	Exasperated, Zira turns to the man for confirmation.

				ZIRA 
			Taylor! Tell him.

				TAYLOR 
			He has a point. On my planet children 
			often play with ape dolls.

	Zaius idly tosses the doll to the ground near Nova. She picks it up, 
	studies it.

361	GROUP SHOT - THE THREE APES

	Cornelius tries again.

				CORNELIUS 
			A doll alone proves nothing. True. But 
			the doll was found beside the jawbone 
			of a man -- and no trace of simian fossils 
			has turned up in this deposit.

				ZAIUS 
			Your conclusion is premature. Have you 
			forgotten your Scripture? The Thirteenth 
			Scroll?
				(quoting from memory) 
			'And Proteus brought the upright beast 
			into the garden, and chained him to a tree, 
			and the children made sport of him.'

				CORNELIUS
				(impatiently)
			No sir, I haven't forgotten.

				ZAIUS
			Well? For a time the ancients kept humans 
			as household pets.	Until the Lawgiver 
			proved that man could not be tamed. Keep 
			digging Cornelius. You'll find evidence of
			the master of this house: an ape.	

A-361	ANOTHER ANGLE - TO INCLUDE TAYLOR AND NOVA

	As Zira again appeals to the man.

				ZIRA 
			Are you going to let that pass without 
			an answer?

	Taylor, who has been toying with objects in the dirt, looks up.

				TAYLOR 
			Yes. I have to agree. From all you've 
			found so far, his position's as good as 
			yours.

				CORNELIUS
				(annoyed)
			What are you doing there?

				TAYLOR 
			Reconstructing a life. Care to have a 
			look?

	Cornelius and Zira cross the pit and Zaius walks around the rim of the 
	excavation.

B-361	MED. CLOSE SHOT - FAVORING TAYLOR AND NOVA

	As the apes come close. A number of artifacts have been arranged in 
	front of Taylor.

				TAYLOR
				(to Cornelius) 
			These were found near the human doll, 
			right?
				(Cornelius nods) 
			Well, whoever owned them was in pretty 
			bad shape.

	He picks up the twisted fragment of a pair of spectacles.

				TAYLOR
			Defective eyesight..

	As Taylor continues his monologue, he picks up the other objects one by 
	one.

				TAYLOR 
			He wore false teeth. 
				(pause) 
			He suffered from a hernia and used 
			this truss to hold up his insides ...
				(pause)  
			And toward the end, these little rings 
			of stainless steel enclosed a prefab-
			ricated valve in his failing heart.

	Taylor pauses. Zaius picks up two of the steel rings, studies them.

				TAYLOR 
			I don't say he was a man like an Earthman, 
			but I'd call him a close relative, for 
			he was plagued by most of man's ills. 
				(to Zaius pointedly) 
			Yet, fragile as he was, he came before you 
			-- and was superior to you.

				ZAIUS 
				(a calm smile) 
			That's lunacy. I can give an alternate 
			description for everyone of those objects 
			that's equally as inventive as yours. But 
			it would be conjecture, not proof.

362	WIDER ANGLE - TO INCLUDE TAYLOR AND NOVA

	She is poking her finger inside the decapitated head of the doll. From 
	it comes a distorted SOUND.

				DOLL'S HEAD 
			Mamma! Mamma! Mamma!.

	The apes stare at the doll in astonishment. Taylor snatches the doll 
	from Nova, brandishes it at the astonished Zaius.

				TAYLOR 
			Dr. Zaius! Would an ape make a human 
			doll that talks?

	Zaius looks at him, speechless. At that moment the CRACK of a distant 
	rifle shot reverberates through the cavern. All present freeze, 
	listening.

				ZIRA
			Lucius....

363-
364	OUT

365	FULL SHOT - THE CAVERN - REVERSE ANGLE

	Taylor alone is armed. Raising his rifle, he glowers at Zaius.

				TAYLOR
			You louse!

	Cornelius is already crossing the pit. He climbs out arid races toward 
	the mouth of the cave. Taylor runs after him. Zira and Nova hurry after 
	Taylor.

366	MED. SHOT - ZAIUS

	Expressionless, he looks down at the doll, then moves toward the mouth 
	of the cave.

367	EXT. TRAIL FROM CAVE TO CAMP - ANGLING UP

	Cornelius emerges from mouth of the cave and runs down the trail toward 
	CAMERA. He halts in f.g., looking down at:

368	THE CAMP SITE - AS SEEN FROM THE TRAIL

	Two of Zaius' gorillas have disarmed Lucius and are clubbing him with
	their rifle butts. Two other mounted apes are driving the scientists' 
	horses back beyond the trees.

369	EXT. THE TRAIL - AS SEEN FROM THE BEACH

	Cornelius, Taylor, Nova and Zira (in that order) can be seen high 
	above, descending the trail. CAMERA PULLS BACK TO DISCLOSE A GORILLA 
	SNIPER in immediate f.g., crouching behind a boulder near the water. He 
	sights his rifle at the man on the trail. Taylor is still too distant 
	to make a sure target, and so the sniper waits.

370	CLOSER ANGLE - TAYLOR ON THE TRAIL

	This portion of the trail has no cover or concealment. Unaware of the 
	sniper, Taylor looks down at the camp as he makes his descent.

371	LONG SHOT - TAYLOR - AS SEEN IN THE SNIPER'S SIGHTS

	The gorilla fires.

372	CLOSE SHOT - TAYLOR

	The bullet ricochets off the rock wall a foot above his head. Taylor 
	scans the terrain bewlow, looking for the sniper. Nova comes to his 
	side, pointing at:

373	THE SNIPER - FROM THEIR P.O.V.

	His head is visible behind the boulder as he reloads his piece	.

374	FLASH SHOT

	He aims and fires.

375	FLASH SHOT - THE SNIPER

	Taylor has missed him, but the sniper ducks behind the boulder.

376	THE TRAIL - PANNING WITH TAYLOR AND NOVA

	Taylor takes her hand and they race back up the trail to where Zira is 
	standing. Outcroppings of rock offer some  cover here. Taylor pushes 
	Nova down behind a rock and signals for Zira to follow suit.

377	CLOSE GROUP SHOT - TAYLOR, NOVA AND ZIRA

	The sniper's SECOND SHOT rings out. Instead of returning the fire, 
	Taylor looks up the rail at:

378	ZAIUS - FRO14 TAYLOR'S P.O.V.

	He is standing impassively on the trail a short distance below the 
	mouth of the cave.

379	FLASH SHOT - TAYLOR

	Bent low, he comes charging up the trail toward Zaius. The sniper's 
	THIRD SHOT splatters rock fragments around him.

380	REVERSE ANGLE - THE TRAIL - ANGLING UP

	Zaius starts to retreat to the cave, but stumbles and falls on some 
	loose shale. No sooner has Zaius regained his feet than Taylor 
	overtakes him. Seizing the ape around the neck with his left arm. 
	Taylor drives the muzzle of his pistol into Zaius' kidney. He spins 
	Zaius around, using him as a shield.

381	CLOSE TWO SHOT - ZAIUS AND TAYLOR

	Taylor releases the pressure on Zaius' throat but keeps the gun pointed 
	at his back.

			TAYLOR
		Tell him to pull back!

			ZAIUS 
			(a hoarse cry)
		Cease fire! Withdraw!

	His command echoes from the west wall of the canyon.

382	LONG SHOT - THE FLOOR OF THE GORGE - FROM THEIR P.O.V.

	The sniper emerges from behind a boulder near the shore, and walks off 
	along the beach.

383	BACK TO TAYLOR AND ZAIUS 

	Taylor lift's the muzzle of his rifle and presses it against the back
	of Zaius' head.

				TAYLOR
			I ought to kill you right now.
				(nudging him) 
			Let's go.

	They move off down the trail.

384	EXT. ARCHEOLOGICAL CAMP - MED. SHOT - DAY

	Zira rushes down the trail to Lucius, who is sprawled on the ground. He 
	has a bloody nose and a lump on his forehead. Nova and Cornelius come 
	next, then Taylor, prodding Zaius ahead of him at gun point. Lucius 
	appears to be more humiliated than hurt.

				LUCIUS 
			They took me by surprise. Sneaked
			up on me while I was watering the
			horses. What's happened to honor?
				(pause, glum) 
			I got off one round to warn you.

				CORNELIUS
				(gloomingly)
			They've taken everything.

				TAYLOR	
			Not everything. They left a hostage.
				(a pause)
			How do you feel, Lucius?

				LUCIUS
			Disillusioned... 
				(turning on)
			But vindicated! I've been right all 
			along. You can't trust the older 
			generation. It's a matter of values --

				TAYLOR
				(gently)
			All right, all right. Will You do me 
			a favor? No orders.

				LUCIUS
				(pause) 
			What is it?

				TAYLOR 
			I want you to go around the bend and 
			tell those gorillas their leader is my 
			prisoner.

				LUCIUS
				(thoughtfull pause)
			Yes, I can do that.

				TAYL0R
			Good. Say I want a week's supply of food 
			for the woman and myself. A horse. A spade.
			And fifty rounds of ammunition.

				LUCIUS
			What if they won't agree to your terms?

				TAYLOR
			Then tell them Dr. Zaius won't leave 
			here alive.

				ZIRA 
				(shocked) 
			Taylor, you can't.

				ZAIUS
				(Calmly)
			Oh yes he can. He's a born killer.
			(to Lucius)
		Deliver the message.

	Lucius looks to Taylor for confirmation. Taylor nods. The young ape 
	hurries away through the rocks. Taylor crosses to a useless saddle, 
	picks up a coil of rope, gestures at Zaius, indicating a nearby tree.

				TAYLOR
			Sit down. Over there.

	Zaius squats on the ground beside the tree. Taylor sets his rifle 
	against the trunk, fashions a noose and places it around Zaius' neck.
	Then, using an ingenious combination of knots, he ties Zaius' hands 
	behind his back, and finally fastens the rope around the base of the 
	tree.

				TAYLOR
				(as he works)
			Now, 	Minister of Science - let me explain 
			certain principle stress and strain. If 
			you exert pressure to remove these bonds, 
			you'll choke yourself to death. It'll be 
			suicide, you see?

	Zira and Cornelius look down at the captive mandarin. Their rebellious 
	spirit has evaporated, and they are clearly afraid.

				ZIRA	
			Taylor, please -- don't treat him that 
			way.

				TAYLOR
			Why not?

				ZIRA 
			It's humiliating.

				TAYLOR 
			Wasn't I humiliated? By all of you? 
			Didn't you lead me around on a leash?

				CORNELIUS 
			That was different. We thought you 
			were .... inferior.

				TAYLOR 
				(wintry smile) 
			And now you know the truth. 
				(to Zaius) 
			Cornelius has beaten you, Doctor. He 
			proved it. Man preceded you here. You 
			owe him your science, your language, 
			whatever knowledge you have.

				ZAIUS 
				(quietly) 
			Then answer this: If ran was superior, 
			why didn't he survive?

				TAYLOR
				(shrugging) 
			He might have been wiped out by a plague. 
			Natural catastrophe. Like a fiery storm 
			of meteors. From the looks of this part 
			of your planet, I'd say that was a fair bet.

				ZIRA,
				(weakly)
			But we can't be sure.

				TAYLOR
				(indicating Zaius)
			He is. He knew all the time. Long before 
			your discovery, he knew.
				(to Zaius) 
			Defender of the Faith. Guardian of the 
			terrible secret. Isn't that right, doctor?

385-
388 	OUT

389	REVERSE ANGLE -	CIRCLE - FAVORING ZAIUS

	As Zira and Cornelius look at him expectantly.

				ZAIUS 
			What I know of man was written long ago 
			-- set down by the wisest ape of all --
			our Lawgiver.
				(to Cornelius)
			Open my breast pocket.

	Cornelius crosses to Zaius, and takes a small book bound in black 
	leather from the breast pocket of his tunic.

				ZAIUS 
			Read it to him: the twentythird Scroll, 
			ninth Verse.

	Cornelius thumbs through the book, finds the citation and reads aloud:

				CORNELIUS 
			'Beware the beast man, for he is the 
			devil's pawn. Alone among God's primates, 
			he kills for sport, or lust or greed. 
			Yes, he will murder his brother to possess 
			his brother's land. Let him not breed 
			in great numbers, for he will make a desert 
			of his home and yours. Shun him. Drive him 
			back into his jungle lair: For he is the 
			harbinger of death'.

	Cornelius falls silent and looks down at Zaius.

				ZAIUS 
				(quietly) 
			I found nothing in the cave to alter that 
			conception of man. And I still live by its 
			injunction.

A-389	ANOTHER ANGLE - THE GROUP

	Lucius hurries out of the rocks leading a saddled horse. Zaius' five 
	mounted gorillas appear behind him. Taylor calls out to them:

				TAYLOR
			Stay where you 	are!

	Lucius comes up with the horse. Taylor checks the provisions in the 
	saddlebags. Lucius is frowning.

				LUCIUS 
			They think you're behaving foolishly. I 
			must say I agree. Where will you go?

				TAYLOR
				(nodding o.s.) 
			I'll start by following the shoreline.
				(a smile) 
			And my nose.

				ZIRA
			But suppose you find nothing but a 
			wasteland. How will you survive?

				ZAIUS 
				(firmly) 
			He won't survive. 
				(all look at him) 
			Do you know what sort of life awaits 
			you out there, Taylor? That of an animal. 
			If you aren't eventually hunted down and 
			killed by apes, some jungle beast will 
			devour you.

				TAYLOR 
			Then there is another jungle?

				ZAIUS 
				(shrugs; then, 
				sardonically) 
			Of course, you could return with us. Our 
			society might find a place for you and 
			your mate.

				TAYLOR
			Sure.	In a cage.

				ZAIUS 
			Where else, but in a cage, does man 
			belong?

				TAYLOR
			No, thanks. I'll take freedom.

	Taylor mounts the horse, extends a helping hand to Nova, who vault's 
	nimbly onto the horse's rump. Taylor looks at Zira and Cornelius.

				TAYLOR
			Would you like to come along?

				ZIRA
			We can't.

				TAYLOR
			It's better than going to prison for 
			heresy.

				CORNELIUS
			They can't convict us of that. You 
			proved our innocence. Besides...
				(indicating Zaius)
			... his culture is our culture.

				TAYLOR 
			Good luck then.

	He reaches down, grasps Cornelius' hand, then grins crookedly.

				TAYLOR 
			Dr. Zira, I'd like to kiss you 
			good-bye.

				ZIRA 
			All right, but.... 
				(tears in her eyes) 
			...you're so damned ugly!

	Taylor smiles, leans down, kisses her.

				ZIRA 
				(softly) 
			Go with God, Taylor. 
				(half smile) 
			That's an old expression. it comes 
			from both ape and man.

				TAYLOR
			God bless you.

	He extends his hand to Lucius, who takes it.

				TAYLOR
			Lucius.

				LUCIUS
			I think you're making a mistake.

				TAYLOR 
			That's the boy. Keep 'em flying.

				LUCIUS
			What?

				TAYLOR 
			The flags of discontent. It's the only 
			way anything ever gets changed. 
				(to Zaius) 
			Don't try to follow us. 
				(pats stock of 
				his rifle) 
			I'm pretty handy with things like this.

				ZAIUS 
			Of that I'm sure. All my life I've 
			awaited your coming and dreaded it. 
			Like death itself.

	Taylor looks piercingly at Zaius, more troubled than offended.

				TAYLOR 
			Why? From the first, I've terrified you, 
			Doctor. And in spite of every sign that 
			I'm an intelligent being who means no 
			harm, you continue to hate and fear me. 
			Why?

				ZAIUS 
				(calmly, 
				without rancor) 
			Because you are a man. And you were right 
			-- I have always known about man. From the 
			evidence, I believe his wisdom must walk 
			hand in hand with his idiocy. His emotions 
			must rule his brain. He must be a warlike 
			animal who gives battle to everything around 
			him -- even himself.

				TAYLOR 
			What evidence? No weapons were found in 
			the cave.

				ZAIUS 
			The Forbidden Zone was once a paradise. 
			Your breed made a desert of it, ages ago.

				TAYLOR 
				(he waits, 
				then wearily) 
			We're back at the beginning. I still don't 
			know the why. A planet where apes evolved 
			from men. A world turned wrong side up.  
			A puzzle with one piece missing.

				ZAIUS 
				(softly) 
			Don't look for it, Taylor. You may not 
			like what you find.

B-389	WIDER ANGLE - TAYLOR AND THE GROUP

	Taylor shakes his head, still baffled, digs his heels into the horse's 
	flank. It canters off along the sandy shore.	Zira, Cornelius and 
	Lucius sadly watch the departure.

				ZAIUS 
			Untie me!

	Cornelius moves quickly to remove the rope from Zaius' neck. Behind 
	them, the five mounted gorillas gallop forward. Zaius gets up, waves 
	them to a halt.

				ZAIUS 
			No, no! Let him go!

C-389	MOVING SHOT - TAYLOR AND NOVA ON HORSEBACK

	Taylor looks back, sees that Zaius has stopped the mounted apes, slows 
	his horse to a trot, smiles at Nova.

390-	OUT
405

406	MED. SHOT - THE APES

	Zaius watches as Taylor's horse moves farther away along the beach. 
	Then he turns to an ape called MARCUS.

				ZAIUS 
				(quietly) 
			Fetch your explosives. We're going 
			to seal the cave.

				MARCUS
			Yes, sir.

	He remounts his horse and rides o.s.

				CORNELIUS
				(aghast) 
			Seal the cave?

				ZAIUS
			That's correct. And you will both stand 
			trial for heresy.

				ZIRA
			But the proof? The doll?

				ZAIUS 
			In a few minutes there will be no doll. 
			There can't be. 
				(honest regret) 
			I'm sorry.

	Cornelius throws himself at Zaius.

				CORNELIUS
			You mustn't! You gave your 'word!

	Zaius looks emptily at one of his apes.

 				ZAIUS
			What I do, I do with no pleasure. Silence 
			him.

	A hairy hand is clapped over Cornelius' mouth. He is dragged off, 
	struggling, kicking. Julius, unafraid, glares at Zaius.

				LUCIUS 
			Dr. Zaius, this is inexcusable! Why must 
			knowledge stand still? What about the 
			future?

	Zaius looks benevolently at Julius.

				ZAIUS
			I may just have saved it for you.

	Julius and Zira look at each other, befuddled. Once more their eyes 
	follow the retreating figures of Taylor and Nova. The beach separating 
	the water from the canyon becomes narrower as they move downstream.

				LUCIUS
			What will he find out there, doctor?

A-406	CLOSEUP - ZAIUS

	His face is A mask, his tone enigmatic.

				ZAIUS
			His destiny.

B-406	WIDER ANGLE - TIE APES P.O.V.

	A moment later, as they watch, Taylor and Nova vanish around the bend.

407-	OUT
408
		
409	EXT. PALISADE AND BEACH - LONG HIGH ANGLE SHOT - DAY

	Taylor and Nova are already far downstream. There is a striking change 
	in the terrain. The area is still desolate,but some vegetation can be
 	seen on the palisade above the narrow beach, and the river has widened 
	to form a vast tidal basin where it meets the sea.

	A NOTE ON PRODUCTION: If feasible at new location site, this scene 
	should be shot at high tide, so that the water laps at the base of the 
	cliffs, making a passage difficult and risky.

410	CLOSER ANGLE - PANNING WITH TAYLOR AND NOVA ON HORSEBACK

	He is alert, sniffing the salt air, sizing up the situation. Hearing 
	the CRIES of birds, he reins in and looks' up.

411	SKY SHOT - CIRCLING BIRDS

	Sea gulls are soaring overhead.

412	TWO SHOT - TAYLOR AND NOVA ON HORSEBACK

	His expression is expectant, searching. Nova emits a whimper of 
	anticipation, pointing off.

413	LONG SHOT - WHAT THEY SEE:

	A verdant forest atop a distant palisade. Their view of the beach below
	the forest, is cut off by a rocky promontory in the middle distance.

414	CLOSE SHOT - NOVA AND TAYLOR

	He smiles at her hopefully.

				TAYLOR
			Yes, Nova -- I see it.
				(looks again at
				forest)
			In my old profession green meant
			safe. Green meant go.

	The horse moves off at a trot, CAMERA PANNING. But they have gone only 
	a short distance when they hear the distant THUNDER of an EXPLOSION. 
	Taylor reins in and looks back.

415	VERY LONG SHOT - A CLOUD OF SMOKE

	A column of smoke and dust rises from the exploded cave far upstream.

416	BACK TO TAYLOR AND NOVA

	Frowning with concern, Taylor gazes for a moment at the smoke, then 
	decides this is no time to linger. He digs his heels into the horse's
	flanks and they move off at a canter, riding toward the promontory that 
	splits the beach. They are nearing the promontory that blocks their 
	view of the beach beyond.

417-	OUT
418

419	CLOSER ANGLE - TRACKING WITH TAYLOR AND NOVA.

	As they round the promontory, the tip of a strange rock formation comes 
	into view. it appears to be jutting from the sea.

420	REACTION SHOT - TAYLOR

	He reins in momentarily, baffled by what he sees. Then he rides on.

421	THE STRANGE FORMATION - AS SEEN BY TAYLOR

	An immense column juts from the beach at a thirty-degree angle. We can 
	now see that it is not rock, but metal. Green metallic tints show 
	through its gray salt-stained surface. As we draw closer, the object 
	takes on the appearance of a massive arm, its top shaped like a hand
	holding a torch.

422	REVERSE ANGLE - FAVORING TAYLOR

	Frowning with consternation. His horse proceeds at a slow walk.

423	TRACKING WITH TAYLOR - WHAT HE SEES:

	Near the base of the column, where the shore and water meet, are a row 
	of metal spikes. From this angle they look like tank traps.

A-423	CLOSER - TAYLOR

	Dumbfounded, he slides from his saddle, approaches the  spikes. Nova 
	dismounts and follows him.

				TAYLOR
				(a cry of agony)
			My God!

	He falls to his knees, buries his head in his hands. CAMERA SLOWLY 
	DRAWS BACK AND UP to a HIGH ANGLE SHOT disclosing what Taylor has 
	found. Half-buried in the sand and washed by the waves is the Statue of 
	Liberty.

1   EXT. DESERT LANDSCAPE (UTAH) - DAY                            1

    Jagged mountains defy a dark, foreboding sky. We hear
    PLODDING HOOVES, CREAKING LEATHER. A lone wanderer
    appears. Wearing a long coat and a battered hat, he
    carries a bolt-action carbine. His name forgotten,
    history remembers him simply as THE POSTMAN.

    His laden pack mule, BILL, BRAYS, as they pass a battered
    sign: "The Great Salt Lake Marina." They start down a
    slope and begin to cross a...


    DRY LAKE BED

    A bizarre, wind-swept sight. Dozens of boats resting lee-
    to on the dry, cracked earth. It's like God pulled the
    plug. Rusty mooring chains snake their way around house
    boats, ski boats and a cabin cruiser or two.

                             WOMAN (V.O.)
               The last of the great cities died
               when my father was a child.
               Another victim of yet another war.
               The plagues followed. And the
               terrors. The living hid
               themselves away in tiny hamlets in
               hopes of surviving whatever new
               madness conspired to rob them of
               the little that remained. The
               Earth itself had fallen prey to
               chaos. For three years a dirty
               snow fell that even summer could
               not erase. The ocean was barren.
               Poisoned. Near death.

    As The Postman continues to cross, the CAMERA PULLS BACK.
    He's soon lost in the massive vista.

                             WOMAN (V.O.)
               Sixteen long years passed before
               the great lungs started working
               again. My father said it was as
               if the ocean breathed a great sigh
               of relief...

    A RUMBLE of THUNDER. RAIN begins to fall. The earth just
    sucks it up at first, but it's coming hard. Rivulets run.
    Puddles form. We begin to get the feeling that soon these
    boats will be tugging at the mooring chains once again.

                                                    (CONTINUED)

                                                           3.

1   CONTINUED:                                                   1

    TRACK a rivulet as it runs, filling up a depression in the
    sand. And then, running to fill another in a series of
    depressions. They make a pattern we recognize as --


    MAN'S FOOTPRINTS

    These tracks may already be days old as they fill with
    rain water. Then, the sound of light, padded FOOTFALLS.
    A LION ENTERS FRAME. Lean, hungry and dangerous, the big
    cat has been tracking this man. He lets out a low,
    disappointed GROWL. The rain has foiled his dinner
    plans -- for now.


2   EXT. HIGHWAY ON-RAMP (UTAH) - DAY                            2

    A bullet-ridden sign reads: "U.S. 84 North." The Postman
    leads Bill down a barren 4-lane. Weeds poke up through
    the asphalt. The rusting hulk of a car rests in the
    median, covered in a tangle of purple wisteria. The
    Postman plucks a flower. He sticks it into a buttonhole
    and continues.

    BILL BRAYS woefully.    In answer:

                               THE POSTMAN
                 I don't know. And if you ask me
                 again, I'm going to slug you.

    They near a sign: "Thank You For Visiting Utah." The
    Postman waves, shouts to the sign as he passes it.

                               THE POSTMAN
                 It's been fun, hasn't it, kids?
                        (to the sign)
                 You're welcome!


3   EXT. 4-LANE (IDAHO) - BILLBOARD - DAY                        3

    Bill tugs up weeds as The Postman is climbing up a ladder
    on a highway that razor cuts the plains to the horizon.

    Above, The Postman sands atop a billboard catwalk. He
    references a tattered road atlas, scans the horizon
    through binoculars with one broken lens. He pauses at a
    Union 76 ball just visible above the tree line.

                                                            4.

4   EXT. HIGHWAY TRAVEL STOP (IDAHO) - DAY                        4

    A 76 Station and the remains of a Howard Johnson's.
    Alert, carbine in hand, The Postman leads in the mule.
    Rusting cars sag on flattened tires. There's a stripped
    fire engine, its cracked hoses leading to the HoJo
    foundation which bristles with burned timbers.

    Bill stops to drink out of a stream.   The Postman swats at
    him with his hat.

                            THE POSTMAN
              Damnit, Bill, you know I need to
              check it first!

    Bill hangs his head. The Postman digs through his pack.
    He removes an old Tupperware container and replaces its
    contents -- a tiny sheaf of litmus papers and several
    small bottles -- with stream water. He adds a few drops
    from each bottle. Swirls it around. Then dips a tiny
    strip of paper into the water. The paper turns a vivid
    purple. The Postman is dubious.

                            THE POSTMAN
              Better than turpentine.
                     (touches some
                      to his lips)
              Tastes about the same. Your call,
              Bill.

    Bill drinks.

                            THE POSTMAN
              You ain't picky, Bill. I like
              that about you.

    The Postman takes his carbine and a burlap sack and
    crosses to the 76 Station. An old extension ladder on the
    ground. The pole holding up the 76 ball has a 30-degree
    bend in it, like someone once tried to pull it over.
    Beyond the 76 ball, the sun sets -- but we here in the
    20th Century have never seen such a wild riot of color
    before.

    The Postman tries the station door. Locked. Smiling
    ironically, he steps in through the blown-out window.


5   INT. 76 STATION - OFFICE - DAY                                5

    A shambles. The Postman kicks around the table. He finds
    a few beat-up CDs, flips through them. Reads the label.

                                                   (CONTINUED)

                                                              5.

5   CONTINUED:                                                      5

                               THE POSTMAN
                 'Running on Empty'? Tell me about
                 it.

    Tossing it, he turns, stops. There, resting on a pile of
    trash is a bashed-in portable TV. The Postman smiles.

                                THE POSTMAN
                 Hey, Bill! We got TV! 147
                 channels. Everything from Jesus
                 to 'Jeopardy'.

    He steps over, switches on the set.      Nothing happens, but
    The Postman pretends just the same.      He mimics static,
    then:

                               THE POSTMAN
                 'Like sands through the hour-
                 glass, so are the days of our
                 lives...'
                        (switching channels)
                 'Michael Shields, come on down,
                 you're the next contestant
                 on...'The Price is Right'.'
                        (switching again)
                 I'll take Domestic Nuclear
                 Disasters for two hundred
                 thousand, Alex...

    The Postman stops suddenly.    Click.

                               THE POSTMAN
                 We interrupt our regularly
                 scheduled program to bring you the
                 Second Civil War... Well, shit.

    The Postman stares at the blank screen a moment. There's
    a sudden, panicked RUSTLING from behind the service
    manager's desk. The Postman wheels around, raises the
    carbine.

                               THE POSTMAN
                 I don't want any trouble... I bet
                 you don't either... Let's just
                 call it a draw, okay?

    Sudden MOVEMENT. The Postman shouts in surprise as a Doe
    dashes out from behind the desk. Scared, it bounds back
    and forth between the walls. Then freezes in the corner.
    The Postman sighs in relief, lowers the carbine.

                               THE POSTMAN
                 Look out, Bill!

                                                      (CONTINUED)

                                                               6.

5   CONTINUED:    (2)                                               5

    The doe bolts for the window and runs right into Bill.
    Bill has a conniption fit.

    Investigating further, The Postman spots a cigarette
    machine. The front glass is smashed and all the slots are
    empty. But he looks down to the lock at the bottom. It's
    intact. He pulls a crowbar from the sack, crouches by the
    machine and digs the pry into a seam and pulls.

    The panel bursts open to reveal four half-open cartons of
    cigarettes. He doesn't believe it for a second. Then:

                               THE POSTMAN
                 I'm rich.


6   EXT. 76 STATION - NIGHT                                         6

    Embers of a campfire glow.    The Postman is asleep, the
    carbine in reach.

    BILL BRAYS and nervously stamps his hooves. The Postman
    reaches for the carbine only to find the barrel of a
    shotgun pointed in his face.

    Three BANDITS! Hard-eyed and ugly. One, barely 20, is
    mostly just ugly. The Postman looks down the barrels of a
    shotgun, a rifle and a revolver. The LEAD BANDIT kicks
    the carbine out of reach.

                               THE POSTMAN
                 I'm just passing through. I don't
                 mean anyone any harm.
                        (re: stream)
                 Water's good.

    The Lead Bandit pokes at The Postman's shoulder with the
    muzzle of his rifle. The Postman knows why.

                               THE POSTMAN
                 I'm not a Holnist.

    The Lead Bandit pokes again. Harder. The Postman opens
    his shirt, reveals his bare left shoulder.

                               THE POSTMAN
                 Okay?

    They just stare at him, none saying a word.      Creepy.

                               THE POSTMAN
                 I'm headed for a town called St.
                 Rose. Somewhere west of Portland.

                                                      (CONTINUED)

                                                             7.

6   CONTINUED:                                                     6

                               LEAD BANDIT
                 Portland's under twenty feet of
                 water.

                               THE POSTMAN
                 Well, I heard different.

                               LEAD BANDIT
                 You mouthin' me?

                               THE POSTMAN
                 No, it's just that it's hard to
                 get good information.

    The third BANDIT, a HULKING brute, has been quiet.

                               HULKING BANDIT
                 He is mouthin' you; I say we kill
                 him.

                               LEAD BANDIT
                 Don't be in such a rush, Martin.
                        (back to
                         The Postman)
                 Now I see a pack mule over there,
                 but I don't see no packs.

                               THE POSTMAN
                 This is all I got.

                               LEAD BANDIT
                 Oh... Kill him, Martin.

    The Hulking Bandit, raises his shotgun. The butt end.
    He's going to bludgeon The Postman to death.

                                THE POSTMAN
                         (pointing)
                 Okay!   My stuff's up there!

    The 76 ball is twenty feet above the ground. In the gloom
    you can just see a hole has been punched through the side.

                               BANDIT #20
                 What do you got in there?

    The Lead Bandit swats Bandit #20 upside the head.

                               LEAD BANDIT
                 Shut up.
                        (to Postman)
                 What do you got in there?

                                                     (CONTINUED)

                                                               8.

                                THE POSTMAN
                 Dried peas.   Beef jerky.
                 Cigarettes.

                                ALL THREE BANDITS
                 Cigarettes!

                                THE POSTMAN
                 Sure.   There's the ladder.

                               BANDIT #20
                 Maybe he's got it booby-trapped.

    The Lead Bandit is about to smack Bandit #20 again -- then
    he sees the logic out of it. The Postman shakes his head,
    but isn't that convincing.

                               LEAD BANDIT
                 You go up and get it.

                                                     CUT TO:


7   EXT. 76 BALL - DAWN                                             7

    The ladder set against the bent pole. Prodded by a
    shotgun, The Postman climbs, disappears through the hole
    and into the tilting 76 ball.


8   INT. 76 BALL - DAWN                                             8

    Full of The Postman's earthly possessions. Trick is, how
    to save them and his life at the same time. He spies an
    old wrench: remnant of an attempt to remove the rusty
    bolts holding the ball in place. An idea begins to take
    shape.

                               LEAD BANDIT (O.S.)
                 Just you start tossing those
                 cigarettes down!


    BANDITS

    There's no answer.     The Bandits eye each other nervously.

                               BANDIT #20
                 Maybe he fell asleep.

                                                     (CONTINUED)

                                                             9.

    76 BALL

    The Postman grabs the wrench, starts working one of the
    last two rusted bolts. As it starts to give...

                               THE POSTMAN
                 It's going to take a second.    I
                 got my stuff bolted in.


    BANDITS

    The Lead Bandit takes a cautious step back.

                               LEAD BANDIT
                 Put some buckshot through it,
                 Martin. Just to hurry him up.

                               HULKING BANDIT
                 I only got three shells left.

                               LEAD BANDIT
                 So use his gun.

    The Hulking Bandit picks up the carbine and aims. CLICK.
    It isn't loaded. The Hulking Bandit tosses the gun aside,
    pulls a knife from his boot. Grimly, he begins to climb.


    76 BALL

    Cramped, The Postman's busy at the base of the ball,
    trying to unscrew the last remaining bolt. It won't
    budge.


    LADDER

    The Hulking Bandit has only a few more rungs to go.


    76 BALL

    No good.   Time's up.   The Postman starts rocking the pole.


    LADDER

    The Hulking Bandit has reached the opening -- feels the
    rocking motion. Hangs on.

                                                     (CONTINUED)

    76 BALL

    Knife in hand, the Hulking Bandit looks inside. At that
    instant, The Postman rocks the pole one more time. The
    rusty bolt is not enough to keep the ball's full weight in
    place. It pops. The ball is frozen for an instant before
    going with the pole's tilt.


    LADDER

    The 76 ball drops off the pole, rolling over the Hulking
    Bandit's back and down the ladder's incline. The other
    Bandits dive clear as the 76 ball hurtles past.


    THE POSTMAN

    whips head over heels as the ball speeds away.


    FIELD

    The 76 ball launches off a dirt berm, but soon comes to a
    stop as it slams into an old utility pole and bursts
    apart. Fighting the vertigo, The Postman staggers to his
    feet.

                               THE POSTMAN
                 Bill!

    Bill bolts from the station as the Lead Bandit raises the
    RIFLE and FIRES at The Postman.

    Losing balance, The Postman lands on his butt just before
    a bullet splinters the utility pole above his head.
    Wobbly, he tries to gather his packs. The Bandits charge,
    quickly closing the ground, but Bill is there first.

    Holding as much as he can, The Postman heaves himself over
    Bill's back. As the mule gallops away, the Lead Bandit
    aims the rifle. He's got The Postman in his sights.

    He's about to fire when -- Bandit #20 stands up INTO the
    SHOT. He's got a fistful of cigarettes in each hand and
    he's laughing like a hyena!

                               BANDIT #20
                 We're rich!

                                                            11.

9    EXT. OVERLOOK HILL (IDAHO) - DAY                             9

     The Postman sits on a rock, holding Bill's halter so the
     mule must face him. They are in the midst of an argument.

                             THE POSTMAN
               It's true, we haven't done this in
               a while, but it's like riding a
               bicycle. Now, open your mouth.

     The Postman pries his mouth open. Taking a toothbrush, he
     tends to Bill's teeth, then gives him an appraising look.
     BILL BRAYS.

                             THE POSTMAN
               I know the rule. It's my rule!
               Avoid civilization at all costs.
               But we gotta eat, don't we?
                      (as BILL BRAYS again)
               What are you so worried about,
               Bill? All you gotta do is stand
               there. I'm the one with all the
               lines.

     The Postman leads the mule down the hill toward the town
     far below. Making his case all the while -- even as BILL
     BRAYS in protest.


10   EXT. VILLAGE SQUARE (IDAHO) - DAY                            10

     A patch of mud. In the center of the square fifty
     townspeople stand before a plank stage where The Postman
     wraps up a performance of MacBeth. He plays it with a
     mis-remembered gusto the people enjoy. Children
     especially are enamored. A heavily-muscled man, WOODY,
     lingers on the fringe of the crowd -- watching The Postman
     with inscrutable intensity.

                             THE POSTMAN
               They said, 'Fear not, MacBeth,
               'til Birnam Wood comes to
               Dunsinane'!

     He looks off stage for someone, but no one appears.

                             THE POSTMAN
               I said, Birnam Wood comes to
               Dunsinane!

     Bill trots on-stage. Covered with twigs, BILL is Birnam
     Wood. He BRAYS lustily. The audience laughs in delight.
     The children clap. Only Woody seems unaffected.

                                                    (CONTINUED)

                                                              12.

     The Postman grabs two wooden swords -- he knows it's going
     well.

                                THE POSTMAN
                  Arm, arm yourselves! If the
                  witch's words are true, there'll
                  be no running or hiding here!

     Shaking off the twigs, Bill takes one of the swords in his
     mouth. The two of them dash back and forth pretending to
     fight off an imaginary attack. Finally, The Postman looks
     out at the audience, remembers the words the best he can.

                                THE POSTMAN
                  Tomorrow, and tomorrow, and the
                  day after that. Out brief candle!
                  Life's but a walking shadow, a
                  poor player that struts his hour
                  upon the stage and is heard no
                  more. It's a tale told by a
                  moron. Full of sound and fury,
                  signifying nothing.
                         (waves sword)
                  But blow, wind! Come wrack! At
                  least we'll die with the harness
                  off our back!

     The audience erupts in applause. But Woody stands still
     as stone. The Postman takes a bow. Even Bill does a
     cross-legged dip. Knowing when to quit, he steps off the
     stage to many hearty handshakes.

     Woody watches his every move. MRS. THOMPSON, one of the
     town's leaders, steps up. She's accompanied by crotchety
     old CURMUDGEON LARRY.

                                MRS. THOMPSON
                  The children have never heard
                  Shakespeare before.

                                THE POSTMAN
                         (grinning)
                  They still haven't.

     The Curmudgeon is still clapping.

                                 THE POSTMAN
                  Thanks.   You're very nice.

                                CURMUDGEON LARRY
                  I'm clapping because you stink.

                  I don't think you understand how
                  it works.

                                CURMUDGEON LARRY
                  When I was young, I tried to be an
                  actor. I was awful. But now I
                  won't die thinking I was the worst
                  one.

                                THE POSTMAN
                  I'm glad I could help.

                                MRS. THOMPSON
                  Larry, stop it.
                         (to The Postman)
                  You were very good.

                                THE POSTMAN
                  Good enough to get something to
                  eat?

     Before she can answer, a SENTRY cries...

                                 SENTRY
                  Holnists!   Holnists are coming!

     All eyes look down the road leading into town. A raiding
     party of Holnist Cavalry are on their way in. Mrs.
     Thompson sees The Postman's concern.

                               MRS. THOMPSON
                  It's okay. We give them food and
                  supplies. All the towns do.

                                MAN #1
                  They hardly kill anyone lately.
                  Just take a woman sometimes.

                                THE POSTMAN
                  Well, I'd just as soon not give
                  them anything of mine. Let's find
                  the back door, Bill.

     The Postman gathers his stuff, slings packs onto Bill.

     The forty Holnists in orange and black uniforms ride in.
     They're armed with mostly pistols and rifles. Some carry
     bows, knives, spear guns and swords. On their bare
     shoulders, branded into the flesh -- the number "8."

     Out front, always leading by example is, GENERAL
     BETHLEHEM. Tough, smart, merciless with style. Commander
     of the United Clans of Holn. Nothing escapes his eye.

     A little behind him is the mysteriously silent Colonel
     Getty, second in command.

     The Postman, finished packing, begins to move from
     building to building -- careful not to attract any
     attention.

                                BETHLEHEM (O.S.)
                  What are you doing there?

     The Postman freezes, turns, is relieved to find
     Bethlehem's not talking to him at all. The General looks
     down from his horse at children playing an impromptu game
     of "Birnam Wood."

     The children stop, stare at their feet. Bethlehem affects
     a "kindly" smile to accompany his gentler tone.

                                BETHLEHEM
                  I said, what are you doing?

     Meantime, The Postman continues his surreptitious escape.
     The MAYOR hurries forward to greet Bethlehem.

                                MAYOR
                  It's just a game, General
                  Bethlehem. Something they saw in
                  a play. No harm in it.

                                BETHLEHEM
                  A play?
                         (to kids)
                  Show me. It's all right,
                  children, show me.

     One BRAVE BOY finds his voice, barely.

                                BRAVE BOY
                  Arm, arm yourselves! No running
                  from the witches!

                                BETHLEHEM
                         (surprised)
                  Shakespeare, is it? Well, I'm
                  sorry I missed it.

                                MAYOR
                  You should know, sir, we haven't
                  nearly stocked the game we thought
                  we would.

                                 BETHLEHEM
                  Really?   But you had time for a
                  play?

     Head down, The Postman makes for "the back way." But it's
     guarded by three daunting Holnist soldiers. No getting by
     them. The Postman does a quick 180, goes back the way he
     came.

     Bethlehem looks at the frightened townsfolk.

                                BETHLEHEM
                  I'm taking three conscripts from
                  each town. They will have the
                  honor of serving in the Holnist
                  Army until such time as I see fit.
                         (to Mayor)
                  Three men. You suppose you could
                  do that?

     The Mayor nods in acquiescence. Bethlehem looks to a
     Holnist officer. The officer, IDAHO, steps up and
     addresses the town.

                                IDAHO
                  All men between 15 and 50 and of
                  suitable ethnic foundation are
                  required to show themselves now.

     The Holnist soldiers fan out, prodding any likely or
     unwilling candidates forward.

     The Postman is now walking behind Bethlehem. Some of the
     Townspeople cast him a furtive glance as he makes his way
     toward the open courtyard and, ultimately, the gate out of
     town.

     Three conscripts are hustled before Bethlehem. He looks
     over the first -- Woody. Smells him. Not much of a
     decision here.

                                 BETHLEHEM
                  Acceptable.

                                 IDAHO
                  Sir?

                                BETHLEHEM
                  Acceptable, Captain!

     The second -- a thin teenager. Bethlehem feels his arm,
     turns his head from side to side.

                                BETHLEHEM
                  You'll need to put some meat on,
                  but I like an impressionable mind.
                  Acceptable.

     The third -- an innocuous man. Or so we think. Bethlehem
     stares hard at his olive skin, traces a finger over the
     bump on the man's nose.

                                 BETHLEHEM
                  Mongoloid.   Unacceptable.

     Soldiers shove the man back into the crowd. The Brave Boy
     that was playing Birnam Wood allows himself a tiny smile
     when he sees that The Postman might make it.

                                BETHLEHEM
                  I want pure blood. Someone
                  like...

     Bethlehem notes the Boy, turns to see the object of his
     attention, and spots The Postman leaving out the front
     gate.

                                   BETHLEHEM
                  That man.

     Idaho and another soldier are on it. The Postman tries to
     back away as the two dismount and come toward him.

                                THE POSTMAN
                  You don't understand...

     But Idaho and the soldier aren't programmed for
     explanations -- they grab him.

                                IDAHO
                  You were required to show
                  yourself.

                                THE POSTMAN
                  But, I'm not with these people.
                  I'm just passing through. I --

     Idaho silences him with a rifle butt to the head.
     Everything falls OUT OF FOCUS

                                   IDAHO (O.S.)
                  Take the mule.

11   EXT. HOLNIST TRAINING CAMP (WESTERN IDAHO) - DAY             11

     Spread out in the valley is General Bethlehem's Holnist
     Expeditionary Force. A five hundred-man army enjoying all
     the comforts a bivouac can offer.

     19 head-shaved CONSCRIPTS, including Woody and The
     Postman, are held in a cramped, barbed wired pen. They
     watch as three more are shoved inside. One of them is
     Bandit #20. He and The Postman come face to face,
     recognize each other.

                              BANDIT #20
               Hi.

                             THE POSTMAN
                      (astonished)
               Hi?

     The Postman steps toward him, Bandit #20 backs off
     quickly.

                             BANDIT #20
               Well... I mean, we know each
               other, kind of...

                              THE POSTMAN
               Kind of.

                             BANDIT #20
                      (looking around)
               Wow!

                             THE POSTMAN
               So what did you guys do with my
               cigarettes?

                             BANDIT #20
               We traded them for a woman.

                              THE POSTMAN
               Wonderful.   What happened to your
               partners?

                             BANDIT #20
               They traded me to the Holnists.

     General Bethlehem approaches on horseback. Colonel Getty
     follows behind. Bethlehem looks his new recruits over.
     Dismounting, he enters the pen and walks among them.

                                BETHLEHEM
                  Welcome, gentlemen, to your new
                  life. You have been born again as
                  soldiers in the army of the United
                  Clans of Holn. The strong have
                  been sapped by the whimpering
                  propaganda of the weak. Men,
                  strong men, have been denied their
                  destiny. You men have been saved
                  from that fate. Redemption is
                  within your grasp.

     He starts down the line, looking the men over. He stops
     in front of a GANGLY RECRUIT. The Postman is alongside.

                                BETHLEHEM
                  You. What did you do before you
                  were given this opportunity?

                                GANGLY RECRUIT
                  I had a shovel. I digged holes.

     Bethlehem regards him benevolently.

                                BETHLEHEM
                  You digged holes... Well, now
                  you're going to fill them.
                         (turns to Postman)
                  And you?

                                 THE POSTMAN
                  Me?

                                BETHLEHEM
                  Is there any question in anyone's
                  mind that I was talking to you?
                  Yes, you. You look like a
                  dangerous man. Are you?

                                THE POSTMAN
                  I'm just a performer.
                  Shakespeare. Stuff like that.

                                 BETHLEHEM
                  Shakespeare?

                                THE POSTMAN
                  He was a writer. He --

                                BETHLEHEM
                  I know who Shakespeare was... 'Cry
                  "Havoc!" and let slip the dogs of
                  war.'

     Bethlehem says the lines boldly, encourages his men to
     clap for him. He looks at The Postman expectantly.
     Finally...

                                THE POSTMAN
                  I, um, you want a line?

     Bethlehem nods.     The Postman thinks a moment...

                                THE POSTMAN
                  'To be or not to be: That is the
                  question.'

     Bethlehem looks at his men as if to say, "Is this all this
     guy's got?" Bethlehem eyes The Postman; he wants a
     contest.

                                BETHLEHEM
                  'We few, we happy few, we band of
                  brothers.'

     The Holnists clap, they know their General can best this
     guy.

                                THE POSTMAN
                         (gaining confidence)
                  'Now is the winter of our
                  discontent made glorious summer by
                  this son of York.'

     Bethlehem claps The Postman on the back.

                                BETHLEHEM
                  You're pretty good. You're also a
                  fighter. I see it in your eyes.

     The Postman doesn't answer. Hesitant, he doesn't want to
     get into any more trouble than he's already in.

                                BETHLEHEM
                  Don't you agree? Come on, a man's
                  got to speak his mind.

     Bethlehem sounds sincere.    He seems like a good guy.

                                THE POSTMAN
                  I don't mean any disrespect, sir,
                  but you'd be better off just
                  letting me go. A fighter is about
                  the last thing I am.

                                                       (CONTINUED)

                                                                20.

     The Postman doubles over as Bethlehem hooks a fist into
     his gut. Bethlehem clubs him in the head, dropping him to
     his knees, then digs a boot into his side. The Postman
     goes down.

                                BETHLEHEM
                  Don't you think I should be the
                  judge of that, soldier?

     The Postman gasps to catch his breath.

                                 BETHLEHEM
                  Get up.   I said, get up.

     The Postman staggers to his feet. Blood trickles from his
     nose as he stares across at Bethlehem.

                                BETHLEHEM
                  Put up your fists.

                                   THE POSTMAN
                  You'd win.

     Bethlehem looks to Getty. CLICK. Getty shoves a PISTOL
     is into The Postman's ear. The Postman reluctantly raises
     his fists. Bethlehem gives him a satisfied nod.

                                   BETHLEHEM
                  Now fight.

     The Postman takes a tentative step forward. Bethlehem
     drives him back with a flurry of blows. The Postman is
     dazed, nearly out on his feet. Bethlehem holds him up.

                                BETHLEHEM
                  You're right. You're not a
                  fighter. But you will be. I'm
                  giving you a chance at a life that
                  means something. A life worth
                  living.

     That said, Bethlehem delivers one last blow to The
     Postman's face. Everything goes BLACK...


12   EXT. HOLNIST TRAINING CAMP (WESTERN IDAHO) - DAWN                12

     A brutal REVEILLE BLASTS the sleeping conscripts awake.

                                   IDAHO (O.S.)
                  Let's move it.     Everybody up and
                  at 'em.

     The Postman comes to. He licks his dry, blood-caked lips.
     A sudden movement startles him -- it's Woody, shoving him
     a battered cup of water. It's like he's been keeping
     watch. The Postman is surprised, a little suspicious, and
     very grateful as he gulps the water down.

                                 THE POSTMAN
                  Thanks.   Did I win?

     Woody shakes his head "no."

                                THE POSTMAN
                  I tried to tell him...

                                  WOODY
                  Say it again.

                                  THE POSTMAN
                  Say what?

                                WOODY
                  The words you said in town. About
                  the wind blowing. And the rest...
                  Say it again.

                                 THE POSTMAN
                  'Blow, wind. Come wrack. At
                  least we'll die with the harness
                  off our back.'

                                WOODY
                  What's it mean?

                                THE POSTMAN
                  Live free or die.

     Woody and The Postman scramble to fall-to with the other
     conscripts. Idaho surveys the ranks.

                                IDAHO
                  All right, girls. We're gonna
                  run. Twenty miles. With packs.
                  You got three hours. Everybody
                  makes it. Or nobody eats.


13   EXT. TRAINING CAMP - MESS LINE - CLOSE ON MEAT - DAY           13

     A COOK dumps a scoop of gristly, gray meat into each mess
     pail as the conscripts wait in line. They fall to
     ravenously, too hungry to taste how bad it is. Idaho
     supervises.

                                                      (CONTINUED)

                  Eat up!    You got meat tonight.

     The line has almost passed. Just The Postman left and
     Bandit #20 bringing up the rear. Idaho looks at The
     Postman, addresses the COOK.

                                IDAHO
                  Why don't you tell Shakespeare
                  what kind of meat that is.

                                  COOK
                  Mule.

     Probably Bill -- and The Postman knows it. He stares in
     revulsion at the putrid meat ladled into his pail.

                                IDAHO
                  A godawful animal. The sterile
                  offspring of a horse and a donkey.
                  Can you imagine that?! There's no
                  room in this new world for a
                  bastard like that.

     Bandit #20 holds out his pail.       But the cook won't fill
     it.

                                  IDAHO
                  Uh uh.
                         (loudly; for all)
                  Any man last in line ain't hungry
                  enough. You show up last, you
                  don't eat!

     Bandit #20 steps away in disbelief. Not knowing what else
     to do, he sits down beside The Postman, the only man with
     food who isn't eating.

                                BANDIT #20
                  I'll die before I'm last in line
                  again.

                                THE POSTMAN
                  That's what they're hoping for.

     He holds his pail out to Bandit #20.

                                 BANDIT #20
                  Serious?   This isn't bad.

     Lost in despair, The Postman stares out at the skewed
     palette.

                                THE POSTMAN
                  These were supposed to be the best
                  years of my life.

14   EXT. TRAINING GROUNDS - DAY                                  14

     The conscripts stand at attention under the guard of Idaho
     and two other soldiers. To their right is a dead oak
     tree. Behind them, three rows of folding chairs.

     Two figures approach. Bethlehem and Getty. Getty carries
     a sheathed sword. Bethlehem surveys the troops -- taking
     no more notice of The Postman than anyone else.

                             BETHLEHEM
               The laws of eight, gentlemen.
               That is the legacy handed down to
               us by Nathan Holn.

     At the mention of this name, the RECRUITS shout as one.

                             RECRUITS
               God rest his soul!

                             THE POSTMAN
                      (low)
               May he burn in hell.

     Getty looks over at him. He heard him. The Postman
     swallows hard. Getty stares hard. Then he turns away.
     He's not going to bust him on it.

                             BETHLEHEM
               These are the laws that we live
               by. The eight is our symbol.
               Each man will bear it with pride.

     Bethlehem nods at Idaho who pushes up his own sleeve to
     reveal the branded 8.

                             BETHLEHEM
               Only then will you be part of the
               clan. Sit down, gentlemen.

     The men move to sit in one of the three rows. Only then
     does it become apparent that there are 18 men and only 17
     chairs. One SLOW RECRUIT is left standing. It doesn't
     take him long to realize that he's in trouble.

                             BETHLEHEM
               Law One. You will obey orders
               without question.
                      (to Slow Recruit)
               I told you to sit.

                             SLOW RECRUIT
                      (scared)
               There weren't enough chairs.

                                                                 24.

                                BETHLEHEM
                  I didn't specify chairs. You
                  could've sat down on the ground.

     The Slow Recruit moves to do so.

                                 BETHLEHEM
                  You disobeyed a direct order.    You
                  broke Law One.

     Idaho and another soldier step up beside the Slow Recruit.

                                 BETHLEHEM
                  Law Two.   Punishment shall be
                  swift.

     They hustle the Recruit to the tree. Idaho unslings a
     coil of rope, throws it over a tree limb. They quickly
     slip a loop over the Slow Recruit's ankles and haul him
     upside down into the air.

                                BETHLEHEM
                  Law Three: Mercy is for the weak.
                  Four: Terror will defeat reason.
                  Five: Your allegiance is to the
                  clan. Six: Justice can be
                  dictated. Law Seven. Any
                  clansman may challenge for
                  leadership of the clan. Does any
                  man here wish to challenge me?

     There are no takers.

                                  BETHLEHEM
                  On your feet!

     The conscripts stand like jackknives snapping open.

     Without a word, without a look -- Bethlehem reaches out
     and draws a sword from a sheath that Getty holds.
     Bethlehem steps to the Slow Recruit -- who slowly twists
     around.

                               BETHLEHEM
                  Law Eight: There is only one
                  penalty: Death.

     Bethlehem raises the sword.

                                SLOW RECRUIT
                  Please, I'm begging you.

                                                         (CONTINUED)

                                                                 25.

     THE POSTMAN

     As the sword finds its mark.     Bethlehem looks at him, but
     addresses all.

                                BETHLEHEM
                  You will get out of this army what
                  you put into it. Work and you'll
                  be fed. Fight and you'll be
                  respected. Die and you'll be
                  remembered. It's up to you.

     Bethlehem turns and walks away.     Getty following behind.
     The Postman watches as they go.     Idaho steps up to him.

                                IDAHO
                  You thinking of challenging for
                  leadership of the clan?

                                 THE POSTMAN
                  No, sir.   I'm a follower not a
                  leader.

                                IDAHO
                  You see Colonel Getty? Always
                  following the General? He's the
                  only man who ever challenged.
                  Fight lasted six seconds, but the
                  General didn't kill him. He cut
                  off his tongue and he cut off his
                  balls and old Getty's been
                  following him like a dog ever
                  since.

     The Postman looks back to see Bethlehem and Getty
     disappear into the gloom. Idaho grins, likes how this
     affects a new man.

     The Postman moves on.     Idaho stops Woody as he passes.

                                IDAHO
                  The General don't see it, but I
                  say you got some nigger in you.

     Woody clenches his jaw, but wisely doesn't answer.


15   EXT. PLAINS - DAY                                                 15

     Rain as the army moves. Boots suck at the mud. War
     wagons heave out of ruts. A monster gun is mounted on an
     old John Deere semi, pulled by a team of ten horses. The
     conscripts fill the middle ranks, each bearing a heavy
     pack.

                                                       (CONTINUED)

     Marching beside Woody, The Postman stares blankly ahead.
     The cry to halt. The conscripts unsling their packs,
     catch their breath. Idaho pulls The Postman out of line.

                                IDAHO
                  The General would like a word with
                  you, Shakespeare.


16   INT. GENERAL BETHLEHEM'S TENT - DAY                             16

     Bethlehem stands before a painter's easel, palette in
     hand. He's got a mirror set up so he can see his
     reflection. He's doing a self-portrait in the tradition
     of the great Dutch Masters -- but it's a dismal failure.

     He continues painting even as Idaho leads The Postman in.
     Idaho salutes, steps back. For a moment, The Postman
     doesn't quite know what to do.

                                 BETHLEHEM
                         (re: the book and
                          binoculars on the
                          table)
                  They're yours. A solitary man,
                  aren't you? Binoculars. To watch
                  life from a distance. And
                  Shakespeare. To read about it
                  instead of living it.

     Bethlehem wants an answer.    The Postman clears his throat.

                                THE POSTMAN
                  No offense, General, but you seem
                  to have read some Shakespeare
                  yourself.

                                BETHLEHEM
                  If he wishes to rise above mere
                  thuggery, a military commandeer
                  must be classically educated.
                  Philosophy, history. Even a sense
                  of the dramatic.
                         (a beat)
                  Do you know what I did before the
                  war? Do you think I was in the
                  army? I sold copying machines. I
                  was a salesman. The talent to
                  lead men and devise and execute a
                  battle plan were locked away
                  inside me.

     He picks up Finding A Way to Win by Nathan Holn.     A 20-
     year-old self-help book.

                                BETHLEHEM
                  If Nathan Holn hadn't come along,
                  I'd still be selling copying
                  machines. Can you imagine the
                  wasted life? Can you imagine the
                  magnitude of it? But war... War
                  gives men like me a chance.

     He turns to a dog-eared page in the book.

                                 BETHLEHEM
                  Here... 'The prize is often left
                  unclaimed. Have the courage to
                  grasp it. For fortune always
                  favors the bold.'
                         (moved)
                  It always inspires me.
                         (beat)
                  I have a design for the future. A
                  master plan. I'll need able
                  officers to carry it out. You
                  have the intelligence. If your
                  heart matches, you'll go far.
                         (a beat)
                  We'll talk more in the weeks to
                  come. Dismissed.

     The Postman leaves.     Idaho stands at the ready.

                                BETHLEHEM
                  Issue the binoculars to a scout.

                                IDAHO
                  And the book, sir?

                                 BETHLEHEM
                  Burn it.

     Idaho leaves. Bethlehem goes back to his painting. He
     considers himself in the mirror. After a long stare-down,
     he shouts:

                                 BETHLEHEM
                  Quit moving.


17   EXT. CAMP - DAY                                                17

     The Postman rejoins the conscripts. Bandit #20 slides
     over.

                                   BANDIT #20
                  What happened?

     Troubled, The Postman doesn't answer. He heads for a
     corner where Woody stands alone. Relentless, Bandit #20
     follows.

                                BANDIT #20
                  What did he say?

                                   THE POSTMAN
                  Nothing.

                                BANDIT #20
                  Did he say anything about me?

                                   THE POSTMAN
                  No.

     They reach the quiet corner; it's just the three of them.

                                THE POSTMAN
                  We got to get out of here.

                                BANDIT #20
                  What are you talking about?

                                THE POSTMAN
                  Escaping.
                         (low)
                  You ever hear of St. Rose? It's
                  on the coast. They say it's a
                  paradise. They've even got
                  electric lights.

     Bandit #20 looks scared, Woody unreadable.

                                   BANDIT #20
                  We can't.

                                THE POSTMAN
                  Between the three of us, we
                  could --

                                BANDIT #20
                  No, no. I can't. I like it here.
                  I like being a part of something.

     The Postman can't believe what Bandit #20 just said.
     Bandit #20 turns, hurries away.

     The Postman looks to Woody who doesn't tip his hand either
     way. He moves away as well.

                                                                29.

18   EXT. CAMP - DAY                                                  18

     The conscripts break camp. Hot work. Glistening with
     sweat, The Postman stops to stretch. Across the way, he
     sees Bandit #20 talking to Getty. Getty glances at The
     Postman who returns to work, watches under his eyebrows as
     Idaho joins the group. There's trouble brewing here.

     Worried, The Postman looks to Woody, who watches the
     exchange as well. He is, as usual, inscrutable.


19   EXT. CLEARING - RIVER - DAY                                      19

     The river is swollen and swift from the spring thaw.
     Marching along the east ridge above it, the army is given
     the order to halt.

     The Postman looks ahead to where Idaho confers with
     Bethlehem. Something's wrong. They look to where:

     Two carbine-toting soldiers stand alertly at guard by a
     thicket across the river. A rotten wood and rope bridge
     spans the space between the ridges.

     Idaho rides to the conscripts:

                             IDAHO
               One of you dogs has earned himself
               a treat. Over there.

     Idaho points to the thicket as he proceeds down the line.

                             IDAHO
               Those men hunted themselves a lion
               this morning. Must've been a zoo
               around here before the war.
               Anyhow, they shot him and he
               crawled into that thicket. A
               third man went in after him. We
               don't know if he's dead or alive.
               I need a volunteer. Someone's
               gotta go in and get our boy out.

     No volunteers, except the zealot Bandit #20.

                               BANDIT #20
               I'll go.

     Idaho ignores him, stops in front of Woody.

                             IDAHO
               I guess size ain't a measure of
               courage, is it? Shakespeare!

     The fix is in.    The Postman steps out of line.

                                                        (CONTINUED)

                                                              30.

19   CONTINUED:                                                     19

     Idaho's about to hand The Postman a carbine when --

                                BETHLEHEM (O.S.)
                  I don't think so, Captain.

     Bethlehem nods to Getty. Getty takes a hunting knife from
     a belt-sheath and tosses it, blade first, into the ground
     between The Postman's feet.

                                BETHLEHEM
                  Come out alive and you got
                  yourself a lion steak.

     Hefting the knife, The Postman stares at the west ridge.

                                 IDAHO
                         (winks)
                  Maybe you'll find your St. Rose up
                  there.

     The Postman looks to Bandit #20 who stares back defiantly.

                                IDAHO
                  What are you waiting for,
                  Christmas?

     Bandit #20 can't contain his giggling, so Idaho backhands
     the sound out of him -- then looks back to The Postman.

     Grim The Postman starts forward, looks from the rotten
     bridge to the water and back again as he moves.

     All eyes on him as he starts across...


20   EXT. BRIDGE - DAY                                              20

     The Postman steps lightly. Far below, the river rages. A
     knotty plank starts to crack underfoot. Scooting off it,
     he takes a last look around. Continues across to...


21   EXT. WEST RIDGE - DAY                                          21

     The soldiers greet him -- unholy smiles on their ugly
     mugs. They point him ahead, prod him forward toward a
     trail of wet blood which leads deeper into the thicket.

     Stooping, The Postman enters. The soldiers split off and
     track along with him on either side of the thicket.

                                                               31.

22   EXT. THICKET - DAY                                              22

     Thorns catch and tear at his clothes as The Postman pushes
     his way through. He freezes. Ahead, sprawled and
     twisted, the mauled, bloody corpse of a Holnist soldier.

                               SOLDIER (O.S.)
                 Why are you stopping?

                                  THE POSTMAN
                 I found him.

                                  SOLDIER (O.S.)
                 He alive?

     Clearly he is not.

                                  THE POSTMAN
                 Yeah.

                                  SOLDIER (O.S.)
                 Bring him out.

     The Postman heaves the corpse onto his back. Rising,
     steadying himself, he looks back over his shoulders at a
     GUTTURAL GROWL. He hurries forward.


     ARMY

     Everyone stares across the river, straining to see as The
     Postman emerges with the corpse on his back.


     ON BRIDGE

     The Postman starts across, hampered by his burden.   He
     pauses, at his feet, the cracked, knotty plank.

                               IDAHO
                        (across river)
                 Hurry up! You still got a lion to
                 bag!

     The Postman decides, deliberately steps on the PLANK.
     CRACK. The Postman and the corpse drop thirty feet down,
     disappear in the river below.

     The corpse surfaces first, floats in the water.

     Then The Postman. Farther down the river. Swimming
     downstream with powerful strokes. Between his efforts and
     the current, he's being quickly swept away from the
     Holnists.

     As Bethlehem's eyes narrow in fury.

                                                     (CONTINUED)

                                                              32.

     A RIFLE BARKS a SHELL BACK after The Postman, but he
     disappears around a bend in the river.

     Bethlehem signals to two soldiers. They start running
     along the east ridge toward the riverbend.

     Two more start across the bridge to the west -- moving
     with military precision.

     Bethlehem wheels toward the conscripts, points out Woody.

                                BETHLEHEM
                  In the water. Come back without
                  him and you and another man will
                  die in his place.

     Woody dives in the water. Bethlehem looks to Idaho who
     dives in as well. Conscripts buzz with nervous
     excitement.

                                CONSCRIPTS
                  Go!   Go!

                                BANDIT #20
                         (caught up)
                  I'll get him, sir.

     He takes off running across the bridge.


23   EXT. RIVER - DAY                                               23

     A fallen tree spans the river. As The Postman is swept
     beneath, he reaches up and catches hold. Pulling himself
     out of the water, he scrambles for the west shore. He
     disappears into the woods as two soldiers appear.

     They catch hold of the tree, look to the west banking, see
     footprints in the mud where The Postman pulled himself
     out. They start after him.


24   EXT. CLEARING - WOODS - DAY                                    24

     Clothes in tatters, his lungs ready to burst, The Postman
     stops. He takes cover as the two soldiers run past.

     Breathing hard, The Postman steps out, starts across the
     clearing. He's halfway when Bandit #20 steps out from the
     trees. They look at each other for a moment.

                                THE POSTMAN
                  Just let me go. I don't want to
                  be part of your army.

                                                     (CONTINUED)

                                                             33.

24   CONTINUED:                                                    24

     Bandit #20 hesitates for a moment, then breaks into a
     grin.

                                 BANDIT #20
                  My army.   I like the sound of
                  that.

     The Postman gestures with his knife.

                                  THE POSTMAN
                  Don't --

                                 BANDIT #20
                  I got him!   Over --

     The Postman lunges, digs into Bandit #20's gut.   He blinks
     in surprise, then sags to the ground.

     The Postman takes a step back. A shadow falls over him.
     It's Woody. Staring down at The Postman. They can hear
     others approaching from the river.

                                WOODY
                  They sent me to kill you.

                                  THE POSTMAN
                  Come with me.

     At that moment, Idaho and the second soldier come into the
     clearing. Idaho grins, relaxes his grip on his gun when
     he sees the mismatch between Woody and The Postman.

                                 IDAHO
                  Good, boy.   Get him.

                                WOODY
                  It's you or me.

                                  THE POSTMAN
                  I know.

                                  IDAHO
                  Finish it.

     Woody circles The Postman, until he's facing Idaho and the
     soldier. Woody takes a long look at The Postman, smiles.

                                WOODY
                  No harness on my back.

     As The Postman realizes what he's doing, Woody flips his
     knife through the air and into the soldier's throat.

                                                   (CONTINUED)

                                                             34.

     As Woody rushes him, Idaho raises his GUN.

     Idaho pumps TWO ROUNDS into Woody, but the big man keeps
     coming. The THIRD ROUND finds his heart, puts Woody down.
     Dead. But not before he lands on top of Idaho.

     As Idaho struggles to get out from under Woody's massive
     frame, The Postman heads for the trees.


     Covered in Woody's blood, Idaho FIRES a ROUND as The
     Postman disappears into the woods. Idaho starts after
     him.


     IDAHO

     Tracking. He sees a dribble of fresh blood.   He touches
     it with his fingers and smiles.

     He cocks his head at MOVEMENT to his left. Smiling,
     hefting his pistol, Idaho moves in. More SHUFFLING.   Just
     ahead. He's got him now.

                                IDAHO
                  You want your St. Rose?

     There's a RUSTLE of BRUSH just before a ROAR splits the
     air. Idaho doesn't even have time to scream as the LION
     pounces down on top of him.


25   EXT. CLIFF - DAY                                              25

     The Postman, lungs heaving, stops his climb long enough to
     take stock of the Army waiting on the distant river edge.

     Strength ebbing, he heaves himself up and continues
     climbing.

                                                   DISSOLVE TO:


26   EXT. WOODS (EASTERN OREGON) - NIGHT                           26

     A chilling RAIN drills down, washing across an old forest
     road. Covered with undergrowth and dotted with saplings,
     nothing's been down here in years.

     Blue-lipped and shivering, his clothes torn and soaked,
     The Postman trudges along. He tries to rub some warmth
     back into his numbed limbs, but a coughing spell wracks
     his body.

                                                   (CONTINUED)

                                                               35.

26   CONTINUED:                                                      26

     He trudges forward, shoes heavy with freezing mud. He's
     made his escape, but he won't last the night if he doesn't
     find some shelter.

     An unnatural shape ahead, just off the road.    Square.   He
     cautiously pulls back a few branches.

     An old, rusted Jeep with faded    U.S. government markings.
     Its hood buried under the dirt    of an old mud slide. The
     Postman stoops to look through    the passenger side window,
     comes face-to-face with death.     A skeleton sits inside,
     the skull grinning against the    glass facing The Postman.


     But The Postman doesn't jump back. He just stares. The
     two heads meet halfway as The Postman's face is reflected
     on the glass, superimposed over the skull.

     A hypothermic shiver wracks his body. The Postman tries
     the door, but it won't budge. The other side of the Jeep
     is buried. But seeing that the windshield is partly
     smashed, he clears away the debris, peels back the spider-
     webbed safety glass and climbs inside.


     JEEP

     Pulling the glass back down, he looks almost shyly at the
     skeleton, like two kids about to "park" for the first
     time.

                                 THE POSTMAN
                  Hey.   How ya doin'?

     The back of the Jeep is filled with bags marked U.S. Mail.
     The Postman picks up a hat off the console. Oddly
     respectful, he runs a finger along the band over the
     "Horse & Rider" emblem.

     The Postman reaches, touches the embroidered American flag
     patch on the skeleton's jacket shoulder. Another shiver.
     A moment later, The Postman is pulling the nice dry jacket
     off the skeleton and shoving his own arms inside.

     A sloshing sound. He pats down the jacket. Finds a
     liquor. He gives the skeleton a "you shouldn't have"
     look. But the cap won't budge. He twists, pries, bangs
     the neck of the steering wheel. At last it gives. He
     takes a long, hard swallow. The warming fire streams down
     his throat.

     The Postman grabs a random letter, reads it aloud.

                                                      (CONTINUED)

                                                            36.

                                THE POSTMAN
                  'Jerry Ball, Pine View.'

     He starts to open it, looks at the skeleton and shrugs.

                                 THE POSTMAN
                  So, arrest me.
                         (reading)
                  Here's a piece of good news.
                  Jerry's decided to go to school to
                  get his contractor's license.

     Tossing it aside, he takes a drink, opens another.   The
     words are in crayon -- a child's scrawl.

                                THE POSTMAN
                         (smiles to skeleton)
                  Little Jimmy wants his grandpa to
                  know he lost a tooth.

     The Postman turns the envelope over in his palm. A tiny
     tooth falls out. The Postman considers it. This suddenly
     isn't so amusing. He puts it back in the envelope.

     Shoving mail sacks aside, he climbs in the back.
     Burrowing in, he pulls the sacks back, covering himself
     with a blanket of mail. Getting warmer already, he
     regards the skeleton a beat as the RAIN DRUMS ON the ROOF.


27   EXT. JEEP - DAY                                              27

     Wearing the blue uniform, The Postman looks down at the
     fresh grave, realizes a eulogy is in order. He takes off
     the hat, holds it over his chest for a heartfelt moment of
     silence.

                                THE POSTMAN
                  Thanks for being there for me.
                         (raising the flask)
                  Here's to you. I consider my
                  taxes very well spent.

     He swallows the last few drops, then sets the flask down
     as a headstone. What now?

                                THE POSTMAN
                  All dressed up. Nowhere to go.

                                                               37.

28   EXT. RURAL HIGHWAY (SOMEWHERE IN OREGON) - DAY                  28

     His hair growing back nicely, The Postman has reached the
     proverbial fork in the road. He considers his two
     options: "Pine View -- 32 miles." Or "Ridgemont -- 220
     miles." He looks the two roads over, thinks.

                                THE POSTMAN
                  Well, that's easy.


29   EXT. GATES (PINE VIEW, OREGON) - DUSK                           29

     The town is protected by a tall, long palisade.     Like Ft.
     Apache. All is dark as The Postman approaches.

                                THE POSTMAN
                  Greetings, Pine View, Oregon!

     TWO SENTRIES appears from the gate house.    They aim
     arrows.

                                SENTRY #1
                  Just head back the way you came.
                  Pine View ain't buying, ain't
                  listening and don't give charity.

     A moment of truth is here.    Finally, with authority:

                                THE POSTMAN
                  Civilian, I'm on official
                  business. I demand entry into the
                  town of Pine View.

                                SENTRY #2
                  What the hell are you talking
                  about?

                                THE POSTMAN
                  I'm through talking to you, buddy
                  boy! Now get somebody with
                  authority to open this gate!

     More silhouettes appear on the palisade.     One is SHERIFF
     BRISCOE, a big, no-nonsense man.

                                BRISCOE
                  I'm Sheriff Briscoe. Who the hell
                  are you?

                                THE POSTMAN
                  I'm a representative of the United
                  States Government --

     An uproar.    He makes himself heard above it.

                  restored Congress to reestablish a
                  communication route to Idaho and
                  lower Oregon. Now open that damn
                  gate!

                                BRISCOE
                  What does that mean in English?

                                THE POSTMAN
                  I'm your postman!

     There's a silent hush.

                         (to someone on wall)
                  Hand me your gun.

                                THE POSTMAN
                  Understand that tampering with or
                  obstructing the mail is a federal
                  offense. Furthermore, the Bolin
                  Act requires you to provide all
                  mail carriers with sanctuary and
                  nourishment.
                         (starting forward)
                  Now open that damn gate!

                                BRISCOE
                  You got three seconds to get your
                  ass outta here.

                                THE POSTMAN
                  Is Jerry the contractor here?

     Briscoe pumps his shotgun, aims it at The Postman.

                                 THE POSTMAN
                  Wait! I'm going to get something
                  out of my bag.

     The Postman dumps the pack over, frantically shuffles
     through the letters.

                                 BRISCOE
                  One!

                                 THE POSTMAN
                  Paul Davis!   124 Vernon Street!

                                BRISCOE
                  Never heard of him. Two!

                                 THE POSTMAN
                  Lois Kent!   14 Weymoth Lane!

                                 BRISCOE
                  Three!

     He fumbles for the last letter.       Briscoe takes aim.

                                 THE POSTMAN
                  Irene March!   478 River Road!

     There's an absolute stunned silence.      Like a switch was
     thrown.


30   EXT. INSIDE GATES - DAY                                          30

     The crowd parts as everyone turns to look back at IRENE
     MARCH. Mrs. March, in her late 50s, is blind, her eyes
     clouded by cataracts. In disbelief...

                                MRS. MARCH
                  Did he say my name?

     The sense of hope is palpable as the gates are swung back.
     Two TOWNIES hurry Mrs. March out to meet The Postman.
     They're followed by a throng. As he sees she's blind...

                                 THE POSTMAN
                  Oh, no...

     Too late now. They stop Mrs. March in front of him.        She
     stares off just to his left, a little afraid.

                                MRS. MARCH
                  I'm Irene March.

                                THE POSTMAN
                         (uncomfortable)
                  I have a letter for you.

     He presses it into her hands, but she won't take it.

                                MRS. MARCH
                  Would you read it?

                                THE POSTMAN
                  I'm sure it's personal.

                                 MRS. MARCH
                  Please.   Someone has to.

                                                        (CONTINUED)

                                                                 40.

     The Postman has little choice.     As he opens the
     envelope...

                                THE POSTMAN
                  We're delivering the old stock
                  piles, but I'll accept all new
                  correspondence as well.

                                TOWNIE
                  Just read it, will ya?

     Excited, the people move closer.      Someone holds up a torch
     and The Postman starts.

                                THE POSTMAN
                  'Dear Irene. Sorry I haven't
                  written. Everything's so crazy.
                  The strange weather. The food
                  shortages. That farmer Nathan
                  Holn causing all that trouble.
                  It's hard to understand. David's
                  home from the Army. The war was
                  over before he even got there.
                  Thank God for that. He's still my
                  baby no matter how big he gets.
                  We're going to miss you for
                  Christmas, but maybe next year.
                  All our love. Donna.'

     Mrs. March reaches out a trembling hand to take the
     letter.

                                MRS. MARCH
                  My sister in Denver. Fifteen
                  years ago. Thank you.

     The populace erupts with excitement.        Mrs. March takes The
     Postman's hand, clasps it tightly.

                                MRS. MARCH
                  You're a Godsend. A savior.

     The Postman pulls his hand back, rejects the title.

                                 THE POSTMAN
                  No.   I'm just... a postman.

     An almost awesome silence.     Too much for The Postman.

                                THE POSTMAN
                  I've been on the road a while. I
                  could use a little something to
                  eat --

                                 MRS. MARCH
                  Oh, yes, absolutely... Is there
                  anything else?

     The townspeople welcome him with cheers. The Postman
     raises a silencing hand. As they quiet...

                                THE POSTMAN
                  Yes, there is! If there are dogs
                  in this town, you have to leash
                  them while I'm here!

     Only The Postman laughs. No one else reacts. Briscoe
     watches dubiously from the wall as the people surround The
     Postman and sweep him through the gates and into town.

     One couple watches The Postman closely as he makes his way
     into town. She is ABBY -- a sweet-faced, pretty woman.
     Her husband, MICHAEL, is a decent-looking sort, tall and
     strong.


31   INT. ABANDONED HOTEL - ROOM 7 - NIGHT                         31

     A freestanding tub has been set up, water "bucketed" in.
     The Postman luxuriates in his first hot bath in years and
     sings a familiar tune to himself.

                               THE POSTMAN
                  'Stop. Oh, yes, wait a minute,
                  Mr. Postman. Waaa-ait, Mr.
                  Postman...'


32   EXT. PARKING LOT (PINE VIEW) - NIGHT                          32

     FORD crosses the parking lot of an abandoned motel. He's
     a black kid, maybe 16, too young to remember any other
     life but this. He carries The Postman's uniform on a
     hanger.


33   INT. ABANDONED HOTEL - ROOM 7 - NIGHT                         33

     The Postman looks up at a KNOCK. Ford steps in. Like
     most kids, he needs a hero. Holding up the uniform, he
     just found one.

                                FORD
                         (beaming)
                  Cleaned and pressed, sir.

                                                     (CONTINUED)

                                                               42.

33   CONTINUED:                                                      33

                                THE POSTMAN
                  Thanks. Didn't somebody say
                  something about dinner?

                                FORD
                  Yeah, I'm supposed to take you to
                  Foster's.
                         (extending a hand)
                  My name's Ford. Ford Lincoln
                  Mercury.

     The Postman just nods, hoisting himself out of the tub and
     hurriedly wrapping a towel around himself.

                                FORD
                  Used to be John Stevens, but I
                  changed it on account of I want to
                  drive cars.

     Hoping to impress, Ford reaches into a pocket, pulls out a
     worn, creased flyer for a "Ford Lincoln Mercury"
     dealership. Ford finds The Postman just staring at him,
     waiting for the uniform he's still got in his hand.
     Embarrassed, Ford quickly hands it over.


34   EXT. STREET (PINE VIEW) - NIGHT                                 34

     Ford leads the way as they leave the motel behind. The
     Postman looks good in his uniform. They cross a parking
     lot where five partly-stripped cars have been sitting for
     years. There's a potted plant outside the driver's door
     of one.

                                FORD
                  I live in that car. A 2003
                  Pontiac Sinatra. With a nine-
                  banger and a Q-eight.

                                THE POSTMAN
                  V-eight. Eight cylinders.   That
                  means an eight-banger.

                                FORD
                         (in awe of him)
                  Were they fast?

                                FORD
                  A buck seventy-five on a strip.

                                                       (CONTINUED)

                                                                  43.

34   CONTINUED:                                                         34

                                FORD
                  A buck seventy-five? I thought
                  maybe I could fix some of them up.
                  It's nothing compared to what you
                  do.

     This is the last thing he expected to hear out of this
     kid's mouth. A moment, then...

                                THE POSTMAN
                  The important thing to remember
                  about cars is, you can't eat 'em.

     Ahead, people are gathered inside an old Foster's Freeze.


35   INT. FOSTER'S FREEZE (PINE VIEW) - NIGHT                           35

     The townspeople fill the booths, line the walls. They
     talk excitedly amongst themselves, break into spontaneous
     applause as Ford and The Postman enter.

     The Postman is surprised, uncomfortable at this display.
     But then he sees that a banquet has been laid out on the
     counter. The centerpiece is a huge vat of steaming stew.

     The PEOPLE clear a path for him.

                                MAN #1
                  Tell us about the government!

                                WOMAN #1
                  Yes, tell us everything!

     Startled, The Postman doesn't quite know what to say.
     They seat him at a table -- but the food looks miles away.

                                MAN #2
                  Is there a President?

                                THE POSTMAN
                  Yeah.

                                WOMAN #2
                  What's his name?

                                THE POSTMAN
                  You know, I'm pretty hungry.

     But these people won't be denied.       Finally...

                                                          (CONTINUED)

35   CONTINUED:                                                       35

                                THE POSTMAN
                  His name is, uh... Richard
                  Starkey. From Maine. He has a
                  saying. 'Things are getting
                  better, getting better all the
                  time.'

     There's warm applause at that.    Several people try the
     expression out on each other.

                                MAN #3
                  He a Democrat or a Republican?

                                THE POSTMAN
                  Parties are over with. The
                  individual is what counts. You
                  vote for the best man.

     Ellen sets a steaming bowl of stew in front of The
     Postman. Famished, he digs in.

                                MAN #4
                  What about Europe? Any word?

     The Postman tries to speak through a mouthful of food.

                                THE POSTMAN
                  Lady Di's in charge. Sixty years
                  old and she still kicks ass.

                                WOMAN #3
                  Is Nathan Holn still alive?

                                THE POSTMAN
                         (smiles at irony)
                  He died. Skin cancer.

     That's sure good news to everyone.       But...

                                WOMAN #4
                  And the Holnists? They're still
                  out there. What's the government
                  going to do about them?

     The Postman looks at the desperate faces -- he'd rather
     get back to his meal -- but this may be the most important
     question of all. He doesn't want to lie.

                                THE POSTMAN
                  The government's just getting
                  started. You're on your own for
                  at least eighteen months.

                  What about the Marines Corp?

     A clamor of Holnist questions.

                                ELLEN
                  Be quiet, everyone! Can't we just
                  let this man eat?

     The people nod and The Postman finally gets to eat. He
     catches sight of Briscoe watching him from the door.
     After a moment, Briscoe leaves.


36   INT. FOSTER'S FREEZE - LATER                                   36

     A band plays an odd array of instruments. There's
     dancing. The Postman sits behind four empty bowls.
     People watch him eat like it was a religious experience.
     He pushes back the fifth bowl.

                                THE POSTMAN
                  Never thought I'd hear myself say
                  this, but I can't eat anymore.

     He's cut off by the sight of a silent, little boy.    The
     kid's looking up, staring intently at something.

                                  THE POSTMAN
                  What?

     The boy just stares.

                                  THE POSTMAN
                          (re:   the cap)
                  This?

     The boy nods. The Postman shakes his head and smiles to
     himself. He takes off the cap, sets it on the kid's head.

                                  THE POSTMAN
                  Almost fits.

     The boy's eyes go wide with wonder. His stock's gone up
     1000%. Before he can rush off to impress his friends,
     ELLEN -- his mother -- steps over and gently chides him.

                                ELLEN
                  That's not a toy, honey. That's
                  very important. Give it back.

     The boy carefully removes the cap, hands it back to The
     Postman. Ellen smiles gratefully and gently guides her
     son away.

     The Postman shrugs, turns to find Abby, the pretty woman
     we saw at the Pine View gates. She smiles at The Postman.

                                ABBY
                  Would you like to dance?

                                 THE POSTMAN
                  I don't know if I can, I think I'm
                  still on duty.

     He laughs.    Abby says nothing.

                                THE POSTMAN
                  It's been a long time.

     Abby holds out her hand like a promise.

                                ABBY
                  All you got to do is hold on.


     DANCE FLOOR

     Abby and The Postman dance.          She keeps looking him over.

                                THE POSTMAN
                  Is something wrong?

                                ABBY
                  How tall are you?

                                THE POSTMAN
                  About six feet.

                                   ABBY
                  Are you smart?

                                THE POSTMAN
                  Smarter than some I guess.       Why?

                                 ABBY
                  Just wondering. Did you ever have
                  the bad mumps?

     The Postman smiles.    She's odd, but beautiful.

                                THE POSTMAN
                  Never had the bad mumps.

                  Have you ever had herpes or
                  syphilis or anything like that?

     He shakes his head "no."    They continue to dance.

                                ABBY
                  So as far as you know, you have
                  good semen?

                                THE POSTMAN
                  Is that a trick question?

                                ABBY
                  I don't mean to be nosy. I'm only
                  asking because I want you to make
                  me pregnant.

     Stunned, The Postman stops dancing.      Abby takes this
     moment to grab Michael.

                                THE POSTMAN
                         (to himself)
                  It's got to be the uniform.

     Abby takes Michael's arm, introduces him proudly.

                                ABBY
                  This is my husband.    Michael.

     Michael smiles, shakes hands with a grave-digger's grip.
     The Postman doesn't know what to think.

                                ABBY
                  We've been trying to have a baby
                  for three years. We can't on
                  account of Michael had the bad
                  mumps when he was twelve. So we
                  need a body father. We could ask
                  a man here, but it could cause
                  trouble. I've seen it happen.
                  Things go okay until the woman
                  starts to show. Then it can be
                  bad. But you'll only be around
                  once in awhile with the mail.

     The Postman just stares at them.      Abby looks to Michael.

                                ABBY
                  He hasn't said 'no'.

                         (undaunted)
                  What do you say, mister?     You'd be
                  doing us a favor.

                                THE POSTMAN
                  I'll have to think about it.

     The Postman excuses himself with a nod and turns away,
     shaking his head at the strangeness of this new world.

     But no rest for the wicked, as soon as he's free from Abby
     and Michael, he's running smack into another group of
     well-wishing TOWNIES. Mrs. March is among them. She's
     holding an envelope.

                                TOWNIE #1
                  Mrs. March wants to give you
                  something.
                         (to Mrs. March)
                  He's right here, Irene.

                                MRS. MARCH
                         (re: letter)
                  It's to my daughter Annie. She
                  left five years ago. She was only
                  fifteen. The last I heard, she
                  was living up north...

     The Postman swallows hard, looks from the envelope to the
     faces around him, to Mrs. March. She looks blindly back.
     How can he lie to her?

                                THE POSTMAN
                  Look, Mrs. March, you should know
                  that...

                                 MRS. MARCH
                  Know what?

                                 THE POSTMAN
                  Know that...

     But she stops him, grabs for his hand.

                                MRS. MARCH
                  I have a feeling about you. I
                  know you'll do what's right.

     Her hand leaves his and she disappears into the crowd.
     She's left him with her letter and no choice at all.

                                THE POSTMAN
                  I got to get out of here.

                                                              49.

37   EXT. PINE VIEW - NIGHT                                         37

     The Postman moves through town. The streets are deserted.
     He's got his pack on, his mailbag. He passes a 7-11
     converted to a blacksmith shop. There's a horse tethered
     to the railing in front of it. He grins; maybe he's going
     to make it out of here after all. As he starts to move
     toward the horse...

                                OLD MAN (O.S.)
                  It's right around the corner.

     An OLD MAN sits on his porch across the street.

                                THE POSTMAN
                         (freezes, startled)
                  What is?

                                OLD MAN
                  What you're looking for.

     The Old Man winks knowingly, then heads inside. As The
     Postman turns the corner, he finds himself in front of the
     post office. An old brick building. Chiseled in the
     granite facing: "UNITED STATES POST OFFICE. EST. 1884."


38   INT. POST OFFICE (PINE VIEW) - NIGHT                           38

     Long ago stripped, it still has a proud, official, almost
     holy feel. The Postman wanders in, stops to read the
     credo calligraphied on the wall. "Neither snow, nor
     rain..." He turns at a SOUND. Ford is here, leaning
     against a wall.

                                FORD
                  I knew you'd come here.

                                  THE POSTMAN
                  You did, huh?

     Ford nods.    A sage sixteen-year-old.

                                FORD
                  How do you get to be a postman,
                  anyhow?

                                THE POSTMAN
                  You have to be in the right place
                  at the right time.

                                FORD
                  How could I do it?

                                                      (CONTINUED)

                  I thought you wanted to drive
                  cars.

                                FORD
                  Not anymore. That was kid's
                  stuff. This is real. So, where's
                  the right place?

                                THE POSTMAN
                  Could be anywhere. Anytime. Only
                  another postman can make you a
                  postman.

                                FORD
                  Kinda like vampires, right?

                                THE POSTMAN
                  Something like that. You have to
                  be sworn in.

     Ford raises his right hand, palm out, ready to take the
     oath. It takes The Postman a moment to realize.

                                THE POSTMAN
                  The organization's kinda shaky.
                  It might not last.

                                FORD
                  What does?

                                THE POSTMAN
                  You'd meet a lot of people who
                  don't believe in you.

                                FORD
                  I'll set them straight.

                                THE POSTMAN
                  It's a lonely job.

                                FORD
                  I've been lonely all my life.

     This response strikes a chord. The Postman sees how badly
     Ford wants something to hold onto. He sees himself.

                                THE POSTMAN
                  So have I, Ford. So have I.

     The Postman looks up at the creed on the wall.    Finally...

                  Congratulations, you're a postman.

     They shake hands. The Postman doesn't realize, but this
     is the most important moment in Ford's life.

                                FORD
                  I want you to know I'd die to get
                  a letter through.

     Ford's intensity takes The Postman back.       But the moment
     is broken when...

                                BRISCOE (O.S.)
                  Johnny, why don't you run along.
                  I need to speak to this man.

     Ford bristles at "Johnny," looks to The Postman.

                  I'll see you around.

                  Sure thing, Ford.

     Ford exits.

                                BRISCOE
                  Johnny's real impressed with you.

                          doesn't answer)
                  Didn't think so. All you cost us
                  so far is a few bowls of soup and
                  maybe later a few broken hearts.
                  I aim to keep it that way. You
                  can stay till morning. Then I
                  don't ever want to see you again.

     Briscoe exits, leaves The Postman alone in the post
     office.


39   INT. ABANDONED HOTEL - ROOM 7 - NIGHT                          39

     The Postman arrives home. He pushes open the door,
     knocking over a stack of letters that have been shoved
     under the door. He gathers them up, flips through them.
     They're written on scraps, the backs of pictures, on
     handkerchiefs and homemade paper. They aren't old.

                                                      (CONTINUED)

                                                                53.

     They're brand new.      Shaking his head, he closes the door.

     The Postman has no sooner done so when there's a KNOCK on
     the window. He looks over at a woman. She shrugs,
     smiles, holds up a letter. The Postman sighs; he's
     trapped in here.


40   EXT. FOSTER'S FREEZE - NIGHT                                     40

     CAMERA STARTS ON a man with a string-tied package crossing
     the streets and DRIFTS TO the abandoned car where Ford
     lives. He's home.


     ON FORD

     Concentrating, Ford holds a needle and thread and a piece
     of cloth on which he's drawn an approximation of the post
     office shoulder patch. By moonlight he embroiders it in.
     Not exactly work you'd pay money for, but not bad either.

     PACKAGE - NIGHT

     ~from the previous scene.       It's on the table with a
     growing stack of mail.

     The Postman is in bed, trying to sleep. But it's hard-
     coming. He laces his fingers behind his head, stares up
     at the moon through a hole in the wall. A KNOCK at the
     door.

                                   THE POSTMAN
                  Just leave it.

     There's a pause.    And then, ANOTHER KNOCK.

                                THE POSTMAN
                  I said leave it.

     The door opens. Surprise. Abby stands in the doorway,
     her hair held up by an old red ribbon. He sits up.

                                   THE POSTMAN
                  Hello, Abby.

                                ABBY
                  You'll be leaving tomorrow?

                                   THE POSTMAN
                  I guess.

                         (enters; closes door)
                  Everybody's up late writing
                  letters for you to take. We're
                  not supposed to waste candles like
                  that, but they're so excited.

                                   THE POSTMAN
                  How about you?     Do you have a
                  letter?

                                ABBY
                  I don't have anybody to write to.

                                THE POSTMAN
                  I'll find you a pen pal. Someone
                  with interests similar to your
                  own. Dancing, checking for mumps.

     Abby laughs.    The Postman is charmed.

                                ABBY
                  You're funny. Hardly anyone's
                  funny around here.

                                THE POSTMAN
                  I guess no one feels much like
                  laughing.

     The two of them just look at each other a moment.         Abby
     fingers the ribbon in her hair.

                                ABBY
                  Have you decided yet?

                                THE POSTMAN
                  Oh, well, I've been thinking about
                  it.

     A beat. Abby lets her shift drop to the floor, then
     slides under the sheets alongside him.

                                 THE POSTMAN
                  Sure.   Why not?

     They lie there awkwardly for a moment.          He looks at her.

                                THE POSTMAN
                  God, you're beautiful. Sorry, I
                  know you'd probably like to keep
                  things more clinical.
                         (beat)
                  You don't even know my name.

     She shushes him, covers his mouth with her hand.

                                ABBY
                  I don't want to.

     He nods he understands.     She stares into his eyes.

                                ABBY
                  It would be easier for me if you
                  closed your eyes.

     The Postman closes his eyes. Abby slides her hand away
     from his mouth. And as they start to make love...

                                                       DISSOLVE TO:


42   INT. ABANDONED HOTEL - ROOM 7 - DAY                               42

     The Postman wakes, reaches for the warm body that was
     there last night. But Abby is gone. All that's left
     behind is her red ribbon. Wistful, he picks it up.


43   EXT. ABANDONED HOTEL - DAY                                        43

     The Postman exits. In uniform, his bag slung over his
     shoulder. He starts then stops short. Only now do we see
     most of the townspeople have silently assembled here.
     They've been waiting for him, starving for him.

     Ford steps up, hands him another fresh packet of letters.
     The Postman sees that Ford hangs on to four or five.

                                THE POSTMAN
                  What about those?

                                FORD
                  These are going to Blue Jay.
                  About twenty miles east. I
                  thought I could take them.

     The Postman scans the crowd.      Looking for Abby maybe?

                                 THE POSTMAN
                          (absently)
                  Okay.   They're yours.

     Briscoe rides up, regards The Postman sternly.

                                BRISCOE
                  I'm your escort out of town.

     Some of the town's CITIZENS lead up a saddled mare.

                  We took a vote, Mr. Postman.   We
                  want you to have this horse.

                                CITIZEN #2
                  Now don't say no. A man on
                  horseback can cover ten times the
                  territory of a man on foot.

                                THE POSTMAN
                         (smiles at Briscoe)
                  I'll take it.

     He ties his mailbag to the saddle, swings himself up.

                                CITIZEN #3
                  There's a bedroll, some oats and a
                  week's rations.

                                THE POSTMAN
                  Thank you.

                                CITIZEN #1
                  Where do you figure you'll go from
                  here?

                                THE POSTMAN
                  Go?... Oh yeah... I'll head west,
                  then work my way back here in a
                  sort of figure eight.

     "8." Everyone's quiet a moment. They shift
     uncomfortably. The Postman looks out at the crowd. They
     crave hope. He should probably just keep his mouth shut.

                                THE POSTMAN
                  Times seem hard right now. But
                  you have to believe it's getting
                  better. Birds are migrating
                  again. The rains are back.

     The people consider him and then each other. By God, they
     do feel hopeful. Suddenly, Ellen, her little boy by her
     side, begins to sing. It's weak at first, but one-by-one
     the others join in. Soon the whole town is singing:

                                ELLEN & TOWN
                  'Oh beautiful for spacious skies,
                  for amber waves of grain. For
                  purple mountain's majesty, above
                  the fruited plain. America...'

     The Postman looks around. They sing their hearts out.
     The guilt is overwhelming. He digs his heels into the
     horse's flanks and rides out of town.

                                                           57.

44   EXT. PALISADE GATES (PINE VIEW) - DAY                        44

     People line the top as The Postman and Briscoe ride out.
     The strains of "AMERICA" still in the background.

                             BRISCOE
               You got a helluva nerve, whoever
               you are.

     The Postman doesn't rise to the bait.

                             THE POSTMAN
               Is Abby around?

                             BRISCOE
               She and Michael are working the
               north meadow this morning.

     Briscoe reins up -- he's gone as far as his duty commands.

                             BRISCOE
               Well, you're on your own.

     The Postman tips his cap and continues riding by "Pine
     View - Population 132." Briscoe watches a moment, then
     calls after him:

                            BRISCOE
               Hey! Are you really who you say
               you are?

                             THE POSTMAN
               If I come back with some mail,
               you'll know!

     The Postman continues. Caught in an inner turmoil,
     Briscoe reaches into his pocket, and pulls out a letter.
     He turns it over in his hands, looks off at The Postman.

                              BRISCOE
               God damn it!

     Briscoe urges his horse forward, catches up. He hands The
     Postman the letter, then rides back for town. The Postman
     watches Briscoe. The people lining the wall. And he
     realizes just what effect he's had. There's nothing to
     do, but shrug his shoulders and ride. Strains of
     "AMERICA" still ECHO hauntingly OVER:


45   EXT. ON ROAD - SUN                                           45

     A green and lavender sunset. In the middle of nowhere,
     The Postman rides, chewing a piece of jerked beef. He
     flips through some of the letters entrusted to him.

                  Seattle. Boise... St. Rose,
                  Paradise on the Pacific...

     He considers the letter, looks around as if someone may be
     watching. He just begins to tear the corner, then stops.

                                 THE POSTMAN
                  Maybe one thing can still be
                  sacred.
                          (to horse)
                  All in all, not a bad gig, huh?

     The HORSE SNORTS. Smiling, The Postman shoves the
     envelope into his bag. As he does, he finds something
     else. The red ribbon. He runs it through his fingers,
     thinks wistfully of Abby. Then, like a knight of old
     representing a lady's honor, he ties it to his mailbag and
     rides on.


46   EXT. WELL (PINE VIEW) - DAY                                    46

     Abby's washing clothes with a tub and washboard. Waging
     war on dirt. Michael leans against a tree, watches Abby
     at work until she notices him. She wipes the sweat from
     her brow, tries not to smile.

                                ABBY
                  What are you looking at?

                                  MICHAEL
                  Everything.

     He steps over and they're in each other's arms. This is
     love. But as Michael kisses her, we hear a familiar
     alarm:

                                  SENTRY
                  Holnists!    Holnists are coming!

     Led by Bethlehem and Getty, the soldiers ride in.
     Something about the citizens disturbs Bethlehem.

                                BETHLEHEM
                  They don't usually look at me.

     Bethlehem reins in across from the post office.     Someone
     has hung a tattered old American flag.

                                BETHLEHEM
                  Who's responsible for that?!

     No one answers.     All heads are down now.

     Ford is sweeping up. The place looks almost presentable.
     He stops when he hears Bethlehem calling once more for the
     responsible party.

     Ford starts forward.    Suddenly Briscoe is blocking his
     way.

                                BRISCOE
                  Holnists, Johnny. You gotta stay
                  out of sight.

                                FORD
                  I'm a postman. And I'm not hiding
                  from anyone. I --

     Briscoe grabs him by the shirt, hauls him out the back
     way.

                                BRISCOE
                  You stay out of this, or I'll lock
                  you up myself damnit.

     Bethlehem picks Michael out of the crowd.

                                BETHLEHEM
                  You.  You'll be responsible.
                         (to soldiers)
                  Get him a torch.

     Michael walks out into the square. One of the soldiers
     returns with a burning torch, gives it to Michael.

     Bethlehem looks at the town, then at Michael.

                                BETHLEHEM
                  Set that flag on fire.

                                                       (CONTINUED)

                                                                60.

     ON MICHAEL

     It's killing him, but Michael sets the torch to the flag.
                              BETHLEHEM
               Now throw it through the window of
               your 'post office.'

     CRASH!    The TORCH goes through the post office WINDOW.


     ON FORD

     Struggling to get out, but Briscoe blocks his way.


     ON BETHLEHEM

     As flames grow, he takes one last look around.

                                BETHLEHEM
                  The United States doesn't exist.
                  That flag is an abomination.

     Briscoe steps forward, attempts to diffuse the situation.

                                BRISCOE
                  General Bethlehem.
                         (as Bethlehem turns)
                  We're gathering the tribute, sir.
                  Can I take your wagons?

     Bethlehem decides not to kill anyone, looks to Getty.

                                BETHLEHEM
                  Make sure that fire doesn't go
                  out.

     The General joins Briscoe.

     Tears on his cheeks, Ford watches the post office burn.


50   EXT. PARKING LOT (PINE VIEW) - EARLY EVENING                     50

     Bethlehem relaxes with his officers as wagons are loaded.
     Michael is just passing with a sack of grain on his
     shoulder, when Bethlehem looks across the street -- spies
     Abby and some of the other women sewing grain sacks shut.

                                BETHLEHEM
                  Good Lord. That, gentlemen, is a
                  first-rate piece of ass.

                                                      (CONTINUED)

                                                               61.

50   CONTINUED:                                                      50

     Michael overhears. He looks over as Bethlehem's men nod
     in agreement. Michael sees that they're talking about
     Abby.

                                BETHLEHEM
                  Tell the Sheriff I want to be
                  introduced. She does not belong
                  in a mudhole like this.

     One of the men hurries off. It's concern for Abby, not
     for his manhood that makes him step forward.

                                MICHAEL
                  Excuse me.

                                BETHLEHEM
                         (looks over)
                  You again?

                                 MICHAEL
                  That's my wife, General.   She's a
                  married woman.

                                BETHLEHEM
                  Do you know what system of
                  government we have here, son?
                         (as Michael shrugs)
                  A feudal system. Like the Middle
                  Ages. With lords and vassals.
                  That's you and me. Those lords,
                  they had some ideas. If a vassal
                  got married, it was the lord's
                  right, his right, to sleep with
                  the bride on the wedding night.

                                MICHAEL
                  Me and Abby have been married for
                  three years.

                                BETHLEHEM
                  Sorry, but I wasn't invited to the
                  wedding. Now, you've already done
                  me one favor, son. Don't let this
                  be a black mark on an otherwise
                  perfect record.


     ABBY

     Another woman has pointed out to her what's going on. She
     can't hear what's being said, but she watches, concerned.

                                                       (CONTINUED)

                                                                 62.

     PARKING LOT

                                BETHLEHEM
                  We'll be civilized about this. I
                  want you to give me your blessing.

                                   MICHAEL
                  Sir, I can't.     You can't.

                                BETHLEHEM
                  Can't? I'm tired of can't. We
                  had a great nation once. Do you
                  know what made it that way? I
                  can! Till the weak came along.
                  The 'I can'ts' destroyed us. But
                  I'm going to make us strong again.
                  I'm going to be the father of a
                  new nation.
                         (draws his sword)
                  Do you know why it will be me?

     Michael looks to Abby as she starts across the street.

                                   BETHLEHEM
                  Because I can!

     The SWORD WHISTLES down.       Accompanied by an anguished cry:

                                   ABBY
                  Michael!

     Abby rushes forward, but she's blocked by Getty and
     another man. She cries out again and again.

     Filled with impotent fury, Briscoe squeezes out the words.

                                BRISCOE
                  You didn't have to --

                                BETHLEHEM
                  Didn't have to what, Sheriff?

     Three Holnist soldiers draw down on Briscoe.      Bethlehem
     circles, menacing on his horse.

                                BETHLEHEM
                  Your people seem seditious.    You
                  seem seditious.

     Briscoe stares down at Michael's crumpled form.      Abby
     wails.

                                   BRISCOE
                  Aw, Michael...

     Briscoe might go after Bethlehem despite the odds.

                                BETHLEHEM
                  What am I seeing here? I'm
                  waiting.

                                BRISCOE
                         (burying his anger)
                  Man came through here. With mail.
                  Said he was a postman. Said the
                  government had been restored back
                  east.

                                BETHLEHEM
                  What government?

     From out of the crowd -- a voice.         Ford.

                                FORD
                  The United States government.

     Bethlehem whirls his horse at the noise.

                                   BETHLEHEM
                  Who said that?

     Not waiting for an answer, Getty charges the crowd, knocks
     one of the onlookers down. A dead silence.

     Bethlehem frowns, thinks it over a minute.

                                BETHLEHEM
                  Which way did he go?
                         (a beat)
                  Do not make me ask again.

                                   BRISCOE
                          (lies)
                  East.

                                BETHLEHEM
                         (to Getty)
                  Send a patrol east. Send three
                  more south, north and west.
                         (to Briscoe)
                  They'd better find him east.


51   EXT. PALISADE GATES (PINE VIEW) - NIGHT                      51

     The Holnist army rides out. Overcome by grief, tied at
     the wrists, Abby stumbles behind one of the wagons.

                                                             64.

52   EXT. BURNT-OUT POST OFFICE - NIGHT                            52

     Before the smoking ruins, Ford pulls on a blue shirt, his
     homemade postal flag on the shoulder. As Briscoe steps
     up, Ford shows him a bundle of singed, but intact letters.

                             FORD
               I managed to save these.

                             BRISCOE
                      (re: shirt)
               Take that thing off, Johnny.    You
               want to die, too?

     Ford shoves the letters in a makeshift bag, then climbs
     onto his waiting pony.

                             FORD
               I'm headed south. With the mail.

                             BRISCOE
                      (grabs harness)
               Don't be a damn fool.

                             FORD
               What kind should I be?... Haw!

     Ford digs his heels into the pony and is off in a flash
     doing damn near a buck seventy-five.


53   INT. MOVIE THEATER (BENNING, OREGON) - DAY                    53

     Mail call. The Postman stands in front of the torn
     screen. Hoping for glory by association, the smiling
     Mayor stands beside him. The ragged people of Benning
     clamor in front. Kids smile up at him as he calls out
     names:

                              THE POSTMAN
               Rachel Clark!
                      (as she's there)
               Charlie Sykes!
                      (as he's there)
               Graham Druitt!

                             VOICE
               G.D. died last winter of flu.

     The Postman nods, sticks the letter back in his bag.

                             THE POSTMAN
               That's it for now, folks.
               There'll be more once a real
               system is in place.

                                                     (CONTINUED)

53   CONTINUED:                                                      53

     As usual, The Postman is assaulted with questions.

                                MAN
                  Tell us about President Starkey!

                                WOMAN
                  What about New York City?   Did
                  they survive the plague?

                                THE POSTMAN
                  Survive? They got Broadway up and
                  running again. There's a kid
                  doing Andrew Lloyd Webber like you
                  wouldn't believe.

     An older woman sheds a happy tear -- this is wonderful
     news.

                                MAN #3
                  How much is it to mail a letter?

                                THE POSTMAN
                         (smiles)
                  A buck seventy-five.

                                MAN #3
                  That sounds awful cheap.

                                THE POSTMAN
                  The catch is the only currency
                  recognized are silver American
                  coins minted before 1964 and two
                  dollar bills. Look for Thomas
                  Jefferson. Of course, food is
                  always acceptable as barter.

     The moment is split by a SIREN.


54   EXT. BENNING, OREGON - DAY                                      54

     A long double-line of Holnist Cavalry stand in formation
     in front of the city walls made from stacks of crushed
     cars. On top, a SKINNY SENTRY CRANKS the SIREN while a
     CHUBBY SENTRY watches.

     Bethlehem rides through them with Abby in tow -- her
     wrists tied by a rope which is looped around the pommel of
     Bethlehem's saddle. Her face is bruised, her bottom lip
     split. Bethlehem reins up, puzzled by the apparent stall.

                  What?

                                GIBBS
                  They say they got a representative
                  of the restored United States in
                  there. They say this army is
                  illegal. They say --

     The Chubby Sentry answers from the top of the palisade.

                                CHUBBY SENTRY
                  Drop dead and go to hell!

     The Chubby Sentry disappears back behind cover. Bethlehem
     remains controlled, but his manner becomes deadly.

                                BETHLEHEM
                  The Romans had an expression they
                  used to scare their children.
                  'Hannibal ad portas!' -- Hannibal
                  is at the gates. Do you know who
                  Hannibal was?
                         (as she doesn't answer)
                  Of course not. A pretty girl like
                  you wouldn't know a thing.
                         (to Getty)
                  Colonel Getty, get some men up
                  there and open that gate.


55   EXT. INSIDE GATES - DAY                                     55

     The Mayor hurries over, The Postman following reluctantly
     behind. The Mayor spots the Sentries up on the parapet.

                                MAYOR
                  What the hell are you doing?!
                  Open the gates!

                                SKINNY SENTRY
                  Government's restored! We don't
                  have to take their crap anymore!


56   EXT. PALISADE GATES (BENNING) - DAY                         56

     Two Holnists scale the gates. They're near the top when
     the Skinny Sentry appears. He FIRES an ARROW. Hit
     through the shoulder, one Holnist falls. The other jumps.

                                                               67.

57   EXT. PARAPET - INSIDE WALLS - DAY                               57

     Chubby and Skinny duck down behind the safety of the
     walls, trading high-fives.


58   EXT. PALISADE GATES (BENNING) - DAY                             58

     Bethlehem orders his men to pull back. He shakes his
     head, a quiet rage building. But he knows there's no
     military threat here. It's going to be a massacre.


59   EXT. PARAPET - INSIDE WALLS - DAY                               59

     Climbing an inside ladder, the Mayor slams the Chubby
     Sentry against the wall.

                              MAYOR
               Idiots!

                             CITIZEN #1
                      (realizing; scared)
               They're gonna kill us all.

     The Mayor peers out through an observation hole.   The
     Postman and several others join him.

                              CHUBBY SENTRY
               No!   Let's fight them!

                             MAYOR
               With what? We got five guns maybe
               20 rounds of ammo in the whole
               town! How do we fight them with
               that?!

     The Postman watches the Holnists prepare for attack.

                            THE POSTMAN
               You don't. Negotiate a
               settlement. Give them extra
               supplies.

     The men look at each other.   Sounds reasonable enough.

                             MAYOR
               Okay. You're a government rep.
               You go tell them.

     The look on The Postman's face says it all.

                                                               68.

60   EXT. GATES (BENNING, OREGON) - DAY                              60

     They open enough to let the Postman ride out, then close
     behind him. He sits nervously on his horse waving a white
     flag. He's met, dismounts and is led to a command post
     where Bethlehem is studying a rough map of the town.

                                BETHLEHEM
               Make it quick.     I've got an attack
               to coordinate.

                             THE POSTMAN
               General, um, they've asked me to
               negotiate a peace treaty.

     The last time he and Bethlehem were face-to-face, the
     Postman had a shaved head, was dressed in rags, and was
     covered with cuts and bruises. Bethlehem can't place him,
     but there's something familiar all the same.

                                BETHLEHEM
               Do I know you?

                             THE POSTMAN
               I don't think so, sir. I --

                             BETHLEHEM
                      (scans uniform)
               You're the Postman, aren't you?


     ABBY

     watches from the flap of Bethlehem's tent.    The guard sees
     and shoves her back inside.


     BETHLEHEM AND THE POSTMAN

     Bethlehem flicks at the uniform flag shoulder patch.

                             BETHLEHEM
               The restored United States. Do
               these people really believe that
               shit? Who are you really?

     Although he wants to confess everything, something tells
     The Postman he has to try to brass it out.

                             THE POSTMAN
               I am a United States Postman.
               Authorized by order 417 of the
               restored Congress to --

                                                                  69.

                                BETHLEHEM
                  I was at the Battle of Georgetown.
                  I watched the White House burn to
                  the ground. Don't try to sell me
                  on any restored U.S...

                                THE POSTMAN
                  The new capital is based in
                  Minneapolis. Inside the Hubert
                  Humphrey Metrodome. You know,
                  where the Vikings used to play?

                                  BETHLEHEM
                  You're funny.    Now, what are the
                  terms?

                                THE POSTMAN
                  They'll open the gate and give you
                  double what they usually give.
                  Just don't hurt anybody. This was
                  all a misunderstanding.

     Bethlehem thinks this over.


61   INT. ABBY'S TENT - DAY                                             61

     Abby tracks the guard's silhouette through the canvas.
     Her eyes search the tent -- land on the cot in the corner
     and focus on its heavy, wooden legs.


62   EXT. GATES - DAY                                                   62

     Bethlehem has decided.

                                BETHLEHEM
                  Appreciate your offer, Postman.
                  Problem is, you're in no position
                  to negotiate. These people made
                  it through the bugs and the riots
                  and the three year winter. But
                  they're not going to survive you.

     Bethlehem looks to Getty and nods.      Getty motions to a
     gunner. The MONSTER GUN is FIRED.       Just as a SHELL
     EXPLODES against the gates --

63   INT. ABBY'S TENT - DAY                                             63

     Abby brings the heavy wooden cot leg down on the
     unsuspecting guard's head.

                                                              70.

64   EXT. CITY GATES - DAY                                          64

     The cavalry ride through roiling smoke into the open town.

     Horrified, The Postman steps forward, but rifles are on
     him. All he can do is watch. The Mayor is the first to
     go down.

                              BETHLEHEM
                Law six, justice can be dictated.
                       (to soldiers)
                Kill him. And kill the restored
                United States with him.

     Bethlehem turns his attention to the battle.   A CAPTAIN
     steps forward with gun raised.

                              CAPTAIN
                       (by rote)
                In accordance with law eight and
                by the authority of Emergency
                Order 46, you are hereby --

     A CRACK of RIFLE FIRE. The Captain's forehead explodes
     and he falls to the ground.

     Shocked, Bethlehem whirls for the source of the GUNFIRE.

     Abby!   FIRING from a position behind a supply wagon.

     But even as Bethlehem turns, an ARROW SINGS in and lodges
     in his arm. Fired from a pocket of sentries up on the
     palisade. Bethlehem bellows in outrage and pain.

     The Postman takes advantage of the moment of chaos to grab
     the fallen Captain's gun.

     He pulls a Holnist rider from his horse and swings into
     the saddle. The unhorsed rider goes for his gun. But
     once more SHOTS RING OUT and he goes down.

     Bethlehem ducks as another BULLET ZINGS close.    Too close.

                              BETHLEHEM
                Get her.

     Two soldiers move forward.

     Suddenly The Postman's HORSE comes THUNDERING -- trampling
     the Holnist nearest him.

     The other Holnist hears, looks back, sees The Postman
     coming and takes aim just as The Postman brings his gun to
     bear.

                                                      (CONTINUED)

                                                                 71.

64   CONTINUED:                                                         64

     The Holnist FIRES first. We don't see the hit. Just
     watch as The Postman FIRES an answering ROUND. The
     Holnist goes down.

     The Postman reins up alongside the wagon. Grunting with
     pain, he reaches down, takes Abby's arm and swings her up
     behind him. Then digs his heels in for all he's worth.

     More Holnists come on the run. They FIRE. The HORSE
     SNORTS in pain. He's hit. But The Postman urges him on,
     heading into the woods.

     Bethlehem snaps off the arrow shaft and shouts:

                                   BETHLEHEM
                  Colonel Getty!


65   EXT. WOODLAND ROAD - DAY                                           65

     Abby is concerned as the horse slows to a trot.

                                ABBY
                  We can't stop now. They'll be
                  coming after us.

     The Postman's head lolls forward. She feels something on
     her hand, pulls it back smeared with blood. The Postman's
     shot in the belly.

     The horse is failing.       Near death.

     We hear the sound of PURSUING CAVALRY. Abby urges the
     horse off the road. When the thicket grows too dense,
     Abby jumps down. She catches The Postman as he slides
     off, easing him to the ground.

                                   THE POSTMAN
                            (disoriented)
                  Abby...

     Abby shushes him. She pulls on the horse's bridle to
     force him farther along. But it's no good, the wounded
     horse goes down on its knees.

     And five RIDERS THUNDER past.       Fooled.   All but the SIXTH,
     who pulls up to listen.

     In the deep b.g., flames lick at the billowing black
     smoke. The town is burning.

     The HORSE WHINNIES: in its death throes.        Abby panics,
     tries to quiet the horse.

                                                         (CONTINUED)

                                                             72.

65   CONTINUED:                                                    65

     The Sixth Soldier has heard the suffering horse. He draws
     his rifle from the saddle boot and starts into the
     thicket.


     ON ABBY AND POSTMAN

     The Postman lies unconscious on the ground. Abby sits
     beside him, rifle in hand. The Sixth Soldier appears.

                                  ABBY
                  Don't move.

     He hesitates at first. Then dismounts and moves toward
     her. Abby cocks the rifle.

                                SIXTH SOLDIER
                  If you'd had a bullet, you'd a
                  used it by now.

     Moving closer still, he doesn't see the BRANCH pulled back
     in The Postman's hand until it SNAPS hard into his face.

     He stumbles back.

                                  ABBY
                  You're right.

     Abby dashes out, rifle in hand. She swings for the
     bleachers. The butt catches the side of the Sixth
     Soldier's head. He falls hard.

     The Postman's eyes flutter. Dazed, he watches as Abby
     pilfers through the Soldier's gear. She takes everything
     of value: a knife, bullets, a canteen. His eyes flutter
     closed.


66   EXT. WOODS - DAY                                              66

     Snowflakes swirl. Abby lays a sapling travois beside The
     Postman. He groans as she rolls him onto it, tucks a
     blanket around him. Using all the strength God gave her,
     Abby lifts one end, gets it high enough to hitch it to the
     Sixth Soldier's horse. As Abby leads the horse away...


67   EXT. WOOD ROAD - DAY                                          67

     The snow has increased. A Holnist patrol moves down the
     road, disappears around a bend. A beat.

                                                   (CONTINUED)

                                                               73.

     Abby appears, leading the horse and travois.   She crosses
     the road and disappears into the woods.

     A moment later, she reappears with a pine branch which she
     uses to brush at the snow, obscuring their tracks.


68   EXT. CASCADE MOUNTAINS (OREGON) - DAY                            68

     Riding into a blizzard, Abby leads the way up a zigzag
     path. A valley opens up below. The unconscious Postman
     lies bundled on the travois.


69   EXT. HUNTING SHACK - DUSK                                        69

     A little square shape just visible beyond a creek.     Abby
     leads the horse and travois-bound Postman to it.


70   INT. HUNTING SHACK - DUSK                                        70

     One room. Dirt floor. The WINDOWS RATTLE in the WIND.
     Snow falls through a hole in the roof. The wooden DOOR
     BURSTS back and Abby enters. Half-frozen, she leads the
     horse and the travois right inside.


71   INT. HUNTING SHACK - NIGHT                                       71

     A fire has been lit.

     The Postman lies unconscious, his shirt open as Abby
     washes around his wound. She pulls the shirt back to
     clean his chest. The material falls away and Abby stops
     short. There -- high on his biceps -- a branded "8." She
     stares in disbelief.

                                                     DISSOLVE TO:


72   INT. HUNTING SHACK - DAY                                         72

     The Postman lies on a cot below the window.    He's
     conscious, but pale as a ghost.

     Abby brings him a bowl of soup. Very thin soup.       Stirring
     it with a spoon, The Postman smiles at Abby.

                                THE POSTMAN
                  Thank you.

     She turns her back on him without a word.   The Postman
     tries an exchange just the same.

                                                     (CONTINUED)

72   CONTINUED:                                                      72

                                THE POSTMAN
                  I don't think I ever had water
                  soup before. Maybe next time we
                  could try it with a little sand?
                         (as she doesn't respond)
                  Dirt? Wood?
                         (as she doesn't smile)
                  A twig garnish?

     She goes about her business in silence.

                                THE POSTMAN
                  You used to think I was funny.

                                ABBY
                  They killed Michael.

                                   THE POSTMAN
                  I'm sorry.

     He takes a spoonful of soup and she comes to him.

                                ABBY
                  How sorry are you?

                                THE POSTMAN
                  What's that supposed to mean?

     Her right hand flashes out, holds a knife up under his
     chin.

                                THE POSTMAN
                  What's with you?

                                ABBY
                  You got the mark of eight on you.

     A long beat. Finally, he swallows the soup in his mouth.
     The action presses his Adam's apple against the blade.

                                THE POSTMAN
                  A mark doesn't mean I'm a --

                  You're a liar.     I should've let
                  you die.

                                THE POSTMAN
                  Then, why didn't you?

     If she knows, she's not ready to say yet.

                  You were with Bethlehem. Does
                  that make you one of them?

     Abby considers this, The Postman's gaze flickers down to
     the spoon he still holds in his hand. Taking one last
     stab at a joke.

                                THE POSTMAN
                         (re: the spoon)
                  Don't make me use this.

     Abby doesn't laugh.      But she does relent.   She steps away.


73   EXT. HUNTING SHACK/VALLEY PASS - SUNSET                           73

     The hunting shack huddled against the south side of a low
     rise. Beyond the rise, a pass. But there's no
     negotiating it now. It's completely snowed in. And
     another storm is on the way.


74   INT. HUNTING SHACK - DAY                                          74

     WIND HOWLING in the b.g. The Postman lies back on his
     cot. The little shack has been scoured clean. Abby
     stares listlessly at the fire. The silence is torture.
     The Postman tries to strike up a conversation.

                                THE POSTMAN
                  Wind's come up.

                  Getting colder too. Must be
                  another storm --

     Abby gets up and throws a log on the fire.

                                   ABBY

                  Lazy?! I got a hole in my
                  stomach. I'm weak. The two big
                  meals around here are grass and
                  snow. And we're running out of
                  grass.

     As the two of them glare at each other for a moment.     Abby
     starts to put on her coat.

                                THE POSTMAN
                  Where are you going?

     Abby doesn't answer. She picks up the rifle and starts to
     lead the horse outside.

                                THE POSTMAN
                  You're not leaving me here, are

     Abby is out the door without a word.

     HOLD ON The Postman in the window as she continues past.
     He watches a moment, suddenly grimaces. A GUNSHOT. The
     THUD of a BODY SLAMMING to the GROUND. Abby has shot the
     horse.

     Tiny tracks in the snow, leading away from the shack.
     Abby struggles to make the monumental climb from the shack
     to the top of the rise where she can get a clear view of
     the pass.

     PAN PAST her UP TO the top of the rise. It's a clear day
     -- but the pass is still snowed-in. No sign of winter
     receding.

     A few flakes of snow have begun to drift down. The
     Postman sits at the window -- starts to play tic-tac-toe

                                THE POSTMAN
                  You can't play tic-tac-toe with

     Disoriented, Abby stops to take stock of her surround-

     too thick.

     The fire is dying. The food untouched. The Postman sits
     in bed staring anxiously out the window. The snow has
     turned into a blizzard. He runs Abby's red ribbon through
     his hands.

     covering the stream breaks beneath her feet.

     The door opens and out steps The Postman. In pain, he
     staggers around the back of the cabin -- in search of her.


84   EXT. STREAM - DAY                                            84

     Abby looks up, sees him coming. The Postman collapses
     across from her. Both prone, they're also nearly nose-to-
     nose.

                             THE POSTMAN
               I can't help you.

     Finally, he pulls himself to his knees. She does the
     same. They climb each other to a standing position. Arm-
     in-arm, they start for the cabin.


85   INT. HUNTING SHACK - DUSK                                    85

     Abby sits huddled in blankets. The fire is blazing. The
     Postman steps over, sets the once-again-hot bowl of stew
     before her.

     She considers the food a moment.

                             ABBY
               I told you that's all there was.

     The Postman lies in bed, stares through the hole in the
     roof. A full moon is on the rise. Abby lies in her own
     makeshift bed, also awake. After a long silence:

                             THE POSTMAN
               We walked on the moon once, Abby.

     Then, he catches his reflection in the water.       Tangled
     beard. Matted hair. Is that him?

     He suddenly starts sharpening the knife with renewed
     vigor. We get a sense he's not going to use it on the
     fish.

     plunge into the water, pull splashfuls up. We START ON
     The Postman's back, then ARC AROUND as he washes his face.
     He's just finished shaving off his beard with the hunting
     knife. He's nicked-up, but it's a definite improvement
     and he smiles in satisfaction -- until he sees --

     Abby, reflected in the water.

                               THE POSTMAN
                  He's wrong. St. Rose is out
                  there. And I'm going to find it.

                                ABBY
                  But you're The Postman.

                                THE POSTMAN
                  Look, I'm nobody, Abby. I'm
                  just...

     Before he can come clean -- they see a distant RIDER
     coming hard. The Postman unslings the rifle, slides a
     round into the chamber.

                                THE POSTMAN
                  This is what I hate. Strangers.
                  Do you say 'hi' or do you blow
                  their head off? Do they want to
                  share what they got or take what
                  you have? And if they want to
                  take, how far are you willing to
                  go to stop them? Damn it.
                         (to the Rider)
                  All right. That's far enough.

     The Rider pulls up short, wearing a blue home-made
     uniform.

                                THE POSTMAN
                  We don't want any trouble.

                                RIDER
                  Me neither, mister.

     The Postman is taken aback. The Rider, a girl, pulls off
     her cap, mops it across her brow. Maybe 14, we'll always
     know her by her Ponytail. Abby registers the uniform
     first.

                                  ABBY
                  What are you?

                                PONYTAIL (RIDER)
                  Carrier 18. U.S. Postal Service.
                  Got any mail?

     Lowering the rifle, The Postman looks over at Abby, back
     to Ponytail.

                                THE POSTMAN
                  That's impossible.

                  Ain't you heard of The Postman?

                                  ABBY
                  No, tell us.

                                PONYTAIL
                  He's only the greatest man who
                  ever lived. He crossed the
                  wasteland, shook his fist at the
                  enemy and spit in the eye of
                  General Bethlehem himself. He's
                  back east with President Starkey
                  right now.

                                THE POSTMAN
                  Who told you all this?

                                PONYTAIL
                  Postmaster Ford Lincoln Mercury.
                  He's in direct contact with the
                  restored congress.

                                THE POSTMAN
                  Direct contact... I don't believe
                  this.

                                PONYTAIL
                         (growing irritated)
                  Do you have mail, or don't you?

                                THE POSTMAN
                  You said Carrier Eighteen. That
                  mean there's eighteen of you?

                                  PONYTAIL
                  Thirty-two.    As of midnight.


91   EXT. R.V. PARK - DAY                                           91

     Oregon's main post office. A silver Airstream, fifty
     mobile homes and rusty Winnebagos resting on flat tires.
     Flying from a pole: the flag of the restored United
     States. A young recruit is ringing a bell on the top of a
     Winnebago.

     Ford walks along an RV boulevard. He's joined by two
     young carriers, RED and Chubby (the sentry from Benning).
     All wear hip, personalized variations of the official
     uniform.

                                CHUBBY
                  You got another letter?

                                                      (CONTINUED)

     They come around the corner to where seven young recruits
     wait. They're joined by another twenty carriers.

                                   FORD
                  More recruits?

                                RED
                  Seven of them. They're coming
                  from everywhere.

     Ford looks them over in satisfaction.

                                CHUBBY
                  Did you get a letter or didn't
                  you?

     Ford smiles, reaches into his pocket. He pulls out a
     creased sheet of paper. Chubby grins.

                                FORD
                  Gather 'round, everybody. Got
                  another letter here. Came in last
                  night.

     Buzzing with excitement, the carriers gather around Ford.


     SOUTH END OF BOULEVARD

     Ponytail leads Abby and The Postman. They come up in the
     back of the crowd. Flanked by Red and Chubby, Ford stands
     on the hood of a car, letter in hand. The Postman taps a
     clueless YOUNG CARRIER on the back.

                                THE POSTMAN
                  What's all this?

                                YOUNG CARRIER
                  Postman sent Ford another letter.
                  He's gonna read it.

                                FORD
                         (reading)
                  'Hello, all postal carriers.'

                                  CARRIERS
                           (a ritual)
                  Hello!

                                                      (CONTINUED)

                                                                 85.

                                FORD
                  I'm here in Minneapolis with
                  President Starkey, but my thoughts
                  are with you. Remember, nothing
                  worth doing can be done overnight.
                  Keep your chins up and do your
                  best not to get shot. Signed, The
                  Postman.

     A buzz goes through the crowd.       Ponytail looks over.

                                PONYTAIL
                  His letters are always kind of
                  short.

     Abby and The Postman exchange a look.

                                FORD
                         (looks up)
                  Hold on now. There's a P.S...
                  Anybody know what P.S. stands for?

     The Postman raises his hand. Ford looks his way. His
     mouth drops as he realizes. In silence, he walks over to
     The Postman. They embrace and all the weight Ford's been
     carrying on his young shoulders suddenly falls to The
     Postman. The kid nearly collapses.

                                 CHUBBY
                  Holy shit...

                                RED
                  That would be H.S., Chubby.

                                CHUBBY
                  I seen him once when I lived in
                  Benning. It's The Postman!

     Word goes through the crowd like a wave.

     The Postman takes the letter, reads.

                                 THE POSTMAN
                  P.S.   Ford knows what to do.

     Ford shrugs sheepishly.

                                FORD
                  Guess you want to talk about this?

     The Postman takes Ford by the elbow. They disappear into
     the tent. The carriers just staring after them,
     awestruck.

     They clamor around her.


92   INT. TENT - DAY                                                 92

     The Postman and Ford.

                                THE POSTMAN
                  President Starkey? Minneapolis?
                  Ford knows what to do?

                                FORD
                  I thought you were dead.

                               THE POSTMAN
                  So? I'm not making the
                  connection. What's all this then?

                                FORD
                  I lied. I told people you were in
                  contact with me.

                                 THE POSTMAN
                  Why?

                                FORD
                  Because I didn't want it to end.

                                THE POSTMAN
                  I don't know how long I can stay,
                  Ford. President Starkey will send
                  word one day and I'll have to move
                  on. Understand?

                               FORD
                  Sure. But you'll stay till he
                  sends word? Right?

     The Postman can't answer, just turns and walks out of the
     tent.


93   EXT. TENT - DAY                                                 93

     As The Postman exits, Chubby leads the carriers in a
     salute. The Postman actually turns a moment to see if
     someone else is standing behind him.

     He looks back, sees the young, shining faces.

                                                       (CONTINUED)

                                THE POSTMAN
                  Aw, don't do that. Hands down.

     Their hands go down in one crisp military move. The
     Postman looks at Abby, to Ford as he exits the tent.         The
     kid is craving reassurance.

                                FORD
                  You'll stay 'til President Starkey
                  sends word, right? Right?

                                THE POSTMAN
                  Yeah, till he sends word, right.

     Ford smiles, gestures to the carriers.

                                FORD
                  Could you say a few words?

     The Postman looks over at the carriers.    They quiet under
     his gaze, immediately respectful.

     The problem is, he has no idea what to say.       Finally:

                                THE POSTMAN
                  Two plus two equals four.

     The cheering is tumultuous. The Postman picks Abby out of
     the cheering crowd -- the look on her face says it all.


94   EXT. RV PARK - WINNEBAGO ROW - DAY                                 94

     The guts of the operation. Several carriers are busy
     sorting and bagging letters. It goes out pinned to a
     clothesline which crisscrosses back and forth. Everyone
     follows as Ford takes The Postman on a tour. There are
     hushed whispers among those who are seeing him for the
     first time.

                                FORD
                  We bring all the mail here first.
                  We sort it, group it and then it
                  goes out. So far we got thirty
                  routes.

     Ford leads The Postman and Abby into another Winnebago.
     Chubby and Red and Ponytail follow. Those that can't fit
     just peer in through the windows.

                                                           88.

95   INT. WINNEBAGO - DAY                                         95

     An old manual crank printing press is working away. Ford
     proudly removes a sheet, shows it to The Postman. A
     caricature of eight evil Holnists, forming a figure eight.
     Beneath: "Unite Against Holnist Tyrraney!"

                             THE POSTMAN
               You spelled tyranny wrong.

                             CHUBBY
                      (low, to Red)
               Boy, he's smart.


96   EXT. RV CAMP - GREEN LAWN - DAY                              96

     The seven young Recruits seen earlier stand in a line.
     They're joined by OLD GEORGE, every day of 75 years old.

     Ponytail holds up her hand, swears them in.

                             PONYTAIL/RECRUITS
               Neither snow, nor rain, nor heat,
               nor gloom of night...

     As they finish, The Postman and Ford pass by. The
     Recruits salute. Shaking his head, The Postman's about to
     salute back when he spots Old George. George has a faded
     purple "AIRBORNE" tattoo on his arm and a twinkle in his
     eye. There's an old crow on his shoulder.

                             THE POSTMAN
               How old are you?

                             OLD GEORGE
               Seventy-five, sir.

     The Postman looks over at Ford, who shrugs.

                               THE POSTMAN
               Can you ride?

                            OLD GEORGE
               Nope. Can't walk too good,
               either.

                             THE POSTMAN
               Why are you here?

                               OLD GEORGE
               I know stuff.

     The Postman looks at Ford again.   Then:

                                THE POSTMAN
                         (re: tattoo)
                  When did you get that?

                                 OLD GEORGE
                  1970. A girl with eyes as big as
                  saucers did me in a little town
                  called Saigon.


97   EXT. RV CAMP - AIRSTREAM - SUNSET                               97

     Carriers move items out of the trailer. The camp is
     buzzing as usual. The Postman looks on -- sees Abby
     passing by.

                                THE POSTMAN
                  Abby --

                                ABBY
                  Yes?

     He's got her attention, just doesn't know what to do with
     it.

                                THE POSTMAN
                  Ford wants me to have his trailer.
                  Said it's the best one.

                                ABBY
                  I'm on the other side of town.

                                THE POSTMAN
                  I got plenty of room here.

     She shakes her head, and then walks away. The Postman
     watches her disappear into the bustle of the camp.

                                THE POSTMAN
                  So much for the uniform theory.


98   EXT. HOLNIST WINTER CAMP (NORTHERN CALIFORNIA) - SUNSET         98

     The same sun sets on the Holnist camp.


99   INT. BETHLEHEM'S TENT - SUNSET                                  99

     Bethlehem once again at his easel with palette in hand.
     He's trying another style -- Impressionism -- and it's
     worse than the last. He looks over as Getty and Gibbs
     approach with a PRISONER.

                                                       (CONTINUED)

                                                              90.

99   CONTINUED:                                                     99

                                BETHLEHEM
                  What do you think, Lieutenant?

                                GIBBS
                  Can't tell what it is if you stand
                  too close. The colors all kinda
                  run together, don't they?

                                BETHLEHEM
                  Yes...

     Bethlehem looks away from his painting to see Gibbs and
     Getty flanking a scared, blue-clad mail carrier. For an
     instant, mistakes him for:

                                BETHLEHEM
                  Well, if it isn't our old friend
                  the U.P.S. man.

                                GIBBS
                  We captured him on the Oregon
                  border.

     Realizing, Bethlehem turns the face from side-to-side.

                                BETHLEHEM
                  Who the hell are you?

                                CARRIER (PRISONER)
                  Carrier Twelve. United States,
                  um, Postal Service.

     Getty sets some of the Carrier's anti-Holnist propaganda
     onto Bethlehem's field table. Bethlehem picks it up.

     It's hard to say what he's thinking.      Finally:

                                BETHLEHEM
                  I want the camp struck at dawn.
                  We're moving north.

                                GIBBS
                  Yes, sir.

     Bethlehem looks back to Carrier Twelve.

                                BETHLEHEM
                         (chilling)
                  You spelled tyranny wrong.

                                                              91.

100   EXT. RV CAMP - DAWN                                           100

      Ten letter carriers are on horseback. Among them, Red and
      Ponytail. Ford and The Postman are also on horses. Each
      rider salutes The Postman, then gets a sheaf of anti-
      Holnist propaganda from Ford.

                              THE POSTMAN
                I wish they'd stop saluting.

      It's annoying him. As Chubby rides up. The Postman
      catches his right wrist as he attempts to salute. So
      Chubby salutes with the left hand instead. As they line
      up:

                              THE POSTMAN
                Just stay safe and remember. The
                mailman's more important than the
                mail.

                              CHUBBY
                Boy, he's smart.

      The sun just peeks up over the horizon. At that signal,
      the carriers thunder off, the ground trembling under them.
      The look on their faces. The glory of it all. They're
      alive! The Postman hesitates, watches after them a
      moment.

                                 THE POSTMAN
                What the hell?

      Urging his horse forward, he rides after them. With them.
      And then, like an exploding firework, each postman shoots
      off in a separate direction. Headed for all points of the
      compass and some in between.


101   EXT. OREGON HAMLET - DAY                                      101

      The Postman looks down on the gathered crowd from his
      horse and smiles.

                              THE POSTMAN
                For President Starkey and the
                First Congress of the Restored
                United States, I officially
                declare Postal Station 10...
                What's the name of this town?

                              YOUNG LEADER
                We never named it.

                              THE POSTMAN
                       (thinks; smiles)
                I officially declare Postal
                Station 10 in Elvis, Oregon, open
                for business!

                                                              92.

102   EXT. TOWN (SOMEWHERE IN OREGON) - DAY                         102

      An eye-blink of a town. Ponytail stands on a crate
      reading names and handing letters to the grateful people
      massed around her.


103   EXT. TOWN (IDAHO BORDER) - DAY                                103

      Red and Chubby finish mail call, exchange an amazed look
      as they're offered a platter of food.


104   EXT. HIGHWAY - NIGHT                                          104

      The moon hangs low over an interstate. A rider is
      silhouetted by the silvery orb, looking like some post-
      apocalyptic Don Quixote. It's The Postman.


105   EXT. FARMHOUSE/COUNTRY ROAD - DAY                             105

      Seen FROM the porch, a rider gallops hard on the road
      beyond.

      A LITTLE BOY comes rushing out, letter in hand. The boy
      pulls up short; realizes the rider is already too far
      gone. The boy's shoulders sag; he's crushed.

                                LITTLE BOY
                I missed him.

      It's an almost psychic moment as the rider reins up in the
      distance and turns back around. A frozen beat and he
      starts galloping back down the road.

      Fearless, the boy holds out the letter. The rider closes;
      it's The Postman. The boy stretches out as far as he can.
      Without breaking stride, The Postman leans out of the
      saddle, snatches the letter as he passes.

      The boy watches after him -- knows what he's going to be
      when he grows up.


106   EXT. PINE VIEW GATES - DAY                                    106

      Sheriff Briscoe huffs and puffs his big frame up the
      ladder and onto the top of the palisade.

                              BRISCOE
                Phil, this better not be another
                of your U.F.O.'s.

      He looks where the sentry points. The Postman waits at
      the gate, behind him on horseback: Ford and Abby.

                                                    (CONTINUED)

                                  THE POSTMAN
                   I'm back!   And I got mail.

                                 BRISCOE
                          (amazed)
                   I'll be damned.


107   EXT. PINE VIEW STREETS - DAY                                    107

      The Postman rides with Briscoe, hurrying to stay alongside
      him. Half the town jogs along behind them.

                                 FORD
                   Bethlehem is offering a 1000
                   pounds of gold to whoever brings
                   you in. Dead or alive.

                                 THE POSTMAN
                   Thank God it wasn't a carton of
                   cigarettes.

                                 BRISCOE
                   I'd have shot you myself.


108   EXT. PINE VIEW STREETS - NIGHT                                  108

      Pine View is throwing a party. It's in full swing. A
      couple of guitars. A banjo and a trombone. Everyone
      dances.

      The Postman walks with Briscoe, sees Mrs. March as her
      letter is read to her. Catches a glimpse of Abby dancing
      with Ford. He seems, for the first time, truly happy.
      For that matter, so does Briscoe.

                                 BRISCOE
                   Things are getting better.
                   Getting better all the time.
                          (a beat)
                   I don't know who you are, but I do
                   know I was wrong about you.

      The Postman smiles, reaches in his bag for an envelope.

                                 THE POSTMAN
                   Got a letter for you, Sheriff.

      Briscoe turns it over in his hands, looks up in wonder.

                                 BRISCOE
                   It's from my sister. I thought
                   she was dead.

                                                        (CONTINUED)

                                 THE POSTMAN
                   You thought wrong.

      Briscoe has tears in his eyes.    The Postman continues on,
      embarrassed but affected.


      DANCE

      The Postman taps Ford's shoulder, wants to cut in on him
      and Abby. Ford steps aside. A beat before Abby decides
      it's okay. They begin. Her eyes are on her feet, careful
      that she doesn't take a misstep. But his eyes are on her.
      And over it all, BLEEDING IN, the sound of HOOF BEATS.


109   EXT. LONELY ROAD (SOUTHERN OREGON) - NIGHT                     109

      A mail carrier, Red, rides like the devil himself was in
      pursuit. Almost. It's Getty and three Holnists.

      INTERCUT WITH:


      DANCE

      They whirl as the tempo picks up. The Postman pulls Abby
      in closer. Her eyes now move up to his.


      ROAD

      They're closing in on the terrified Red.


      DANCE

      Abby and The Postman.    The chemistry is undeniable.


      ROAD

      RIFLES CRACK. SHOT in the back, Red throws back his arms.
      Letters flutter from the mail bag over his shoulder; he
      seems to glide along that way forever.


      DANCE

      The Postman looks at Abby; she's so beautiful.    Like only
      a pregnant woman can be.

                                                       (CONTINUED)

                                 THE POSTMAN
                   Tell me about the baby, Abby.   I
                   want to know.

      Abby snaps out of the dream she's in. This isn't right.
      Breaking away, she heads off. As he watches her go:


      ROAD

      Red falls from his horse.    One of the soldiers scoops up
      his mailbag.

                                                        CUT TO:


110   INT. COMMAND TENT (SOUTHERN OREGON) - NIGHT                       110

      By lantern, Bethlehem and Getty watch as Gibbs sorts
      through the contents of the confiscated mailbag.

                                 GIBBS
                   Births and deaths, the weather,
                   gossip. There's nothing here.

                                 BETHLEHEM
                   Nothing? Everything is here.    Am
                   I the only one who sees that?
                          (to Gibbs)
                   Get out!

      Gibbs hurries away, leaving Bethlehem and Getty alone.

                                 BETHLEHEM
                   Give the people back their hope
                   and their dreams won't be far
                   behind.

      Bethlehem sees Getty waiting.

                                 BETHLEHEM
                   What is it, Getty?

      Getty hands Bethlehem a sheet of paper -- something Gibbs
      missed. It's a propaganda sheet featuring a caricature of
      The Postman leading a few carriers against Bethlehem and
      his army -- represented as Hitler and the Nazis. The
      caption underneath reads: "Ride Against the Holnist
      Tide!"

                          (crumpling the paper)
                   A military man, especially a
                   commander, should keep a journal.
                   After he's gone, it's the only
                   real defense against the slander
                   that arises.


111   INT. OLD GEORGE'S TRAILER - NIGHT                               111

      Old George sits hunched over a home-made shortwave radio
      with a joint in his mouth. The Postman sits beside him,
      listening as STATIC pours from an old car SPEAKER.

                                 THE POSTMAN
                   Who do you talk to?

                                 OLD GEORGE
                   Not a soul in seven years of
                   trying. But I will.

      The Postman steps to a telescope pointing up through a
      hole in the trailer ceiling.

                                 OLD GEORGE
                   Go ahead. Take a look.
                          (offering joint)
                   Want some?

                   No. No thanks. Hey, don't let
                   the kids see that.

      George nods and goes on playing with the dials --
      searching for a voice in the void.

      The Postman focuses on the moon.

                                 OLD GEORGE
                   I was an aerospace engineer. I
                   helped design the Galileo space
                   station.
                          (scanning sky)
                   I dream it's orbiting Earth
                   forever. With a dozen human
                   skeletons all grinning at each
                   other. Laughing at us down here.

      There's an urgent KNOCKING on the trailer door.    Ford
      appears.

                                 THE POSTMAN
                   What is it?

                                                       (CONTINUED)

                                  FORD
                   It's Red.   He's overdue.

                                 THE POSTMAN
                   That makes five. All on Southern
                   routes.


112   EXT. TRUCK STOP - DAY                                        112

      Five dead mail carriers have been laid out on the asphalt.
      Bethlehem walks the line, looking for his elusive arch-
      enemy.

                                 BETHLEHEM
                   No.  No. Not him. No.
                          (looks to soldiers)
                   Children. I want a man and you
                   bring me children!


113   EXT. OREGON ROAD - DAY                                       113

      A beautiful day. Ponytail rounds a bend at a lope -- and
      then -- her eyes widen in terror. She jerks the reins;
      the horse rears in protest.

      Ahead: the truck stop. The five mail carriers hang
      upside down from the roof's overhang. A macabre sight.


      POV THROUGH RIFLE SCOPE

      SIGHTING ON Ponytail. A hand comes INTO FRAME and brings
      the rifle barrel down. It's --


      GIBBS AND HOLNIST SHARPSHOOTER

                                 GIBBS
                   Not yet. General wants the
                   message to get back.


114   EXT. RV. CAMP - NIGHT                                        114

      PAN UP FROM The Postman's dusty boots TO his grimly
      determined face as he strides through camp and stops at
      Old George's trailer.

      He moves OUT OF FRAME, revealing -- Abby and Ponytail in
      the b.g.

                                                                98.

115   INT. OLD GEORGE'S TRAILER - NIGHT                               115

      As usual, Old George is hunkered down before his short
      wave. He looks as the door opens and The Postman enters.

                                 THE POSTMAN
                   Tell me about the other stuff you
                   know...

      George crosses the trailer, opens a cabinet. Inside:
      twenty odd guns plus the parts for several more. The CROW
      CAWS.


116   EXT. ELVIS, OREGON - DAY                                        116

      Quiet. An old flag ruffles outside the post office -- the
      only new structure in town. Old George sweeps the porch
      as a patrol of ten Holnist soldiers ride into town.
      George makes no move to flee as they near. As they rein
      up across from him he just smiles and continues sweeping.

      Sensing it, the Holnist officer looks up. There, on the
      roof, stands The Postman. Ford and Briscoe flank him --
      along with twenty mailmen and locals, armed with guns,
      bows and rocks.

      As the soldiers raise their rifles, the roofies OPEN FIRE.
      George whips up a sawed-off SHOTGUN. BOOM! Caught in the
      storm, the ten soldiers go down.

      Grim, The Postman looks to Ford as the locals cheer.
      George resumes sweeping. The mailmen climb down to strip
      the weapons off the dead.

                                 THE POSTMAN
                   Ford, I want you to get rid of the
                   bodies. I don't want these people
                   blamed for what we did.

      Ford nods.


117   EXT. HOLNIST ARMY CAMP - NIGHT                                  117

      Two sentries guard the east. They peer into the gloom at
      the sound of a WAGON APPROACHING. It sounds like it's
      coming fast.

                                  SENTRY
                   Halt!   Identify yourself!

      WAGON

      tearing along. Ford at the reins, urging the horses to
      all possible speed.  Then he stands, leaps to the ground.


      SENTRIES

      They raise their rifles as the riderless wagon looms out
      of the night. They each get off a SHOT before being
      forced to dive out of the way. The wagon continues on,
      down to...


      HOLNIST CAMP

      A soldier finally grabs hold of one of the halters and
      brings the wagon to a stop. Half-dressed, Bethlehem steps
      up. A tarp covers the back upon which is written...

                                  BETHLEHEM
                          (reading)
                   Postage due...

      Bethlehem yanks away the tarp to reveal the 10 dead
      Holnist soldiers. The men around Bethlehem exchange
      looks, can't believe it. Bethlehem bellows in rage.


118   EXT. WOODS - NIGHT                                             118

      Ford, hidden in the woods, smiles at the sound.


119   EXT. HOLNIST CAMP - NIGHT                                      119

      Bethlehem steps forward and shouts his challenge into the
      night.

                                 BETHLEHEM
                   You want a war? I'll give you a
                   war. I was born for it!


120   EXT. WOODS - NIGHT                                             120

      Bethlehem's words reach Ford, his smile fades. He's just
      a scared boy. He kicks his horse into a gallop and rides
      away.

                                                     CUT TO:

                                                            100.

121   EXT. SMALL AIRFIELD - DAY                                    121

      In the fog, the sound of hollow HOOF BEATS. The Postman
      rides past the shapes of airplanes. Standing silent.
      Forever grounded. The ghosts of the past.


122   EXT. RV CAMP - DAY                                           122

      Ford is swearing in four new recruits.


      ON FORD AND RECRUITS

      As they repeat after him we realize they've changed the
      oath a bit.

                              FORD/RECRUITS
                Neither snow, nor heat, nor gloom
                of night. Through bandit's hell,
                through fire fight. Through flood
                and plague we cannot fail. No
                Holnist trash will stop the mail.


      THE POSTMAN

      riding his weary mount into town, saddlebags bulging with
      mail. He pauses by the new recruits long enough to hear
      the words they're saying.

      As he dismounts, a fresh-faced carrier takes the bridle.
      The Postman's well past the point of fatigue. He's living
      on pure adrenaline.

                              THE POSTMAN
                Get this mail sorted. Bring me a
                fresh horse. Something to eat.

      As fresh-face starts away, The Postman calls after him.

                              THE POSTMAN
                And all the mail going South!

      The Postman watches as Ford shakes the hands of the new
      recruits.

      The Postman reaches for his canteen. Empty. Damn. A tin
      cup filled with water appears from nowhere. Abby. The
      Postman takes it, too tired to acknowledge the gesture.

                              THE POSTMAN
                They changed the oath.

                                                    (CONTINUED)

                                                                101.

                                  ABBY
                   Ford's idea.

                                 THE POSTMAN
                   Figures.
                          (scoffs)
                   They don't think to ask who
                   they're replacing. Or why.

      He drains the cup and hands it back to her.      Just then,
      one of the new recruits, LUKE, steps over.

                                 LUKE
                   Sir? It'd be an honor if I could
                   shake your hand.

      A farmboy-type, Luke looks like a younger version of
      Woody. The Postman sees this, is lost in reverie. Luke
      still holds his hand out.

                                  LUKE
                   Sir?

                                 THE POSTMAN
                   You look like... Do I know you?

                                  LUKE
                   No, sir.

                                 THE POSTMAN
                   Well, good luck to you.

      Nodding in awe, Luke heads off.

                                  THE POSTMAN
                   Nice kid.   Probably be dead in a
                   week.

                                 ABBY
                          (ignores it)
                   You're exhausted. You need rest.
                   There's food in the trailer --

      Ponytail rides by; two sacks of mail hang from her saddle
      pommel. The Postman grabs her horse's halter, stops her.

                                 THE POSTMAN
                   Where are you going?

                                 PONYTAIL
                   Route twenty-two. I'm already an
                   hour late.

                   You're grounded. Get off the
                   horse. You know the rule.

                                 PONYTAIL
                   What rule?

                                 THE POSTMAN
                   Twenty-two's too far south.

                                 PONYTAIL
                   But they're waiting on their mail
                   down there.

                                 THE POSTMAN
                   Get off the goddamn horse.

      Shocked, she does. At the same time, fresh-face comes up
      leading a second horse laden with mail.

                                  THE POSTMAN
                          (re: Ponytail's
                           horse)
                   Tie him off to this one.

      Fresh-face goes about tying the second horse to the first.

                                 ABBY
                   You can't keep doing this.

                                 THE POSTMAN
                   Doing what?

                                  ABBY
                   Riding all the routes.   You're not
                   saving anyone.

      The Postman climbs on Ponytail's horse, looks at Abby.

                                 THE POSTMAN
                   Did I ever tell you how I got to
                   be a postman, Abby?
                          (doesn't give
                           her time to answer)
                   I don't know if you'd laugh or
                   cry.

      The Postman digs in his heels. The horse gallops away,
      the second one following behind.

                                                               103.

123   EXT. ELVIS, OREGON - CLOSE ON BLOODIED POSTAL CARRIER -         123
      NIGHT

      A crowd of townsfolk are visible in deep b.g.   Beyond
      them, the town of Elvis burns to the ground.

      The CAMERA CIRCLES AROUND the BLOODIED CARRIER until we're
      looking OVER his shoulder at a firing squad led by Colonel
      Getty and Lieutenant Gibbs. Bethlehem watches.

                              GIBBS
                Ready!

      The only building not on fire is the post office. A
      SOLDIER rides up, carrying a torch, meaning to burn it.

                              SOLDIER
                The post office, General?

                              BETHLEHEM
                No. Let it stand. All by itself.
                So it can remind them what it cost
                them.

                              GIBBS
                Aim!

      Rifles are aimed.

                              GIBBS
                Fire!

      Shock and dismay from the townsfolk as SHOTS RING OUT.


      CLOSE ON BLOODY CARRIER'S FACE

      as he realizes he's still standing.

      PULL BACK to reveal nine bodies lying on the ground.     Only
      the Bloodied Carrier is still standing.

      Bethlehem points at the Bloodied Carrier, crooks a finger
      for him. He staggers up. Bethlehem smiles.

                              BETHLEHEM
                You think you can ride?
                       (as the Carrier
                        nods)
                Then today's your lucky day.

      The Postman motions it's okay as the Carrier struggles.

                                 BLOODIED CARRIER
                   ... he's... headed north. He's

                   town. Then burn it to the ground.
                   For what you did...

      The Postman is puzzled.    But Ford knows what and why.

                                 BLOODIED CARRIER
                   He said to tell you Pine View's on
                   his way. He said he'd wait there,
                   but not for long.
                          (breaking down)
                   I was so scared, sir... I thought
                   they were going to kill me, too...
                   I wish they would have...

      The Postman poised on a rise that affords a view of the
      gruesome spectacle below.


      POSTMAN'S POV

      Pine View in flames. The big John Deere gun has blown
      several gaps into the palisade. Bethlehem watches as his
      army sacks the town. The people have been rounded up.
      The selection of the ten has begun.


126   EXT. RISE ABOVE PINE VIEW - DAY                                  126

      The Postman wheels his horse around. But Ford, Ponytail,
      Chubby and Luke are standing in his way.

                                 FORD
                   What are you going to do?

                                 THE POSTMAN
                   I'm going to stop this.

                                 FORD
                   You can't.

                                 THE POSTMAN
                   Get out of my way, Ford. All of
                   you.

                                 FORD
                          (shaking his head)
                   They'll kill you.

      The Postman starts to ride through them.      Luke, Chubby and
      Ponytail move their horses to block.

      Ford maneuvers his horse in close and grabs The Postman's
      harness.

                                  THE POSTMAN
                   Goddamnit --

      The Postman jumps off his horse. Ford tackles him. The
      Postman shoves him away, continues on. Luke and Chubby
      pounce on him. With Ford's help, they hold him down.

                                 FORD
                   You can't help them!

                                 THE POSTMAN
                   There's still time, Ford!

      The Postman struggles.      They're genuinely having trouble
      holding him down.

                                 PONYTAIL
                          (re: The Postman)
                   You're hurting him.

      But there's no let-up.

                                 FORD
                   No, this is all my doing.    I went
                   against your orders.

      There's a moment of shocked surprise.

                                 FORD
                   The Holnists we killed. You told
                   me to bury them. But I didn't. I
                   sent Bethlehem the bodies.

                                  THE POSTMAN
                   Why?

                                 FORD
                   Because Bethlehem has to know that
                   we're not going to stop.

                                                         (CONTINUED)

                                 THE POSTMAN
                   God damn you, Ford. Those people
                   down there are dying because of
                   us. Because of what we did.

                                 FORD
                   Bullshit. They're dying because
                   of Bethlehem. They're dying
                   because this is a shitty world.
                   And if we're ever going to change
                   it, then somebody might have to
                   die. If I could make it be me
                   down there I would. But I can't.

      A terrible SCREAM gives them all pause.

      Down below -- Holnist soldiers hold back a screaming
      mother as her 10-year-old boy is pulled into the line.

      Sheriff Briscoe is among the ten, he puts his hand on the
      boy's shoulder -- the picture of grace under pressure.

                   Billy.

      A moment of stunned silence.

                                 PONYTAIL
                   What Ford did was wrong. But it
                   doesn't change anything for any of
                   us. Does it?

      Bethlehem looks the line-up over. The firing squad stands
      at the ready. Bethlehem looks to the trees -- feeling
      something.

                                 BETHLEHEM

                   He's out there somewhere.
                   Watching. I can feel it.

      Briscoe follows his gaze. He doesn't see anything, but
      maybe gets the same feeling. Bethlehem looks to Briscoe.

                                 BETHLEHEM
                   You feel it too, don't you?
                   Didn't have to end like this,
                   Sheriff. He knew where I'd be if
                   he wanted to face me like a man.
                   Instead, he's hiding like a
                   rabbit. So much for your Postman.

                                    GIBBS
                   Ready!    Aim!

      Rifles are raised. Briscoe seems to grow as he throws his
      shoulders back and shouts...

      The Postman folds a letter, shoves it into an envelope.
      He writes "Bethlehem" across the front, starts to write a
      second letter. The door opens and Abby enters.

                              ABBY
                Ford thinks you're going to do
                something.

                               THE POSTMAN
                I am.

      The Postman watches as, outside, the mail carriers begin
      to assemble.

                              THE POSTMAN
                If I don't, those kids are going
                to keep on getting themselves
                killed.

                              ABBY
                Ford doesn't know what it means to
                be a kid. He doesn't have your
                memories. None of them do. All
                they've got is the lousy world we
                gave them. And this is the only
                decent thing in it.

                               THE POSTMAN
                What? Being a postman? It's all
                bullshit, Abby. All of it.
                       (beat)
                I took this uniform off a skeleton
                to stay warm. I made up the rest
                to stay fed. There is no restored
                United States.

                              ABBY
                I knew it was something like that.

      The Postman fingers the brim of the cap, softens.

      Twelve mail carriers, including Ford, Ponytail, Chubby,
      Luke and Old George, wait as The Postman steps up before
      them. Abby's off to the side.

                   Got a letter from President
                   Starkey.

      An excited murmur among the carriers. Only Ford eyes The
      Postman suspiciously. The Postman reads:

                                 THE POSTMAN
                   'Greetings all carriers.'

      He looks at them, doesn't need to read what's in his
      heart.

                   In dark days, in a weary world,
                   you gave everything and asked for
                   nothing. You beat back despair
                   and replaced it with hope and for
                   that your country can never repay
                   you. But the price is too high.
                   I won't see anymore of my bravest
                   die. It is my duty to hereby
                   disband the Postal Service of the
                   restored United States. You are
                   to burn your uniforms and The
                   Postman is to return to
                   Minneapolis at once. Thank you
                   and that is all.

      A hushed silence. The Postman walks away. The carriers
      exchange tired, defeated looks. Abby just sighs, knows
      he's not necessarily wrong.

      Ford catches up with The Postman.    He stares at The
      Postman; The Postman stares back.

                           (low; fierce)
                   The President never wrote that

                   If he could've that's what he
                   would have said.

      Ford gestures to the second letter.

                   Who's the other letter to?

                   Bethlehem. I'm taking it to him
                   in the morning.

                                 FORD
                   What does it say?

                   What does it say?

                          (stops; turns)
                   It says it's over. It says we
                   quit.

                                 FORD
                   It says you quit. What about the
                   oath?

                                 THE POSTMAN
                   Tell me something, Ford. How much
                   mail can a dead postman deliver?
                   It's over.

      The Postman starts to walk away again.

                                 FORD
                   Then I'll take it.

                                 THE POSTMAN
                   I can't trust you.

      Ford gathers courage and confronts The Postman.

                                 FORD
                   If this is the end. If this is
                   the last piece of mail that ever
                   gets delivered. I'll take it.

                                 THE POSTMAN
                   Whoever takes this letter probably
                   dies for it.

      Ford thrusts out his hand.

                                 FORD
                   I'm still a postman. You owe it
                   to me... I owe it to me.

      The Postman hesitates, studies the intense young man.
      Gives him the letter.


138   EXT. R.V. CAMP - STABLE AREA - DAY                               138

      The Postman is packing bags onto a horse as Abby
      approaches.

                                 THE POSTMAN
                   I'm going to St. Rose, Abby. And
                   I'm taking you with me. I know
                   you don't want to hear it, but
                   that's my child inside you. I
                   want to see it born somewhere
                   safe. I have a right to that,
                   Abby. Whether you like it or not.

      Abby walks away. The Postman rests his head on his pack
      for a moment. Heavy.

                                                        (CONTINUED)

                                                                112.

      The CLICK of a GUN causes The Postman to lift his head and
      see Luke standing there.

                                 THE POSTMAN
                   Thought I recognized you.

                                 LUKE
                   General Bethlehem said...
                          (raises the pistol)
                   ... You should be on your knees
                   when I do it.

                                 THE POSTMAN
                   I don't give a damn what that
                   asshole said.

                                 LUKE
                   The general is a great man.

                                 THE POSTMAN
                   The general is a fucking lunatic.

      The Postman steps forward. Stops when the barrel of the
      pistol is right against his own chest.

                                 THE POSTMAN
                   You don't own a thought in that
                   goddamn head of yours, do you?
                          (a beat)
                   You want to see a man?

      The Postman turns to watch as Ford starts out of camp.

                                   THE POSTMAN
                   That's a man.

      The Postman turns, sees Luke's face fraught with confusion
      and emotion.

                                 THE POSTMAN
                   You don't understand, do you? You
                   never will until you can think for
                   yourself and be willing to pay the
                   price for it.

      Luke stares back into The Postman's eyes.      A frozen beat.

                                   THE POSTMAN
                   You ready?

                                   ABBY (O.S.)
                   Yes.

      Abby sits on her horse. She's witness to it all. Luke is
      confused and ashamed. The Postman mounts his horse and
      moves to Abby's side.

                                 THE POSTMAN
                   You're a better man than
                   Bethlehem, Luke. I've seen it.


139   EXT. RIDGE - R.V. CAMP - DAY                                    139

      Some carriers drop their uniforms into a bonfire.

      The Postman and Abby ride up on the ridge above the RV
      camp. They pause to look back one last time. Across the
      way, on the other side, Ford is doing the same thing. As
      though he senses it, Ford stops and looks back.

      Ford raises his hand, salutes. Slowly, The Postman brings
      up his own hand. But he doesn't salute. He waves. Good-
      bye. As Ford turns away, so does The Postman.


      ON CHUBBY, PONYTAIL AND CARRIER NAMED DREW

      watching as The Postman and Abby disappear from sight.

                                 CHUBBY
                   Guess Minneapolis is that way.


140   EXT. INTERSTATE - DAY                                           140

      A sign prohibits pedestrians, horses and bicycles. The
      Postman and Abby ride by. The Postman no longer wears his
      uniform. Their gear is packed behind their saddles.

      As a family of transients begin to rise from where they're
      camped in the breakdown lane:

                                 THE POSTMAN
                   We can't help you. We're just as
                   lost as you are.

      The Postman rides on. Abby watches over her shoulder as
      they slowly begin to sit back down.


141   EXT. HOLNIST CAMP - BETHLEHEM'S TENT - DAWN                     141

      Bethlehem sits waiting at his camp table.     Behind him, a
      finished painting.

                                                       (CONTINUED)

      This time he's painted himself in the grand Rococo-style -
      - as part of the Holy Family with doves and flowers and
      glowing rays from Heaven. It's awful.

      Getty and Gibbs bring in a prisoner.       It's Ford!

                                 BETHLEHEM
                   Good lord, what do we have here?

                   I'm a representative of the
                   restored United States --

      Bethlehem backhands Ford.

                                 GIBBS
                   He's got a letter. Says The
                   Postman sent it.

                                 BETHLEHEM
                   A letter?

      Bethlehem tears open the letter and starts to read:

                                 BETHLEHEM
                   'Bethlehem. This letter is my
                   testimony to the fact that there
                   is no restored United States and
                   there is no Postal Service.'
                          (laugh; grim)
                   Then who the hell have we been
                   fighting...?
                          (reads on)
                   'My carriers are returning home.
                   In exchange, I'm asking you to let
                   them be. The Postman.'

      Bethlehem eyes Ford with undisguised contempt.

                                 BETHLEHEM
                   He expects me to believe this?

                                 LUKE (O.S.)
                   It's true, sir. I was there. He
                   disbanded the carriers and rode
                   west.

      Ford turns blazing eyes to Luke -- he's been standing
      there all along.

                                 FORD
                   Traitor...

      It takes a moment for the news to sink in.      But it does.

                   Then I've won.     I've won.

      As the assembled Holnists congratulate each other,
      Bethlehem looks at Luke.

                                 BETHLEHEM
                   You were supposed to kill him.

                                 LUKE
                   I couldn't get close enough.
                          (re: Ford)
                   This one's his second in command.

      Bethlehem looks Ford over.

                                 BETHLEHEM
                   Why doesn't that surprise me?

      Ford stares back.    Proud.     Bethlehem looks to Getty.

                                 BETHLEHEM
                   Bring out the one we found
                   yesterday. They can die together.

      A frightened CARRIER is brought up. He wears a purple
      uniform with CALI sewn on the shoulder. Neither we nor
      Ford have seen him before. As a firing squad assembles,
      Ford is shoved over with him.

                                    FORD
                   Who are you?

                   the restored Republic of
                   California. Who are you?

      Ford looks at him a second, can't help but laugh.      From
      Gibbs; the shout of "ready!"

                                 FORD

      Bethlehem watches as Clark holds out his hand.      Ford
      shakes it. "Aim!"

      A pair of boots are walking through the water. It's The
      Postman. He turns over a body in the water. It wears a
      homemade postal uniform, a bag of mail twisted around his
      arm. It's a young face, one we haven't seen before. He
      looks up to Abby on a ridge.

                                 THE POSTMAN
                   I don't know him. Do you?

                   Where do you think he came from?

      Puzzled, The Postman shakes his head. He gently releases
      the body. The current takes it and they watch as it
      continues on its way to Postal Valhalla.

      The family of transients are grilled by three Holnist
      scouts. One man points the way Abby and Bethlehem rode.

                                                                 117.

      Littered with rubble. The wood, brick, steel and concrete
      of what was once a small town. Amazingly, one gray house
      still stands, miraculously untouched by whatever disaster
      visited this place.

      A wild-haired SQUATTER steps out on the porch as Abby and
      The Postman ride by. He waves hello with a .45.

                       (motions an explosion)
                ... 'Poof.' Destroyed everything
                for miles. But the sunsets are
                beautiful.

                              THE POSTMAN
                You ever hear of a city called St.
                Rose?

                              SQUATTER
                Friend, I've never heard of St.
                Shit.

      The Squatter laughs and laughs -- like it was the funniest
      thing in the world. The Postman and Abby exchange a look,
      continue on their way.

                              SQUATTER
                Hey, don't go! I got Monopoly in
                the house! Boardwalk, Park Place
                and the Reading Railroad!

                                                       CUT TO:


145   EXT. EDGE OF RUBBLE - DAY                                         145

      Ponytail, Chubby, and Draw watching from afar.    Chubby has
      the telescope.

                              CHUBBY
                You think that's President
                Starkey?

                                                       (CONTINUED)

                                                                 118.

145   CONTINUED:                                                        145

      Ponytail takes the telescope from Chubby for a look.

                                 PONYTAIL
                   No.

                                 CHUBBY
                   What makes you so sure?

                                 PONYTAIL
                   President lives in a white house.
                   That guy's place is gray.

      Drew and Chubby exchange a look.       That makes sense.


146   EXT. SKY - DAY                                                    146

      A lightning bolt shreds the sky.       It's day, but the sky is
      black with rain.


147   EXT. HIGH TENSION TOWERS - DAY                                    147

      The useless towers cutting across a valley.      Rain beats
      down, as The Postman and Abby trudge along.

      Up ahead, a rail-road tunnel promises shelter from the
      storm.

                                 THE POSTMAN
                          (re: the tunnel)
                   We can rest in there.

      Abby is quick to agree.

      Out of the corner of his eye, The Postman catches a blur
      of movement.

      He turns his head quickly, but he's barely in time to see
      a wooden basket, attached to one of the high wires, swing
      from a distant tower. There's a sentry inside it.

      The basketed sentry whistles away at 40 mph, heading
      straight for an adjacent tower. In a matter of seconds,
      he's lost from view.

      The Postman looks back at Abby.       She's shivering.

                                 THE POSTMAN
                   Did you see that?

                                 ABBY
                          (shaking her head)
                   I'm hungry, Postman.

      The Postman guides her toward the train tunnel.

                                                              119.

148   INT. TRAIN TUNNEL - DAY                                        148

      Abby sleeps beside the fire. The Postman, silhouetted
      against the flames, heads toward the far tunnel exit.


149   EXT. FAR SIDE OF TUNNEL - DAY                                  149

      The Postman peers into the rain, taking in the view of a
      distant bridge. Abby comes to stand at his side.


150   EXT. COLUMBIA RIVER GORGE (BRIDGE CITY) - DAY                  150

      A town settled between spans of a steel truss bridge. The
      Columbia River rushes far below. A sentry spots Abby and
      The Postman approaching, blows a whistle.

                              GUARD
                Set the rifle on the ground.

                              THE POSTMAN
                This old thing? It isn't even
                loaded. Where are we?

      The BRIDGE CITY MAYOR, a middle-aged retro-hippie, steps
      up.

                              B.C. MAYOR
                You're in Bridge City. Where we
                don't allow guns.

      The Postman sets down the carbine.    The Guard steps over
      to scoop it up.

                              B.C. MAYOR
                Sentry said you were coming.

      The Postman stares at the Mayor a beat.

                                 THE POSTMAN
                I know you.     You're famous.

                              B.C. MAYOR
                I was once. Not anymore.
                       (beat)
                Are you looking to cross?

                              THE POSTMAN
                We will be. Right now, we'd just
                appreciate some food.
                       (as the Mayor
                        nods his assent)
                I got some kids behind me, too.

                                                      (CONTINUED)

                                                                120.

150   CONTINUED:                                                       150

                                   B.C. MAYOR
                   How many?

                                   THE POSTMAN
                   Three.
                          (as the Mayor
                           agrees once more)
                   Hey, guys, come on in! I know
                   you're out there!

                                 CHUBBY SENTRY
                   Boy, is he smart...

      As they stand, show themselves.


151   EXT. NORTH BOUND LANE (BRIDGE CITY) - DUSK                       151

      Fog rolls in.    Abby rests.

      Ponytail, Chubby and Drew look up gratefully as one of the
      citizens of Bridge City doles out bread.

      The Mayor steps over, hands The Postman two loaves.

                                 B.C. MAYOR
                   For you and your wife.

                                   THE POSTMAN
                   Thanks.    She's not my wife.

      The exchange cuts Abby like a knife. She gets up and
      leaves. The Mayor keeps his council -- not sure what to
      make of this arrangement.

                                 THE POSTMAN
                   Let me ask you something, have you
                   ever heard of a town with electric
                   lights?

                                   B.C. MAYOR
                   St. Rose?

                                   THE POSTMAN
                   Yeah!

                                 B.C. MAYOR
                   Never been. But they say it's a
                   ways down on the coast.

                                   THE POSTMAN
                   How far?

                                                        (CONTINUED)

                                                                121.

151   CONTINUED:                                                       151

                                 B.C. MAYOR
                   Couple hundred miles at least.   I
                   couldn't say for sure.

      It's the discovery of a lifetime. The Postman looks to
      the west end of the bridge, where Abby stands alone.

                                 THE POSTMAN
                   You seem like a decent man. And
                   these seem like decent people.

                                   B.C. MAYOR
                   We try to be.

                                 THE POSTMAN
                   And this seems like a safe place.

                                 B.C. MAYOR
                          (intuitive)
                   You want to leave her?

      The Postman looks back to the Mayor, then slowly nods.

                                 THE POSTMAN
                   All of them. I'll give you the
                   horses and my gear. Abby's
                   special. She's strong. Probably
                   end up running the place.

                                 B.C. MAYOR
                   Why don't you take the night to
                   think. Decide if that's what you
                   really want.


152   EXT. BRIDGE - NIGHT                                              152

      Fog obscures the east end. A sentry squints at the
      MUFFLED CLOP of HOOVES. The mist parts to reveal, seventy
      yards away: three Holnist scouts on horseback.
      Emissaries from hell.

      As the sentry blows a whistle...


      BRIDGE

      As word spreads, folks move down the bridge for a look.
      Eating their bread, The Postman, Abby and the carriers
      join them.

                                                        (CONTINUED)

      EAST END

      The Mayor stands across from the lead scout -- conferring.
      Finally, the Mayor points him back the way he came. The
      lead scout doesn't budge, spots The Postman in the crowd.

      He and The Postman seem to stare at each other forever.
      Then, with a flick of the reins, he's gone. The other two
      follow. Swallowed up by the misty evening gloom. The
      Postman's head swims dizzily. It's not over.

      The Mayor returns to dozens of nervous questions.

                                 B.C. MAYOR
                   They're looking for The Postman.

                                 B.C. MAN
                   No such thing anymore.

                                 B.C. MAYOR
                   Man on the horse says there is.
                   Says he thinks he's here. Says
                   he's coming back with friends.

      A little BOY steps forward, sings out.

                                 B.C. BOY
                   What's a postman?

      A silent moment. It's been so long, no one's sure how to
      answer. The Postman looks down at the ground. The
      carriers exchange deflated looks. Then...

                                 ABBY
                          (stepping forward)
                   You never heard of a postman?

      He shakes his head "no." Seems a shame. As The Postman
      looks over at Abby, she takes a page from his book.

                                 ABBY
                   There used to be a postman for
                   every street in America. They
                   wore uniforms. And hats. Like
                   this one...

      She goes to The Postman's gear, returns with his postal
      cap. Sets it on the boy's head.

                                 B.C. BOY
                   Wow...

                                                      (CONTINUED)

                                                                123.

152   CONTINUED:    (2)                                                152

                                 ABBY
                   My postman knew the name of every
                   kid on my street. He knew our
                   birthdays. He'd even find the
                   baseballs you'd hit down the
                   street. I can still see the smile
                   on his face. The tip of his cap
                   -- when he had a letter in his bag
                   with my name on it. Mine always
                   came just after school. You could
                   set your watch by him. Unless you
                   were waiting on something special
                   -- like a present from somewhere
                   far away or a letter from your
                   sweetheart. Then it seemed like
                   he'd never come. I used to think
                   they could make time stand still.

      Several other listeners nod -- they're completely with
      her.

                                 ABBY
                   I don't think we ever really
                   understood what they meant to us
                   until they were gone. Getting a
                   letter made you feel like you were
                   part of something bigger than
                   yourself. No place was ever too
                   far away for the postman. So
                   nobody ever had to be alone. The
                   postman was someone you could
                   count on. Things just made more
                   sense when they were around.
                          (beat)
                   That's the kind of world we used
                   to have. A world a lot of us took
                   for granted. And now we've got
                   this one. And it makes me
                   wonder -- what kind of world do I
                   want my child to live in? I want
                   my child to live in a world where
                   hopes and dreams aren't just lies
                   you tell yourself to get through
                   another day. I want my child, and
                   I want my friends -- I want all of
                   us to live in a world where you
                   still get your mail.

      It's a   moment before anyone speaks.

      The Postman takes the cap off the little boy's head,
      touches the emblem, and answers.

                                 THE POSTMAN
                   Yes.

                                 B.C. MAYOR
                   I've heard of you, man. You're
                   famous.

                                 THE POSTMAN
                   Yeah, I guess I am. And all of a
                   sudden, I'm not wearing the right
                   clothes.

      And as he puts on his cap, he accepts the mantle as well.


153   EXT. BRIDGE - CLOSE ON PINE BOX - MORNING                       153

      lowered from the top of the bridge. Hands reach up to
      steady it and bring it gently to the ground. It's one of
      many.

      The Postman and Abby gasp as the Mayor opens the lid to
      reveal: 20 well-oiled rifles and 15 pistols with ammo.
      The Postman blinks over at the Mayor.

                                 B.C. MAYOR
                   Fact that we don't allow 'em
                   doesn't mean we don't have 'em.
                   We're not stupid, after all.

                                 THE POSTMAN
                   I'm sorry I've brought this on
                   you.

                                 B.C. MAYOR
                   No need to be sorry. Long as we
                   get our mail on time.

                                 PONYTAIL (O.S.)
                   Ready for duty, sir.

      The Postman looks over to see Ponytail, Drew and Chubby
      ride up. Like him, they are back in uniform.

                                 THE POSTMAN
                   The order was to burn all
                   uniforms.

      The carriers look away -- sheepish.

                                 THE POSTMAN
                   You know what to do then?

                                 PONYTAIL
                   Talk to the people. Gather who's
                   willing. Tell them it's
                   important. Tell them we can make
                   a difference.

                                 CHUBBY SENTRY
                   And tell 'em we're going to kick
                   ass.

                                 THE POSTMAN
                   Yeah, tell them that, too.


154   EXT. NEAR BRIDGE - DAY                                             154

      At the edge of the Gorge. The three carriers, and the
      mounted locals thunder off the bridge and down the road.
      High above...


155   EXT. HIGH TENSION TOWER - POSTMAN AND ABBY                         155

      The Mayor is in the b.g. helping one of the sentries
      prepare the basket for travel.

                                 ABBY
                   This is hard for me.
                          (beat)
                   Michael was the best man I ever
                   knew. I never thought there'd be
                   another man I could love the way I
                   loved him.
                          (searching for
                           the words)
                   I don't know why I've been so
                   blessed. And I've tried to find a
                   way to be thankful, but I swear,
                   if I lose you...

      Her eyes start to tear and he takes her in his arms.

                                 THE POSTMAN
                   Abby, do you think a lie can
                   become the truth?

                                 ABBY
                   I don't know, but I believe in
                   you. You have a gift, Postman.     I
                   saw it back in Pine View.

                                 ABBY (CONT'D)
                   You made Mrs. March feel like she
                   could see again. You made Ford
                   feel like he was part of the
                   world. You give out hope like it
                   was candy in your pocket.

      He starts to speak.    She stops him, taking his hand.

                                 ABBY
                   When you come back, we'll be
                   waiting here for you. So you can
                   take us to St. Rose.

      The Postman lets go of her hand and starts for the basket.

      The Mayor gestures to the line of towers extending into
      the distance.

                                 B.C. MAYOR
                   There's three good-sized towns up
                   that way. Enough folks to be a
                   big help to you. If you can
                   convince them to come.

      As The Postman steps into the basket, he makes the mistake
      of looking over the edge. It's a long, long way down.

                                 B.C. MAYOR
                   A lot higher than it looks, huh?

      The Postman looks at the contraption with more than a
      little trepidation. The Mayor grins.

                                  B.C. MAYOR
                   Don't tell anybody, but I like to
                   ride the damn thing just for the
                   hell of it. Being a city official
                   has its perks.

      He winks and as he reaches for the release pin.     The
      Postman's hand meets his there.

                                 B.C. MAYOR
                   Trust me, man. This'll get you
                   there a lot faster.

                                 THE POSTMAN
                   How do I stop --

      But it's too late.    The Mayor releases the pin.

                                                       (CONTINUED)

                   and Godspeed.


      COUNTERWEIGHT

      Plummeting into the Columbia River Gorge.      The Mayor lets
      out a rebel yell.


      BASKET

      The Postman is whipped along, past the riders below.     The
      speed exhilarating.


156   EXT. PINE VIEW, OREGON - DAY                                     156

      The town's gone, but the palisade remains. Chubby rides
      along it, exhorting the people who watch from above. But
      it's The Postman we hear, all the magic back in his voice.

                                 THE POSTMAN (V.O.)
                   Once more into the breach, dear
                   friends, once more. Or close the
                   wall with our dead. In peace
                   nothing so becomes a man as
                   modesty and humility. But when
                   the blast of war blows in our
                   ears, then imitate the action of
                   the tiger.


157   EXT. ELVIS, OREGON - NIGHT                                       157

      A few makeshift structures are back up. Carrying a torch,
      Ponytail gallops hard into town. People wake, including
      Mrs. March's daughter. As Ponytail speaks to them...

                                 THE POSTMAN (V.O.)
                   Summon up the blood. Disguise
                   fair nature with rage and lend the
                   eye a terrible aspect.


158   EXT. FIELD - DAY                                                 158

      Captured by a Holnist cavalry patrol, Old George and four
      other carriers are lined up, hands bound before them.
      Holnist soldiers force them to their knees as Gibbs
      organizes an impromptu firing squad.

                                                        (CONTINUED)

      Old George looks down the line.    The carriers are about to
      break down.

                                 OLD GEORGE
                   Steady, boys, steady.

      And as Gibbs steps up, all hope is gone.

                                 GIBBS
                   In accordance with Law Eight...

                                 OLD GEORGE
                   Get on with it, you floppy-eared
                   sonuvabitch!

      We see the faces of the young carriers. Defeated, bitter.
      But there's a sudden spark in Old George's eyes. He
      starts to rise.

      The soldiers pick up their guns and that's when they see
      The Postman.


      THE POSTMAN

      Riding over the crest. Galloping toward them. Behind
      him, forty new mail carriers. All riding like mad. One
      of them carries the flag of the restored United States.

      Gibbs and his men run for their horses. SHOTS are FIRED.
      Four Holnists go down. The rest gallop away.

      The Postman and his carriers meet.


159   EXT. CROSSROADS - DAY                                            159

      Converging. The Postman with his forty-five coming from
      the west. Drew, Chubby, and a ragtag thirty coming from
      the north. And from the south, Ponytail leading a
      contingent of fifty!

      The forces converge and continue east.


160   EXT. HOLNIST CAMP - DAY                                          160

      The army has gathered.    Three hundred strong.

      Bethlehem and Getty stand outside the command tent,
      listening to a winded, frightened Gibbs. We FOLLOW
      Bethlehem's eyes OVER Gibbs' SHOULDERS TO the horizon,
      where he sees: The Postman and his army of two hundred
      carriers cresting a distant rise.

                   ... We were outnumbered, sir.

                                 BETHLEHEM
                   How many?

                                 GIBBS
                   A least a hundred. With guns.

                                 BETHLEHEM
                          (feigning shock)
                   With guns? Are you sure?

                                 GIBBS

                   Looks more like two hundred to
                   me...

      He steps away to get a better vantage point of the
      approaching army. He reaches out -- Getty hands him a
      pair of binoculars.

                                 BETHLEHEM

                   Only thing worse than a coward is
                   one who can't count. Lieutenant,
                   do yourself a favor. Die well in
                   this battle. In my army a
                   deserter's life is a brief and
                   unpleasant one.

      Bethlehem watches The Postman through the binoculars -- a
      hint of a smile on his face.

                                 BETHLEHEM
                          (to himself)
                   At last, someone with courage
                   enough to bring the fight to me.

      A Holnist soldier stands by with Bethlehem's horse.   The
      General mounts -- the model of military calm and
      precision. Getty reins up beside him.

                                 BETHLEHEM
                   Reckoning, gentlemen. This is the
                   day I've dreamed of.


161   EXT. BATTLEFIELD - DAY                                         161

      A sea of wildflowers separates the carriers from the
      Holnists. The monster John Deere gun is ready for battle.

                                                              130.

162   EXT. HOLNIST LINE - DAY                                        162

      Bethlehem stands with Getty, scanning the postal line with
      his binoculars. The carriers look, just spoiling for a
      fight. Bethlehem lowers his binoculars, smiles grimly.

                              BETHLEHEM
                They're an eager-looking bunch.
                Morale's a dangerous thing.
                       (to Getty)
                Bring him up. I want this postman
                to see how the game is played.


163   EXT. CARRIERS' LINE - DAY                                      163

      The Postman, Chubby, Ponytail and Old George and all the
      carriers have taken positions.

      The Postman sights through a telescope.

      He scans further down the line -- then stops when he sees
      Ford. Bloody, beaten within inches of his life. He's
      shackled -- surrounded by Holnist guards.

      The Postman's eyes turn to stone.

                              THE POSTMAN
                       (to carriers)
                Stay here. No one moves until I
                give the orders.

      He clicks his horse forward, toward the Holnist line.


164   EXT. HOLNIST LINE - DAY                                        164

      Bethlehem, flanked by Getty and the Holnist Sergeant,
      watches as The Postman makes his approach. He reaches
      into his pocket, withdraws a white kerchief and holds it
      in the air.

                              SERGEANT
                Are they surrendering?

                              BETHLEHEM
                God, I hope not.

      He watches for a moment as The Postman crosses the field -
      - moving well within range of Holnist fire. Then, he
      coaxes his horse forward.

                                                              131.

165   EXT. MEADOW - DAY                                              165

      Bethlehem and The Postman riding toward each other. They
      meet when The Postman is almost three-quarters of the way
      over to the Holnists' side.


      BETHLEHEM AND POSTMAN

      As they come face-to-face.

                              BETHLEHEM
                My little shipping clerk.

                              THE POSTMAN
                We're both a couple of frauds.
                You know it; I know it.

      Bethlehem sneers.

                              BETHLEHEM
                Great men are made by other great
                men. Patton had Rommel. Grant
                had Lee. But I get you.

                              THE   POSTMAN
                You're no fucking   general. You're
                a copying machine   salesman.
                You're not even a   good painter.

                              BETHLEHEM
                Are you trying to goad me into a
                fight?

                              THE POSTMAN
                Wouldn't it be great if wars could
                be fought just by the assholes who
                started them? We could settle
                this thing right here. You and
                me.

                              BETHLEHEM
                Unfortunately, it doesn't work
                that way.

                              THE POSTMAN
                It does in your army.

      The Postman kicks his horse up into a gallop, and rides up
      the Holnist line. No one, least of all Bethlehem, is sure
      what's going on.

                              THE POSTMAN
                I invoke law seven of the Laws of
                Eight! Any man may challenge for
                leadership of the clan!

                                                      (CONTINUED)

                                                               132.

165   CONTINUED:                                                      165

                                 BETHLEHEM
                   What?

      The Postman wheels his horse around.

                                 THE POSTMAN
                   I challenge you.

      Bethlehem is caught completely by surprise, but recovers.

                                 BETHLEHEM
                   You're not a Holnist. You're not
                   a member of the clan. You don't
                   have the right.

      The Postman rolls up his sleeve. He rides the Holnist
      lines displaying his brand for all to see. The Holnists
      murmur amongst themselves.

                                 THE POSTMAN
                   I have every right. I invoke law
                   seven!

      Bethlehem can't believe his eyes.

                                 THE POSTMAN
                   I challenge for leadership of the
                   clan!

      The seed of doubt is planted. Is Bethlehem violating one
      of the Laws of Eight? The men look at one another. Gibbs
      looks to Getty. Bethlehem looks from The Postman's tattoo
      to his face.

                                 BETHLEHEM
                   Where do I know you from?

                                THE POSTMAN
                   'Cry Havoc! And let slip the dogs
                   of war.' Remember that?

                                  BETHLEHEM
                   Shakespeare. The one who didn't
                   want to fight.

                                 THE POSTMAN
                   I should've found a way to kill
                   you then. But you seemed so
                   strong.

                                 BETHLEHEM
                   Law seven it is.
                          (to all)
                   This war is settled here!

                                                       (CONTINUED)

                                                                 133.

      As The Postman nods in agreement.

      They take their positions -- and without a word -- they
      kick their horses into a charge. Coming straight for each
      other like medieval jousters.

      Bethlehem reaches for his sword.    But before it clears the
      scabbard, The Postman lunges.

      The horses collide.    Bethlehem and The Postman hit the
      ground hard.

      Holnists and Carriers alike begin to move forward for a
      better look.

      The fight is fierce. Bloody. The Postman and Bethlehem
      are at each other like coiled snakes.

      It's more of a fight than any of the Holnists --
      especially Getty -- expected. The spectators pull in
      tighter.

      Both combatants have taken a beating -- and still, they
      fight on -- trading bloody, raw-knuckled punches.

      One of Bethlehem's connects. The Postman loses his
      footing, hits the ground -- knocking his head on a rock
      with a resounding CRACK. Dazed, he's slow to rise.

      It's just the moment Bethlehem needs, he straddles the
      fallen Postman, reaches for his knife with one hand --
      grabs The Postman's throat with the other.

                                 BETHLEHEM
                   I study people. I know your
                   problem. Do you know why you
                   can't fight?

      The Postman can't answer.

                                 BETHLEHEM
                   You have nothing to fight for.
                   You don't care about anything.
                   You don't value anything. You
                   don't believe in anything. That's
                   what makes me better.

      The Postman grabs Bethlehem's knife-hand -- using all his
      remaining strength to keep him at bay.

                                 THE POSTMAN
                          (barely audible)
                   I believe in the United States
                   Postal Service.

                                                       (CONTINUED)

                                                                 134.

165   CONTINUED:    (3)                                                 165

      The Postman lets go of Bethlehem's hands, grabs his belt
      and pulls him over. As they roll to their feet, The
      Postman club-fists Bethlehem on the side of the head.

                                  THE POSTMAN
                   Neither snow...
                          (wham!)
                   Nor rain...
                          (wham!)
                   Nor heat...
                          (wham!)
                   Nor gloom of night...
                          (wham!)
                   Will stay this courier from the
                   swift completion of his appointed
                   rounds...

      Bethlehem reels, stumbling back. The Postman pounces on
      top of him, begins to strangle him. Bethlehem tries to
      pry the fingers from his throat, but can't. He's going to
      die.

      The Postman is urged on. By both sides. Holnists.
      Carriers. Ford. Even Holnist Luke. He looks up at the
      faces -- and finally lets Bethlehem go. The General gasps
      for breath.

      As Ponytail and Chubby move forward to untie Ford, The
      Postman looks to both sides.

                                 THE POSTMAN
                   It doesn't have to be this way.
                   We don't have to kill each other.
                   We can live together. We can --

      Ford takes Chubby's pistol, sets it against the side of
      Bethlehem's head.

                                  FORD
                   Law three.   Mercy is for the weak.

                                    THE POSTMAN
                   Ford, don't...

      Bethlehem shakes his head -- doesn't want him to, either.

                                 FORD
                   Law eight. There is only one
                   penalty and that penalty is death.

      Ford's going to shoot.

                                 THE POSTMAN
                   He isn't worth it. I'm the head
                   of the clan now! There are going
                   to be new laws!
                          (to all)
                   Law one! No more killing!
                   There's going to be peace!

      The Postman looks at carriers and Holnists alike.

                                  THE POSTMAN
                   Who else?   Who else has a law?

                                 WOMAN
                   Everyone has to learn how to read.

                                 THE POSTMAN
                   That's law two. Who else?!

                                   CARRIER #1
                   Three.    Liberty and justice for
                   all!

                                   LUKE
                   Four.    No more tattoos.

                                  CARRIER #2
                   Law five.   Give peace a chance!

                                HOLNIST SOLDIER #2
                   Law six. Mercy is, it's okay
                   sometimes!

                                   CARRIER #3
                   Seven!    Bring back vacations!

      The Postman nods solemnly, looks to Ford.

                                 THE POSTMAN
                   How about it, Ford Lincoln
                   Mercury? You give us law eight.

      Ford grits his teeth.

                                 THE POSTMAN
                          (close -- for Ford)
                   Be a leader, Ford.

                                   FORD
                   Law eight...

      Ford FIRES! Bethlehem flinches, then sags as he realizes
      Ford has fired into the ground.

                                 FORD
                   ... Live and let live.

      The Postman smiles in relief as Ford lowers the revolver
      and starts to hand the weapon over.

      Forgotten for an instant, Bethlehem makes a last, wild
      lunge, grabs Ford's gun.

      As Bethlehem aims at The Postman, a SHOT rings out. Hit
      in the chest, Bethlehem blinks in amazement before he
      falls to the ground, dying. Getty has shot him.

                                 BETHLEHEM
                   Would I had bestowed that time in
                   the tongues that I have in
                   fencing, dancing and bear-baiting.
                   Oh, had I but followed the arts...

      He dies.

                                 THE POSTMAN
                   Grow like savages -- as soldiers
                   will -- that nothing do but
                   mediate on blood.

      Getty throws his rifle on the ground. Other weapons are
      laid down. The war, at long last, is over.

                                 THE POSTMAN
                   Somebody take a letter.

                                 CHUBBY
                   Huh?

                                 THE POSTMAN
                   A letter...

                                                        DISSOLVE TO:


166   INT. ABBY'S PLACE (BRIDGE CITY) - DAY                            166

      Abby, in bed, holding her new baby in her arms. She's
      reading a letter. What she reads makes her smile. She
      puts the letter down and cuddles her baby.

                                 ABBY
                   Your daddy wrote to tell you that
                   he'll be here as soon as he can.
                   And that he loves you very much.

      Abby looks up to see The Postman standing at her door.
      She looks at him, smiling with tears in her eyes.

                                                        (CONTINUED)

                   Mail's slow.   I'll have to see
                   about that.

      Abby smiles down at the child in her arms.

                                    ABBY
                   Your daughter.     Her name is Hope.

      The Postman takes the tiny child in his arms.

                                 WOMAN (V.O.)
                   And so my father returned home
                   after the Holnists were
                   defeated...


167   EXT. ST. ROSE - DAY                                                167

      A beach town. No wall, no sentries, just cottages lining
      a dozen sand-swept streets. A crowd has gathered to hear
      The Postman's daughter, HOPE, mid-thirties, speak. Beside
      her, a bearded, 52-year-old Ford in his postmaster's
      uniform. They stand before a large, tarp-draped statue.

                                 HOPE
                   But he never did see St. Rose.
                   There was too much to be done.
                   He'd made a promise and in keeping
                   it -- he traded one dream for
                   another. With no regrets. And
                   so, in honor of my father...

      She unveils the statue: we've seen this before. It's The
      Postman on his horse, low-slung in the saddle, leaning
      down to pluck the letter from the Little Boy's hand.

      There's an OLDER MAN in the audience who seems especially
      moved by the statue. There's a younger man beside him.

                                    OLDER MAN

         FADE IN


   1     EXT. OUTER SPACE                                       1

         The infinite blackness punctuated by a billion stars.
         As we slowly DESCEND through the varied shades of blue
         of the Earth's atmosphere, we HEAR the first strains of
         a haunting, Central American FLUTE, joined by a swelling
         background of JUNGLE SOUNDS.  We descend further,
         through a lush JUNGLE CANOPY, backlit by a setting sun.

                                                      DISSOLVE TO:



   2     EXT. JUNGLE COASTLINE - DAY (MAGIC HOUR)               2

         Through a collage of shimmering HEAT-WAVES, a dark,
         OTHER-WORLDLY OBJECT drops INTO VIEW, backlit by the
         fiery, ORANGE-RED sphere of a setting tropical SUN,
         heading slowly towards us, floating, as if suspended by
         the rising heat of the jungle.

         Continuing to approach, the shimmering object resolves
         into a MILITARY ASSAULT HELICOPTER, its rotors strobing
         in the fading sunlight.  Drawing closer, the SOUND of
         powerful TURBINES, throbbing in the heavy air, becomes
         dominant, overpowering.

         Guided by COLORED SMOKE and LANDING LIGHTS, the chopper
         looms hard INTO VIEW, pitching forward and settling to
         the ground, kicking up a maelstrom of dust and vegetation



   2-A   INT. COMMAND POST - DAY (MAGIC HOUR)                   2-A  *

         Where a MAN wearing a military UNIFORM watches through
         the large open windows the helicopter as it continues
         to approach.  Before the skids have even touched down he
         SEES the first of the MEN, dressed in CIVILIAN CLOTHES
         but carrying full COMBAT GEAR, alight gracefully from
         the chopper, double-timing in close order to one side,
         the orders SHOUTED by one man lost in the ROAR of the
         chopper.

         The man turns away from the window, to a FIGURE, hidden     *
         in the shadows.

                                 MAN                                 *   
                  He's here.

         He turns back, lowering a BAMBOO SHADE, obscuring the       *   
         window.
   
------------------------------------------------------------------------
                                                                2



   2-B   EXT. HELICOPTER PAD - NIGHT                            2-B  *

         On adjoining PADS, two other HELICOPTERS are VISIBLE; in
         the b.g. can be SEEN several concrete and THATCHWORK
         BUILDINGS, a secret command post disguised as a COASTAL
         FISHING VILLAGE.

         The post in a flurry of activity, AMERICAN ADVISORS
         shouting directions to dozens of LATIN AMERICAN SOLDIERS
         who stand by to assist the landing helicopter and to
         load EQUIPMENT into the other choppers.

         Inside the chopper, one man remains, stretched out against  *
         the bulkhead, as if asleep.  He stirs, sits up, lighting    *
         up a CIGAR.  With fatigue showing in his motion, he leans   *
         forward, descending to the ground.                          *

         A JEEP pulls to stop, the man swinging casually into the    *
         front seat, tossing his GEAR into the rear.  With a         *
         lurch the jeep heads out towards the command post.          *

         In the doorway TWO MEN solemnly watch as the jeep
         approaches.  Reaching the command post the man alights
         from the jeep, heading towards the two men.

         Into the pool of light cast by the fixture above the
         door steps MAJOR ALAN SCHAEFER, the team leader, 38, an
         intelligent and intense man.  He informally salutes,
         GENERAL H.L. PHILIPS, 55, hardened, close-cropped graying
         hair, his nameplate and insignia identifying him as a
         member of an elite commando unit in the U.S. Army.  He
         clasps Schaefer warmly on the shoulder.

                                 PHILIPS
                         (with affection)
                  You're looking well, Dutch.

                                 SCHAEFER
                  It's been a long time, General.

         They walk up the stairs, entering the palapa, leaving
         the other man on guard.



   3     INT. PALAPA - DAY                                      3

         Large, two room concrete floor, thatched walls and roof.
         Behind a partially drawn curtain in the kitchen, a naked
         lightbulb hung from the rafters illuminates a bank of
         compact FIELD RADIO EQUIPMENT, MAPS and AERIAL
         PHOTOGRAPHS.  Otherwise the rooms are primitive and
         stand out in stark contrast to this high-tech invasion.

         Philips and Schaefer enter the room.

                                                      (CONTINUED)

   3     CONTINUED                                              3

                                 PHILIPS
                         (growing serious)
                  We've got a real problem here,
                  something right up your alley.

         They cross to the center of the room to a folding table,
         covered with a large TOPOGRAPHICAL MAP of the Central
         American highland jungle.  Philips leans over the table,
         circling a set of COORDINATES and a MARK on the open
         map.

                                 PHILIPS
                  Eighteen hours ago I was
                  informed that one of our
                  choppers, transporting three
                  presidential cabinet members
                  from this charming little
                  country, was shot down...
                         (point to
                         the circled
                         area)
                  ...The pilots radioed from the
                  ground that they were all
                  alive.  Their position was
                  fixed by the transponder
                  beacon onboard the chopper.
                         (points)
                  Here.

         Schaefer studies the map.  He looks up at Philips.

                                 SCHAEFER
                  That's over the border,
                  General.

                                 PHILIPS
                         (dead serious)
                  That's the problem.  Apparently
                  they strayed off course.
                         (pause)
                  We're certain they've been
                  captured by the guerrillas.

         Schaefer looks up, puffing lightly on the cigar.

                                 SCHAEFER
                         (quietly)
                  What have you got in mind,
                  General.

                                 PHILIPS
                  We figure we've got less than
                  twenty-four hours to catch
                  up with them.  After that,
                  there's not much hope.  We
                  want a rescue operation
                  mounted tonight.  That doesn't
                  give you much time.

         Another puff on the cigar.

                                 SCHAEFER   
                  What else it new?  When do
                  we leave?

         Philips looks at his watch.

                                 PHILIPS
                  You lift off in three hours.
                         (pause)
                  There's one other thing.

                                 SCHAEFER
                  What's that, General?

                                 PHILIPS
                  Someone else will be going
                  in with you.

         Schaefer stubbs out his cigar in an ashtray.

                                 SCHAEFER
                  You know we don't work with
                  outsiders, General.

                                 VOICE
                         (o.s.)
                  Who said anything about
                  outsiders, Dutch?

         Schaefer turns, SEEING the outline of a figure standing
         in the doorway of the communications room, holding a
         sheaf of PAPERS.

         Wearing pressed fatigues, DILLON, mid-thirties, black,
         walks into the room.

         Although as rugged looking as the others, his bearing
         and grooming indicate he's been away from the business
         of soldiering for sometime.  His quick intelligent eyes
         reveal his current profession.

                                 DILLON
                  Last time we danced, it was
                  Lieutenant, Schaefer.

         A grin breaks out across Schaefer's face.

                                 SCHAEFER
                  Dillon, you son of a bitch.

         The two men step forward and simultaneous swing from
         the hip as it to land a punch...but their hands SLAP
         together in a gesture of friendship, their forearms
         bulging, testing each other's strength.

                                 DILLON
                         (warmly)
                  How you been, Dutch?

         They continue the contest, Schaefer has the edge, forcing
         Dillon's arm slowly downward.

                                 SCHAEFER
                  You've been pushing too many
                  Pencils, Dillon.  Had enough?

                                 DILLON
                         (grinning)
                  No way, old buddy.

                                 SCHAEFER
                  You never did know when to
                  quit.

         They look into each other's faces, each remembering
         something from the past.  A moment's hesitation and they
         quit the contest.  They laugh, Dillon slapping Schaefer
         on the shoulder.

                                 DILLON
                  That piece of work you guys
                  pulled off at the Berlin
                  embassy last week was really
                  something.  Blew the entry
                  points on three floors and
                  neutralized the opposition
                  in eight seconds flat.
                  Beautiful.

                                 SCHAEFER
                  Like the old days, Dillon.

                  Also heard that you passed
                  on that little job in Libya.

         Schaefer looks at Dillon, quietly considering him.

                                 SCHAEFER
                  Wasn't my style.  We're a
                  rescue unit, not assassins.
                         (smiles)
                  This must be good.  Big shot
                  from the CIA, leaves his desk
                  to come back to the bush.
                  What's so important?

                                 DILLON                                     
                  Those cabinet members are
                  very important to our scope
                  of operations in this part
                  of the world.  They're about
                  to get squeezed.  We can't
                  let that happen.  I needed
                  someone who could get the job
                  done, quick and quiet...no
                  screw-ups.  I needed the best.
                  The best.  So, I pulled a few
                  strings at the State
                  Department...and here we are.

                                 SCHAEFER
                  Go on.

         Dillon goes to the map.

                                 DILLON
                  The set-up is simple, Dutch.
                  One day job.  We pick up their
                  trail at the chopper, run 'em
                  down, grab the hostages and
                  bounce back across the
                  border before anyone knows
                  we were there.  You've done
                  it a hundred times.  Nothing
                  out of the ordinary.

         Schaefer considers this.

         Philips breaks in.

                                 PHILIPS   
                  I'm afraid those are your
                  orders, Major.  Once you
                  reach your objective, Dillon
                  will evaluate the situation
                  and take charge.

         Schaefer looks from Philips to Dillon.  He still doesn't
         like it.

                                 DILLON
                  Not to worry, Dutch.  I
                  haven't lost my edge.  They've

                  ready.
                         (pause)
                  Good luck, Major.



   4     EXT. TWO ASSAULT HELICOPTERS - NIGHT                   4

         Burst over the top of a ridge.  Rising up in silhouette
         they perform a radical left bank turn and descend
         rapidly into an adjoining valley, racing over the
         jungle at treetop level.

         As the helicopters perform dizzying, high-speed
         maneuvers through the winding canyon, the PILOT'S
         VOICES can be HEARD, coordinating their operations.

                                 PILOT ONE

                  five, zero, on your move.
                  Over.

         The helicopters rise in perfect coordination over
         another ridge and bank sharply into the next valley,
         leveling out as they go.



   5     INT. HELICOPTER - NIGHT                                5

         Illuminated by the eerie red glow of NIGHT LIGHTS, are
         SEVEN MEN, dressed in jungle camouflage, soft hats and
         camouflage face-makeup.  They wear no identity badges
         or insignias.  The man are checking their WEAPONS,
         making last minute adjustments to their GEAR.

         The compartment reverberates with the NOISE of the
         THUMPING ROTORS and the ROAR of air from the open
         doors.

         BLAIN, weapons and ordinance specialist, a frightening
         bull of a man, a 240 pound killer, removes from his
         shirtpocket a think PLUG OF TOBACCO.  He looks across
         at:

         MAC, a huge bear of a man, black, holding am M-60
         MACHINE GUN.  Blain holds out the tobacco to Mac who
         refuses with a gentle shake of the head, a knowing
         smile, he knows what's coming.

         Holding the plug between his teeth Blain yanks free
         from his shoulder scabbard a wicked, ten inch COMBAT
         KNIFE.  Placing the razor sharp blade next to his lips
         he slices through the plug as if it were butter.  He
         chews throughtfully.

         Seated by the open doorway is RAMIREZ, a slight,
         angular man, an East L.A. streetwise Chicano.

         Adding a final piece of camouflage TAPE to his pack
         HARNESS, he looks up and smiles, faking a throw and
         the bulleting the tape to:

         HAWKINS, the radioman and medic, Irish, street-tough,
         reading a rolled-up magazine, as if he were a rush hour
         commuter.  He snags the tape with an instinctual snap

         of the wrist, continuing to read for a moment before
         looking up, grinning at Ramirez, his boyish, eager
         face belying the rugged professional beneath.  He
         turns his gaze to the man next to him:

         BILLY, the Kit Carson Scout, an American Indian, proud,
         stoic, a man of quiet strength and simplicity,
         carefully replacing the FIRING MECHANISM of his M-203,
         working its action several times.  He looks up with a
         smile at Hawkins.

                                 HAWKINS
                         (shouting)
                  Hey, Billy, how many marines
                  does it take to eat a squirrel?

         Billy looks back, shaking his head, uncomprehending.

                                 HAWKINS
                  Two.  One to eat it and one
                  to watch for cars.

         Hawkins laughs heartily at his joke.



   6     EXT. JUNGLE - NIGHT                                    6

         Clearing another ridge, the helicopters plunge into a
         steep descent, turning quickly into a DEEP-WALLED
         CANYON, the force of the turn accentuated by the
         changing PITCH of the screaming turbines and the
         biting of rotors into the air.



   7     INT. HELICOPTER - NIGHT                                7

         The men, suspended in RESTRAINING HARNESSES from the
         bulkheads, lean forward, nearly upside down in response
         to the radical maneuver, handling the situation with
         ease.

         Blain holds out the tobacco to Ramirez, who swats at
         the offending object as if it were alive.

                                 RAMIREZ
                         (shouting)

         Grinning, Blain proffers the plug to each man, each one
         refusing; they've done it a thousand times.  It's an old
         gag but they obviously care for the man in a big way.

                                 BLAIN
                  ...bunch of slack-jawed

                  sexual ty-ran-toe-sore-ass...
                  just like me.

         This brings a chorus of HOOTS and SHOUTS from the others.
         The helicopter makes another radical turn.

         Schaefer and Dillon, seated near the cockpit, communicate
         through HEADSETS, also linked to the pilot.  They
         consult a TOPOGRAPHICAL MAP by RED PENLIGHTS.

   8     INT. COCKPIT - NIGHT                                   8

         The PILOT and CO-PILOT are surrounded by an array of
         dimly lit GAUGES and SWITCHES.  Before the Co-Pilot is
         a RADAR SCREEN and an INFRA-RED DISPLAY TERMINAL on
         which the TWO HELICOPTERS appear as HEAT SOURCES.

         A BLUE LIGHT appears on the forward bulkhead.  Schaefer
         is speaking over a RADIO TELEPHONE.  The Co-Pilot turns
         and hands him a clipboard.  Schaefer reads, notes his
         approval and hands it back.

         Flares up into position over the jungle and hovers, as
         the SUPPORT HELICOPTER holds in a protective position
         above.



  11     INT. HELICOPTER - NIGHT                               11

         Dillon seems comfortable with the men, showing Ramirez
         a battered CIGARETTE LIGHTER from a famed commando
         unit from the past.

         But his ingratiating demeanor is not impressing Mac, who
         regards Dillon with the cold suspicion reserved for an
         outsider.  Mac looks up at Blain, his eyes narrowing.

         Blain's massive jaws roll as he masticates the chew.
         He pauses, eyes moving downward, spotting his target.

         He hocks a thick, vile stream of TOBACCO JUICE directly
         between Dillon's legs and onto the floor, a gelatinous
         skein lacing across the toe of one boot.  Dillon looks
         up, his face goes cold and menacing.

                                 DILLON
                         (icy)
                  Man, that's a real bad habit
                  you've got.

         Dillon turns back to Ramirez, ignoring Mac and Blain,
         who continues to stare at him.  Mac looks across at
         Blain, wide grins breaking across their huge faces.
         Cradled in Blain's arms, as if it were a part of his
         body, is a large, CANVAS-COVERED BUNDLE.  Blain looks
         down at his bundle, almost affectionately.

         The PILOT's VOICE breaks in over Schaefer's headset.

                                 PILOT NUMBER ONE

                  Stand by the rappel lines.

         Looking up, Schaefer gives a hand signal to the nearest
         man who nods and in return,passes the signal down the
         line.

         Ramirez and Blain pick up heavy, METAL CONICAL DEVICES,
         attached to canvas bags filled with rope.



  12     EXT. HELICOPTER - NIGHT                               12

         From the open doors the RAPPELLING LINES hurtle into
         space, CRASHING through the double canopy of the trees
         and to the jungle floor below.

         The blue light changes to GREEN.  Schaefer nods.
         RAPPELLING DEVICES SNAP into place.  Gloved hands grab
         onto rope.  Combat boots move into position.

         The man crash through the trees and are swallowed up by
         the darkness below.  The helicopters depart, THUMPING
         their way into the night.

  15     EXT. MOUNTAIN RIDGE - DAY (DAWN)                      15

         A light shower passes through the trees.  The sky
         clears, REVEALING a lush and exotic foliage.  Birds
         are beginning to SING but otherwise, all is SILENT.

         The dense growth seems impenetrable, but from a solid
         wall of undergrowth, a HAND appears and signals in a
         downward motion.

         As if by magic, the assault team materializes, quietly,
         cautiously.  Schaefer makes another gesture and the team
         moves forward in perfect harmony in POINT-LOCK step,
         taking their cue from Ramirez, the pointman.  Schaefer,
         highly focused and alert to every sound and movement,
         follows Ramirez, as if organically connected.



  16     EXT. JUNGLE HILLSIDE - DAY                            16

         Descending the steep mountain slope, the team encounters
         an even denser growth of jungle, at times moving by
         instinct, as they are often visually separated.  At one
         point, Schaefer checks his COMPASS, flashing some hand
         signals to Ramirez, indicating a new direction.  Ramirez
         nods and moves on, Schaefer signaling to the rest of the
         men.



  17     EXT. JUNGLE CLEARING - DAY                            17

         Blain, in a defensive position, sweeps the jungle slowly
         with his MP-5.  He steps back and turns, checking,
         revealing in the b.g. the WRECKAGE OF A U.S. ARMY UH-1H
         HELICOPTER, hanging upside down, twenty feet above the
         ground, entangled in vines in the heavy capony, badly
         damaged, rotors bent, its tail section blown away.

         A GRAPPLING HOOK is hurled from the ground, CLATTERING
         into the cargo hold, hooking the edge of the airframe.



  18     INT. HELICOPTER - DAY                                 18

         Ramirez moves cautiously, searching for trip wires,
         using his knife to check the edges of the seats and
         door frames.  Grimly he glances at the TWO BODIES
         slumped over the controls and then exits, snapping
         into and rappelling down the rope to the ground.

         He joins Schaefer standing in the f.g.  They look
         up, watching as Dillon moves through the cockpit,
         searching through pockets and compartments.  Schaefer
         turns his back to the helicopter.

                                 RAMIREZ
                  The pilots have each got one
                  round in the head.  And whoever
                  hit it stripped the shit out of it.

         Schaefer studies the clearing, eyes always moving, wary.
         He turns back, looking at the chopper.

                                 RAMIREZ    
                  There's something else, Major...

                                 SCHAEFER
                  Mmmnnn...?

                                 RAMIREZ
                  I don't think that was any ordinary
                  army taxi...

         Schaefer looks at him quizically.

                                 RAMIREZ
                  ...looks more like a surveillance
                  bird to me.

         Dillon rappells down the line and approaches.

                                 DILLON   
                  Have you picked up their trail yet?

         Schaefer taps Ramirez on the shoulder and he moves
         away.  Schaefer turns to Dillon:

                                 SCHAEFER
                  Billy's on it.
                         (indicates chopper)
                  Heat seeker.  Pretty sophisticated
                  for half-asses mountain boys.

                                 DILLON
                  They're getting better equipped
                  every day.

         Bill approaches from the b.g.

                                 BILLY
                  Major, looks like there were ten,
                  maybe twelve guerrillas.  Looks
                  like they took some prisoners
                  from the chopper.
                         (points)
                  Then a different set of track,
                  over there.

                                 SCHAEFER
                         (puzzled)
                  What do you mean?

                                 BILLY
                  Six others, U.S. issue jungle
                  boots.  They came in from the
                  north, then followed the guerrillas.

         Schaefer turns to Dillon.

                                 SCHAEFER
                  Mean anything to you?

                                 DILLON
                  Probably another rebel patrol.
                  They operate in here all the time.

         Schaefer is obviously concerned about this.  He
         turns to Billy.

                                 SCHAEFER
                  Get ahead, see what you can find.
                         (to Ramirez)  
                  Slow and easy.

                  We don't want any accidents.

         Billy takes up the trail, disappearing in to the jungle.
         Ramirez signals, the team moves out.



  19     EXT. JUNGLE - DAY                                     19

         As Billy reconnoiters, Ramirez looks back and gives a       *
         sign...

         Schaefer nods and rappels down cliff.                       *   

         As he joins Ramirez, there seem to be butterflies           *   
         everywhere --         
         

                                 SCHAEFER                            *

                  Same business, guerrillas
                  hauling two guys from the
                  chopper...followed by men
                  with American equipment...

         Ramirez seems concerned by this.  Schaefer signals him to   *
         move on.  Before he follows, Schaefer looks around:  there's*
         something dodgy about this.  He goes.                       *

         Over his head is a butterfly on a limb:                     *



  20     EXT. JUNGLE - OVERHEAD - DAY                          20

         As the assault team passes below, a BUTTERFLY lands on
         what appears to be the BARK of a TREE.  It fans its wings
         and flies on.

         The impression of the butterfly remains in PERFECT
         RELIEF, as is imprinted on the bark.  The image fades,
         REVEALING for an instant a gridwork of TINY SCALES on
         the bark.

         The bark moves!  Changing colors, like a chameleon,
         REVEALING for an instant the form of something alive
         as it flows into the leaves, once again becoming
         indistinguishable from the surrounding foliage.

         TWO EYES, faintly flowing yellow, appear in the
         foliage.  They blink, disappearing, and then become
         VISIBLE again.

         careful, silent movements at they pass by.

         The SOUNDS of the FOREST are also ALTERED and ENHANCED
         with an electric, STATICLIKE quality.

         The Observer scans over the men...and then focuses
         on Schaefer as he crouches down, signaling forward
         and rear with a circular motion.  He refers to an
         OBJECT in his hand, studying it carefully.

         Using a MAP in lining out a course on his COMPASS.  The
         other team members appear, silently, clustering around
         him.  Using hand signals, Schaefer indicates a course
         change.

  26     EXT. DENSE UNDERGROWTH - DAY                          26

         The hillside of a steep valley, dark and foreboding.
         Billy passes by and halts, removing his KNIFE.  With
         his other hand he pulls down from overhead a THICK VINE,
         severing it.  A thin stream of WATER emerges which
         he drinks.

         Suddenly he stops, letting the water drip to the
         ground.  He quietly releases the vine and brings his
         M-203 shotgun to bear, listening intently.  Something
         seems wrong.  He brings his eyes upward and stares,
         hard into the treeline of the opposing hillside.

         As his eyes strain to penetrate the dense, intertwined
         canopy, he is engulfed by the rising SOUNDS of the
         JUNGLE, a cacophony of BUZZING and CLICKING,
         amplified in the sweltering heat of the day.  Unable
         to locate a source to account for his anxiety, he
         relaxes, moving on, resuming the track.



  27     BILLY (MINUTES LATER)                                 27

         examines the ground as he moves, growing confused
         and puzzled by what he sees before him.  He stops,
         scrutinizing the jungle, probing the world around him
         with his keen senses.

         HEARING a faint RUSTLING SOUND he looks up, SEEING a
         curtain of MOSS several feet away.  He takes a cautious
         step forward, extending his weapon.  He reaches
         forward with his free hand, touching the moss.

         Behind the curtain a slight shifting of DARK FORMS
         occurs.  He pauses and then with a sudden movement,
         sweeps the moss aside...

         A BLACK EXPLOSION of FLUTTERING WINGS as carrion-eating
         BIRDS rush past Billy's body.

  27     CONTINUED:                                            27

         Billy's face seizes into a mask of horror, his
         expression descending into a state of complete,
         primitive shock, his eyes staring transfixed, inches
         away from the leering death-grin of a HUMAN FACE,
         upside down, completely stripped of skin.

         Reeling, his body numbed by the sight before him,
         he stumbles backwards and stops.

         Vines threaded through their achilles tendons, the
         BODIES OF THREE MEN, skinned and gutted, hang
         suspended in the think, suffocating air, BUZZING
         with insects.

         Billy turns away, revulsed as Ramirez moves quietly
         INTO VIEW, Schaefer directly behind him.  Ramirez
         stares at the bodies, now seen to be in the first
         stages of deterioration, strips of flesh torn away
         by the birds and other scavengers.  In an almost
         childlike manner, he crosses himself.

                                 RAMIREZ   
                         (hoarse whisper)  
                  Holy Mother...

         Schaefer moves into the clearing, kneeling beside
         a bloody pile of CLOTHING and ENTRAILS.  He examines
         the clothing and then rises, holding a DOG TAG on
         a broken chain.  He reads the tag, his face growing
         hardened and bitter as he stares down at the tag,
         recognizing the name.

                                 SCHAEFER
                         (to himself)
                  J.S. Davis, Captain, U.S. Army...

         Schaefer's eyes move from the bloody dog tag to
         the bodies.

                                 SCHAEFER   
                         (coldly)  
                  Mac.  Cut them down.

         Mac moves forward, withdrawing his COMBAT KNIFE.
         The blade flashes, cutting the vine as the first
         body THUDS to the ground.  He bends over, picking up
         other DOG TAGS.

         Schaefer turns to Dillon.

                  shouldn't have been here.

                  Well somebody sent them.

         Schaefer walks off.  Mac steps out of the clearing,
         sheathing his knife with a violent gesture, passing
         Ramirez.

                  Must have run into the guerrillas
                  ...Fucking animals.

         Mac moves alongside Blain.

                  Time to let 'ol 'painless'
                  out of the bag.

         Grimly, Blain RIPS apart the velcro closures of the
         CANVAS BUNDLE slung across his shoulder, REVEALING
         a truly awesome weapon, a SIX-BARRELED MINI-GUN adapted
         for field combat.

         Kneels at the side of the original trail examining the
         ground.  He rises, holding a spent CARTRIDGE.  Schaefer
         approaches, kneeling beside him.

                                 SCHAEFER

                                 SCHAEFER
                  I can't believe Jim Hopper
                  walked into an ambush.

                  I don't believe he did, Sir.
                  I couldn't find a single track.
                  Just doesn't make sense.

                  What about the rest of Hopper's

                         (pause)
                  It's like they just disappeared.

         Schaefer ponders a moment.  Then, to Billy:

                                 SCHAEFER
                  Stick with the guerilla trail.

                  Five meter spread.  No sound.
                  Nothing.

  28-A   EXT. BLAIN - DAY                                      28-A

         Blain feeds the magazine of BELTED-SHELLS into the
         weapon, cocking it.  He looks up at Mac, his eyes
         cold, his face taut with anger.

                                 BLAIN
                  Payback time.

         Blain hefts the Mini-gun to his hip as Mac draws back
         slightly on the breech bolt of the M-60, letting it
         snap.

         They move on, Billy pausing to look at the jungle
         before disappearing into the foliage.

  29     EXT. ALTERED P.O.V. - DAY                             29

         carefully watching this exchange from high in the
         treetop canopy.  The Observer watches as Schaefer
         turns and leaves the clearing, cautiously moving
         into the jungle.



  30     EXT. JUNGLE HILLSIDE - DAY                            30

         Mac appears suddenly, materializing out of the
         undergrowth, pausing cautiously, his senses alert,
         intense, almost nervous.  He moves on, his huge body
         barely making a sound as he weaves through the heavy
         undergrowth.

         Dillon appears.  As he moves on, he crosses over a
         fallen TREE.  Stepping down, his foot breaks through
         a rotten portion, a CHUCK of the log breaking free
         and rolling down the hill.

         Dillon at once goes into a defensive position,
         listening.  The jungle is SILENT.  He stands and
         starts to move forward.  Suddenly Mac appears
         within inches of Dillon's face.  Mac's face is
         menacing, angry.

                                 MAC
                         (hissing; barely
                         audible)
                  You're ghostin' on me, mother
                  fokaaa!...I don't care who
                  you are back in the world...
                  You give away our position
                  again and I'll bleed you quiet
                  and leave your fuckin' ass
                  right here.
                         (hisses; spits)
                  Got it?

         Dillon's eyes are wide and fixed, staring back in
         cold hatred at Mac, controlling his rage...he knows
         the rules.

         Not waiting for a response, Mac turns and vanished
         into the jungle.  Seething with anger Dillon
         focuses on a still moving LEAF and STEM, indicating
         Mac's exit point.  He moves on.



  31     EXT. BLAIN - DAY                                      31

         Crouches under heavy foliage, waiting.  He is
         joined by Mac.  They glance briefly at each other,
         scanning in opposite directions for movement and
         sounds.  They speak in whispers.

                                 BLAIN
                  Say, Bull.  What's goin' down?
                  We got movement?

                                 MAC
                  No.  Shithead with his
                  trenchcoat and dee-coda-da
                  ring was makin' enough noise
                  to get us all waxed.  I don't
                  like that guy.  Don't like
                  him at my back.  I ain't
                  winding up like those
                  bastards back there.

         Mac, sweating heavily, wipes the moisture from
         his brow with his finger.

         Blain pats the mini-gun affectionately.

                                 BLAIN
                  I know what you mean, Bull,
                  but don't sweat it, me and
                  'ol 'painless' here are
                  watchin' the front door.

                  As always, bro...

         They do a gentle fist dap and smile warmly at
         each other.  Two men who have seen it all,
         through a dozen no-win situations, and have lived
         to tell about it.

         Mac advances a few meters and signals slowly.



  32     EXT. KNOLL                                            32

         The assault team moving up the hill, barely
         visible in the heavy foliage, the team moves
         cautiously into defensive positions.  Holding.
         A moment later they continue up the hill,
         crawling.

         On their stomachs, Schaefer and Ramirez clear
         the edge of the knoll, SEEING below a GUERRILLA
         VILLAGE, a huge, spreading PALAPA covering
         implacements dug into a hillside, descending
         to a winding stream bed below.  30 MEN, dressed
         in a mixture of jungle fatigues and civilian
         clothes, armed with AK-47 ASSAULT RIFLES move
         about the camp.  A heavy MACHINE GUN emplacement
         guards the entrance to the camp.  TWO MEN sit
         in the camouflaged emplacement.



  33     SCHAEFER                                              33

         sweeping the camp with BINOCULARS, SEES a
         GUARD above the camp.  One of the man picks up
         a hand-held ROCKET LAUNCHER, placing it beside
         a bandolier of ROCKETS and a RADIO SET and
         CONSULS taken from the U.S. surveillance
         helicopter as if preparing to take them away.

         Schaefer puts down the glasses, looking at
         Ramirez who nods in acknowledgment.  A sudden
         MUFFLED CRY brings Schaefer's attention to one
         end of the camp, where a heavily thatched DOOR
         covers and opening to the PALAPA.  A GUARD
         stands at the door.

         The door flies open as a HOSTAGE, shirtless,
         hands tied behind his back, staggers through
         the door as if kicked from behind.

                                                      (CONTINUED)

  33     CONTINUED                                             33

         The man falls to the ground, feebly trying to regain
         his footing.  Although difficult to see from Schaefer's
         vantage point, the man's battered face and welt-covered
         back indicate he has been severely tortured.

         Emerging from the palapa, a GUERRILLA LEADER,
         moustached and wearing a SIDEARM, approaches the
         beaten man, kicking him viciously in the stomach,
         rolling him to his side.

         Kneeling beside the man he withdraws an AUTOMATIC from
         his holster and cocks the hammer.  Grabbing the man by
         the hair he jams the muzzle into the man's ear and with
         a violent twist, pulls the trigger.

         The guerrilla leader stands and strides quickly back
         to the palapa, still holding the pistol, closing the
         door behind him.



   34    SCHAEFER                                              34 

         grim-faced at having witnesses the murder, lowers him
         glasses, a look of cold determination on his face.
         Quickly he and Ramirez ease down the escarpment,
         joining the other team members.

         Schaefer makes a circling motion with his thumb
         and the team members gather in close, huddle formation.

                                 SCHAEFER
                         (whispering; angry)
                  Just killed one of the                             *
                  prisoners.  No time for                            *
                  invitations.  We take them,
                  now.



  35     EXT. BLAIN AND MAC - DAY                              35

         Crawl silently through the underbrush.  With nearly
         impreceptible movements, Blain slips out of the
         cartridge pack, ditching the Mini-gun.  He withdraws
         his COMBAT KNIFE, placing it between his teeth.

         They move through the underbrush in tandem, like
         two bug cats, stalking.  Mac freezes, the sweat
         pouring from his face, holds up his hand as Blain
         stops.

         Using a BLADE OF GRASS, Mac points out a metal TRIP
         WIRE, following it to a hidden CLAYMORE MINE.  Blain
         grins making a switching GESTURE.  Carefully Mac
         detaches the LEAD WIRES.  Directing the mine towards
         the camp, he reattaches the wires, nodding at Blain.



  36     EXT. JUNGLE - OVERHEAD - ALTERED P.O.V. - DAY         36

         SEEN THROUGH HEAT-SEEKING VISION, FOCUSED ON Blain
         and Mac, lying in the grass below, their bodies
         outlined in LUMONOUS AUREOLES.  The Observer SEES the
         NETWORK of TRIP WIRES guarding the approaches to the
         machine gun nests.  The wires GLOW as if ELECTRIFIED,
         standing out in hard-edged relief in contrast to
         the jungle foliage.  He moves higher into the forest
         canopy.



  37     EXT. BILLY - DAY                                      37

         On Schaefer's signal rises up, pulling a SENTRY to
         him, covering his mouth with his hand, jerking him
         backwards and to the side, knocking him off balance
         with a sweeping motion of his left leg, killing him
         with his COMBAT KNIFE.



  38     EXT. SCHAEFER - DAY                                   38    *

         Belly crawls silently through the tall grass just
         outside and above the main entrance to the camp.  He
         stops, studying the ancient, rusted skeleton of a
         TRUCK parked on a level spot above the camp, its
         engine quietly IDLING.  The truck is jacked and
         blocked up, one rear wheel attached to a belt-drive
         leading to a PUMP, drawing water from a river nearby.
         In the open cab of the truck a GUARD is on duty,
         watching the high ground above the camp.

         Schaefer moves out, heading for the guard.



  39     EXT. MACHINE GUN EMPLACEMENT - DAY                    39

         While one Guerrilla attends to his equipment, the
         OTHER attentively watches the approaches to the camp.
         He is momentarily distracted by a BUZZING FLY, which
         he annoyingly swats at with his hand.

         He hears something to his side.  Turning to investigate,
         the huge, hamhock fist of Mack smashes into his throat.

         Simultaneously, Blain rises up behind the other man,
         grabs him by the hair, pulling him down, his COMBAT
         KNIFE driving downward.

  40     EXT. TRUCK - DAY                                      40    *

         A SATCHEL CHARGE is looped over the gearshift lever,
         resting on the floorboard.  Schaefer, lying low
         across the seat of the truck, turns and looks, SEEING
         the guard, lying in a heap in the foliage.



  40-A   EXT. RAMIREZ - DAY                                    40-A  * 
  
         Moves into position to the side and above the camp.
         He carefully checks the readiness of his SIX-SHOT
         GRENADE LAUNCHER, also setting his MP-5 in front of
         him, ready for action.



  41     EXT. SCHAEFER                                         41    *   


         Crouched to the side of the truck, watches the camp,
         SEEING below through the dense undergrowth, Ramirez,
         barely visible, signaling.

         Before him are two FRAGMENTATION GRENADES.  He looks
         at his watch, and then up the hill to:



  41-A   DILLON AND HAWKINS                                    41-A  *

         their weapons ready.  Dillon picks up his binoculars,
         focusing on the machine gun emplacement, seeing a MAN,
         his face covered by a HAT.  The head rises, REVEALING
         the face of Blain, who looks above the camp and
         slightly nods.  Putting his glasses down, motions
         to Hawkins.

                                 DILLON
                         (to Hawkins)
                  Ready, kid?

         Hawkins grins back.  Together they slip through the
         grass, downward towards the edge of the camp.

         Holds his huge, COMMANDO MACHETE on a diagonal,
         pushing through the belt, slicing it cleanly.  Turning
         he crawls silently to the rear of the truck,
         positioning himself behind the rear of the one ton
         truck.

         He squats, and with an enormous, concentrated effort,
         deadlifts the rear of the truck, its rusted springs
         and frame beginning to CREAK and GROAN slightly.

         With a herculean effort he lifts the truck free of
         its blocks and then pushes forward.  He rolls aside,
         disappearing into the ground cover as the truck, its
         tireless rims digging into the earth, lops down the
         hill, slowly picking up speed.



  45     EXT. GUERRILLA VILLAGE - DAY                          45

         A Guerrilla, alerted by the SOUND of the approaching
         truck, looks up at the hillside, SEEING the vehicle
         still moving down the hill at a moderate roll.  He
         CALLS OUT and several Guerrilla leaves their posts,
         moving out to prepare to stop the truck.

         The truck rolls into the clearing picking up speed,
         heading towards the main palapa.  The men rush
         forward, surrounding the truck, trying to slow it
         down, but the truck rolls, SMASHING through the front
         wall of the palapa.  The men gather around truck
         and then look back up the hill.



  46     EXT. ALTERED P.O.V. - DAY                             46    *

         Watching as Schaefer pulls the pin and launches the
         GRENADE into the air, the Observer following its
         arc as it spirals dead-center into the camp, bouncing
         twice before rolling into the FUEL DUMP...which a
         moment later, EXPLODES into an incredible FIREBALL.

         The expanding FIREBALL released from the explosion
         is to the Observer like an erupting sun, momentarily
         blinding him.



  47     EXT. GUERRILLA CAMP - DAY                             47

         The truck is BLOWN up into the air by the explosion...
         a moment later the satchel charge DETONATES with an
         ear-splitting EXPLOSION, tearing the truck apart.



  48     EXT. SCHAEFER - DAY                                   48

         Jumps to his feet, FIRING an M-203 round into the
         camp.



  49     EXT. KNOLL - DAY                                      49

         Schaefer races down the hillside, joined by Dillon,
         leaving Hawkins to cover them.  Bullets burst around
         their feet as they run low, firing short bursts to
         his left and right.

         He FIRES the undermounted GRENADE LAUNCHER, sending a
         round into a gun position in the trees.  Still running
         he breaks open the breach, slamming in another 40mm
         ROUND from the cartridge pack at his waist.

         Blain and Mac fire the heavy machine guns, laying down
         a withering curtain of lead, shredding the camp,
         taking out five Guerrillas at once.



  50     EXT. GUERRILLA CAMP - DAY                             50

         A MAN almost completely ON FIRE is hit by an onslaught
         of GUNFIRE, ripping him back into the jungle.

         Ramirez cuts loose a barrage from the SIX-SHOOTER...
         seconds later the MACHINE GUN IMPLACEMENT erupts in
         a series of EXPLOSIONS, blowing two Guerrillas into
         the air.

         At the HILLSIDE HUT, two Guerrillas move into position
         by the window, drawing down on Schaefer as he appears,
         racing down the hill.

         As they are about to open fire, Dillon appears,
         YELLING OUT a warning.

                                 DILLON
                  On your nine!!!

         Schaefer dives, hitting the ground as Dillon OPENS
         FIRE taking out the Guerrillas.  Schaefer rolls to
         his feet, spins, firing the 203 grenade launcher,
         completely destroying the hut.



  51     EXT. ALTERED P.O.V. - DAY                             51

         As the Observer regains its vision an eerie, surreal
         experience of sight and sound unfolds:

         BULLETS streak through the air, leaving blood-red
         trails of HEAT, like laser blasts.  As they impact
         into the Guerillas, we HEAR the enhanced SLAPPING
         of BULLETS, SEEING tiny blossoms of HEAT mushroom
         out of their bodies.

         We HEAR the horrific, deformed CRIES and SCREAMS
         of the dying men.

         Another searing, blinding EXPLOSION sends pieces of
         SHRAPNEL ripping through the air, some of them
         ROARING past the Observer's position, like tiny
         meteors.

  52     EXT. GUERRILLA VILLAGE                                52    *

         at the entrance way to the main palapa, a Guerrilla
         stands in the doorway, giving COVER FIRE to his comrades
         as they fall back inside.

         Jumping from the roof of the adjoining palapa, Billy
         drops directly in front of the Guerrilla.

         From the side, unseen by Billy, another Guerrilla           *
         thrusts out with a knife, Billy ducking backwards, the
         tip of the knife SLASHING his face.  With a lightning
         move, Billy whips his arm up and around the Guerrilla,
         locking his elbow, breaking the joint.

         Still holding the man he FIRES, blowing the other
         Guerrilla off his feet with the SHOTGUN portion of his
         weapon.  He looks at the Guerrilla out of the corner of
         his eye.  He suddenly strikes, breaking his neck,
         dropping him in a heap.

         Billy continues on, racing down the stairs, firing the
         M-203.

         Meanwhile, Blain is crouched next to a tree, providing      *
         cover.  Behind Blain, at the edge of the camp, circling
         around from below, TWO GUERRILLAS appear and FIRE a
         grenade round which EXPLODES behind Blain, fragments
         ripping into the tree next to which Blain is standing,
         bark and dirt flying as shrapnel rips into his vest, one
         piece tearing into his upper shoulder.  The hits have
         no effect on the huge man and with a savage GROWL, he
         spins, opening fire, raking the two attackers with the
         Mini-gun.

         Nearby, Mac charges from the jungle on a dead run,
         diving over a fallen tree as machine gun FIRE rakes the
         ground around him.

         Blain, spotting the sniper high in a tree, opens FIRE
         with the MINI-GUN, shredding the tree, sending the
         Guerrilla crashing down through the roof of the
         palapa.



  53     INT. PALAPA - DAY                                     53

         The sniper CRASHES through the roof, landing on the
         floor near Hawkins and Ramirez who do a quick double
         take before opening fire on a group of fleeing
         Guerrillas, taking out two, giving chase to the others.

  53     CONTINUED:                                            53

         Schaefer and Dillon appear at the top of the staircase,     *   
         Schaefer freezing as he SEES below a Guerrilla raising
         an AK-47, preparing to fire.  Schaefer tackles Dillon,
         the two men hurling into the air, a moment later BULLETS
         ripping into the CRATES behind where they were standing.

         Dillon rises up, kicking over a crate, shooting the         *
         Guerrilla who is trying to bring the gun around to fire
         at him.

         Schaefer crouches, covering the upper entrances to the      *   
         palapa, as Ramirez rushes past, joining Schaefer.  From
         the corner of his eye, Schaefer catches a movement.
         With a whipping, backhanded throw, he lets fly his
         COMMANDO MACHETE...

         The machete impales the attacking Guerrilla, driving him    *   
         backwards, pinning him to a post.

                                 SCHAEFER
                  Stick around.

         Schaefer and Ramirez run towards the lower levels, side
         by side, firing as they go.

         They reach a door, Schaefer taking out an ATTACKING
         Guerrilla.  Ramirez grabs the side of the door, shoots
         a look to Schaefer and throws it open.  With Schaefer
         covering him, Ramirez takes a quick peak inside and
         then rushes into the room.

         

  53-A   INT. ROOM - DAY                                       53-A

         At one end is a STAIRWAY, leading to an escape door.
         A Guerrilla, seen from the waist up, scrambles down
         the stairs.

         At the base of the stairs, a Guerrilla, holding an
         AK-47 on his hip, turns and starts to fire.

         Schaefer and Ramirez respond with full AUTO BURSTS
         which rip into the Guerrilla, spinning him around,
         knocking over a crude WOODEN TABLE, scattering a
         BRIEFCASE with burning PAPERS, FOOD CANS, and LIQUOR
         BOTTLES.

         As he spins he FIRES the weapon, an arcing line of SLUGS
         slamming into the tin roof, sending down a shower of
         rust and dirt.  He falls to the ground.  Dead.

                                                      (CONTINUED)

  53-A   CONTINUED:                                            53-A

         Ramirez charges through the DUST and thick SMOKE to
         cover the fallen men; Schaefer following close behind,
         jerking a new CLIP from his ammo belt.

         Suddenly, another Guerrilla erupts from behind some
         ammunition crates, drawing down on Ramirez with a
         machine pistol.

                                 SCHAEFER
                         (shouting)
                  Down!!!

         As the Guerrilla fires, Schaefer smashes the butt of
         his empty weapon into the Guerrilla's shoulder, knocking
         the gun aside, the SLUGS thudding into the wall
         harmlessly.

         He hits the Guerrilla with a vicious glancing blow to
         the head with the barrel of his weapon.  The Guerrilla
         is hurled backward, crashing into the wooden crates and
         to the floor.

         Ramirez, recovering quickly, descends the stairs with
         catlike agility, disappearing.

         Schaefer crouches and spins, jamming a new clip into the
         rifle, scanning the palapa for any other movement.  He
         races to the main door of the room, shouting into the
         palapa.

         He SEES Blain charging down the steps.  Catching his
         attention he signals him on, out the back to cover
         Ramirez.

                                 SCHAEFER
                         (to Hawkins)
                  Hawk, Get Con. Op. on the
                  hook!  Position and situation,
                  now!

         As Blain runs down the stairs, Hawkins already has the
         radio off his back, setting up the portable SATELLITE
         DISH ANTENNA.

                                 HAWKINS
                  You got it, Major!

  53-B   EXT. PALAPA - WATER AREA - DAY                        53-B

         Ramirez, Blain and Billy race down the back stairs
         of the palapa, FIRING Mini-gun, automatic and grenade
         rounds at the escaping GUERRILLAS as they flee the area,
         splashing, charging across the shallow river.

         The guerrillas are history...in no uncertain terms.



  53-C   INT. PALAPA - DAY                                     53-C

         For the first time, Schaefer studies the interior of
         the cavernous palapa, SEEING the enormous stockpile
         of WEAPONS, EQUIPMENT and SUPPLIES stacked along the
         walls, obviously a major military stronghold hidden
         deep within the mountains.  Mac hustles up to Schaefer,
         a look of urgency on his face.

                                 SCHAEFER
                  Any sign of the hostages?

                                 MAC
                         (nods)
                  We found 'em both, dead.
                  And the gear from the chopper.
                  If they're Central American,
                  I'm a fuckin' Chinaman.  By                        *
                  the looks of 'em, I'd say our                      *
                  cabinet minister and his aide                      *
                  are CIA.
                         (pause)
                  Another thing, Major, we were
                  lucky...couple of those guys
                  we waxed are Russians,
                  military advisors by the look
                  of it.  Something big was
                  about to happen here.

         Schaefer looks at Mac a moment, a flush of anger
         beginning to show.

                                 SCHAEFER
                  Good work, Mac.  Clear the
                  area, no traces.  Get the men
                  ready to move.

         Schaefer goes back into the room, looking down at the
         unconscious guerrilla, racking a round into the
         chamber, reloading his weapon.

         He kneels, staring into the FACE of a WOMAN, ANNA,
         dark, late twenties.  Despite her blood and
         dirt-smeared face, she is beautiful.

                  Shit...

         He checks her pulse and then slowly he bends to pick
         up her PISTOL, ejecting the clip.  He stands, beginning
         to shuffle through the PAPERS scattered about the room.
         Staring at one he looks up, the pieces falling together.



  54     EXT. JUNGLE - DAY                                     54

         Ramirez, at a crouch, runs through the jungle,
         following the obvious signs of the Guerrilla's
         retreat.  He emerges from the trees into an opening,
         leading to a sheer rock cliff, towering fifty feet
         above the ground.  Scanning the wall, he SEES
         movement and quickly takes cover, as automatic
         FIRE rips up the ground before him.



  54-A   EXT. ROCK WALL - DAY                                  54-A

         Near the center of which a narrow cut, two feet
         wide, leads to the top of the cliff, giving access
         to the adjoining ridge.

         Two Guerrillas scramble up through the chimney,
         assisted by a ROPE, which with withdraw as they
         reach the top.  Ramirez takes out one man, the
         other taking cover, returning fire.



  54-B   EXT. BASE OF ROCK WALL - DAY                          54-B  *

         Blain joins Ramirez, behind cover at the foot of
         the cliff.  As they take cover, Ramirez notices
         the wound on Blain's shoulder.

                                 RAMIREZ
                  You're hit.  You're bleedin',
                  man.

         Blain looks briefly at the wound.

                                 BLAIN
                         (spits)
                  Ain't got time to bleed.

         On a signal, they both clear cover and fire LONG
         BURSTS from their weapons up the cliff.

                                                      (CONTINUED)

  54-B   CONTINUED:                                            54-B

         The smoke is hardly cleared when they are answered
         by withering FIRE.  They duck down as a grenade
         EXPLODES nearby.  Ramirez quickly replaces the 40MM
         rounds into the SIX-SHOOTER.

                                 BLAIN
                  Son of a bitch's dug in like

                  ...jack us around all day.

                                 RAMIREZ
                  Hell, dude, we don't have all
                  day.

         Ramirez immediately rolls into the line of fire,
         BLASTING six RAPID-FIRE shots on a HIGH-ARC trajectory
         towards the rocks.  Blain reacts.

                                 BLAIN
                  Shit, Pancho!!!

         Blain dives against the protective cover of the
         rock wall, covering his head.  Ramirez casually
         hops across, squatting next to Blain.  They make
         eye-contact.

                                 RAMIREZ
                  What's your problem, dude?

         Before Blain can answer, Ramirez puts his fingers
         into his ears and grimaces just as...

         The entire hillside EXPLODES, blowing the Guerrillas
         into the air, a torrent of vegetation and earth
         raining down the cliff, obscuring Blain and Ramirez.



  55     INT. PALAPA ROOM - DAY                                55

         Schaefer is staring out the window, his weapon slack
         in one arm, still holding the paper.  Dillon enters,
         obviously excited about what he has found.  He sees
         the papers on the floor.  He reads through them
         quickly, growing even more excited.

         Schaefer turns, striding slowly to Dillon, handing him
         the paper he is holding.

                                 SCHAEFER
                  I think this is the one you want.

         Dillon reads it.

                  In two days, three hundred of
                  these bastards would have been

                  they crossed the border, it

                  I couldn't get you in here without

                                 DILLON
                  We've been lookin' for this
                  place for months.  The chopper
                  must have gotten close when
                  they got shot down.  Hopper                        *
                  was sent in to get my men.
                  He was just doing his job.
                  When he disappeared I had to
                  clean this up,  I had to stop
                  there bastards.  We were so
                  close, we couldn't quit.  We
                  couldn't sleep through this
                  one.  I needed you, Dutch,
                  can't you see that?

                                 DILLON
                  To invade a foreign country,
                  illegally?  You lied, Dillon.
                  Stacked the odds against us.  Set
                  us up.  You could have gotten
                  us all killed.
                         (pause; looking at him)
                  You used to be one of us,
                  Dillon, someone I could trust
                  with my life...

                                 DILLON
                  We've been through a lot together
                  Dutch.  When we were together, no                  *
                  one could stop us, the hottest                     *
                  Goddamned team the army ever saw.                  *
                  But things changed, I woke up.
                  We're fighting them in a dozen
                  Goddamned countries.  It's a
                  fight we can't lose, Dutch.  We're
                  all expendable assets, can't you
                  see that?

         Schaefer takes the paper from Dillon's hands.

                                 SCHAEFER
                  That's your problem, Dillon.
                  You always did put ambition
                  before the lives of your men.
                         (pause)
                  My men are not expendable.  I
                  don't do this kind of work.
                         (crumples up
                         paper in fist)

         He stuffs the crumpled paper into Dillon's shirt
         pocket.

         Anna, regaining consciousness, GROANS, a heavy flow
         of blood running down her face from her head wound.

         Hawkins appears at the door.

                                 HAWKINS
                  Major!

         Schaefer turns away from Dillon and steps through
         the doorway into the palapa as Anna moans again,
         MUMBLING something in Spanish.  Dillon kneels,
         beside her.

                                 DILLON

         Schaefer is talking to Hawkins who has the field
         radio set on a crate just outside the door.

                                 HAWKINS

                         (o.s.)
                  She goes with us.

         Schaefer turns.  Dillon is at the doorway, supporting
         the still groggy Anna.

                                 DILLON
                  She's too valuable.  She's
                  got to know their whole
                  network.  The whole set up.
                  We take her with us.                               *

                  chance she gets.  No
                  prisoners, Dillon.

         Dillon grabs the handset from Hawkin's radio, shoving it
         at Schaefer.

                                 DILLON
                  You're still under orders,
                  Dutch.  You want to make the
                  call, or should I?

         Schaefer looks at the handset.  Then at Dillon, he knows
         Dillon's won.

         He starts to walk away but stops, turning back, pointing
         a finger at Dillon.

                                 SCHAEFER
                  I'm getting my men out of this

  56     EXT. GUERRILLA VILLAGE - DAY                          56

         Schaefer and Billy are kneeling on the ground near the
         trailhead, studying a MAP.  In the b.g., the team, hidden,
         covers the hillside approaches to the camp, nervous and
         wary, weapons ready.

                                 SCHAEFER
                  This place is too hot for a pick-up.
                  They won't touch us until we're over
                  the border.  We can lift at LZ 49,
                  here.
                         (points to map)
                  Spotter plane says we're cut off.
                         (points to map)
                  Except for this valley.

         Billy shakes his head, following the CONTOUR LINES of
         the rugged terrain.

                                 BILLY
                  Looks bad, Major.  It's gonna be
                  a real bitch.
                         (points to map)
                  If we follow above the river and
                  then down, here, at this canyon,
                  we might find a way out.

         Schaefer turns to Ramirez, kneeling close by.

                                 SCHAEFER
                         (decisively)
                  Not much choice.  Pancho, take
                  the lead.  Double time it.

         He turns and looks at Dillon, Anna as his side, her
         forehead bandaged, her hands bound in front of her.
         He turns back to the others.

                                 SCHAEFER
                  Lock n' load, watch your ass.

         Blain moves out, swinging the Mini-gun in front of him
         as he goes.

         Watching as Dillon leads ANNA onward, SEEING her bound
         hands.  Dillon pushes her.



  57     EXT. ANNA - DAY                                       57

         Spins, hurling a string of insults to Dillon in
         SPANISH.

                                 ANNA
                         (in Spanish)
                  You touch me again, pig, and
                  I will cut off your balls!

                                 DILLON
                         (in Spanish)
                  It's a long walk back, make it
                  easy on yourself.

         She spits at him, turning forward with a twist of
         her head.

         Dillon picks up his back, shouldering it.  As they
         move on, Mac calls out to him.

                                 MAC
                         (quietly)
                  Hey, Dillon, over here.

         Dillon doesn't respond.

                                 MAC
                         (louder)
                  Dillon, over here.

         Dillon turns and approaches, warily, holding
         the girl.

                                 DILLON
                  Yeah, what is it, Sergeant?

         MAc unsheathes his knife.  He gives Dillon a cold
         look and turns him by the shoulders.  Crawling
         across the PACK on Dillon's back is a huge SCORPION.

         Mac skeweres the scorpion with the tip of his
         blade, holding it before the wincing Dillon.  Anna
         smirks, nodding to the writhing, stinging insect.

                                 ANNA
                         (in Spanish)
                  When my people catch you,
                  you'll wish you were him.

         Dillon looks at Mac.

                                 DILLON
                  Thanks.

                                 MAC
                         (coolly)
                  Anytime.

         Mac flings the scorpion to the ground, crushing it
         with his boot.  He looks up at Dillon, walks away.
         Dillon follows, pulling Anna behind him.

         Billy, guarding the rear, glances furtively around
         the clearing.  He moves a step forward and stops,
         freezing.

         Slowly he turns back, his eyes riveted upon the
         treeline above the camp.  His eyes strain, his
         senses registering a fear he cannot name or see.

         Something is out there, in the trees, waiting,
         watching.

         Billy turns and walks into the jungle, pausing
         one last time to look behind him before he too
         disappears from sight.

         The jungle GROWS SILENT.



  58     EXT. OBSERVER'S ALTERED P.O.V. - DAY                  58

         LOOKING DOWN from his vantage point TO the treeline
         below, terraces like stepping stones, FOCUSING ON
         a TREE, fifty feet away.

         The Observer utters a LOW TRILL and springs outward
         into space, hurtling downward towards his landing
         point, the canopy of the trees approaching in a
         staccato rush of green.

         The SOUNDS of the FOREST are again altered and
         enhanced with an electric, STATIC-LIKE quality as
         the Observer descends fluidly through the trees
         and to the ground.

         He enters the camp, surveying the terrible
         destruction and carnage.  He SEES the dead
         Guerrillas, the dissipating heat from their bodies
         leaving them pale and GHOST-LIKE, as if fading
         light about to extinguish.  He sees their weapons,
         the cold hard steel of the barrels registering
         ICE BLUE in his vision.

                                                               42



  58-A   EXT. OBSERVER'S P.O.V. OF HIS HAND - DAY              58-A

         As it appears, pulsing in a pale magenta heat, low
         to the ground, holding his weapon.  He lays down
         the weapon, picking up the SCORPION, turning it
         slowly in his fingers, examining it.  It looks like
         an exotic flower, its color fading from sight,
         turning to BLACK.

         A low SOUND is uttered, something vaguely familiar
         about it:  A NEARLY HUMAN VOICE, a distorted
         imitation of Mac.

                                 HUNTER
                         (o.s.; filtered)
                  Dillon, over here.

         Again the phrase is uttered, improving, closer to
         Mac's inflection and accent.

                                 HUNTER
                         (o.s.)
                  Dillon, over here.

         The Hunter lowers the pitch.

                                 HUNTER
                         (o.s.)
                  Dillon, over here.

         The last effort is a chilling simulation of Mac's
         voice.



  59     EXT. OBSERVER'S HAND - DAY                            59

         Drops the scorpion and picks up the weapon which
         changes instantly back to the Observer's skin tones.



  59-A   EXT. OBSERVER'S P.O.V. - DAY                          59-A

         He turns and focuses on the area where the team
         left camp.

         He crouches and springs to the lower branches of a
         tree, grasping them with his clawed, three-fingered
         hands, pulling himself up and through the branches
         with astounding speed and simian-like dexterity; his
         spurred prehensile feet, grasping and thrusting him
         to a vantage point, fifty feet above the ground.

         As he moves on, the jungle grows suddenly QUIET, as
         if aware, sensing that the HUNTER is now stalking, no
         longer observing!!!

  60     EXT. JUNGLE VALLEY - DAY                              60

         The twilight world of a PREHISTORIC FOREST, filled
         with gigantic plants and towering trees, overgrown
         with vines and creepers.

         The team, with Billy at point, walk alongside a
         wandering STREAM BED, weirdly illuminated by SHAFTS
         OF LIGHT, streaming through openings in the trees,
         as if from spotlights, a hundred feet above.

         It is midday, hot and humid, the air BUZZING with the
         sounds of insects, the CRYING of birds and monkeys.
         The men are moving fast and quiet, straining to see
         into the dense jungle, aware of every sound, sweating,
         quietly slapping at biting insects.



  61     EXT. GIANT HARDWOOD TREE - DAY                        61

         Lies across their path.  As the man climb over a
         rotten section, Mac stops to assist Blain with his
         Mini-gun.

                                 MAC
                  I've seen some badass bush
                  before, but nothin' like
                  this, man.
                         (pause)
                  Little taste 'o home?

         Blain nods and pauses to rest, looking around him
         as Mac withdraws a small silver POCKET FLASK.  He
         takes a nip, passing the flask to Blain who also
         takes a sip.

                                 BLAIN
                  I hear you bro, this is some
                  shit.  Makes Cambodia look
                  like Kansas.  Lose your way
                  in here, man, you be in some
                  kinda hurt.

         Blain hands back the flask, Mac replacing it inside
         his vest.  They do their hand dap, looking warily
         behind them before they move on.



  62     EXT. ANNA AND DILLON - JUNGLE - DAY                   62

         Have fallen behind, Dillon looking worriedly ahead
         at the them out distancing them.  Anna is keeping
         her pace purposefully slow.  She trips on a root
         falling to the ground.  She lies there, motionless.
         He quickly reaches down to haul her to her feet.

                                 DILLON
                         (urgently)
                  Shit.  Come on...

         Like an uncoiled spring, Anna turns, flinging a
         handful of DIRT into his face, momentarily blinding
         him.  She lunges for his rifle with her bound hands.

         Suddenly the BARREL of an MP-5 is thrust into her face.

         Looking up she SEES Ramirez, calmly holding the weapon
         on her, the look in his eyes indicating he'd hove no
         trouble shooting her.

                                 RAMIREZ
                         (in Spanish)
                  Don't try it.

         She looks back at Dillon, wiping the dirt from his eyes.
         She moves on.  Ramirez gives him a cold look as Dillon
         hurries past.

                                 RAMIREZ
                         (coolly)
                  You should put her on a leash,
                  Agent Man.  If you can't handle
                  her, just say the word.

         Dillon moves on, ignoring Ramirez, who turns, scanning
         the jungle behind him before moving on.  Dillon catches
         up with Anna, turning her sharply by the chin.

                                 DILLON
                         (cold; in Spanish)
                  Try that again.  Please.                           *

         She looks at him contemptuously, undaunted.  She will
         try it again.  She breaks away from his grasp and
         moves on, Dillon watching her go, he won't hesitate
         next time.



  63     EXT. HUNTER'S P.O.V. - DAY                            63

         As he travels, directly overhead, timing his movement
         with those of the team.  He moves lower, closer to
         the slowly moving humans.



  64     EXT. RIVER BED - DAY                                  64

         The team moves cautiously through the winding stream
         bed, now wearing their clothing in various stages of
         disarray for comfort, sweat dripping from their bodies.

  64     CONTINUED:                                            64

         Billy, in the lead, picks his way along the riverbank,
         his concentration rapt, aboriginal.  His face a
         trancelike mask of expectation.

         Blain, cradling the heavy Mini-gun as if it were a
         toy, swings the weapon relentlessly across his field
         of view.  He pauses to adjust the hanging, belted
         loop of cartridges trailing from the back pack
         magazine.  An INSECT lands on his face and is trapped
         in the grease paint near his lips.  He draws the
         hapless bug into his mouth with his tongue and quietly
         spits it out, his concentration unbroken.

         Mac follows, holding the M-60 high across his chest.

         Schaefer, bent, cautious, his feet moving aside the
         dry leaves on the ground, heel to toe and on foot
         edges.  He glances around, checking the team's
         position and progress.

         Hawkins follows, his mouth open, breathing deeply,
         exhausted, the radio a 60 pound demon.

         Anna, struggling to climb a section of the stream
         bank, slips on some loose dirt.  Unable to assist
         herself with her hands tied, she nearly falls.
         Dillon prods her with his rifle, forcing her to
         her feet.  She scrambles up the bank, Dillon following.



  65     EXT. RIVER BANK - DAY                                 65

         As Billy enters a small clearing, bordered on one
         side by the towering trees, carpeting the
         mountainside.  High above in the thick, impenetrable
         treeline, brightly colored birds SQUAWK loudly,
         chasing each other from branch to branch.

         Suddenly Billy stops.  Schaefer holds up his hand
         and the team freezes in position.  An eerie SILENCE,
         like a slowly falling curtain, descends over the
         jungle until even the BUZZING and CLICKING of insects
         have CEASED.



  66     EXT. TEAM MEMBERS - DAY                               66

         Sensing an ambush, move quietly into the foliage.
         Dillon moves into the undergrowth, dragging Anna
         with him.  He slings his MP-5 over his shoulder,
         withdrawing his KNIFE.  Grasping Anna by her shirt
         collar and pushing her to the ground he holds the
         weapon near her throat.  Dillon signals to Ramirez          *
         who approaches.  Dillon hands Ramirez the knife.

                                                      (CONTINUED)

                  Watch her.

         Before Ramirez can respond, Dillon slips into the
         undergrowth.  Ramirez holds the knife on Anna,
         cautiously scanning around him for movement.

         Unseen by Ramirez, Anna's outstretched hands slowly
         tighten around a stout ROOT-BURL, lying loose on the
         ground.



  67     EXT. BILLY - AT THE RIVER BED - DAY                   67

         He remains frozen and transfixed, staring into the
         treeline.  Something is moving, fluid, silently and
         downward, into the forest.  Billy remains rooted to
         the spot, lost in concentration.



  68     SCHAEFER                                              68

         sensing something very wrong with Billy, moves alongside
         Mac.

                                 SCHAEFER
                  What's got Billy so spooked?

                                 MAC
                  Can't say, Major...been
                  squirrely all mornin'...
                  fuckin' weird...sometimes
                  I think that nose of his is
                  too good...smells things that
                  ain't there.

         Schaefer signals for Mac to cover him and then moves low
         and quiet towards Billy.  Dillon appears, looking to
         Mac for an explanation.  Mac ignores him, concentrating
         on the jungle.  Dillon looks forward at...

         Billy, his eyes riveted to the capony above, as he
         unconsciously reaches to his throat, grasping a LEATHER
         POUCH, secured to his neck by a thong.  He fingers the
         MEDICINE BAG talisman.



  69     EXT. HUNTER'S P.O.V. - DAY                            69

         As he slowly descends through the trees, moving
         towards Billy, who's eyes search the treeline for
         movement.

  70     BACK TO SCENE/SCHAEFER                                70

         approaches Billy, gripping his shoulders and in a
         hoarse whisper, speaks his name.

                                 SCHAEFER
                  What is it...?

         Billy, rigid, does not respond.  Schaefer forcefully
         jerks his around to face him.

                                 SCHAEFER
                  Billy...What the hell's wrong
                  with you?

                         (low)
                  Something...in the trees...



  71     EXT. HUNTER'S P.O.V. - DAY                            71

         Still closing in on Billy.  Billy turns back, looking
         high into the trees, puzzled and frightened.  He's
         lost sense of the Hunter's presence.  He lowers his
         vision, looking towards the Hunter, now on the ground,
         30 yards across the clearing from Billy.  The Hunter
         pauses.



  72     BACK TO SCENE/BILLY AND SCHAEFER                      72

                                 BILLY

                         (points)
                  ...there?

         Schaefer stares hard at the jungle.

                                 SCHAEFER
                  It's...nothing...



  73     EXT. HUNTER'S P.O.V. - DAY                            73

         Moves behind a broad fern, skirting around Billy
         and Schaefer, heading away from the column.



  74     BACK TO SCENE/BILLY AND SCHAEFER                      74

         Schaefer shakes his head, continuing to stare into
         the jungle.  He turns to Billy.

                                 SCHAEFER
                  What do you think...?

         Billy turns, a puzzled look in his eyes.  He nods
         in agreement.

                                 BILLY
                  It's nothing...



  75     EXT. ANNA AND RAMIREZ - DAY                           75

         Sensing the danger has passed, Ramirez releases his
         grip on Anna.  As they start to rise, Ramirez sheaths
         his knife and unslings his MP-5.  Anna still stares
         hard into the jungle.

         Suddenly, without even looking, Anna with the trained
         reflexes of an experienced fighter swings the BURL with
         all her might, catching Ramirez hard on the side of the
         head, just above the eye, opening a wicked gash.
         Spinning around she knees him brutally in the groin.
         As Ramirez goes down, doubled over in pain, Anna turns,
         scrambling up the embankment, running for the jungle.

         Ramirez CRIES out.



  76     EXT. SCHAEFER - DAY                                   76

         HEARING Ramirez' cry, Schaefer signals to Hawkins to
         move.  Hawkins moves out, fast, heading towards the
         sound...



  77     EXT. HAWKINS - DAY                                    77

         SEES Anna running away.  He gives chase.
         Anna, although bound, is light and fit and runs fast,
         hurdling fallen logs and branches, charging through the
         undergrowth.  SHe has a good start.

         Hawkins, hampered by the radio and weapon but in
         tremendous shape, thunders after her, closing the
         distance.



  78     EXT. HUNTER'S P.O.V. - DAY                            78

         As he passes from behind a large tree, surrounded by
         dense foliage, SEEING the fleeing Anna.  He watches
         her and then begins to move parallel with her, only
         faster, the green of the jungle rushing by in a blur.



  79     EXT. ANNA AND HAWKINS - DAY                           79

         Anna, bursting through a grove of ferns, drives on,
         breathing hard with the exertion.

         Hawkins, ten yards behind, closing the distance,
         taking advantage of any hesitation Anna makes,
         struggling with the dense jungle.

         Anna hits a small clearing, an alleyway through
         the trees.  She sprints hard across the clear
         ground.



  80     EXT. HUNTER'S P.O.V. - DAY                            80

         Moving through the jungle.  As he steps clear of
         the foliage he SEES Anna driving hard into the
         alleyway, running directly towards him.  Twenty
         yards away, Hawkins, closes in.



  81     BACK TO SCENE/HAWKINS                                 81

         Only a few feet behind Anna, lunges forward, knocking
         her to the ground.  In a second he's on her, his
         weapon ready.  She struggles to her feet, fighting,
         gasping for breath.  Hawkins holds the MP-5 on her,
         looking at her, almost pleading.  He doesn't want
         to shoot her, but he will if he has to.

                                 HAWKINS
                  Please...

         She looks at the weapon, to Hawkins and then,
         hopefully, to the jungle.  She stops, staring hard
         down the alleyway.  Something...suddenly she sees it!


                                 ANNA
                         (in Spanish)

         Hawkins spins...



  82     EXT. HAWKINS AND ANNA'S P.O.V. - DAY                  82

         SEEING the MOTTLED OUTLINE of the Hunter's body,
         racing towards them, as if the entire wall of the
         jungle were rushing in.  The Hunter's WEAPON
         flares to life.



  83     EXT. HUNTER'S P.O.V. - ANNA AND HAWKINS - DAY         83

         As he hurtles towards them, their faces frozen in
         surprise.

         A splitting THUD as Hawkins is hurtled backwards into
         the undergrowth, the Hunter's hand and WEAPON flashing

         through the air.  BLOOD splashes on Anna's face.
         She SCREAMS as Hawkins' MP-5 FIRES a short BURST
         into the air.



  85     EXT. RIVER BED - DAY                                  85

         HEARING the GUNFIRE, Schaefer WHISTLES low and sharp.
         Ramirez, face bloody, swings into action, moving in a
         coordinated defensive/offensive pattern into the
         jungle.



  86     HAWKINS/BACK TO SCENE                                 86

         The Hunter's ARM and SPUR hook into Hawkins' leg, and
         he is dragged into the jungle.



  87     EXT. RAMIREZ - DAY                                    87

         Ramirez runs forward ten paces, drops to a crouch,
         scanning to each side.  Immediately Schaefer runs
         forward twenty paces.  As he passes Ramirez, Ramirez
         turns and scans the rear and flanks.

         Dillon, Mac and Blain repeat the maneuver, leap-frogging
         forward, canvassing the jungle, providing areas of
         intersection cover.



  88     EXT. RAMIREZ                                          88

         Entering the alleyway where Hawkins was killed he SEES
         Anna, cowering in the bushes, her blood splattered
         face glazed with terror, his eyes vacant.  He
         approaches, angry, wary, but the girl is so stunned.
         He SEES the trail of BLOOD and CRUSHED GRASSES leading
         into the jungle.  He gives a LOW WHISTLE and then moves
         on, the rest of the team assuming defensive positions
         around the clearing.

         He follows the trail, finding first Hawkins'
         blood-covered weapon, and then, a few yards later,
         the radio.  Ramirez cautiously parts the brush before
         him.  A look of puzzlement and then revulsion comes
         of his face.



  89     EXT. ALLEYWAY - DAY                                   89

         Blain and Mac at either end, cautiously searching
         the jungle; Billy covering their flanks.

         Schaefer and Dillon approach Anna.  She seems unaware
         of their presence, staring numbly ahead.  Schaefer
         checks her out, looking for wounds, he wipes some of
         the blood from her face.

                                 SCHAEFER
                  It's not her blood.

         Ramirez emerges from the jungle carrying Hawkins'
         MP-5 and radio.  He approaches, dumping the equipment
         on the ground.

                                 RAMIREZ                                    
                  Major, you'd better take a
                  look at this.

                                 SCHAEFER
                  Hawkins?

                                 RAMIREZ
                         (oddly)
                  I can't tell.



  90     EXT. SCHAEFER AND RAMIREZ - DAY                       90

         Dillon in the b.g., as Ramirez parts the brush with
         his weapon.  Before them, covered with dirt and
         leaves, are Hawkins' ENTRAILS.  There is no body.

                                 SCHAEFER
                         (shocked)
                  What in God's name...?

                                 RAMIREZ
                  I think it's Hawkins.

                                 SCHAEFER
                  Where the hell is his body?

                                 RAMIREZ
                  There's no sign of it.



  91     EXT. ALLEYWAY - DAY                                   91

         The entire team is gathered, still holding defensive
         positions.  Anna, still stunned, is beginning to
         come around.  She looks up at Schaefer.  He turns to
         Ramirez.

                                 SCHAEFER
                  Ramirez, ask her what
                  happened.

         Ramirez drops to one knee and talks softly to her in
         SPANISH.  She mutters incoherently in Spanish, still
         dazed, shaking her head.  Dillon listens closely to her
         response.  Ramirez turns to Schaefer.  He seems
         confused.

                                 RAMIREZ
                  She says...the jungle came
                  alive, and took him...

                                 DILLON
                  That isn't what she said...
                  she said...

                         Ramirez)
                  ...she doesn't make sense.

                                 RAMIREZ
                         (growing angry)
                  Couple of sappers been
                  trailing us all the way from
                  the camp, Major.  Billy heard
                  them.  She set us up, ran
                  for it...They were waiting.
                  I should've wasted the bitch
                  when I had the chance.

         Schaefer, looking at Hawkins' bloodstained equipment
         lying at Anna's feet, looks up.

                                 SCHAEFER
                         (quietly)
                  Why didn't they take the
                  radio and his weapon?
                         (pause)
                  Why didn't she escape?

         Ramirez and Dillon look at the equipment and then
         to the girl, still numb with shock.

                                 DILLON
                         (grimly; remembering)

         The two veteran commandos look at each other, finding
         no explanation between them.

                                 SCHAEFER
                         (urgent; to the others)
                  I want him found.  Sweep
                  pattern and double back.  Fifty
                  meters.

         They move out.  Schaefer moves into the jungle,
         searching.  He crouches at the base of a huge
         MAHOGANY TREE, covered with vines, studying the
         jungle.  He moves away from the tree and into the
         forest, looking for signs on the ground.

         Where he was sitting, a DROP OF BLOOD falls.  Another
         drop falls, dripping from a leaf and above that, from
         another leaf.  Above that, high in the top of the
         tree, SUSPENDED from vines from his ankles, is
         HAWKINS' BODY, his chest a gaping wound.

         He hands there as if he were an animal, field dressed.



  92     EXT. BLAIN - DAY                                      92

         Crouched in the undergrowth.  There is a movement in
         the brush before him.  He wipes the sweat from his
         eyes and clicks his safety on the Mini-gun to fire.

         The SOUND is growing closer.  Blain levels the weapon.
         A smile crosses his face.

                                 BLAIN
                         (whispers)
                  Come on in you fuckers...come on
                  in.  'ol 'painless' is waitin'...

         The movement in the brush is GROWING LOUDER.  Blain's
         finger moves closer to the trigger.

         Suddenly a small TAPIR bursts through the leaves,
         startling Blain.  He relaxes momentarily as he
         watches the animal scurrying from sight.  He
         stands...

         SOMETHING grazes his shoulder, a gout of BLOOD erupting.
         He starts to turn, the Mini-gun held low, ready to
         fire...

         ...from out of the jungle, 75 feet away, the Hunter's
         WEAPON streaks toward him like a missile.  He SCREAMS
         as it enters his back, erupting from his chest in an
         EXPLOSION of BLOOD.



  93     EXT. MAC - DAY                                        93

         Has heard Blain's cry.  He moves fast through the brush.
         He HEARS a RUSTLING in the bushes.  A wet SUCKING SOUND.
         Mac charges into the clearing.  In the instant before
         the Hunter disappears into the forest, Mac SEES a vision
         so brief and fantastic that it seems like a
         hallucination.

         The Hunter's EYES flare momentarily from the green
         before they vanish.

         Mac sees his friend, lying on the ground, his chest
         open, the powerful man, dead.

                                  MAC
                         (shouting)
                  Contact, 30 Right!!!

         He OPENS FIRE with his M-203, belted shells slamming
         into the weapon from the magazine at his waist,
         expending it in one LONG BURST.
 


  94     EXT. THE OTHER TEAM MEMBERS - DAY                     94

         Flying through the jungle, weapons ready, eyes searching

  95     EXT. MAC - DAY                                        95

         He throws down the weapon and with a cry of rage, lunges
         forward, grabbing the Mini-gun.  As he stands, the
         CARTRIDGE BELT, attached to Blain, strings out between
         them.

         He opens FIRE and the foliage before him EXPLODES with
         the fury of the terrible weapon.  Mac sweeps the
         Mini-gun from left to right, like a man possessed,
         mowing down the jungle.

         The other team members race INTO SIGHT and begin firing
         with Mac.

  96     EXT. HUNTER - DAY                                     96

         Moving.  A piece of SHRAPNEL cuts his shoulder.  A
         splash of ORANGE BLOOD spatters across the LEAVES
         of a nearby tree, bullet holes ripping through the
         surrounding foliage.



  97     BACK TO SCENE/MAC                                     97

         More FIRING.  Mac, his weapon expended, continues
         to thrust the Mini-gun forward, still squeezing the
         trigger.

         Suddenly, as quickly as it started, THE FIRING STOPS.
         The men move catlike into the jungle, reloading,
         searching, their nerves taut, stretched to the limit,
         ready to fire again at any second.

         Mac is frozen, eyes wide, unblinking, his breath
         coming in rapid gasps as he stares into the jungle,
         still squeezing the trigger of the weapon, its
         breech locked open, GUNSMOKE wafting from the chamber
         and barrel.

         Schaefer moves in front of Mac, still staring into the
         jungle.  Dillon pushes Anna into the clearing, moving
         towards the body.  Anna looks at the body and then up
         to Mac.  Schaefer sees a terrifying moment of
         recognition flash in her eyes as she continues to
         stare at Mac.  He turns to Mac.

                                 MAC
                         (confused)
                  I...saw it.

         At these words, Anna reacts in shock, drawing a             *
         slight breath.  Schaefer turns, sees her staring at         *
         Mac.  He turns back.

                                 SCHAEFER

                         (still dazed)
                  I saw it.

         Schaefer turns back to see Anna, staring fixidly at Mac,    *
         watching his lips.  Schaefer turns quickly to Blain's       *
         body and kneels alongside Dillon.

         Schaefer stands, looking at the body.  In the b.g.

         Mac stares ahead, dumbly, not hearing.  He grabs Mac

         awareness.

                  I don't know.  Goddamn it,

         Ramirez runs from the jungle, breathing hard, shaking
         his head.

                                 RAMIREZ
                  Nothing.  The same thing.
                  Not a fucking trace.  No
                  bodies, blood, anything.

         Mac stands.  Instinctively the team has now grouped
         around Schaefer, their weapons pointing into the jungle,
         ready, their nerves on total edge.  Schaefer looks
         upward at the darkening sky.

                                 SCHAEFER
                         (quietly)
                  We're losing the light.  Mac,
                  I want a defensive position
                  above this ridge, mined with
                  everything we're got.

         Man is again the hardened professional.

                                 MAC
                  Yessir.

         Schaefer looks down at Blain's body.  He turns to
         Ramirez and Billy.

                                 SCHAEFER
                  Put him in his poncho and
                  liner and carry him back.
                  We'll bury him in the morning.

                                 MAC
                  I'll take him.

         as they leave approaches the brush, her attention
         focused on something clinging to the leaves, well off
         to the side of where Mac saw the Hunter.  She draws
         closer, reaching out, hesitant, as if drawn magnetically
         to the leaves.

         Clinging to the leaves, thick, viscous, pale-orange,
         almost like the sap of an exotic plant.  Her fingers
         hover above it, hesitantly, and then touch it.



 101     ANNA                                                 101

         examines the blood, transfixed.  Dillon appears at her
         shoulder, startling her.  He motions for her to return.
         She turns, wiping the blood onto her pants leg.



 102     EXT. ENCAMPMENT - DUSK                               102

         The team is dug into the foxholes in a dense grove of
         trees, a solid wall to their backs.  The men are barely
         visible they blend in so well.

         Nearby, Mac is stringing a TRIP WIRE, low to the ground,
         covering it with leaves and grass.  He moves into camp
         and reports to Schaefer.

                                 MAC
                  We've got most of the flares,
                  frags. and two claymores just
                  outside.  Nothin's comin'
                  close to here without trippin'
                  on somethin'.

                                 SCHAEFER
                  Thank you, Sergeant.

         Mac starts to go but Schaefer places his hand on his
         shoulder.

                                 SCHAEFER
                  I'm sorry, Bull.  It's never
                  easy.  He was a good soldier.

                  The best friend I ever had.

         Mac turns and walks through the camp, stopping beside
         a DARK OBJECT on the ground.  He kneels beside the
         PONCHO pulling back the zipper REVEALING Blain's face,
         looking peaceful in death, as if lying in state.

         Mac removes something from his pocket, holding it in
         his hand, studying it.



 103     DETAIL OF OBJECT IN MAC'S HAND                       103

         The small WHISKEY FLASH, the chrome rubbed away in
         places REVEALING the brass beneath and a MEDALLION
         depicting the 101 1ST AIRBORNE DIVISION.



 104     MAC                                                  104

         takes a tiny sip from the flask.  He replaces the cap
         and lifts the flap of Blain's shirt pocket, placing
         the flask inside.  He lingers on the face and then
         closes the zipper.

                                 MAC

         is huddles into a foxhole, her hands still tied in front
         of her.  She looks down at her pants leg.  The Hunter's
         BLOODSTAIN glows with a faint luminosity.  She places
         her fingers near the stain.

         A momentary HUSH falls over the symphony of night
         sounds.  Anna and Billy turn towards the trees with a
         growing look of wariness.  The others, setting up the
         RADIO, show no response.

 

 108     INT. HUNTER'S SHIP - DAY (DUSK)                      108 

         The Hunter's foot steps on the upper leg of the corpse,
         the PREHENSILE SPUR digging deep, pinioning the body
         to the ground.  The Hunter's HAND extends, his
         FINGERS puncturing the skin at the base of the spine,
         gripping the vertebrae.

         With otherworldly strength the arm pulls, the entire
         SPINAL COLUMN ripping free from the body, a sickly
         SNAPPING and POPPING of cartilage separating from bone
         and tissue.

         together in a tight circle, Ramirez and Billy facing
         outward in defensive positions, Anna, silent, watching.
         Schaefer is look at him.

         Ramirez looks up at Billy who continues to stare into
         the jungle, aware, catlike, reacting to every sound,
         his nerves on edge, as if ready to snap.  Ramirez
         rises, moves alongside his friend, Dillon watching
         closely.

         Billy looks deep into his eyes, chilling Ramirez to the
         bone, looking at his with eyes which have seen on an
         instinctual level what the others have so far only begun
         to sense.

         Billy turns away, moving a short distance away, taking
         up his position.  Dillon looks after him and then into
         the blackness of the jungle canopy.  Dillon speaks to
         Ramirez.

                  have to take down.

         Despite his words, there is an edge of doubt in his
         voice.  Schaefer returns.  He's overheard this exchange.
         He's holding the group of DOG TAGS taken from Davis' men.
         He holds them up for Dillon to see.

 110     INT. HUNTER'S SHIP - NIGHT                           110 

         CLOSE ON an oval CHAMBER made of an otherworldly looking
         metal with a strange copperlike patina, its interior
         bathed in INTENSE BLUE LIGHT.  In the chamber is
         Hawkins' SKULL CAP and SPINAL COLUMN still attached.

         The light field suddenly changes as all connective
         tissue, flesh and blood and drawn away from the bony
         structures with incredible force, disintegrating as they
         rush toward the sides of the chamber.

         The light changes in frequency to a dull glow as the
         Hunter's hands remove the GLAZED, POLISHED trophy from
         the chamber.  He turns, carefully placing it upon a
         GLOWING SURFACE.  He touches the trophy gently, feeling
         its texture, as a man might touch the hide of a big cat.
         He pulls his hand away and instantly an opaque FORCE
         FIELD covers the trophies.

                         (pause)
                  ...a real number ten night.
                  Remember Bro?  Only you and
                  me, the only one's out of the
                  whole fuckin' platoon who made
                  it out.

         His eyes probe the darkness, remembering.

                  ...we walked out on top of

                  to you, Bro...you were just

         He ponders this a moment.

 112     INT. HUNTER'S SHIP - NIGHT                           112

         A FORCE FIELD that permeates the jungle, becoming one
         with the trees and foliage.  The Hunter walks down a
         CORRIDOR of SOLID LIGHT, leading to an opening to the
         jungle.  As the Hunter reaches the doorway he changes
         from visible to invisible, moving on into the night.



 113     EXT. ENCAMPMENT - NIGHT                              113

         The mist has thickened, the night alive with a million
         JUNGLE SOUNDS.  The team members sleep uneasily, if at
         all.

         Mac, although weary, stares hard into the night,
         waiting, each small sound a potential enemy.  A LULL
         spreads over the jungle, animals and insects QUIETING.
         Mac tightens his grip on the Mini-gun.

         Billy awakens, peering into the night.  Nothing.

         Suddenly, a metallic CLICK, a POP, the SOUND of a
         warning flare rocketing into the canopy.  A moment later
         a brilliant FLASH as the flare burns, illuminating the
         camp.

         An echoing eerie SCREAM fills the night as a DARK SHAPE
         in the mist rockets through the undergrowth towards Mac.

         Mac spins, hauling the heavy gun around, just as
         something crashes into his upper body, driving the huge
         man into the foxhole.

         A desperate battle for life ensues, illuminated with
         the strobing light of the descending flare.  Mac's
         enraged SHOUTS and ROARS mingled with horrific SCREAMS
         fill the night.

         Mac's razor-edged KNIFE slashes in the light; BLOOD
         spatters his face as he attacks fiercely.

                                                      (CONTINUED)

 113     CONTINUED:                                           113 

         Schaefer and Ramirez rush at a crouching run towards
         the foxhole, their weapons ready.

         A tremendous climatic SCREAM from the foxhole AND THEN,
         SILENCE.  Schaefer and Ramirez approach, cautiously.
         Mac stands, his face and clothes drenched in blood,
         some of it his, his breath coming in rapid gasps.  He
         looks at Schaefer, whispering hoarsely.

                                 MAC
                  Got the motherfucker...

         As the flare breaks through the canopy, dying out in
         great flickering bursts, the man stare down into the
         foxhole.  A huge, jungle BOAR lies mutilated in a pool
         of blood, still quivering in the final throes of death.

         The flare dies out.

         Mac, shaking from adrenalin, breathing heavily, looks
         down at the dying animal.

                                 MAC
                         (incredulous)
                  A pig...just a fucking pig...

         Schaefer shines his TEKNA-LIGHT onto the boar, playing
         the light along its massive hulk, its razor edges tusks
         gleaming in the light.  Ramirez appears by his side,
         looking down at the huge carcass.

                                 RAMIREZ
                  Holy shit, Mac.

         Nearby, unnoticed by the men, Anna stoops, her hands
         still bound, picking up an MP-5 from the ground.  She
         turns, looking for an avenue of escape, running for
         the jungle.

         But the forest looks foreboding and sinister.  She
         stops, staring at the jungle, the moonlight reflected
         off leaves like a thousand eyes.  For a brief second
         she imagines she can see the Hunter's eyes, crashing
         towards her, the shifting patterns of light and dark
         making the jungle seem to strobe, like it is about to
         rush in at her.  She freezes, paralyzed by fear, by her
         memories of the attack.

         She drops the MP-5 to the ground.

         Back at the foxhole, Schaefer and Ramirez help the
         still shaken Mac from the hole.  Schaefer looks at
         Mac, at the huge gash across his chest.

                  Get a field dressing on that
                  right away.

         Suddenly he remembers, Anna.

                                 SCHAEFER
                  Where's the girl?

         They all turn, ready to move and then stop.  Coming
         forth from the shadows Anna appears, still frightened,
         seeking the security of the soldiers.

         From the darkness nearby, Billy's VOICE in a hoarse
         WHISPER.

                                 BILLY
                         (o.s.; urgently)
                  Major, over here.

         Schaefer turns, apprehensive, something in Billy's
         voice...

         He walks over to Billy, standing with a FLASHLIGHT
         pointing to the ground.  They see Blain's BODY BAG
         slashed open, covered in blood.  Ramirez appears.

                                 BILLY
                  The body...it's gone.

                                 RAMIREZ
                  Came in through the trip
                  wires, took it right out from
                  under our noses...

         Anna appears between Schaefer and Ramirez, staring down
         at the empty, blood-soaked body bag.  She looks up, into
         Schaefer's eyes.



 114     EXT. ENCAMPMENT - DAY (PRE-DAWN)                      114

         A patchy GROUND FOG covers the area.  Anna, in her
         foxhole, awakens, LISTENING to the rising SOUNDS of
         the jungle.  MONKEYS begin to forage, their noisy
         CHATTERING and SCREECHING filling the air.

         A BIRD flutters back to its nest; a CHAMELEON emerges
         onto a leaf, directly above Anna's head.

         Anna carefully extends her arm, allowing the lizard
         to crawl onto her, watching, fascinated as it changes
         colors.  She carefully places the chameleon back on the
         leaf, which changes color again, becoming nearly
         invisible.

         Near the empty PONCHO, Schaefer, Billy and Ramirez
         are examining the ground and the trip wire to the
         flare.  Billy stands, turns to Schaefer.

                                 BILLY
                  Boar set off the trip flare,
                  Major.  No other tracks.

         Schaefer kneels and examines the thin, well hidden
         WIRE.  He stands, looking around the camp.

                                 RAMIREZ
                  How could anyone get through

                                 RAMIREZ
                  Why didn't he try to kill one
                  of us last night?

         Schaefer looks at him.

                                 SCHAEFER
                  He came back for the body.
                         (pause)
                  He's killing us, one at a
                  time...

         Schaefer turns and looks at Billy, asking with his
         eyes for a viable explanation.

                                 BILLY
                  Like a Hunter.                                     *

         Schaefer stares at him, the words sinking in.  He           *
         looks up, reconstructing in his mind the possible           *
         events of last night, his eyes following the tree line,     *
         tracing the path of the intruder as he might have           *
         travelled through the trees and down to the ground.         *
         He looks up at Billy.

                                 SCHAEFER
                  He uses the trees.                                 *

         Billy and Ramirez stare up at the trees, a wave of fear     *
         passing through them...from the trees.  Schaefer turns,     *
         moving to where Dillon is guarding Anna, sitting on the
         ground.  Reaching down, Schaefer pulls her firmly to her
         feet, looking at her intensely.

                                 SCHAEFER
                  Yesterday.  What did you see?

         She stares back at him.

                  No more games.

         She looks at him a long moment, and then answers in
         English.

                                 ANNA
                  I don't know what it was.
                  It...

         Dillon does a double take.  Schaefer continues to look      *
         at Anna.  He wasn't surprised:  he knew it yesterday.       *

                                 SCHAEFER

                  Shit, you trying to tell me
                  Blain and Hawkins were killed
                  by a fucking lizard?  Don't
                  listen to her.  Its's a psych-job.

         Ignoring him, Schaefer takes her hands, drawing his

         She touches her pant leg, the stain is faded but still
         there.  Schaefer turns to Dillon.

                  If it bleeds, we can kill it.



 115     EXT. ENCAMPMENT - MORNING (LATER)                    115 

         Anna at the base of the rocks scans the jungle with
         binoculars watching the tree line.  Mac moves past her,
         uncoiling a trip wire linking up four CLAYMORE mines
         hidden at various points with leaves and foliage.  In
         a tree at the edge of the clearing, Billy tosses an
         uncoiling roll of wire to Ramirez who attaches it to
         a GRENADE, wedged it the crouch of a tree.

         Wires attached to GRENADES and CLAYMORE MINES lead off
         through the underbrush and trees leaving a long, unmined
         corridor leading from the camp and into the jungle.


         At the corridor's end, where the rocks merge with
         the jungle, Schaefer hauls down on a HEAVY VINE,
         straining with every ounce of strength, his muscles
         bulging, while Dillon takes up the slack of the vine

         around the base of a tree.  The vine is attached to a
         forty foot SAPLING, arcing closer to the ground in a
         gigantic bow with every pull, CREAKING and GROANING
         with tension.  With a last mighty heave, Schaefer draws
         the tree almost within reach, gesturing to Dillon to        *
         tie it off, who does.                                       *

                  got the chance.

         Ignoring him, Schaefer rapidly drags into position a
         NET crudely woven of differing sizes of vines, their
         LEAVES still attached.  He carefully begins to cover
         the net with leaves and debris.  Dillon watches him
         in growing frustration as Schaefer moves quickly,
         picking up a FRAMEWORK of STICKS he has tied together,
         a TREADLE-SPRING TRIGGER.  He holds up the framework,
         hurriedly examining his work before placing it on
         the ground.

                                 SCHAEFER
                  He'll be looking for the trip wires.
                  If we're lucky, he won't see this.

                  send your mystery guest an
                  invitation?

         Schaefer turns, there is a touch of fear in Dillon's
         eyes.

                                 SCHAEFER
                  You're catching on, Dillon.

         Schaefer returns to his work on the net and trigger.        *

 116     EXT. ENCAMPMENT - DAY (LATER)                        116 

         Morning passes.  Fog lifts as the sun creeps into the jungle.
         Insects swarm and are fed upon by BIRDS and other predators.

         At the entranceway to the rock outcropping, the net and trigger
         are hidden beneath the leaves, the framework of the trigger
         bulging with tension from the straining vine attached to the
         bent tree.

         At the other end of the corridor, several meters above the
         jungle floor, Schaefer and his team, heavily camouflaged,
         nearly invisible, lie hidden, waiting.  The team members, as
         if hypnotized by the BUZZING din, stare into the jungle,
         fixated, alert.

         ANNA while waiting at the net:

                                  ANNA
                         (hushed)
                  When I was little we find a man --
                         (she struggles for
                         the words)
                  -- like a butcher.  The old ones in
                  the village cross themselves and
                  whisper crazy things.  'Demonio,
                  cazador de trofoes...Only the hottest
                  times of the hottest years...'  Crazy
                  things...This year is grows hot.  And
                  we begin finding our men.  We find
                  them sometimes without their skin.
                  Sometimes...much, much worse.  Cazador
                  de trofoes...means the demon who takes
                  trophies.

         SLOW RACK TO Schaefer's face.  Ashen.  HOLD.  Suddenly an
         EERIE SILENCE moves over the jungle:

         He whips his face forward.  The silence is SHATTERED by a
         bird flapping from the brush.

         Schaefer sits back and scratches his head, frustrated and a
         little chagrined.

         Schaefer glares at him.  Turns to go --

         He stands and begins to move low to the ground toward the
         waiting snare.

                                                      (CONTINUED)

         Behind him, sighting down their well-hidden gun barrels, the
         others scan the jungle, alert for the slightest sound or
         movement, covering him.

         Schaefer reaches the trap, carefully skirting the trigger
         hidden beneath the leaves.  He reaches the end of the corridor,
         moving out into the jungle.  He moves further away from the
         others, the silence crushing down on him.  He stops and waits,
         sweat pouring down his face, his finger tightening on the
         trigger of his M-203, eyes scanning the jungle.

         He turns his back on the jungle, waiting.  Nothing.  He moves
         back towards the corridor, reaching the net, again waiting,
         listening, sensing.  Nothing.  He turns around, looking at the
         jungle one last time, his face measuring defeat and then, with
         carefully, measured strides, he walks back to the camp.

         Schaefer looks at Billy who shakes his head in puzzlement.
         Nearby, Dillon starts to rise.

         Suddenly, behind Schaefer at the end of the corridor,
         with a resounding SWISH and SNAP, the NET explodes off
         the floor of the jungle in a hail of leaves and sticks,
         rocketing upward into the treetops.

         Schaefer spins, the others leaping to their feet as
         they SEE the net as it tears into the treetops, a
         large struggling bulge trapped within as a long,
         unearthly TRILLING SCREAM ECHOES through the jungle.

         Schaefer and the others charge from the rocks towards
         the jungle and the bobbing net, their weapons ready.
         Anna remains behind, watching terrified from the rocks.

         They arrive under the net, raising their weapons to
         fire...but before they can fire the entire net
         EXPLODES into a flurry of leaves, twigs, vines, dirt
         and a FLASH of PULSATING CRIMSON.



 117     EXT. HUNTER'S HAND AND ARM - DAY                     117

         As the Hunter leaps from the net his WEAPON activates,
         his arm slashing out, severing a THICK LIMB of the
         spreading tree capony, entangled in vines.



 118     EXT. THE TEAM - DAY                                  118

         The limb CRASHES down from the trees, Schaefer, Dillon,
         Billy and Mac Diving for safety.  But Ramirez, following
         the Hunter's leap, SEES too late the pendular movement
         of the severed limb and is struck a THUDDING blow in
         the ribs, which lifts him off his feet, hurling him
         backwards like a rag doll, his shirt torn open,
         exposing a BLOODY WOUND.

         As Anna runs to Ramirez's side the others, still
         stunned, look upward, frozen in shock SEEING:  THE
         HUNTER, clinging to a side of a tree, flushed bright
         crimson.

         Dillis is dumbfounded, like the others, rooted to the
         ground staring upward.

                                 DILLON
                  What is God's name...?

         The Hunter utters an unearthly SNARL and HISS from his
         open mouth as an instant later his camouflage resumes
         and he vanishes from sight...a rapid, furtive movement
         through the trees.

         Mac OPENS FIRE with the M-60, the others joining in,
         shredding the foliage, but they know the creature is
         gone.

         With a SHOUT, Mac races into the jungle, in pursuit
         of the Hunter.

                  Mac!

         Schaefer hurriedly ejects the spent clip from the M-203,
         slamming in a new one.  He shouts an order to Billy.

                                 SCHAEFER

         He turns to run after Mac.  Dillon steps in front of
         him, putting his hand on Schaefer's chest.

                                 DILLON

         Dillon turns.  Picking up the spare MP-5, Schaefer
         tosses the weapon to Dillon, who grabs it with one
         hand.  They share a look, knowing this is farewell.

         Hefting both weapons at the hip he runs into the jungle
         after Mac.  Schaefer watches him leave.  He breaks and
         goes to Ramirez, attended by Anna and Billy, who is now
         sitting up, holding his ribs and gasping for breath.

         Moving through the underbrush HEARS a slight RUSTLING
         in the foliage.  Mac?  He strains to locate the source
         of the movement.

         He HEARS A SOUND, too faint at first it identify.  He
         listens.  Silence.  He hears is again, the SOUND of
         a VOICE, barely audible.  A VERY QUIET WHISPER.

         carefully parts the thick leaves and vines and enters
         a tiny opening.  He looks around, seeing nothing.

         Dillon points to an OUTCROPPING OF ROCKS, covered with
         VINES.

                  We both got scores to settle.

         Dillon silently disappears into the jungle, Mac
         watching him go.

         Mac makes his way toward the rock outcropping, working
         his way between the rocks and the vines.  He takes up
         a position and scans the jungle before him.



 121     DILLON                                               121

         moving quietly, his face intense, determined.  He
         stops and listens.



 122     MAC/ROCK OUTCROPPING                                 122

         straining to hear VAGUE SOUNDS coming from the jungle.
         He reaches out and grabs a VINE and carefully pulls
         himself forward into a better position.



 123     BACK TO SCENE/DILLON                                 123

         moving, searching.  He goes into a crouch.



 124     MAC/ROCK OUTCROPPING                                 124

         There is MOVEMENT in the undergrowth.  He begins to
         sweat.  He moves the safety to fire; reaches out and
         grabs another vine to pull himself forward.  Mac
         reacts in shock.

         The vine is alive!  Before he can move, the Hunter's
         HAND appears from the vines, grabbing Mac by the
         wrist.

         In the moment before he is killed, Mac turns and SEES
         the Hunter's glowing EYES.

         A FLASH as the Hunter's other hand, moves with
         blinding speed, Mac's face contorting in pain as the
         Hunter's razor-sharp SPUR rips deep into his throat.
         He falls forward into the leaves.



 125     DILLON                                               125

         He HEARS the faint disturbance in the leaves.  He
         pauses, turning in Mac's direction, listening.
         Hearing no further sound he relaxes, moving on.

         Anna in the lead, followed by Schaefer carrying Ramirez
         on his back.  Billy, carrying the RADIO is covering
         them from above, as they skitter and slide down the
         loose gravel of a rocky slope, leading to a river
         crossing.



 127     EXT. DILLON                                          127

         He stalks through a narrow corridor of tangled vines
         and moss, leading to the rock outcropping on the other
         side, his face alert, showing no signs of fear, his
         weapon ready.



 128     EXT. VINES AND MOSS - DETAIL - DAY                   128

         Through the thick tangle of undergrowth, there is
         MOVEMENT, a slight, undulating distortion, drifting
         through the hanging vegetation, as if cast by a
         passing shadow.



 129     DILLON                                               129

         Did he hear something?  He moves on.



 130     EXT. HUNTER'S P.O.V. - DAY                           130

         Behind Dillon and to the side of the corridor.  The
         Hunter syncopates him movements precisely with those
         of Dillon.

         Dillon stops.  The Hunter freezes in position.



 131     BACK TO SCENE/DILLON                                 131

         He does sense something behind him.  He crouches and
         spins, leveling the weapon.  The corridor behind him
         is empty, quiet and undisturbed.  He studies the trail
         intently.



 132     EXT. HUNTER'S P.O.V. - DAY                           132

         Peering out through the vines.  Dillon is looking
         directly at him.  Dillon turns, moves on, as the
         Hunter resumes his stalk, timing his movements
         perfectly with those of Dillon.



 133     BACK TO SCENE/DILLON                                 133

         as he approaches the rock outcropping.  He signals.
         Receiving no response he moves closer, turning
         cautiously to right and left.

                  Mac...Mac.

         He moves closer to the rocks, eyes probing.  Through a
         gap in the rocks he SEES Mac's face, staring up at him,
         eyes frozen wide in death.

         Dillon spins hard.  He stares at the solid wall of
         undergrowth.  He looks from one side of the corridor
         to the other.  Something it out there.  Where?

         Something in the vines has caught his attention.  He
         stares hard at a section of moss.



 134     EXT. MOSS - DETAIL - DAY                             134

         Suddenly the right combination of light and shadow
         prevail and Dillon SEES in an instant, the Hunter's
         EYES materialize and then disappear.



 135     BACK TO SCENE/DILLON                                 135

         With a growl and exhalation of breath, charges,
         bringing the weapon to bear.  A short BURST OF GUNFIRE
         erupts from the barrel.



 136     EXT. THE HUNTER - DAY                                136

         In an indiscernible blue of camouflage releases his
         weapon.



 137     DILLON                                               137

         SCREAMS, his arm instantly severed halfway between
         his shoulder and elbow.  The weapon drops to the
         ground, the forearm still attached, still FIRING.

         With his left hand he FIRES the second weapon
         SHOUTING INSANELY as swings it towards the blurred
         image of his unseen attacker, hitting nothing.

         The Hunter reloads his WEAPON which turns INVISIBLE
         again.  Dillon continues to fire.  The Hunter's
         weapon appears from below, cutting into Dillon's
         unprotected abdomen, which, as if hit by a samurai
         sword, bursts open.  Dillon CRIES OUT as the huge man
         hits the ground.



 138     EXT. LOG CROSSING - DAY                              138

         spanning the narrow gorge, Schaefer and Anna with
         Ramirez between them, move onto the log, preparing
         to cross.  They stop, HEARING Dillon's GUNFIRE.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

         Moving through the jungle with incredible speed,
         leaping, tearing from tree to tree, the jungle a rush
         of HEAT TRAILS as he charges on.



 140     EXT. LOG CROSSING - DAY                              140

         The jungle is still deathly SILENT.  Schaefer, Anna
         and Ramirez cross the log, moving onto the other side.
         Billy, still at the foot of the log, providing cover,
         turns to face the jungle.

         He lifts his head towards the trees, feeling the
         onrushing presence of the Hunter.  He shrugs off the
         radio letting it fall, smashing into the rocks
         below.

         He casts away his weapon.  Staring forward he reaches
         into his cargo pocket, withdrawing a small
         GREASE-PAINT TIN.  Covering his finger in BLACK
         PAINT he applies dark slashes under his eyes and
         again, vertically down his cheeks.  Taking another
         dap of paint he makes a SYMBOL on his bare skin, over
         his heart.

         He drops the tin, withdrawing his COMBAT KNIFE.  Holding
         the knife he grasps the MEDICINE BAG around his neck,
         yanking it free with a quick snap.  He wraps the
         leather thong around his hand and knife, binding the
         weapon and bag together.

         Staring outward, as if in a trance, he begins a low
         CHANT.

         On the other side, Schaefer carrying Ramirez on his
         back, laboring up the steep slope, nearing the top,
         turns and SEES Billy standing, waiting at the foot of
         the bridge.

                                 SCHAEFER
                         (screaming)

         But Billy stands at the foot of the bridge, knife
         raised, waiting, accepting his oncoming destiny.

         In frustration, Schaefer hikes Ramirez higher onto his
         back, digs in and sprints to the top of the hill, Anna
         waiting at the top.

 145     EXT. RIDGETOP - DAY                                  145

         Over the top, in a low depression, Schaefer props
         Ramirez against some rocks, reaching for his weapon.
         They HEAR Billy's echoing SCREAM.  Instantly their
         weapons are raised, cocked and ready.

                                 SCHAEFER
                  Get back, into the rocks!

         Schaefer sweeps Anna behind him as Ramirez struggles
         to his feet.  Together they back up, covering the
         ridgeline over which they've just come.

         Suddenly, from one side, near Ramirez, the Hunter
         bursts from the jungle, Ramirez, seeing the Hunter,
         spins raising his weapons to fire...

         Ramirez SEES the Hunter's onrushing face, still in
         camouflage, a montage of organic textures and colors,
         his yellow eyes burning.

         Whipping the MP-5 is the direction of the Hunter
         he is hurled backwards from the impact of the Hunter's
         weapon, his neck gushing BLOOD, the MP-5 flying
         through the air, landing in front of Anna.  She moves
         for the weapon...

         The Hunter, with unearthly speed, turns towards
         Anna, as Schaefer starts to spin, SEEING the Hunter
         about to strike as Anna dives for the weapon.
         Schaefer lunges kicking the MP-5 out of Anna's reach.

                                 SCHAEFER
                         (to Anna)

         Schaefer spins and FIRES, bullets THUDDING into the
         ground, the barrel arcing towards the Hunter as Anna
         stumbles to her feet running into the jungle.

         In a blur the Hunter spins back, hurling his weapon at
         Schaefer which slices through the wooden stock of the
         rifle, SPARKS FLYING as it severs the trigger guard
         and steel breech.

         The M-203 flies out of Schaefer's hands as the Hunter's
         weapon cuts deeply into his left shoulder, laying open
         the flesh.

         The M-203 hits the ground, where it lies broken in half,
         useless.

         Schaefer hits the ground and is rolling, up and running
         for his life, the Hunter charging after him.



 146     SCHAEFER                                             146

         crashes headlong through the jungle.  He leaps a fallen
         log, stumbles, struggles to his feet, running on pure
         adrenalin, his shoulder pulsing blood, his eyes filled
         with terror.

         Behind him he can hear the Hunter in pursuit, closing.

         Schaefer spins to look behind him, a wild desperate
         look on his face; he turns back, ducks an overhanging
         limb and lunges on.

         runs like a madman, the SOUND of the Hunter's FOOTSTEPS
         close behind.  He's losing ground.  He knows he's going
         to die.

         Schaefer SHOUTS.  Suddenly the ground before him
         COLLAPSES and he disappears from sight.



 149     EXT. CANYON WALL - DAY                               149

         In a shower of leaves, flailing arms and legs, Schaefer
         crashes through the trees at the canyon's edge, free
         falling into space.

         With a sickening IMPACT, he hits the branches of the
         first trees lining the canyon and falls, a hundred feet,
         through one canopy after another, desperately grabbing
         for limbs and branched to break his fall.

         He hits the bottom branches of the list line of trees,
         impacting crosschest on a large BRANCH, knocking his
         wind out.

         Semi-conscious, he hangs momentarily before he slides
         off, fingers digging into the bark, falling another ten
         feet into the swiftly moving river.



 150     EXT. RIVER - DAY                                     150 

         Weighted down by his boots and clothing, Schaefer
         struggles to stay afloat.  Gasping for air he ducks
         underwater, untying one of his boots.  He surfaces,
         fills his lungs and dives again, releasing the other
         boot.  He surfaces, strips off his shirt and pants and
         begins to swim towards shore, stroking with one arm.



 151     EXT. HUNTER'S P.O.V. - DAY                           151 

         As he nears the edge of the precipice from which
         Schaefer has fallen.  The Hunter in close pursuit does
         not hesitate but LAUNCHES himself off the cliff in
         a spectacular LEAP, streaking downward towards the tops
         of the trees that grow out from the canyon wall.

         The Hunter tears through the canopy of the first tree,
         the branches and leaves rushing past in a KALEIDOSCOPIC
         BLUR.

         The Hunter bounds off of one branch after another,
         moving through the trees as an expert skier might
         negotiate a series of downhill gates.

         The Hunter leaps free of one tree, bounds across twenty
         feet of open space to a large branch of a huge tree,
         affording a good view of the river below.  From his
         vantage point, looking down at the windening, slowing
         expanse of river, Schaefer is nowhere to be seen.



 152     EXT. SCHAEFER - DAY                                  152

         He is swept into a still FASTER CURRENT and is carried
         helplessly downstream.  Boiling WHITEWATER appears.

         Out of control he is swept through a series of rapids,
         pulling his further and further downstream until he is
         finally ducked into the undertow and hurled over the
         top of a six foot falls, driven deep underwater by the
         pounding force of the water.



 153     EXT. POOL AT BASE OF FALLS - DAY                     153

         There is no sign of Schaefer.  Precious seconds pass.
         Slowly, looking like a drowned rat, he surfaces, taking
         a feeble breath.  He is nearly finished, his energy
         sapped.  But the water is calm and a few strokes are
         enough to carry him near the shore.  His feet hit
         bottom.

         He tries to stand but pitches headfirst into the thick
         MUD SLURRY at the river bank.  With his last ounce of
         strength, he crawls, panting and gasping into a
         sheltered mud OVERHANG, collapsing beside the exposed
         ROOT-SYSTEM OF A DEAD TREE, his body completely covered
         in thick, gray MUD.

         Nearly unconscious, he raises his head and looks to the
         opposite side of the river, scanning the bank.  There is
         no sign of the Hunter.  He collapses in relief.  He's
         escaped.

         Suddenly, the Hunter impacts the water, throwing up a
         huge SPLASH.  He stands up in the waist deep water.  As
         the water streams off of his body, the chameleon effect
         rapidly changes, struggling to match the shifting color
         patterns of the shimmering water.

         His glaring yellow orbs stare directly at the spot where
         Schaefer lies helplessly trapped.

         The Hunter surges forward, relentlessly closing in on
         this prey.



 154     SCHAEFER                                             154 

         is frozen in terror, paralyzed with fear, his eyes
         locked ontothe incredible creature that is about to
         kill him.



 155     EXT. HUNTER - DAY                                    155

         Closing rapidly, another ten feet.  He leaves the water
         and walks through the mud, stopping, towering over
         Schaefer.

 156     EXT. SCHAEFER'S P.O.V. - DAY                         156

         As the Hunter's feet surge though the mud and stop,
         three feet away.



 157     EXT. SCHAEFER - DAY                                  157

         Realizing his life is about to end, closes his eyes,
         awaiting the Hunter's killing blow.



 158     EXT. HUNTER'S EYES - DAY                             158

         The fierce yellow orbs look downward.



 159     EXT. HUNTER'S P.O.V. - DAY                           159

         He's looking directly at Schaefer, EXCEPT HE CAN'T
         SEE HIM.

         He can clearly see the EXPOSED ROOT-SYSTEM, but because
         of the heavy mud blocking Schaefer's body heat, Schaefer
         registers in the Hunter's vision as merely an indistinct
         lump of clay, unrecognizable to the Hunter as a human
         being.

         He scans the bank, searching, looking for heat sources.

         Detecting none he moves on sounding a questioning TRILL
         several times.



 160     BACK TO SCENE/SCHAEFER                               160

         disbelieving that he's still alive, opens one eye,
         SEEING the Hunter's feet move away, his prehensile
         spurs dragging in the mud.  He rounds a bend and
         disappears, heading for the undergrowth.

         Astonished, he tries to raise up on his hands but a
         sudden jabbing pain in his shoulder causes him to
         collapse, falling onto his side, unconscious in the
         mud.



 161     EXT. RIVER - DAY                                     161

         As a HUEY ATTACK HELICOPTER breaks over the top of the
         ridge, diving forward, moving down the canyon.  The
         chopper flares up into a holding pattern.

         In the open doorway, a SOLDIER searches the top of
         the canyon with binoculars.  Seeing no sign of life,
         the chopper flies on, disappearing down the canyon
         rim.



 162     BACK TO SCENE/SCHAEFER                               162

         lies unconscious in the mud, the distant SOUND of the
         helicopter THRUMPING into the distance.

------------------------------------------------------------------------
                                                               86



 163     EXT. ANNA - DAY                                      163

         She runs into a clearing, stopping momentarily, gasping
         for breath.  She is startled by a sudden movement
         behind her.  She spins, looking.  There is nothing
         there.  She runs on.



 164     EXT. THE CANYON - DAY (DUSK)                         164

         Schaefer GASPS as his eyes bolt open in fear.  As if
         the Hunter were still attacking, Schaefer rolls to his
         feet and runs, slogging through the THICK MUD, stumbling,
         lunging forward, gasping for breath.

         Schaefer spins and staggers backwards into a shallow
         POOL, scuttling, crablike into the chest deep water.
         Schaefer backs into the moss-covered wall by the
         waterfall, looking for movement, regaining his senses.

         As the water settles, he looks down, SEEING the image
         of himself, reflected in the pool; his hair and face
         covered in THICK CLAY.  He stares, mesmerized at the
         image.

         He lifts his arm from the water, his fingers wiping the
         MUD from his face, exposing a PATCH of SKIN.  He studies
         the mud in his hand and then looks at the image of
         himself in the water, SEEING the exposed skin.  HE
         stares at it, a wave of realization rushing through
         his mind.  He places the mud back on his face, again
         looking at his image.

                                 SCHAEFER
                  You couldn't see me.

         He looks up, out into the failing light, at the treeline
         of the deepening forest, realizing that fate has given
         him a fighting chance.  Slowly a look of vengeance and
         hatred crosses over his face.



 165     EXT. CLAY BANK - NIGHT                               165

         Using his MACHETE he carves MAGNESIUM SHAVINGS from a
         fire block into a pile of KINDLING.  He removes a match
         from the hollow handle of the machete, also containing
         a coil of PIANO WIRE, GREEN TAPE and MEDICAL SUPPLIES.
         He lights the shavings which burn with a brilliant white
         light.  Schaefer shelters the fire with a banana leaf
         until the flame dies down.  He feeds the fire with more
         kindling, fanning it with a leaf.



 165-A   SCHAEFER - BOW AND ARROW MONTAGE - NIGHT (LATER)     166

         Holding a three foot section of FIRE-HARDENED sapling
         between his feet and shoulder, he scrapes the char
         from the seasoned wood with his machete.

                                                      (CONTINUED)

------------------------------------------------------------------------
                                                               87



 165-A   CONTINUED:                                           165-A 


         He bends the bow and attaches a long piece of PIANO
         WIRE to one end, carefully wrapping it for strength,
         using strips of green tape to cover the sides of the
         wire where the nock of the arrow will fit.

         He attaches split quilled FEATHERS with fishing line to
         an ARROW,  its tip fashioned into a series of barbs,
         rubbing them to a polished hardness against a smooth
         stone.  When finished he places the arrow on the ground
         next to three other identical arrows.


                                 SCHAEFER
                  One chance, that's all.



 166     EXT. CLAY BANK - NIGHT                               166 
 

         Schaefer is pounding a peeled root between two stones.
         He pauses to drool saliva into the pulpy mass.  He
         scrapes the milky substance onto a BANANA LEAF, mixing
         it with a sticky SAP, holding it over the coals until
         the mixture steams.

         Schaefer coats the arrow tips with the sticky poison,
         holding them over the coals until the sap bubbles and
         smokes.  He spins the arrows in his hands, blowing on
         the tips to cool and harden the mixture.

         Using the tip of his machete, he pries open the casing
         of one of the 40MM grenades, discarding the warhead.  He
         dumps the PROPELLANT POWDER from the shell onto a leaf,
         mixing that with a mound of MAGNESIUM SHAVINGS.

         He opens the narrow, tight roll of GAUZE taken from the
         first aid kit of the machete handle, fluffing it into a
         large, loose BUNDLE, the size of a baseball.  He pours
         the powder-mixture into the gauze, mixing it into the
         fabric.

         He transfers the ball of explosive ladened gauze to a
         pliable DRY LEAF, closing it into a bundle, binding it
         at the top with a long strand of jungle-grass.

         He twists the remaining gauze around a MATCH, leaving
         the head exposed, forming a self-striking FUSE.

         He coats the fuse with SAP and then thickly covers it
         with more powder from the 40MM grenade.  He pokes the
         fuse down into the leaf.  Taking a long strand of JUNGLE
         GRASS he makes a large loop, tying it onto the grenade,
         slipping the loop and grenade over his head.

                                                      (CONTINUED)

------------------------------------------------------------------------
                                                               88



 166     CONTINUED:                                           166 

         Finally, using several sections of BAMBOO of differing
         diameters, he fashions a crude, anti-personnel
         SPEAR-BOMB, a BANG-STICK like weapon, using the
         sharpened TONGUE from his belt buckle for a FIRING PIN
         and a 40MM GRENADE from his belt pouch as an explosive
         charge.



 167     EXT. RIVER'S EDGE - NIGHT                            167

         Schaefer appears, he has covered him entire body with a
         variety of CLAYS and OCHERS, creating a mottled, EARTHEN
         CAMOUFLAGE pattern.

         Holding his weapons in one hand, he moves up the canyon,
         ascending into a rising boulder field.



 167-A   EXT. BOULDER FIELD - NIGHT                           167-A

         Where the river flows into a series of falls and pools,
         surrounded by massive boulders and table top rocks,
         their crevices jammed with large amounts of DRIFTWOOD
         swept down at high water from the forests above.

         On a flattened section of rock, Schaefer drags a large
         section of BRANCHES INTO VIEW, adding it to a growing
         mound of FIREWOOD.  He kneels, tending to a pile of
         DRIES GRASS, LEAVES and other tinder.  Using the last of
         his precious matches, he sets fire to the tinder, gently
         coaxing the tiny blaze into a slowly consumming FIRE,
         flames starting to lick upward through the dry wood.

         He stands, staring into the rapidly growing blaze.  He
         turns, facing the canyon rim, raising his weapons in one
         hand.  From the depths of his soul, a SOUND emerges;
         primitive and visceral, as if from an animal in pain.

         He throws back his head and SHOUTS.



 168     EXT. CANYON RIM - NIGHT                              168

         A hundred feet below, Schaefer stands in the boulder
         field, his mud coated body bathed in RED FIRELIGHT,
         looking like a fierce, primitive warrior; a timeless,
         prehistoric sight, his long and WAILING CRY, ECHOING
         endlessly through the canyon.



 169     EXT. HUNTER'S SHIP - NIGHT                           169

         Backlit by the LIGHT of the open door, the Hunter's
         head, in three-quarter profile, his eyes gleaming, rears
         INTO VIEW, looking up at the sky, HEARING Schaefer's cry.

                                                      (CONTINUED)

------------------------------------------------------------------------

 169     CONTINUED:                                           169 

         Responding with a low HISS, he turns back, raising in
         one hand his weapon, in the other a U-shaped SHARPENING
         DEVICE.  As he passes the weapon through the device, it
         FLASHES into life, a deep, HARMONIC HUM emitted as the
         blade grows with energy, growing hotter, hotter and
         HOTTER with each stroke.  He draws the blade now WHITE-HOT
         through the device for the last stroke.  He lifts
         it, testing its balance, the WHITE-HOT blade
         illuminating his alien face.



 170-                                                 OUT     170-

 178     EXT. HUNTER'S P.O.V. - JUNGLE - NIGHT                178 

         Emerging from his camp, the Hunter swings into the
         nearby tree line, moving to the uppermost branches.
         The Hunter travels silently from tree to tree, arriving
         at the canyon rim where far below he SEES in the
         canyon, the BONFIRE, a leaping, shifting, multi-colored
         collage of HEAT WAVES and FLARES, luring him onward.



 179     SCHAEFER                                             179 
 
         hidden back within the deep notch of several large
         LOGS and broken trees, in the river canyon.  Below
         him, on the rock plateau, is the bonfire, illuminating
         in SHIFTING PATTERNS of LIGHT, the awaiting arena of
         destiny.

         His eyes shift, trancelike, moving from side to side,
         watching the approaches to the fire below.  His senses
         are alert; his nerves on a wire edge.



 180     EXT. HUNTER - NIGHT                                  180 

         His SHADOW-FORM descending through the canyon, a
         rippling movement of grays and blacks, passing through
         the shifting light patterns on the rocks, cast by the
         growing bonfire below.



 181     EXT. HUNTER'S P.O.V. - NIGHT                         181 

         His eyes probe the canyon, drawn to the swirling
         patterns of HEAT given off by the gaseous COMBUSTION
         of the bonfire.



 182     EXT. HUNTER - NIGHT                                  182 

         Continues on, moving silently down through the canyon.
   
------------------------------------------------------------------------
                                                               90



 183     SCHAEFER                                             183 

         sits motionless, nearly invisible in his mud camouflage
         amid the darkness of the logs.

         Suddenly, over the CRACKLING of the FIRE, the BUZZING,
         CLICKING of INSECTS, and the CROAKING of FROGS, suddenly
         CEASES.

         Slowly, painfully he draws the bow to full arch, his
         wounded shoulder trembling, the BLOOD beginning to seep
         through the bandage.

         The bow straining at full draw, Schaefer stares intently,
         concentrating, searching for the Hunter's form in the
         dancing light below.



 183-A   EXT. THE HUNTER - NIGHT                              183-A

         Like a giant insect, drops from above, fifteen feet
         above Schaefer, his steel-like spurs digging deep into
         the log.



 183-B   EXT. SCHAEFER - NIGHT                                183-B

         He freezes at the sound of the Hunter dropping, his
         eyes wide with fear.  The slightest movement will bring
         an instant attack from the Hunter behind him.  But to
         wait, his back exposed.



 183-C   EXT. THE HUNTER - NIGHT                              183-C

         Jumps from the log above and to Schaefer's left, onto
         a boulder, gaining a better vantage point of the arena
         and fire below.  He raises his weapon, his EYES
         glistening in the dim light, searching.  A quiet HISS
         emerges from his mouth.



 183-D   EXT. SCHAEFER - NIGHT                                183-D

         Spins and fires at the movement of the Hunter.



 184     EXT. ARROW - NIGHT                                   184

         Flies into the night, lodging into a BRANCH of an
         exposed tree, just missing the Hunter's head.

         In a blur, the Hunter's arm streaks downward, a dull
         flash of light leaving his fingers as he fires the
         weapon, the projectile STREAKING downward, EXPLODING
         into the log, inches from Schaefer, sending a SHOWER
         of wood chips and bark, flying in every direction.
   
------------------------------------------------------------------------
                                                               91



 185     SCHAEFER                                             185

         in a flash, is up and running, clutching his weapons,
         leaping from boulder to boulder.  He jumps down into the
         lighted area below, landing hard, rolling into the
         protective shadows of the rocks, putting the loping fire
         between he and the Hunter's position on the rocks above.

         He moves forward, darting to look backwards before
         leaping off the lip of the table rock into the boulder
         field below, a flat plane littered by weirdly shaped,
         water-erroded rocks, forming a giant stone AMPITHEATER.
         Shadows leap and dance across the boulders, cast by the
         bonfire from the plateau above.

         Schaefer crouches between two large boulders, quietly
         breathing through clenched teeth, feeling the pain of
         his now freely bleeding shoulder wound.



 185-A   EXT. HUNTER - NIGHT                                  185-A

         A nightmarish silhouette appearing for an instant on the
         rim of the plateau above.



 185-B   EXT. SCHAEFER - NIGHT                                185-B

         Over the SOUNDS of the FIRE and the softly flowing
         RIVER, distinguishes a NEW SOUND, one that brings fear
         and a savage determination to his heart:  the rhythmical
         CLICK-SCRAPE, CLICK-SCRAPE of the Hunter's feet, moving
         over the rocks, somewhere above him.

         Drawing back on the bow, Schaefer moves around the
         boulder to his left, heading towards the sound of the
         Hunter.

 198     INT. HUNTER. SOMEWHERE IN THE BOULDERS - NIGHT       198

         REVEALED in flashes of strobing light, pauses at the
         juncture of several towering rocks.

         He stands, erect, tilting his head slowly, turning it
         from side to side, his ears trying to orientate to the
         diversity of SOUNDS reflecting off the circular walls,
         enclosing the boulder field.



 199     INT. HUNTER'S P.O.V. - NIGHT                         199

         His vision, accustomed to another spectrum, has little
         available heat to register vivid images of the inert,
         lifeless forms of the stones.  He SEES instead, a world
         of soft, ill-defined shapes in a pale MAGENTA field of
         flickering heat.

 200     INT. SCHAEFER - NIGHT                                200

         Creeping forward, carefully placing one foot in front
         of the other, suddenly stops, hearing the CLICK-SCRAPE,
         CLICK-SCRAPE, now on his right.

         Starting to move in this new direction, he stops again,
         HEARING the sound now directly across from him.
         Listening, he hears the sound again from yet another
         direction, the sound ECHOING in the natural ampitheater
         of rock.

         Schaefer, uncertain of where to turn, waits.  Suddenly
         he crouches and freezes, HEARING the unbelievable SOUND
         of a HUMAN VOICE, softly echoing through the
         ampitheater.

                                 ANNA'S VOICE
                         (o.s.; filtered;
                         in Spanish)
                  Look out, behind you!!!

         Schaefer spins, his breath catching at the sound of
         Anna's voice.  Wide-eyed, straining, he waits, hearing
         only the muted FLOWING of water, the HISSING and POPPING
         of the dying fire above, the shadows growing longer,
         darker with each minute.

         And then again, Anna's VOICE.

                                 ANNA'S VOICE
                         (o.s.; in
                         Spanish)
                  ...Look out, behind you!

                         (to himself)
                  Anna...?

         Tracelike he moves towards the sound.



 201     THE HUNTER                                           201

         his head canted, throat distended, utters another
         mimicry.



 202     SCHAEFER                                             202

         moving towards the space between two boulders from which
         the VOICE seems to emanate.

         his ears now directed towards the SOUND of Schaefer's
         voice, his slowly approaching FOOTSTEPS, raises his
         weapon.



 204     SCHAEFER                                             204

         pauses before the opening of the passageway.  All is
         silent.  He hesitates to enter.  Listeneing.  He starts
         to move and then hears a NEW VOICE:

                                 HUNTER
                         (o.s.; Mac's
                         voice)
                  Dillon, over here...

         Schaefer, horrified at the sound of the dead man's
         voice, backs quickly into the space between a boulder
         and the high rock wall of the ampitheater.



 205     INT. HUNTER - SOMEWHERE IN THE BOULDERS - NIGHT      205

         His feet moving quietly over the rock, the shadow-light
         deepening with the dying fire above, closing in.



 205-A   EXT. SCHAEFER - NIGHT                                205-A

         Bow drawn, trapped against the rock, HEARING the sound
         of the Hunter approaching from the left, now the
         right, is helpless, not knowing where to fire, the
         Hunter's deadly strike only an instant away.

         Still holding the bang-stick in his bow hand, he
         carefully releases the draw on the string, reaching
         to his neck for the FLASH-GRENADE.  With painstaking
         care he removes the grenade from his neck.

         Focusing on the rocks before him and the still
         approaching SOUND, he reaches down with the grenade,
         gripping with his fingertips the matchhead fuse,
         placing it against the rocks at his side.

         With a sudden jerk of his hand he strikes and throws
         the grenade, snatching up the bang-stick with his
         good hand.

 205-A   CONTINUED:                                           205-A

         The matchhead SPUTTERS as the grenade flies through the
         air, an instant later a blinding, WHITE FLASH of light
         illuminates the ampitheater...

         In that instant Schaefer SEES above him and to his left,
         the HUNTER, poised on top of a rock, his weapon raised,
         about to strike!  Momentarily blinded by the flash of
         light, the Hunter's head recoils to the side.

         Darkness swallows the image of the Hunter, but in that
         second, Schaefer seizes his advantage, hurling the
         bang-stick spear.

 214     INT. THE SPEAR - NIGHT                               214

         It smashes into the boulder at the Hunter's feet.  The
         Hunter leaps as the grenade DETONATES, shrapnel tearing
         into his body.

         With a terrifying SCREAM of pain and anger, the Hunter
         clutches frantically at the WOUNDS in his neck and
         chest.  Another bloodcurdling SCREAM OF RAGE and the
         Hunter is gone.



 215     INT. WATERFALL - NIGHT                               215

         Cascades over the rocks, fed by a small stream running
         through the ravine.  A pile of BOULDERS breaks the
         falls, filling the area with an everconstant MIST.

         Schaefer appears, holding the bow and arrow, following
         the LUMINOUS BLOOD TRAIL of the Hunter over the rock.

         Moving behind the falls, Schaefer's body is briefly
         soaked by the water, the hardened and CAMOUFLAGE
         beginning to dissolve, running off his body.  He
         continues on, slowly, cautiously following the blood
         trail.



 216     INT. TABLE TOP BOULDER - NIGHT                       216

         Next to the flowing stream, surrounded by an open area
         of rock.

         Schaefer, smeared with blood and sweat, his clay and
         ochre camouflage partially washed away, climbs up a log
         onto the boulder.  Oblivious to the searing pain in his

         shoulder, he breathes in hot, powerful exchanges, his
         eyes wide and glowing with vengeance.

                                 SCHAEFER
                  Bleed, you bastard.

         His bow down, Schaefer follows the blood trail across
         the rock, edging alongside a huge vertical boulder.
         The blood trail stops.

         He takes another step forward, past a darkened ALCOVE...

         Schaefer spins, SEEING in the alcove the SURPRISED
         Hunter whirl and spring towards him...

         Schaefer in a bound closes the distance, savagely
         kicking the Hunter's arm.  The WEAPON flies from the
         Hunter's hand CLATTERING to the rock.

         Before he can recover, Schaefer follows with a karate
         kick to the chest, hurling the Hunter to the ground,
         his back exposed.

         In a flash, Schaefer is standing over the Hunter, the
         bow drawn, poised, the blood from his open wound
         dripping onto the Hunter's back.

         The Hunter slowly rolls onto his back, REVEALING his
         face, his eyes bleached white in shock from the loss of
         blood.  The Hunter's body, rippled out of control,
         trying desperately to orientate itself to the
         environment.

                                 SCHAEFER
                         (incredulous)
                  Who the hell are you...?



 217     EXT. HUNTER'S P.O.V. OF SCHAEFER - NIGHT             217

         Schaefer's body, looms over him, MOTTLED and STREAKED
         from his exposed skin, blood oozing from the shoulder
         wound, his eyes like black sockets in his almost
         skull-like face.  Seen from this perspective, Schaefer
         is a frightening, horrible visage.



 218     THE HUNTER                                           218

         shudders, GASPING hungrily for air, strugging to speak.
         From his throat, Schaefer HEARS the feeble, distorted
         efforts of the Hunter, at first garbled,
         incomprehensible and then, slowly, chillingly, taking
         on the timbre and quality of his OWN VOICE.

                  ...You?

         The Hunter's strength seems to fade even more...

         Then, suddenly, with the last of his diminishing
         strength, he lashes out with one arm, activating the
         lethal, razor sharp SPURS on his wrists.

         The Hunter's coiled leg kicks upward with incredible
         force, his terrible spur ripping into Schaefer's thigh,
         hurling Schaefer into the air, flipping him over,
         sending him crashing to his back into the shallow pool
         of water, momentarily losing his bow.  He flounders
         desperately in the water, searching for the bow.  He
         finds it just as...

         The Hunter rises slowly to his feet, GASPING desperately
         for breath.  He inhales deeply, hungrily, gaining
         strength with each breath.

         Schaefer looks from the pool to SEE the Hunter, raising
         his weapon to throw.

         In one totally instinctual movement, Schaefer draws
         back on the arrow to its very tip and fires.

         The arrow, with a deadly THUD, penetrates deeply into
         the Hunter's neck.  Another bloodcurdling SCREAM of RAGE
         as the Hunter clutches his throat, dropping his weapon.
         An instant later and the Hunter is gone.



 219     EXT. LOG BRIDGE - NIGHT (PRE-DAWN)                   219 

         Emerging onto a huge log leading to the rim of the
         canyon, Schaefer holding the Hunter's weapon, pauses
         several times, finding more traces of the Hunter's
         blood, the deep WOUND in his thigh flowing heavily.
         He continues across the log and climbs the bank,
         following the traces into the jungle.

 220     EXT. JUNGLE - PRE-DAWN                               220 

         Moving along the rim of the coulee, Schaefer follows
         the thick, orange blobs hanging on leaves and spent on
         the forest floor.

         Too weak to move through the trees, the Hunter has
         left a SWATH of trampled grasses, broken twigs and
         branches in his headlong retreat from Schaefer:  the
         Hunter turned Hunted.



 221     EXT. TWO ATTACK HELICOPTERS - DAY (PRE-DAWN)         221

         Powering upward from the canyon, the WATERFALL in the

         heading towards the island promontory.



 222     EXT. HUNTER'S P.O.V. - CAMP -PRE-DAWN                222

         Staggering into the clearing, bleeding severely.  The
         Hunter is rapidly losing his camouflage ability, his
         skin turning a PALE GREEN, flexing and pulsing in
         shock.  The glow of light from the ENERGY FIELD
         reflecting off the spreading apron of BLOOD flowing
         from his wound.

         With trembling hands he grasps the arrow and breaks
         it, pulling the shaft from his neck.  He screams in
         pain.



 223     EXT. GLEN - PRE-DAWN                                 223

         Schaefer follows the blood trail, deeper into the
         incredibly dense vegetation, ripping aside the heavy
         growth, plunging onward.

         Before him, covering a narrow passageway, is a huge
         SPIDER WEB, intricate, four feet across.  Schaefer
         starts to sweep aside the web.  With a sharp intake
         of breath, he halts, inches from the wed.  Something
         is wrong.

         Examining the web closer he sees not silken threads
         but a hard and shiny network of HAIR-FINE WIRE: A TRAP.

         He backs up, picking up a hefty branch from the ground.
         He swings the branch with a mighty heave, clenching
         his teeth in pain.  The branch sails end over end
         into the web impacting the strands.  A metallic SNAP
         is HEARD; a high-pitches WHINE and the log is violently
         severed, the pieces flying in opposite directions with
         great speed.

 223     CONTINUED:                                           223

         Schaefer runs on, again picking up the blood traces of
         the fleeing Hunter.



 224     EXT. HUNTER'S CAMP                                   224 

         At the edge of the site.  He SEES the Hunter staggering
         through the foliage.

         Schaefer starts after him but then stops, dumbfounded
         by the incredible images that crash in on him:
         TRANSLUCENT HUMAN SKINS stretched over frames, the hair
         of the attached scalps moving lightly in the wind;
         SKINNED BODIES, some lying on the ground, others hung
         from the trees, like Hopper and his men were.

         He turns back, SEEING the Hunter as he passes through
         the shimmering distortion of a FORCEFIELD enveloping
         the forest.  Within the force field he SEES the vague,
         nearly transparent OUTLINE of the Hunter's ship.

         He approaches it, wide-eyed, his senses reeling with
         astonishment and rage.

         From within the force field, a PASSAGE WAY of BLUE LIGHT
         appears, the Hunter's form backlit as he ascends the
         RAMP to his spacecraft.



 225-                                                 OUT     225-

 227     THE HUNTER                                           227

         as he passes his hand through a light BEAM, the ship
         instantly responds, as a low, TURBINELIKE HOWL is
         HEARD, building slowly in volume and pitch.



 228     SCHAEFER                                             228

         in his weakened condition staggers forward, looking
         up, SEEING the passage way of light diminish as the
         door begins to close.

         As rising HEAT WAVES begin to envelope the ship, the
         Hunter stares out at Schaefer, the heat waves
         increasing as the KEENING WHINE of the ship's drive
         builds.  He enters the force field, the door now
         inches from closing.

         On the ground, nearly obscured by the grass and leaves,
         Schaefer SEES the Hunter's WEAPON, lying where he
         dropped it in his desperate flight to escape.

         Schaefer grabs up the weapon and holds it.  How the
         hell does it work?...He squeezes the handle of the
         weapon feeling it resist.  Nothing happens.

         With the last ounce of his strength, and with a BELLOW
         of RAGE, his arm muscles bulging, he crushes down on
         the handle...

         In a FLASH of blue-white light, the weapon becomes
         ACTIVATED.

         Schaefer raises the weapon, sensing its power and
         function.

         In the final seconds before the door closes, Schaefer,
         with a triumphant SCREAM, fires the weapon...

         The weapon, flaring with deadly energy, drops and turns
         sideways, accelerating through the door and into the
         spacecraft.



 229     INT. SPACECRAFT - DAY                                229

         The weapon impacts the Hunter, his head EXPLODING in
         a fountain of orange blood and pale green tissue.

         The weapon continues on, burying itself into the energy
         field, bolts of plasma-energy begin arcing from the
         force field.

         Schaefer falls forward onto his hands and knees,
         staring at the Hunter's ship.  The SOUND of the
         hyper-drive continues to increase, as the ship begins
         to tremble.



 230     EXT. HELICOPTER COCKPIT - DAY                        230

         As suddenly the instrument panel goes wild, gauges
         spinning, digital readouts racing out of control.
         The SOUND of the turbine faltering, changing pitch.
         The pilot lurches forward with the stick, fighting
         for control.



 231     EXT. HUNTER'S CAMP - DAY                             231

         The multi harmonic whine of the Hunter's ship is
         still building as the ground begins to shake.

         Schaefer, realizing that the ship is going to explode,
         and ignoring the pain of his shoulder and leg, runs
         desperately, searching for cover.  He sprints for

         the edge of the clearing, diving over the embankment
         just as:

         A blinding purple FLASH blows the ship to pieces.



 232     EXT. HELICOPTER - COCKPIT - DAY                      232

         Enveloped in the flash of intense light.  CRIES of
         surprise fill the ship as the SHOCK-WAVE hits the
         chopper, heeling it hard over to one side.

         Below, the concentric waves of energy race outward
         from the center of the blast, an unearthly sight, like
         the miniature birth of a star.

         The helicopter suddenly regains control, its power
         restored.

                                 PILOT
                  Holy, fuck, what was

                  Orbit right...check it out!

         The helicopter levels out and heads toward the smoking,
         devastated site of the blast.



 233     EXT. HUNTER'S CAMP - DAY                             133

         The jungle has been completely transformed.  No longer
         lush and verdant, the area is clear-cut, two feet
         above the ground, covered in FINE WHITE, smoldering
         ASH.  Amongst the shattered stumps, debris from the
         ship, bright as magnesium flares, burns with exotic
         colors.

         If the f.g., Schaefer, a living dead-man, streaked
         with the alien ash, rises up from a shallow depression,
         staring dumbstruck at the site.

         Breaking in low over the treetops, the HELICOPTERS
         flare up into position, one preparing to land.

         As the chopper descends, the crew, standing in the
         door way, stare transfixed at the devastation, their
         eyes trying to penetrate the dense white smoke.

         As the helicopter slowly descends, its propwash creating
         a raging storm, Schaefer materializes from the SWIRLING
         SMOKE AND ASH, his features taking form as he
         approaches, his naked body covered in mud, blood and
         ash.

 234     EXT. SCHAEFER'S P.O.V. - LANDING HELICOPTER - DAY    234 

         As the chopper, emerging from the vortex, settles
         towards the ground where the spacecraft once stood.
         Through the distorted veil, the helicopter, bristling
         with WEAPONS, VISORED and HELMETED MEN, now covered
         with WHITE ASH, looks like a landing spacecraft.



 235     EXT. HELICOPTER - DAY                                235

         The door gunner swings the M-60 into firing position,
         pointing it at Schaefer.  He racks the bolt, loading
         a round.

         The crewmen look tense, frightened.

         Anna, standing next to the door gunner, stares at the
         strange creature before her, narrowing her eyes,
         uncertain.  Is there something familiar about the
         figure?



 236     SCHAEFER                                             236

         stands in the clearing, staring at the helicopter and
         the array of weapons pointed at him.  He looks dazed,
         like a man making contact with members of an alien
         race, for the first time.



 237     THE HELICOPTER                                       237

         hovers low to the ground, the tension inside building
         as Schaefer approaches.

         More weapons swing into position.  Fingers tighten on
         triggers.  Suddenly Anna recognizes the figure.
         Realizing the danger she holds up her hands, shouting

                                 ANNA
                  NOOOOOO!!!!!!



 238     EXT. HELICOPTERS - JUNGLE - DAY                      238

         Flash overhead, heading across the trackless jungle,
         their rotors THUMPING like heavy machine gun fire.



 239     INT. HELICOPTER - DAY                                239

         Schaefer, a blanket over his shoulders, still in the
         remains of his mud camouflage, his body laced with
         deep cuts; his chest and shoulder caked with dried
         blood, is seated on a bench in the cargo hold.

         Near the cockpit are General Philips, an ARMY MEDIC,
         two MACHINE GUNNERS.  They look at Schaefer in awe.

         The Medic, holding an open FIELD KIT, a syringe and
         bandages, turns to Philips.

                                 MEDIC
                         (shaking his head)
                  Looks like he's been through
                  hell...can't believe he's
                  still alive.  What the hell
                  went on down there?

                                 PHILIPS
                  If it hadn't been for her, he'd
                  be dead now.  That story she
                  told us...I still can't believe
                  it.

         He looks at Anna, her eyes meeting his, as if asking
         for an explanation.  She looks at him a moment before
         turning back to Schaefer, staring at him as if he were
         risen from the dead.

         She looks into Schaefer's face, Schaefer returning her
         look, recognition passing between them.  Anna extends
         her hand.  Schaefer slowly reaches out, touching her
         fingers, then clasping her hand.

         Schaefer turns his eyes to stare out the open door,
         beyond the passing jungle below, out to the heavens.

         He turns back, looking at Anna, a faint smile crossing
         his face...they made it.

   1     EXT. OUTER SPACE                                       1

         The infinite blackness punctuated by a billion stars.
         As we slowly DESCEND through the varied shades of blue
         of the Earth's atmosphere, we HEAR the first strains of
         a haunting, Central American FLUTE, joined by a swelling
         background of JUNGLE SOUNDS.  We descend further,
         through a lush JUNGLE CANOPY, backlit by a setting sun.

                                                      DISSOLVE TO:



   2     EXT. JUNGLE COASTLINE - DAY (MAGIC HOUR)               2

         Through a collage of shimmering HEAT-WAVES, a dark,
         OTHER-WORLDLY OBJECT drops INTO VIEW, backlit by the
         fiery, ORANGE-RED sphere of a setting tropical SUN,
         heading slowly towards us, floating, as if suspended by
         the rising heat of the jungle.

         Continuing to approach, the shimmering object resolves
         into a MILITARY ASSAULT HELICOPTER, its rotors strobing
         in the fading sunlight.  Drawing closer, the SOUND of
         powerful TURBINES, throbbing in the heavy air, becomes
         dominant, overpowering.

         Guided by COLORED SMOKE and LANDING LIGHTS, the chopper
         looms hard INTO VIEW, pitching forward and settling to
         the ground, kicking up a maelstrom of dust and vegetation



   2-A   INT. COMMAND POST - DAY (MAGIC HOUR)                   2-A  *

         Where a MAN wearing a military UNIFORM watches through
         the large open windows the helicopter as it continues
         to approach.  Before the skids have even touched down he
         SEES the first of the MEN, dressed in CIVILIAN CLOTHES
         but carrying full COMBAT GEAR, alight gracefully from
         the chopper, double-timing in close order to one side,
         the orders SHOUTED by one man lost in the ROAR of the
         chopper.

         The man turns away from the window, to a FIGURE, hidden     *
         in the shadows.

                                 MAN                                 *   
                  He's here.

         He turns back, lowering a BAMBOO SHADE, obscuring the       *   
         window.

   2-B   EXT. HELICOPTER PAD - NIGHT                            2-B  *

         On adjoining PADS, two other HELICOPTERS are VISIBLE; in
         the b.g. can be SEEN several concrete and THATCHWORK
         BUILDINGS, a secret command post disguised as a COASTAL
         FISHING VILLAGE.

         The post in a flurry of activity, AMERICAN ADVISORS
         shouting directions to dozens of LATIN AMERICAN SOLDIERS
         who stand by to assist the landing helicopter and to
         load EQUIPMENT into the other choppers.

         Inside the chopper, one man remains, stretched out against  *
         the bulkhead, as if asleep.  He stirs, sits up, lighting    *
         up a CIGAR.  With fatigue showing in his motion, he leans   *
         forward, descending to the ground.                          *

         A JEEP pulls to stop, the man swinging casually into the    *
         front seat, tossing his GEAR into the rear.  With a         *
         lurch the jeep heads out towards the command post.          *

         In the doorway TWO MEN solemnly watch as the jeep
         approaches.  Reaching the command post the man alights
         from the jeep, heading towards the two men.

         Into the pool of light cast by the fixture above the
         door steps MAJOR ALAN SCHAEFER, the team leader, 38, an
         intelligent and intense man.  He informally salutes,
         GENERAL H.L. PHILIPS, 55, hardened, close-cropped graying
         hair, his nameplate and insignia identifying him as a
         member of an elite commando unit in the U.S. Army.  He
         clasps Schaefer warmly on the shoulder.

                                 PHILIPS
                         (with affection)
                  You're looking well, Dutch.

                                 SCHAEFER
                  It's been a long time, General.

         They walk up the stairs, entering the palapa, leaving
         the other man on guard.



   3     INT. PALAPA - DAY                                      3

         Large, two room concrete floor, thatched walls and roof.
         Behind a partially drawn curtain in the kitchen, a naked
         lightbulb hung from the rafters illuminates a bank of
         compact FIELD RADIO EQUIPMENT, MAPS and AERIAL
         PHOTOGRAPHS.  Otherwise the rooms are primitive and
         stand out in stark contrast to this high-tech invasion.

         Philips and Schaefer enter the room.

                         (growing serious)
                  We've got a real problem here,
                  something right up your alley.

         They cross to the center of the room to a folding table,
         covered with a large TOPOGRAPHICAL MAP of the Central
         American highland jungle.  Philips leans over the table,
         circling a set of COORDINATES and a MARK on the open
         map.

                                 PHILIPS
                  Eighteen hours ago I was
                  informed that one of our
                  choppers, transporting three
                  presidential cabinet members
                  from this charming little
                  country, was shot down...
                         (point to
                         the circled
                         area)
                  ...The pilots radioed from the
                  ground that they were all
                  alive.  Their position was
                  fixed by the transponder
                  beacon onboard the chopper.
                         (points)
                  Here.

         Schaefer studies the map.  He looks up at Philips.

                                 SCHAEFER
                  That's over the border,
                  General.

                                 PHILIPS
                         (dead serious)
                  That's the problem.  Apparently
                  they strayed off course.
                         (pause)
                  We're certain they've been
                  captured by the guerrillas.

         Schaefer looks up, puffing lightly on the cigar.

                                 SCHAEFER
                         (quietly)

                  up with them.  After that,
                  there's not much hope.  We
                  want a rescue operation
                  mounted tonight.  That doesn't
                  give you much time.

         Another puff on the cigar.

                                 SCHAEFER   
                  What else it new?  When do
                  we leave?

         Philips looks at his watch.

                                 PHILIPS
                  You lift off in three hours.
                         (pause)
                  There's one other thing.

                                 SCHAEFER
                  What's that, General?

                                 PHILIPS
                  Someone else will be going
                  in with you.

         Schaefer stubbs out his cigar in an ashtray.

                                 SCHAEFER
                  You know we don't work with
                  outsiders, General.

                                 VOICE
                         (o.s.)
                  Who said anything about
                  outsiders, Dutch?

         Schaefer turns, SEEING the outline of a figure standing
         in the doorway of the communications room, holding a
         sheaf of PAPERS.

         Wearing pressed fatigues, DILLON, mid-thirties, black,
         walks into the room.

         Although as rugged looking as the others, his bearing
         and grooming indicate he's been away from the business
         of soldiering for sometime.  His quick intelligent eyes
         reveal his current profession.

                  Last time we danced, it was
                  Lieutenant, Schaefer.

         A grin breaks out across Schaefer's face.

                                 SCHAEFER
                  Dillon, you son of a bitch.

         The two men step forward and simultaneous swing from
         the hip as it to land a punch...but their hands SLAP
         together in a gesture of friendship, their forearms
         bulging, testing each other's strength.

                                 DILLON
                         (warmly)
                  How you been, Dutch?

         They continue the contest, Schaefer has the edge, forcing
         Dillon's arm slowly downward.

                                 SCHAEFER
                  You've been pushing too many
                  Pencils, Dillon.  Had enough?

                  No way, old buddy.

                                 SCHAEFER
                  You never did know when to
                  quit.

         They look into each other's faces, each remembering
         something from the past.  A moment's hesitation and they
         quit the contest.  They laugh, Dillon slapping Schaefer
         on the shoulder.

                                 DILLON
                  That piece of work you guys
                  pulled off at the Berlin
                  embassy last week was really
                  something.  Blew the entry
                  points on three floors and
                  neutralized the opposition
                  in eight seconds flat.
                  Beautiful.

                                 SCHAEFER
                  Like the old days, Dillon.

                  Also heard that you passed
                  on that little job in Libya.

         Schaefer looks at Dillon, quietly considering him.

                                 SCHAEFER
                  Wasn't my style.  We're a

                  Those cabinet members are
                  very important to our scope
                  of operations in this part
                  of the world.  They're about
                  to get squeezed.  We can't
                  let that happen.  I needed
                  someone who could get the job
                  done, quick and quiet...no
                  screw-ups.  I needed the best.
                  The best.  So, I pulled a few
                  strings at the State
                  Department...and here we are.

                                 SCHAEFER
                  Go on.

         Dillon goes to the map.

                                 DILLON
                  The set-up is simple, Dutch.
                  One day job.  We pick up their
                  trail at the chopper, run 'em
                  down, grab the hostages and
                  bounce back across the
                  border before anyone knows
                  we were there.  You've done
                  it a hundred times.  Nothing
                  out of the ordinary.

         Schaefer considers this.

         Philips breaks in.

                                 PHILIPS   
                  I'm afraid those are your
                  orders, Major.  Once you
                  reach your objective, Dillon
                  will evaluate the situation
                  and take charge.

         Schaefer looks from Philips to Dillon.  He still doesn't
         like it.

                                 DILLON
                  Not to worry, Dutch.  I
                  haven't lost my edge.  They've
                  got a head start on us in
                  some real tough country,
                  otherwise, believe me, it's
                  a piece of cake.

                  Gentlemen, we're losing time.

                  You'd better get your men
                  ready.

   4     EXT. TWO ASSAULT HELICOPTERS - NIGHT                   4

         Burst over the top of a ridge.  Rising up in silhouette
         they perform a radical left bank turn and descend
         rapidly into an adjoining valley, racing over the
         jungle at treetop level.

         As the helicopters perform dizzying, high-speed
         maneuvers through the winding canyon, the PILOT'S
         VOICES can be HEARD, coordinating their operations.

         The helicopters rise in perfect coordination over
         another ridge and bank sharply into the next valley,
         leveling out as they go.



   5     INT. HELICOPTER - NIGHT                                5

         Illuminated by the eerie red glow of NIGHT LIGHTS, are
         SEVEN MEN, dressed in jungle camouflage, soft hats and
         camouflage face-makeup.  They wear no identity badges
         or insignias.  The man are checking their WEAPONS,
         making last minute adjustments to their GEAR.

         The compartment reverberates with the NOISE of the
         THUMPING ROTORS and the ROAR of air from the open
         doors.

         BLAIN, weapons and ordinance specialist, a frightening
         bull of a man, a 240 pound killer, removes from his
         shirtpocket a think PLUG OF TOBACCO.  He looks across
         at:

         MAC, a huge bear of a man, black, holding am M-60
         MACHINE GUN.  Blain holds out the tobacco to Mac who
         refuses with a gentle shake of the head, a knowing
         smile, he knows what's coming.

         Holding the plug between his teeth Blain yanks free
         from his shoulder scabbard a wicked, ten inch COMBAT
         KNIFE.  Placing the razor sharp blade next to his lips
         he slices through the plug as if it were butter.  He
         chews throughtfully.

         Seated by the open doorway is RAMIREZ, a slight,
         angular man, an East L.A. streetwise Chicano.

         Adding a final piece of camouflage TAPE to his pack
         HARNESS, he looks up and smiles, faking a throw and
         the bulleting the tape to:

         HAWKINS, the radioman and medic, Irish, street-tough,
         reading a rolled-up magazine, as if he were a rush hour
         commuter.  He snags the tape with an instinctual snap

         of the wrist, continuing to read for a moment before
         looking up, grinning at Ramirez, his boyish, eager
         face belying the rugged professional beneath.  He
         turns his gaze to the man next to him:

         BILLY, the Kit Carson Scout, an American Indian, proud,
         stoic, a man of quiet strength and simplicity,
         carefully replacing the FIRING MECHANISM of his M-203,
         working its action several times.  He looks up with a
         smile at Hawkins.

                                 HAWKINS
                         (shouting)
                  Hey, Billy, how many marines
                  does it take to eat a squirrel?

         Billy looks back, shaking his head, uncomprehending.

                                 HAWKINS
                  Two.  One to eat it and one
                  to watch for cars.

         Hawkins laughs heartily at his joke.



   6     EXT. JUNGLE - NIGHT                                    6

         Clearing another ridge, the helicopters plunge into a
         steep descent, turning quickly into a DEEP-WALLED
         CANYON, the force of the turn accentuated by the
         changing PITCH of the screaming turbines and the
         biting of rotors into the air.

         The men, suspended in RESTRAINING HARNESSES from the
         bulkheads, lean forward, nearly upside down in response
         to the radical maneuver, handling the situation with
         ease.

         Blain holds out the tobacco to Ramirez, who swats at
         the offending object as if it were alive.

         Grinning, Blain proffers the plug to each man, each one
         refusing; they've done it a thousand times.  It's an old
         gag but they obviously care for the man in a big way.

                                 BLAIN
                  ...bunch of slack-jawed
                  faggots around here...

                  sexual ty-ran-toe-sore-ass...
                  just like me.

         This brings a chorus of HOOTS and SHOUTS from the others.
         The helicopter makes another radical turn.

         Schaefer and Dillon, seated near the cockpit, communicate
         through HEADSETS, also linked to the pilot.  They
         consult a TOPOGRAPHICAL MAP by RED PENLIGHTS.

   8     INT. COCKPIT - NIGHT                                   8

         The PILOT and CO-PILOT are surrounded by an array of
         dimly lit GAUGES and SWITCHES.  Before the Co-Pilot is

         A BLUE LIGHT appears on the forward bulkhead.  Schaefer
         is speaking over a RADIO TELEPHONE.  The Co-Pilot turns
         and hands him a clipboard.  Schaefer reads, notes his
         approval and hands it back.



  10     EXT. HELICOPTER - NIGHT                               10

         Flares up into position over the jungle and hovers, as
         the SUPPORT HELICOPTER holds in a protective position
         above.



  11     INT. HELICOPTER - NIGHT                               11

         Dillon seems comfortable with the men, showing Ramirez
         a battered CIGARETTE LIGHTER from a famed commando
         unit from the past.

         But his ingratiating demeanor is not impressing Mac, who
         regards Dillon with the cold suspicion reserved for an
         outsider.  Mac looks up at Blain, his eyes narrowing.

         Blain's massive jaws roll as he masticates the chew.
         He pauses, eyes moving downward, spotting his target.

         He hocks a thick, vile stream of TOBACCO JUICE directly
         between Dillon's legs and onto the floor, a gelatinous
         skein lacing across the toe of one boot.  Dillon looks
         up, his face goes cold and menacing.

                                 DILLON
                         (icy)
                  Man, that's a real bad habit
                  you've got.

         Dillon turns back to Ramirez, ignoring Mac and Blain,
         who continues to stare at him.  Mac looks across at
         Blain, wide grins breaking across their huge faces.
         Cradled in Blain's arms, as if it were a part of his
         body, is a large, CANVAS-COVERED BUNDLE.  Blain looks
         down at his bundle, almost affectionately.

         The PILOT's VOICE breaks in over Schaefer's headset.

                                 PILOT NUMBER ONE
                         (voice over)
                  LZ comin' up in 30 seconds.
                  Stand by the rappel lines.

         Looking up, Schaefer gives a hand signal to the nearest
         man who nods and in return,passes the signal down the
         line.

         Ramirez and Blain pick up heavy, METAL CONICAL DEVICES,
         attached to canvas bags filled with rope.



  12     EXT. HELICOPTER - NIGHT                               12

         From the open doors the RAPPELLING LINES hurtle into
         space, CRASHING through the double canopy of the trees
         and to the jungle floor below.



  13     INT. HELICOPTER - NIGHT                               13    *

         The blue light changes to GREEN.  Schaefer nods.
         RAPPELLING DEVICES SNAP into place.  Gloved hands grab
         onto rope.  Combat boots move into position.

                                 DILLON

         Schaefer signals.  Men leap from the chopper.



  14     EXT. JUNGLE - NIGHT                                   14

         The man crash through the trees and are swallowed up by
         the darkness below.  The helicopters depart, THUMPING
         their way into the night.

                                                      DISSOLVE TO:



  15     EXT. MOUNTAIN RIDGE - DAY (DAWN)                      15

         A light shower passes through the trees.  The sky
         clears, REVEALING a lush and exotic foliage.  Birds
         are beginning to SING but otherwise, all is SILENT.

         The dense growth seems impenetrable, but from a solid
         wall of undergrowth, a HAND appears and signals in a
         downward motion.

         As if by magic, the assault team materializes, quietly,
         cautiously.  Schaefer makes another gesture and the team
         moves forward in perfect harmony in POINT-LOCK step,
         taking their cue from Ramirez, the pointman.  Schaefer,
         highly focused and alert to every sound and movement,
         follows Ramirez, as if organically connected.



  16     EXT. JUNGLE HILLSIDE - DAY                            16

         Descending the steep mountain slope, the team encounters
         an even denser growth of jungle, at times moving by
         instinct, as they are often visually separated.  At one
         point, Schaefer checks his COMPASS, flashing some hand
         signals to Ramirez, indicating a new direction.  Ramirez
         nods and moves on, Schaefer signaling to the rest of the
         men.



  17     EXT. JUNGLE CLEARING - DAY                            17

         Blain, in a defensive position, sweeps the jungle slowly
         with his MP-5.  He steps back and turns, checking,
         revealing in the b.g. the WRECKAGE OF A U.S. ARMY UH-1H
         HELICOPTER, hanging upside down, twenty feet above the
         ground, entangled in vines in the heavy capony, badly
         damaged, rotors bent, its tail section blown away.

         A GRAPPLING HOOK is hurled from the ground, CLATTERING
         into the cargo hold, hooking the edge of the airframe.



  18     INT. HELICOPTER - DAY                                 18

         Ramirez moves cautiously, searching for trip wires,
         using his knife to check the edges of the seats and
         door frames.  Grimly he glances at the TWO BODIES
         slumped over the controls and then exits, snapping
         into and rappelling down the rope to the ground.

         He joins Schaefer standing in the f.g.  They look
         up, watching as Dillon moves through the cockpit,
         searching through pockets and compartments.  Schaefer
         turns his back to the helicopter.

                                 RAMIREZ
                  The pilots have each got one
                  round in the head.  And whoever
                  hit it stripped the shit out of it.

         Schaefer studies the clearing, eyes always moving, wary.
         He turns back, looking at the chopper.

                                 SCHAEFER
                  Took 'em out with a heat seeker.

                                 RAMIREZ    
                  There's something else, Major...

                                 SCHAEFER
                  Mmmnnn...?

                                 RAMIREZ
                  I don't think that was any ordinary
                  army taxi...

         Schaefer looks at him quizically.

                                 RAMIREZ
                  ...looks more like a surveillance
                  bird to me.

         Dillon rappells down the line and approaches.

                                 DILLON   
                  Have you picked up their trail yet?

         Schaefer taps Ramirez on the shoulder and he moves
         away.  Schaefer turns to Dillon:

                         (indicates chopper)
                  Heat seeker.  Pretty sophisticated

                  They're getting better equipped
                  every day.

         Bill approaches from the b.g.

                                 BILLY
                  Major, looks like there were ten,
                  maybe twelve guerrillas.  Looks
                  like they took some prisoners
                  from the chopper.
                         (points)
                  Then a different set of track,
                  over there.

                                 SCHAEFER
                         (puzzled)
                  What do you mean?

                                 BILLY
                  Six others, U.S. issue jungle
                  boots.  They came in from the
                  north, then followed the guerrillas.

         Schaefer turns to Dillon.

                                 SCHAEFER
                  Mean anything to you?

                                 DILLON
                  Probably another rebel patrol.
                  They operate in here all the time.

         Schaefer is obviously concerned about this.  He
         turns to Billy.

                                 SCHAEFER
                  Get ahead, see what you can find.

         As Billy reconnoiters, Ramirez looks back and gives a       *

         Schaefer nods and rappels down cliff.                       *

         Ramirez seems concerned by this.  Schaefer signals him to   *

         something dodgy about this.  He goes.                       *

  20     EXT. JUNGLE - OVERHEAD - DAY                          20

         As the assault team passes below, a BUTTERFLY lands on
         what appears to be the BARK of a TREE.  It fans its wings
         and flies on.

         The impression of the butterfly remains in PERFECT
         RELIEF, as is imprinted on the bark.  The image fades,
         REVEALING for an instant a gridwork of TINY SCALES on
         the bark.

         The bark moves!  Changing colors, like a chameleon,
         REVEALING for an instant the form of something alive
         as it flows into the leaves, once again becoming
         indistinguishable from the surrounding foliage.

         TWO EYES, faintly flowing yellow, appear in the
         foliage.  They blink, disappearing, and then become
         VISIBLE again.

         The SOUNDS of the FOREST are also ALTERED and ENHANCED

         The Observer scans over the men...and then focuses

         The hillside of a steep valley, dark and foreboding.
         Billy passes by and halts, removing his KNIFE.  With
         his other hand he pulls down from overhead a THICK VINE,
         severing it.  A thin stream of WATER emerges which
         he drinks.

         Suddenly he stops, letting the water drip to the
         ground.  He quietly releases the vine and brings his
         M-203 shotgun to bear, listening intently.  Something
         seems wrong.  He brings his eyes upward and stares,
         hard into the treeline of the opposing hillside.

         As his eyes strain to penetrate the dense, intertwined
         canopy, he is engulfed by the rising SOUNDS of the
         JUNGLE, a cacophony of BUZZING and CLICKING,
         amplified in the sweltering heat of the day.  Unable
         to locate a source to account for his anxiety, he
         relaxes, moving on, resuming the track.



  27     BILLY (MINUTES LATER)                                 27

         examines the ground as he moves, growing confused
         and puzzled by what he sees before him.  He stops,
         scrutinizing the jungle, probing the world around him
         with his keen senses.

         HEARING a faint RUSTLING SOUND he looks up, SEEING a
         curtain of MOSS several feet away.  He takes a cautious
         step forward, extending his weapon.  He reaches
         forward with his free hand, touching the moss.

         Behind the curtain a slight shifting of DARK FORMS
         occurs.  He pauses and then with a sudden movement,
         sweeps the moss aside...

         A BLACK EXPLOSION of FLUTTERING WINGS as carrion-eating
         BIRDS rush past Billy's body.

         Billy's face seizes into a mask of horror, his
         expression descending into a state of complete,
         primitive shock, his eyes staring transfixed, inches
         away from the leering death-grin of a HUMAN FACE,
         upside down, completely stripped of skin.

         Reeling, his body numbed by the sight before him,
         he stumbles backwards and stops.

         Vines threaded through their achilles tendons, the
         BODIES OF THREE MEN, skinned and gutted, hang
         suspended in the think, suffocating air, BUZZING
         with insects.

         Billy turns away, revulsed as Ramirez moves quietly
         INTO VIEW, Schaefer directly behind him.  Ramirez
         stares at the bodies, now seen to be in the first
         stages of deterioration, strips of flesh torn away
         by the birds and other scavengers.  In an almost
         childlike manner, he crosses himself.

                                 RAMIREZ   
                         (hoarse whisper)  
                  Holy Mother...

         Schaefer moves into the clearing, kneeling beside
         a bloody pile of CLOTHING and ENTRAILS.  He examines
         the clothing and then rises, holding a DOG TAG on
         a broken chain.  He reads the tag, his face growing
         hardened and bitter as he stares down at the tag,
         recognizing the name.

                                 SCHAEFER
                         (to himself)
                  J.S. Davis, Captain, U.S. Army...

         Schaefer's eyes move from the bloody dog tag to
         the bodies.

                                 SCHAEFER   
                         (coldly)  
                  Mac.  Cut them down.

         Mac moves forward, withdrawing his COMBAT KNIFE.
         The blade flashes, cutting the vine as the first
         body THUDS to the ground.  He bends over, picking up
         other DOG TAGS.

         Schaefer turns to Dillon.

                  I knew this man.  Green Berets,
                  out of Fort Bragg.  What the hell
                  were they doing in here?  You got
                  any answers for this, Dillon?

                  Uh...I wasn't told of any
                  operations in this area.  They
                  shouldn't have been here.

                                 SCHAEFER
                         (angry)
                  Well somebody sent them.

         Schaefer walks off.  Mac steps out of the clearing,
         sheathing his knife with a violent gesture, passing
         Ramirez.

                                 RAMIREZ
                         (seething)
                  Must have run into the guerrillas
                  ...Fucking animals.

         Mac moves alongside Blain.

                                 MAC
                         (spits)
                  Ain't no way for a soldier to
                  die.
                         (looks at Blain)
                  Time to let 'ol 'painless'
                  out of the bag.

         Grimly, Blain RIPS apart the velcro closures of the
         CANVAS BUNDLE slung across his shoulder, REVEALING
         a truly awesome weapon, a SIX-BARRELED MINI-GUN adapted
         for field combat.

         Kneels at the side of the original trail examining the
         ground.  He rises, holding a spent CARTRIDGE.  Schaefer
         approaches, kneeling beside him.

                                 SCHAEFER
                  What happened here, Billy?

         Billy looks at him, puzzled.

                  Strange, Major.  There was a
                  firefight.  Shooting in all
                  directions.

                                 SCHAEFER
                  I can't believe Jim Hopper
                  walked into an ambush.

                                 BILLY
                  I don't believe he did, Sir.
                  I couldn't find a single track.
                  Just doesn't make sense.

                                 SCHAEFER
                  What about the rest of Hopper's
                  men?

         Billy shakes his head.

                                 BILLY
                         (uncomfortably)
                  No sign.  They never left here
                  Major.
                         (pause)
                  It's like they just disappeared.

         Schaefer ponders a moment.  Then, to Billy:

                                 SCHAEFER
                  Stick with the guerilla trail.
                         (to team)
                  Let's get it over with.  We move.
                  Five meter spread.  No sound.
                  Nothing.

                                                      CUT TO:



  28-A   EXT. BLAIN - DAY                                      28-A

         Blain feeds the magazine of BELTED-SHELLS into the
         weapon, cocking it.  He looks up at Mac, his eyes
         cold, his face taut with anger.

                                 BLAIN
                  Payback time.

         Blain hefts the Mini-gun to his hip as Mac draws back
         slightly on the breech bolt of the M-60, letting it
         snap.

         They move on, Billy pausing to look at the jungle
         before disappearing into the foliage.

         carefully watching this exchange from high in the
         treetop canopy.  The Observer watches as Schaefer
         turns and leaves the clearing, cautiously moving
         into the jungle.



  30     EXT. JUNGLE HILLSIDE - DAY                            30

         Mac appears suddenly, materializing out of the
         undergrowth, pausing cautiously, his senses alert,
         intense, almost nervous.  He moves on, his huge body
         barely making a sound as he weaves through the heavy
         undergrowth.

         Dillon appears.  As he moves on, he crosses over a
         fallen TREE.  Stepping down, his foot breaks through
         a rotten portion, a CHUCK of the log breaking free
         and rolling down the hill.

         Dillon at once goes into a defensive position,
         listening.  The jungle is SILENT.  He stands and
         starts to move forward.  Suddenly Mac appears
         within inches of Dillon's face.  Mac's face is
         menacing, angry.

                         (hissing; barely
                         audible)
                  You're ghostin' on me, mother
                  fokaaa!...I don't care who
                  you are back in the world...

                         (hisses; spits)
                  Got it?

         Dillon's eyes are wide and fixed, staring back in
         cold hatred at Mac, controlling his rage...he knows
         the rules.

         Not waiting for a response, Mac turns and vanished
         into the jungle.  Seething with anger Dillon
         focuses on a still moving LEAF and STEM, indicating
         Mac's exit point.  He moves on.



  31     EXT. BLAIN - DAY                                      31

         Crouches under heavy foliage, waiting.  He is
         joined by Mac.  They glance briefly at each other,
         scanning in opposite directions for movement and
         sounds.  They speak in whispers.

                                 BLAIN
                  Say, Bull.  What's goin' down?
                  We got movement?

                                 MAC
                  No.  Shithead with his
                  trenchcoat and dee-coda-da
                  ring was makin' enough noise
                  to get us all waxed.  I don't
                  like that guy.  Don't like
                  him at my back.  I ain't
                  winding up like those
                  bastards back there.

         Mac, sweating heavily, wipes the moisture from
         his brow with his finger.

         Blain pats the mini-gun affectionately.

                                 BLAIN
                  I know what you mean, Bull,
                  but don't sweat it, me and
                  'ol 'painless' here are
                  watchin' the front door.

                  As always, bro...

         They do a gentle fist dap and smile warmly at
         each other.  Two men who have seen it all,
         through a dozen no-win situations, and have lived
         to tell about it.

         Mac advances a few meters and signals slowly.



  32     EXT. KNOLL                                            32

         The assault team moving up the hill, barely
         visible in the heavy foliage, the team moves
         cautiously into defensive positions.  Holding.
         A moment later they continue up the hill,
         crawling.

         On their stomachs, Schaefer and Ramirez clear
         the edge of the knoll, SEEING below a GUERRILLA
         VILLAGE, a huge, spreading PALAPA covering
         implacements dug into a hillside, descending
         to a winding stream bed below.  30 MEN, dressed
         in a mixture of jungle fatigues and civilian
         clothes, armed with AK-47 ASSAULT RIFLES move
         about the camp.  A heavy MACHINE GUN emplacement
         guards the entrance to the camp.  TWO MEN sit
         in the camouflaged emplacement.



  33     SCHAEFER                                              33

         sweeping the camp with BINOCULARS, SEES a
         GUARD above the camp.  One of the man picks up
         a hand-held ROCKET LAUNCHER, placing it beside
         a bandolier of ROCKETS and a RADIO SET and
         CONSULS taken from the U.S. surveillance
         helicopter as if preparing to take them away.

         Schaefer puts down the glasses, looking at
         Ramirez who nods in acknowledgment.  A sudden
         MUFFLED CRY brings Schaefer's attention to one
         end of the camp, where a heavily thatched DOOR
         covers and opening to the PALAPA.  A GUARD
         stands at the door.

         The door flies open as a HOSTAGE, shirtless,
         hands tied behind his back, staggers through
         the door as if kicked from behind.

         The man falls to the ground, feebly trying to regain
         his footing.  Although difficult to see from Schaefer's
         vantage point, the man's battered face and welt-covered
         back indicate he has been severely tortured.

         Emerging from the palapa, a GUERRILLA LEADER,
         moustached and wearing a SIDEARM, approaches the
         beaten man, kicking him viciously in the stomach,
         rolling him to his side.

         Kneeling beside the man he withdraws an AUTOMATIC from
         his holster and cocks the hammer.  Grabbing the man by
         the hair he jams the muzzle into the man's ear and with
         a violent twist, pulls the trigger.

         The guerrilla leader stands and strides quickly back
         to the palapa, still holding the pistol, closing the
         door behind him.



   34    SCHAEFER                                              34 

         grim-faced at having witnesses the murder, lowers him
         glasses, a look of cold determination on his face.
         Quickly he and Ramirez ease down the escarpment,
         joining the other team members.

         Schaefer makes a circling motion with his thumb
         and the team members gather in close, huddle formation.

                                 SCHAEFER
                         (whispering; angry)

  35     EXT. BLAIN AND MAC - DAY                              35

         Crawl silently through the underbrush.  With nearly
         impreceptible movements, Blain slips out of the
         cartridge pack, ditching the Mini-gun.  He withdraws
         his COMBAT KNIFE, placing it between his teeth.

         They move through the underbrush in tandem, like
         two bug cats, stalking.  Mac freezes, the sweat
         pouring from his face, holds up his hand as Blain
         stops.

         Using a BLADE OF GRASS, Mac points out a metal TRIP
         WIRE, following it to a hidden CLAYMORE MINE.  Blain
         grins making a switching GESTURE.  Carefully Mac
         detaches the LEAD WIRES.  Directing the mine towards
         the camp, he reattaches the wires, nodding at Blain.



  36     EXT. JUNGLE - OVERHEAD - ALTERED P.O.V. - DAY         36

         SEEN THROUGH HEAT-SEEKING VISION, FOCUSED ON Blain
         and Mac, lying in the grass below, their bodies
         outlined in LUMONOUS AUREOLES.  The Observer SEES the
         NETWORK of TRIP WIRES guarding the approaches to the
         machine gun nests.  The wires GLOW as if ELECTRIFIED,
         standing out in hard-edged relief in contrast to
         the jungle foliage.  He moves higher into the forest
         canopy.



  37     EXT. BILLY - DAY                                      37

         On Schaefer's signal rises up, pulling a SENTRY to
         him, covering his mouth with his hand, jerking him
         backwards and to the side, knocking him off balance
         with a sweeping motion of his left leg, killing him
         with his COMBAT KNIFE.



  38     EXT. SCHAEFER - DAY                                   38    *

         Belly crawls silently through the tall grass just
         outside and above the main entrance to the camp.  He
         stops, studying the ancient, rusted skeleton of a
         TRUCK parked on a level spot above the camp, its
         engine quietly IDLING.  The truck is jacked and
         blocked up, one rear wheel attached to a belt-drive
         leading to a PUMP, drawing water from a river nearby.
         In the open cab of the truck a GUARD is on duty,
         watching the high ground above the camp.

         Schaefer moves out, heading for the guard.



  39     EXT. MACHINE GUN EMPLACEMENT - DAY                    39

         While one Guerrilla attends to his equipment, the
         OTHER attentively watches the approaches to the camp.
         He is momentarily distracted by a BUZZING FLY, which
         he annoyingly swats at with his hand.

         He hears something to his side.  Turning to investigate,
         the huge, hamhock fist of Mack smashes into his throat.

         Simultaneously, Blain rises up behind the other man,
         grabs him by the hair, pulling him down, his COMBAT
         KNIFE driving downward.

  40     EXT. TRUCK - DAY                                      40    *

         A SATCHEL CHARGE is looped over the gearshift lever,
         resting on the floorboard.  Schaefer, lying low
         across the seat of the truck, turns and looks, SEEING
         the guard, lying in a heap in the foliage.



  40-A   EXT. RAMIREZ - DAY                                    40-A  * 
  
         Moves into position to the side and above the camp.
         He carefully checks the readiness of his SIX-SHOT
         GRENADE LAUNCHER, also setting his MP-5 in front of
         him, ready for action.



  41     EXT. SCHAEFER                                         41    *   


         Crouched to the side of the truck, watches the camp,
         SEEING below through the dense undergrowth, Ramirez,
         barely visible, signaling.

         Before him are two FRAGMENTATION GRENADES.  He looks
         at his watch, and then up the hill to:



  41-A   DILLON AND HAWKINS                                    41-A  *

         their weapons ready.  Dillon picks up his binoculars,
         focusing on the machine gun emplacement, seeing a MAN,
         his face covered by a HAT.  The head rises, REVEALING
         the face of Blain, who looks above the camp and
         slightly nods.  Putting his glasses down, motions
         to Hawkins.

                                 DILLON
                         (to Hawkins)
                  Ready, kid?

         Hawkins grins back.  Together they slip through the
         grass, downward towards the edge of the camp.

         Holds his huge, COMMANDO MACHETE on a diagonal,
         pushing through the belt, slicing it cleanly.  Turning
         he crawls silently to the rear of the truck,
         positioning himself behind the rear of the one ton
         truck.

         He squats, and with an enormous, concentrated effort,
         deadlifts the rear of the truck, its rusted springs
         and frame beginning to CREAK and GROAN slightly.

                                                      (CONTINUED)

         With a herculean effort he lifts the truck free of
         its blocks and then pushes forward.  He rolls aside,
         disappearing into the ground cover as the truck, its
         tireless rims digging into the earth, lops down the
         hill, slowly picking up speed.



  45     EXT. GUERRILLA VILLAGE - DAY                          45

         A Guerrilla, alerted by the SOUND of the approaching
         truck, looks up at the hillside, SEEING the vehicle
         still moving down the hill at a moderate roll.  He
         CALLS OUT and several Guerrilla leaves their posts,
         moving out to prepare to stop the truck.

         The truck rolls into the clearing picking up speed,
         heading towards the main palapa.  The men rush
         forward, surrounding the truck, trying to slow it
         down, but the truck rolls, SMASHING through the front
         wall of the palapa.  The men gather around truck
         and then look back up the hill.



  46     EXT. ALTERED P.O.V. - DAY                             46    *

         Watching as Schaefer pulls the pin and launches the
         GRENADE into the air, the Observer following its
         arc as it spirals dead-center into the camp, bouncing
         twice before rolling into the FUEL DUMP...which a
         moment later, EXPLODES into an incredible FIREBALL.

         The expanding FIREBALL released from the explosion
         is to the Observer like an erupting sun, momentarily
         blinding him.



  47     EXT. GUERRILLA CAMP - DAY                             47

         The truck is BLOWN up into the air by the explosion...
         a moment later the satchel charge DETONATES with an
         ear-splitting EXPLOSION, tearing the truck apart.



  48     EXT. SCHAEFER - DAY                                   48

         Jumps to his feet, FIRING an M-203 round into the
         camp.



  49     EXT. KNOLL - DAY                                      49

         Schaefer races down the hillside, joined by Dillon,
         leaving Hawkins to cover them.  Bullets burst around
         their feet as they run low, firing short bursts to
         his left and right.

         He FIRES the undermounted GRENADE LAUNCHER, sending a
         round into a gun position in the trees.  Still running
         he breaks open the breach, slamming in another 40mm
         ROUND from the cartridge pack at his waist.

         Blain and Mac fire the heavy machine guns, laying down
         a withering curtain of lead, shredding the camp,
         taking out five Guerrillas at once.



  50     EXT. GUERRILLA CAMP - DAY                             50

         A MAN almost completely ON FIRE is hit by an onslaught
         of GUNFIRE, ripping him back into the jungle.

         Ramirez cuts loose a barrage from the SIX-SHOOTER...
         seconds later the MACHINE GUN IMPLACEMENT erupts in
         a series of EXPLOSIONS, blowing two Guerrillas into
         the air.

         At the HILLSIDE HUT, two Guerrillas move into position
         by the window, drawing down on Schaefer as he appears,
         racing down the hill.

         As they are about to open fire, Dillon appears,
         YELLING OUT a warning.

                                 DILLON
                  On your nine!!!

         Schaefer dives, hitting the ground as Dillon OPENS
         FIRE taking out the Guerrillas.  Schaefer rolls to
         his feet, spins, firing the 203 grenade launcher,
         completely destroying the hut.



  51     EXT. ALTERED P.O.V. - DAY                             51

         As the Observer regains its vision an eerie, surreal
         experience of sight and sound unfolds:

         BULLETS streak through the air, leaving blood-red
         trails of HEAT, like laser blasts.  As they impact
         into the Guerillas, we HEAR the enhanced SLAPPING
         of BULLETS, SEEING tiny blossoms of HEAT mushroom
         out of their bodies.

         We HEAR the horrific, deformed CRIES and SCREAMS
         of the dying men.

         Another searing, blinding EXPLOSION sends pieces of
         SHRAPNEL ripping through the air, some of them
         ROARING past the Observer's position, like tiny
         meteors.

  52     EXT. GUERRILLA VILLAGE                                52    *

         at the entrance way to the main palapa, a Guerrilla
         stands in the doorway, giving COVER FIRE to his comrades
         as they fall back inside.

         Jumping from the roof of the adjoining palapa, Billy
         drops directly in front of the Guerrilla.

         From the side, unseen by Billy, another Guerrilla           *
         thrusts out with a knife, Billy ducking backwards, the
         tip of the knife SLASHING his face.  With a lightning
         move, Billy whips his arm up and around the Guerrilla,
         locking his elbow, breaking the joint.

         Still holding the man he FIRES, blowing the other
         Guerrilla off his feet with the SHOTGUN portion of his
         weapon.  He looks at the Guerrilla out of the corner of
         his eye.  He suddenly strikes, breaking his neck,
         dropping him in a heap.

         Billy continues on, racing down the stairs, firing the
         M-203.

         Meanwhile, Blain is crouched next to a tree, providing      *
         cover.  Behind Blain, at the edge of the camp, circling
         around from below, TWO GUERRILLAS appear and FIRE a
         grenade round which EXPLODES behind Blain, fragments
         ripping into the tree next to which Blain is standing,
         bark and dirt flying as shrapnel rips into his vest, one
         piece tearing into his upper shoulder.  The hits have
         no effect on the huge man and with a savage GROWL, he
         spins, opening fire, raking the two attackers with the
         Mini-gun.

         Nearby, Mac charges from the jungle on a dead run,
         diving over a fallen tree as machine gun FIRE rakes the
         ground around him.

         Blain, spotting the sniper high in a tree, opens FIRE
         with the MINI-GUN, shredding the tree, sending the
         Guerrilla crashing down through the roof of the
         palapa.



  53     INT. PALAPA - DAY                                     53

         The sniper CRASHES through the roof, landing on the
         floor near Hawkins and Ramirez who do a quick double
         take before opening fire on a group of fleeing
         Guerrillas, taking out two, giving chase to the others.

  53     CONTINUED:                                            53

         Schaefer and Dillon appear at the top of the staircase,     *   
         Schaefer freezing as he SEES below a Guerrilla raising
         an AK-47, preparing to fire.  Schaefer tackles Dillon,
         the two men hurling into the air, a moment later BULLETS
         ripping into the CRATES behind where they were standing.

         Dillon rises up, kicking over a crate, shooting the         *
         Guerrilla who is trying to bring the gun around to fire
         at him.

         Schaefer crouches, covering the upper entrances to the      *   
         palapa, as Ramirez rushes past, joining Schaefer.  From
         the corner of his eye, Schaefer catches a movement.
         With a whipping, backhanded throw, he lets fly his
         COMMANDO MACHETE...

         The machete impales the attacking Guerrilla, driving him    *   
         backwards, pinning him to a post.

                                 SCHAEFER
                  Stick around.

         Schaefer and Ramirez run towards the lower levels, side
         by side, firing as they go.

         They reach a door, Schaefer taking out an ATTACKING
         Guerrilla.  Ramirez grabs the side of the door, shoots
         a look to Schaefer and throws it open.  With Schaefer
         covering him, Ramirez takes a quick peak inside and
         then rushes into the room.

         

  53-A   INT. ROOM - DAY                                       53-A

         At one end is a STAIRWAY, leading to an escape door.
         A Guerrilla, seen from the waist up, scrambles down
         the stairs.

         At the base of the stairs, a Guerrilla, holding an
         AK-47 on his hip, turns and starts to fire.

         Schaefer and Ramirez respond with full AUTO BURSTS
         which rip into the Guerrilla, spinning him around,
         knocking over a crude WOODEN TABLE, scattering a
         BRIEFCASE with burning PAPERS, FOOD CANS, and LIQUOR
         BOTTLES.

         As he spins he FIRES the weapon, an arcing line of SLUGS
         slamming into the tin roof, sending down a shower of
         rust and dirt.  He falls to the ground.  Dead.

  53-A   CONTINUED:                                            53-A

         Ramirez charges through the DUST and thick SMOKE to
         cover the fallen men; Schaefer following close behind,
         jerking a new CLIP from his ammo belt.

         Suddenly, another Guerrilla erupts from behind some
         ammunition crates, drawing down on Ramirez with a
         machine pistol.

                                 SCHAEFER
                         (shouting)
                  Down!!!

         As the Guerrilla fires, Schaefer smashes the butt of
         his empty weapon into the Guerrilla's shoulder, knocking
         the gun aside, the SLUGS thudding into the wall
         harmlessly.

         He hits the Guerrilla with a vicious glancing blow to
         the head with the barrel of his weapon.  The Guerrilla
         is hurled backward, crashing into the wooden crates and
         to the floor.

         Ramirez, recovering quickly, descends the stairs with
         catlike agility, disappearing.

         Schaefer crouches and spins, jamming a new clip into the
         rifle, scanning the palapa for any other movement.  He
         races to the main door of the room, shouting into the
         palapa.

         He SEES Blain charging down the steps.  Catching his
         attention he signals him on, out the back to cover
         Ramirez.

                                 SCHAEFER
                         (to Hawkins)

                  hook!  Position and situation,
                  now!

         As Blain runs down the stairs, Hawkins already has the
         radio off his back, setting up the portable SATELLITE
         DISH ANTENNA.

                                 HAWKINS
                  You got it, Major!

         Ramirez, Blain and Billy race down the back stairs
         of the palapa, FIRING Mini-gun, automatic and grenade
         rounds at the escaping GUERRILLAS as they flee the area,
         splashing, charging across the shallow river.

         The guerrillas are history...in no uncertain terms.



  53-C   INT. PALAPA - DAY                                     53-C

         For the first time, Schaefer studies the interior of
         the cavernous palapa, SEEING the enormous stockpile
         of WEAPONS, EQUIPMENT and SUPPLIES stacked along the
         walls, obviously a major military stronghold hidden
         deep within the mountains.  Mac hustles up to Schaefer,
         a look of urgency on his face.

                                 SCHAEFER
                  Any sign of the hostages?

                         (nods)
                  We found 'em both, dead.

                  Another thing, Major, we were
                  lucky...couple of those guys
                  we waxed are Russians,
                  military advisors by the look
                  of it.  Something big was
                  about to happen here.

         Schaefer looks at Mac a moment, a flush of anger
         beginning to show.

                                 SCHAEFER
                  Good work, Mac.  Clear the
                  area, no traces.  Get the men
                  ready to move.

         Schaefer goes back into the room, looking down at the
         unconscious guerrilla, racking a round into the
         chamber, reloading his weapon.

         He kneels, staring into the FACE of a WOMAN, ANNA,
         dark, late twenties.  Despite her blood and
         dirt-smeared face, she is beautiful.

                  Shit...

         He checks her pulse and then slowly he bends to pick
         up her PISTOL, ejecting the clip.  He stands, beginning
         to shuffle through the PAPERS scattered about the room.
         Staring at one he looks up, the pieces falling together.



  54     EXT. JUNGLE - DAY                                     54

         Ramirez, at a crouch, runs through the jungle,
         following the obvious signs of the Guerrilla's
         retreat.  He emerges from the trees into an opening,
         leading to a sheer rock cliff, towering fifty feet
         above the ground.  Scanning the wall, he SEES
         movement and quickly takes cover, as automatic
         FIRE rips up the ground before him.



  54-A   EXT. ROCK WALL - DAY                                  54-A

         Near the center of which a narrow cut, two feet
         wide, leads to the top of the cliff, giving access
         to the adjoining ridge.

         Two Guerrillas scramble up through the chimney,
         assisted by a ROPE, which with withdraw as they
         reach the top.  Ramirez takes out one man, the
         other taking cover, returning fire.



  54-B   EXT. BASE OF ROCK WALL - DAY                          54-B  *

         Blain joins Ramirez, behind cover at the foot of
         the cliff.  As they take cover, Ramirez notices
         the wound on Blain's shoulder.

                                 RAMIREZ
                  You're hit.  You're bleedin',
                  man.

         Blain looks briefly at the wound.

                                 BLAIN
                         (spits)
                  Ain't got time to bleed.

         On a signal, they both clear cover and fire LONG
         BURSTS from their weapons up the cliff.

  54-B   CONTINUED:                                            54-B

         The smoke is hardly cleared when they are answered
         by withering FIRE.  They duck down as a grenade
         EXPLODES nearby.  Ramirez quickly replaces the 40MM
         rounds into the SIX-SHOOTER.

                                 BLAIN
                  Son of a bitch's dug in like

                  ...jack us around all day.

                                 RAMIREZ
                  Hell, dude, we don't have all
                  day.

         Ramirez immediately rolls into the line of fire,
         BLASTING six RAPID-FIRE shots on a HIGH-ARC trajectory
         towards the rocks.  Blain reacts.

                                 BLAIN
                  Shit, Pancho!!!

         Blain dives against the protective cover of the
         rock wall, covering his head.  Ramirez casually
         hops across, squatting next to Blain.  They make
         eye-contact.

                                 RAMIREZ
                  What's your problem, dude?

         Before Blain can answer, Ramirez puts his fingers
         into his ears and grimaces just as...

         The entire hillside EXPLODES, blowing the Guerrillas
         into the air, a torrent of vegetation and earth
         raining down the cliff, obscuring Blain and Ramirez.



  55     INT. PALAPA ROOM - DAY                                55

         Schaefer is staring out the window, his weapon slack
         in one arm, still holding the paper.  Dillon enters,
         obviously excited about what he has found.  He sees
         the papers on the floor.  He reads through them
         quickly, growing even more excited.

         Schaefer turns, striding slowly to Dillon, handing him
         the paper he is holding.

                                 SCHAEFER
                  I think this is the one you want.

         Dillon reads it.

                         (reacting)
                  Two days...that's all we had.
                  In two days, three hundred of
                  these bastards would have been
                  equipped with all this.  After
                  they crossed the border, it
                  would have taken a year to

         anger flaring in his eyes.

                                 SCHAEFER
                  I'm getting my men out of this
                  damn jungle, Dillon.  She's
                  your baggage.  You fall behind,
                  you're on your own.



  56     EXT. GUERRILLA VILLAGE - DAY                          56

         Schaefer and Billy are kneeling on the ground near the
         trailhead, studying a MAP.  In the b.g., the team, hidden,
         covers the hillside approaches to the camp, nervous and
         wary, weapons ready.

                                 SCHAEFER
                  This place is too hot for a pick-up.
                  They won't touch us until we're over
                  the border.  We can lift at LZ 49,
                  here.
                         (points to map)
                  Spotter plane says we're cut off.
                         (points to map)
                  Except for this valley.

         Billy shakes his head, following the CONTOUR LINES of
         the rugged terrain.

                                 BILLY
                  Looks bad, Major.  It's gonna be
                  a real bitch.
                         (points to map)
                  If we follow above the river and
                  then down, here, at this canyon,
                  we might find a way out.

         Schaefer turns to Ramirez, kneeling close by.

                                 SCHAEFER
                         (decisively)
                  Not much choice.  Pancho, take
                  the lead.  Double time it.

         He turns and looks at Dillon, Anna as his side, her
         forehead bandaged, her hands bound in front of her.
         He turns back to the others.

                                 SCHAEFER
                  Lock n' load, watch your ass.

         Blain moves out, swinging the Mini-gun in front of him
         as he goes.

  56-A   EXT. OBSERVER'S P.O.V. - DAY                          56-A

         Watching as Dillon leads ANNA onward, SEEING her bound
         hands.  Dillon pushes her.



  57     EXT. ANNA - DAY                                       57

         Spins, hurling a string of insults to Dillon in
         SPANISH.

                                 ANNA
                         (in Spanish)
                  You touch me again, pig, and
                  I will cut off your balls!

                                 DILLON
                         (in Spanish)
                  It's a long walk back, make it
                  easy on yourself.

         She spits at him, turning forward with a twist of
         her head.

         Dillon picks up his back, shouldering it.  As they
         move on, Mac calls out to him.

                                 MAC
                         (quietly)
                  Hey, Dillon, over here.

         Dillon doesn't respond.

                                 MAC
                         (louder)
                  Dillon, over here.

         Dillon turns and approaches, warily, holding
         the girl.

                                 DILLON
                  Yeah, what is it, Sergeant?

         MAc unsheathes his knife.  He gives Dillon a cold
         look and turns him by the shoulders.  Crawling
         across the PACK on Dillon's back is a huge SCORPION.

         Mac skeweres the scorpion with the tip of his
         blade, holding it before the wincing Dillon.  Anna
         smirks, nodding to the writhing, stinging insect.

                                 ANNA
                         (in Spanish)
                  When my people catch you,
                  you'll wish you were him.

                                                      (CONTINUED)

  57     CONTINUED:                                            57

         Dillon looks at Mac.

                                 DILLON
                  Thanks.

                                 MAC
                         (coolly)
                  Anytime.

         Mac flings the scorpion to the ground, crushing it
         with his boot.  He looks up at Dillon, walks away.
         Dillon follows, pulling Anna behind him.

         Billy, guarding the rear, glances furtively around
         the clearing.  He moves a step forward and stops,
         freezing.

         Slowly he turns back, his eyes riveted upon the
         treeline above the camp.  His eyes strain, his
         senses registering a fear he cannot name or see.

         Something is out there, in the trees, waiting,
         watching.

         Billy turns and walks into the jungle, pausing
         one last time to look behind him before he too
         disappears from sight.

         The jungle GROWS SILENT.



  58     EXT. OBSERVER'S ALTERED P.O.V. - DAY                  58

         LOOKING DOWN from his vantage point TO the treeline
         below, terraces like stepping stones, FOCUSING ON
         a TREE, fifty feet away.

         The Observer utters a LOW TRILL and springs outward
         into space, hurtling downward towards his landing
         point, the canopy of the trees approaching in a
         staccato rush of green.

         The SOUNDS of the FOREST are again altered and
         enhanced with an electric, STATIC-LIKE quality as
         the Observer descends fluidly through the trees
         and to the ground.

         He enters the camp, surveying the terrible
         destruction and carnage.  He SEES the dead
         Guerrillas, the dissipating heat from their bodies
         leaving them pale and GHOST-LIKE, as if fading
         light about to extinguish.  He sees their weapons,
         the cold hard steel of the barrels registering
         ICE BLUE in his vision.
   
------------------------------------------------------------------------
                                                               42



  58-A   EXT. OBSERVER'S P.O.V. OF HIS HAND - DAY              58-A

         As it appears, pulsing in a pale magenta heat, low
         to the ground, holding his weapon.  He lays down
         the weapon, picking up the SCORPION, turning it
         slowly in his fingers, examining it.  It looks like
         an exotic flower, its color fading from sight,
         turning to BLACK.

         A low SOUND is uttered, something vaguely familiar
         about it:  A NEARLY HUMAN VOICE, a distorted
         imitation of Mac.

                                 HUNTER
                         (o.s.; filtered)
                  Dillon, over here.

         Again the phrase is uttered, improving, closer to
         Mac's inflection and accent.

                                 HUNTER
                         (o.s.)
                  Dillon, over here.

         The Hunter lowers the pitch.

                                 HUNTER
                         (o.s.)
                  Dillon, over here.

         The last effort is a chilling simulation of Mac's
         voice.



  59     EXT. OBSERVER'S HAND - DAY                            59

         Drops the scorpion and picks up the weapon which
         changes instantly back to the Observer's skin tones.



  59-A   EXT. OBSERVER'S P.O.V. - DAY                          59-A

         He turns and focuses on the area where the team
         left camp.

         He crouches and springs to the lower branches of a
         tree, grasping them with his clawed, three-fingered
         hands, pulling himself up and through the branches
         with astounding speed and simian-like dexterity; his
         spurred prehensile feet, grasping and thrusting him
         to a vantage point, fifty feet above the ground.

         As he moves on, the jungle grows suddenly QUIET, as
         if aware, sensing that the HUNTER is now stalking, no
         longer observing!!!

------------------------------------------------------------------------
                                                               43



  60     EXT. JUNGLE VALLEY - DAY                              60

         The twilight world of a PREHISTORIC FOREST, filled
         with gigantic plants and towering trees, overgrown
         with vines and creepers.

         The team, with Billy at point, walk alongside a
         wandering STREAM BED, weirdly illuminated by SHAFTS
         OF LIGHT, streaming through openings in the trees,
         as if from spotlights, a hundred feet above.

         It is midday, hot and humid, the air BUZZING with the
         sounds of insects, the CRYING of birds and monkeys.
         The men are moving fast and quiet, straining to see
         into the dense jungle, aware of every sound, sweating,
         quietly slapping at biting insects.



  61     EXT. GIANT HARDWOOD TREE - DAY                        61

         Lies across their path.  As the man climb over a
         rotten section, Mac stops to assist Blain with his
         Mini-gun.

                                 MAC
                  I've seen some badass bush
                  before, but nothin' like
                  this, man.
                         (pause)
                  Little taste 'o home?

         Blain nods and pauses to rest, looking around him
         as Mac withdraws a small silver POCKET FLASK.  He
         takes a nip, passing the flask to Blain who also
         takes a sip.

                                 BLAIN
                  I hear you bro, this is some
                  shit.  Makes Cambodia look
                  like Kansas.  Lose your way
                  in here, man, you be in some
                  kinda hurt.

         Blain hands back the flask, Mac replacing it inside
         his vest.  They do their hand dap, looking warily
         behind them before they move on.



  62     EXT. ANNA AND DILLON - JUNGLE - DAY                   62

         Have fallen behind, Dillon looking worriedly ahead
         at the them out distancing them.  Anna is keeping
         her pace purposefully slow.  She trips on a root
         falling to the ground.  She lies there, motionless.
         He quickly reaches down to haul her to her feet.

                                 DILLON
                         (urgently)
                  Shit.  Come on...

         Like an uncoiled spring, Anna turns, flinging a
         handful of DIRT into his face, momentarily blinding
         him.  She lunges for his rifle with her bound hands.

         Suddenly the BARREL of an MP-5 is thrust into her face.

         Looking up she SEES Ramirez, calmly holding the weapon
         on her, the look in his eyes indicating he'd hove no
         trouble shooting her.

                                 RAMIREZ
                         (in Spanish)
                  Don't try it.

         She looks back at Dillon, wiping the dirt from his eyes.
         She moves on.  Ramirez gives him a cold look as Dillon
         hurries past.

                                 RAMIREZ
                         (coolly)
                  You should put her on a leash,
                  Agent Man.  If you can't handle
                  her, just say the word.

         Dillon moves on, ignoring Ramirez, who turns, scanning
         the jungle behind him before moving on.  Dillon catches
         up with Anna, turning her sharply by the chin.

                                 DILLON
                         (cold; in Spanish)
                  Try that again.  Please.                           *

         She looks at him contemptuously, undaunted.  She will
         try it again.  She breaks away from his grasp and
         moves on, Dillon watching her go, he won't hesitate
         next time.



  63     EXT. HUNTER'S P.O.V. - DAY                            63

         As he travels, directly overhead, timing his movement
         with those of the team.  He moves lower, closer to
         the slowly moving humans.



  64     EXT. RIVER BED - DAY                                  64

         The team moves cautiously through the winding stream
         bed, now wearing their clothing in various stages of
         disarray for comfort, sweat dripping from their bodies.

         Billy, in the lead, picks his way along the riverbank,
         his concentration rapt, aboriginal.  His face a
         trancelike mask of expectation.

         Blain, cradling the heavy Mini-gun as if it were a
         toy, swings the weapon relentlessly across his field
         of view.  He pauses to adjust the hanging, belted
         loop of cartridges trailing from the back pack
         magazine.  An INSECT lands on his face and is trapped
         in the grease paint near his lips.  He draws the
         hapless bug into his mouth with his tongue and quietly
         spits it out, his concentration unbroken.

         Mac follows, holding the M-60 high across his chest.

         Schaefer, bent, cautious, his feet moving aside the
         dry leaves on the ground, heel to toe and on foot
         edges.  He glances around, checking the team's
         position and progress.

         Hawkins follows, his mouth open, breathing deeply,
         exhausted, the radio a 60 pound demon.

         Anna, struggling to climb a section of the stream
         bank, slips on some loose dirt.  Unable to assist
         herself with her hands tied, she nearly falls.
         Dillon prods her with his rifle, forcing her to
         her feet.  She scrambles up the bank, Dillon following.



  65     EXT. RIVER BANK - DAY                                 65

         As Billy enters a small clearing, bordered on one
         side by the towering trees, carpeting the
         mountainside.  High above in the thick, impenetrable
         treeline, brightly colored birds SQUAWK loudly,
         chasing each other from branch to branch.

         Suddenly Billy stops.  Schaefer holds up his hand
         and the team freezes in position.  An eerie SILENCE,
         like a slowly falling curtain, descends over the
         jungle until even the BUZZING and CLICKING of insects
         have CEASED.



  66     EXT. TEAM MEMBERS - DAY                               66

         Sensing an ambush, move quietly into the foliage.
         Dillon moves into the undergrowth, dragging Anna
         with him.  He slings his MP-5 over his shoulder,
         withdrawing his KNIFE.  Grasping Anna by her shirt
         collar and pushing her to the ground he holds the
         weapon near her throat.  Dillon signals to Ramirez          *
         who approaches.  Dillon hands Ramirez the knife.

                  Watch her.

         Before Ramirez can respond, Dillon slips into the
         undergrowth.  Ramirez holds the knife on Anna,
         cautiously scanning around him for movement.

         Unseen by Ramirez, Anna's outstretched hands slowly
         tighten around a stout ROOT-BURL, lying loose on the
         ground.



  67     EXT. BILLY - AT THE RIVER BED - DAY                   67

         He remains frozen and transfixed, staring into the
         treeline.  Something is moving, fluid, silently and
         downward, into the forest.  Billy remains rooted to
         the spot, lost in concentration.



  68     SCHAEFER                                              68

         sensing something very wrong with Billy, moves alongside
         Mac.

                                 SCHAEFER
                  What's got Billy so spooked?

                                 MAC
                  Can't say, Major...been
                  squirrely all mornin'...
                  fuckin' weird...sometimes
                  I think that nose of his is
                  too good...smells things that
                  ain't there.

         Schaefer signals for Mac to cover him and then moves low
         and quiet towards Billy.  Dillon appears, looking to
         Mac for an explanation.  Mac ignores him, concentrating
         on the jungle.  Dillon looks forward at...

         Billy, his eyes riveted to the capony above, as he
         unconsciously reaches to his throat, grasping a LEATHER
         POUCH, secured to his neck by a thong.  He fingers the
         MEDICINE BAG talisman.



  69     EXT. HUNTER'S P.O.V. - DAY                            69

         As he slowly descends through the trees, moving
         towards Billy, who's eyes search the treeline for
         movement.

  70     BACK TO SCENE/SCHAEFER                                70

         approaches Billy, gripping his shoulders and in a
         hoarse whisper, speaks his name.

                                 SCHAEFER
                  What is it...?

         Billy, rigid, does not respond.  Schaefer forcefully
         jerks his around to face him.

                                 SCHAEFER
                  Billy...What the hell's wrong
                  with you?

                  Something...in the trees...



  71     EXT. HUNTER'S P.O.V. - DAY                            71

         Still closing in on Billy.  Billy turns back, looking
         high into the trees, puzzled and frightened.  He's
         lost sense of the Hunter's presence.  He lowers his
         vision, looking towards the Hunter, now on the ground,
         30 yards across the clearing from Billy.  The Hunter
         pauses.



  72     BACK TO SCENE/BILLY AND SCHAEFER                      72

                         (points)
                  ...there?

         Schaefer stares hard at the jungle.

                                 SCHAEFER
                  It's...nothing...



  73     EXT. HUNTER'S P.O.V. - DAY                            73

         Moves behind a broad fern, skirting around Billy
         and Schaefer, heading away from the column.



  74     BACK TO SCENE/BILLY AND SCHAEFER                      74

         Schaefer shakes his head, continuing to stare into
         the jungle.  He turns to Billy.

                                 SCHAEFER
                  What do you think...?

         Billy turns, a puzzled look in his eyes.  He nods
         in agreement.

                                 BILLY
                  It's nothing...



  75     EXT. ANNA AND RAMIREZ - DAY                           75

         Sensing the danger has passed, Ramirez releases his
         grip on Anna.  As they start to rise, Ramirez sheaths
         his knife and unslings his MP-5.  Anna still stares
         hard into the jungle.

         Suddenly, without even looking, Anna with the trained
         reflexes of an experienced fighter swings the BURL with
         all her might, catching Ramirez hard on the side of the
         head, just above the eye, opening a wicked gash.
         Spinning around she knees him brutally in the groin.
         As Ramirez goes down, doubled over in pain, Anna turns,
         scrambling up the embankment, running for the jungle.

         Ramirez CRIES out.



  76     EXT. SCHAEFER - DAY                                   76

         HEARING Ramirez' cry, Schaefer signals to Hawkins to
         move.  Hawkins moves out, fast, heading towards the
         sound...



  77     EXT. HAWKINS - DAY                                    77

         SEES Anna running away.  He gives chase.
         Anna, although bound, is light and fit and runs fast,
         hurdling fallen logs and branches, charging through the
         undergrowth.  SHe has a good start.

         Hawkins, hampered by the radio and weapon but in
         tremendous shape, thunders after her, closing the
         distance.



  78     EXT. HUNTER'S P.O.V. - DAY                            78

         As he passes from behind a large tree, surrounded by
         dense foliage, SEEING the fleeing Anna.  He watches
         her and then begins to move parallel with her, only
         faster, the green of the jungle rushing by in a blur.



  79     EXT. ANNA AND HAWKINS - DAY                           79

         Anna, bursting through a grove of ferns, drives on,
         breathing hard with the exertion.
                                                      (CONTINUED)

  79     CONTINUED:                                            79

         Hawkins, ten yards behind, closing the distance,
         taking advantage of any hesitation Anna makes,
         struggling with the dense jungle.

         Anna hits a small clearing, an alleyway through
         the trees.  She sprints hard across the clear
         ground.



  80     EXT. HUNTER'S P.O.V. - DAY                            80

         Moving through the jungle.  As he steps clear of
         the foliage he SEES Anna driving hard into the
         alleyway, running directly towards him.  Twenty
         yards away, Hawkins, closes in.



  81     BACK TO SCENE/HAWKINS                                 81

         Only a few feet behind Anna, lunges forward, knocking
         her to the ground.  In a second he's on her, his
         weapon ready.  She struggles to her feet, fighting,
         gasping for breath.  Hawkins holds the MP-5 on her,
         looking at her, almost pleading.  He doesn't want
         to shoot her, but he will if he has to.

                                 HAWKINS
                  Please...

         She looks at the weapon, to Hawkins and then,
         hopefully, to the jungle.  She stops, staring hard
         down the alleyway.  Something...suddenly she sees it!


                                 ANNA
                         (in Spanish)
                  Look out, behind you!!!

         Hawkins spins...



  82     EXT. HAWKINS AND ANNA'S P.O.V. - DAY                  82

         SEEING the MOTTLED OUTLINE of the Hunter's body,
         racing towards them, as if the entire wall of the
         jungle were rushing in.  The Hunter's WEAPON
         flares to life.



  83     EXT. HUNTER'S P.O.V. - ANNA AND HAWKINS - DAY         83

         As he hurtles towards them, their faces frozen in
         surprise.



  84     BACK TO SCENE/ANNA AND HAWKINS                        84

         A splitting THUD as Hawkins is hurtled backwards into
         the undergrowth, the Hunter's hand and WEAPON flashing

         She SCREAMS as Hawkins' MP-5 FIRES a short BURST
         into the air.

         HEARING the GUNFIRE, Schaefer WHISTLES low and sharp.
         Ramirez, face bloody, swings into action, moving in a
         coordinated defensive/offensive pattern into the
         jungle.



  86     HAWKINS/BACK TO SCENE                                 86

         The Hunter's ARM and SPUR hook into Hawkins' leg, and
         he is dragged into the jungle.



  87     EXT. RAMIREZ - DAY                                    87

         Ramirez runs forward ten paces, drops to a crouch,
         scanning to each side.  Immediately Schaefer runs
         forward twenty paces.  As he passes Ramirez, Ramirez
         turns and scans the rear and flanks.

         Dillon, Mac and Blain repeat the maneuver, leap-frogging
         forward, canvassing the jungle, providing areas of
         intersection cover.



  88     EXT. RAMIREZ                                          88

         Entering the alleyway where Hawkins was killed he SEES
         Anna, cowering in the bushes, her blood splattered
         face glazed with terror, his eyes vacant.  He
         approaches, angry, wary, but the girl is so stunned.
         He SEES the trail of BLOOD and CRUSHED GRASSES leading
         into the jungle.  He gives a LOW WHISTLE and then moves
         on, the rest of the team assuming defensive positions
         around the clearing.

         He follows the trail, finding first Hawkins'
         blood-covered weapon, and then, a few yards later,
         the radio.  Ramirez cautiously parts the brush before
         him.  A look of puzzlement and then revulsion comes
         of his face.



  89     EXT. ALLEYWAY - DAY                                   89

         Blain and Mac at either end, cautiously searching
         the jungle; Billy covering their flanks.

         Schaefer and Dillon approach Anna.  She seems unaware
         of their presence, staring numbly ahead.  Schaefer
         checks her out, looking for wounds, he wipes some of
         the blood from her face.

                                 SCHAEFER
                  It's not her blood.

         Ramirez emerges from the jungle carrying Hawkins'
         MP-5 and radio.  He approaches, dumping the equipment
         on the ground.

         Dillon in the b.g., as Ramirez parts the brush with
         his weapon.  Before them, covered with dirt and
         leaves, are Hawkins' ENTRAILS.  There is no body.

                  I think it's Hawkins.

         The entire team is gathered, still holding defensive
         positions.  Anna, still stunned, is beginning to
         come around.  She looks up at Schaefer.  He turns to
         Ramirez.

                  Ramirez, ask her what
                  happened.

         Ramirez drops to one knee and talks softly to her in
         SPANISH.  She mutters incoherently in Spanish, still
         dazed, shaking her head.  Dillon listens closely to her
         response.  Ramirez turns to Schaefer.  He seems
         confused.

                                 RAMIREZ
                  She says...the jungle came
                  alive, and took him...

                  ...she doesn't make sense.

                         (growing angry)
                  Couple of sappers been
                  trailing us all the way from
                  the camp, Major.  Billy heard
                  them.  She set us up, ran
                  for it...They were waiting.
                  I should've wasted the bitch
                  when I had the chance.

         Schaefer, looking at Hawkins' bloodstained equipment
         lying at Anna's feet, looks up.

                                 SCHAEFER
                         (quietly)

                         (pause)
                  Why didn't she escape?

         Ramirez and Dillon look at the equipment and then
         to the girl, still numb with shock.

                  meters.

         They move out.  Schaefer moves into the jungle,
         searching.  He crouches at the base of a huge
         MAHOGANY TREE, covered with vines, studying the
         jungle.  He moves away from the tree and into the
         forest, looking for signs on the ground.

         Where he was sitting, a DROP OF BLOOD falls.  Another
         drop falls, dripping from a leaf and above that, from
         another leaf.  Above that, high in the top of the
         tree, SUSPENDED from vines from his ankles, is
         HAWKINS' BODY, his chest a gaping wound.

         He hands there as if he were an animal, field dressed.



  92     EXT. BLAIN - DAY                                      92

         Crouched in the undergrowth.  There is a movement in
         the brush before him.  He wipes the sweat from his
         eyes and clicks his safety on the Mini-gun to fire.

         The SOUND is growing closer.  Blain levels the weapon.
         A smile crosses his face.

                                 BLAIN
                         (whispers)
                  Come on in you fuckers...come on
                  in.  'ol 'painless' is waitin'...

         The movement in the brush is GROWING LOUDER.  Blain's
         finger moves closer to the trigger.

         Suddenly a small TAPIR bursts through the leaves,
         startling Blain.  He relaxes momentarily as he
         watches the animal scurrying from sight.  He
         stands...

                                                      (CONTINUED)

         SOMETHING grazes his shoulder, a gout of BLOOD erupting.
         He starts to turn, the Mini-gun held low, ready to
         fire...

         ...from out of the jungle, 75 feet away, the Hunter's
         WEAPON streaks toward him like a missile.  He SCREAMS
         as it enters his back, erupting from his chest in an
         EXPLOSION of BLOOD.



  93     EXT. MAC - DAY                                        93

         Has heard Blain's cry.  He moves fast through the brush.
         He HEARS a RUSTLING in the bushes.  A wet SUCKING SOUND.
         Mac charges into the clearing.  In the instant before
         the Hunter disappears into the forest, Mac SEES a vision
         so brief and fantastic that it seems like a
         hallucination.

         The Hunter's EYES flare momentarily from the green
         before they vanish.

         Mac sees his friend, lying on the ground, his chest
         open, the powerful man, dead.

                                  MAC
                         (shouting)
                  Contact, 30 Right!!!

         He OPENS FIRE with his M-203, belted shells slamming
         into the weapon from the magazine at his waist,
         expending it in one LONG BURST.
 


  94     EXT. THE OTHER TEAM MEMBERS - DAY                     94

         Flying through the jungle, weapons ready, eyes searching
         for movement.



  95     EXT. MAC - DAY                                        95

         He throws down the weapon and with a cry of rage, lunges
         forward, grabbing the Mini-gun.  As he stands, the
         CARTRIDGE BELT, attached to Blain, strings out between
         them.

         He opens FIRE and the foliage before him EXPLODES with
         the fury of the terrible weapon.  Mac sweeps the
         Mini-gun from left to right, like a man possessed,
         mowing down the jungle.

         The other team members race INTO SIGHT and begin firing
         with Mac.

  96     EXT. HUNTER - DAY                                     96

         Moving.  A piece of SHRAPNEL cuts his shoulder.  A
         splash of ORANGE BLOOD spatters across the LEAVES
         of a nearby tree, bullet holes ripping through the
         surrounding foliage.



  97     BACK TO SCENE/MAC                                     97

         More FIRING.  Mac, his weapon expended, continues
         to thrust the Mini-gun forward, still squeezing the
         trigger.

         Suddenly, as quickly as it started, THE FIRING STOPS.
         The men move catlike into the jungle, reloading,
         searching, their nerves taut, stretched to the limit,
         ready to fire again at any second.

         Mac is frozen, eyes wide, unblinking, his breath
         coming in rapid gasps as he stares into the jungle,
         still squeezing the trigger of the weapon, its
         breech locked open, GUNSMOKE wafting from the chamber
         and barrel.

         Schaefer moves in front of Mac, still staring into the
         jungle.  Dillon pushes Anna into the clearing, moving
         towards the body.  Anna looks at the body and then up
         to Mac.  Schaefer sees a terrifying moment of
         recognition flash in her eyes as she continues to
         stare at Mac.  He turns to Mac.

                                 MAC
                         (confused)
                  I...saw it.

         At these words, Anna reacts in shock, drawing a             *
         slight breath.  Schaefer turns, sees her staring at         *
         Mac.  He turns back.

                                 SCHAEFER
                  You saw what?

                                  MAC
                         (still dazed)
                  I saw it.

         Schaefer turns back to see Anna, staring fixidly at Mac,    *
         watching his lips.  Schaefer turns quickly to Blain's       *
         body and kneels alongside Dillon.



  98     SCHAEFER                                              98

         is at Blain's side, shocked at the sight of the
         mutilated body.  He is joined by Dillon.

                  cauterized...what the hell
                  did this?

         Schaefer stands, looking at the body.  In the b.g.
         Anna drifts away from the group.

                                 SCHAEFER
                         (to Mac)
                  ...Mac!

         Mac stares ahead, dumbly, not hearing.  He grabs Mac
         by his shoulders, shaking him violently back to
         awareness.

                                 SCHAEFER
                         (demanding;
                         angry)
                 Mac!  Mac!  Look at me!

         Mac turn to face Schaefer, a shocked expression on his
         face.

                                 SCHAEFER
                         (urgent)
                  Mac, who did this?

         Mac is suddenly angry and frustrated, he has no
         explanation.

                                 MAC
                  I don't know.  Goddamn it,
                  something...I saw something/.

         Ramirez runs from the jungle, breathing hard, shaking
         his head.

                                 RAMIREZ
                  Nothing.  The same thing.

         Mac stands.  Instinctively the team has now grouped
         around Schaefer, their weapons pointing into the jungle,
         ready, their nerves on total edge.  Schaefer looks
         upward at the darkening sky.

                                 SCHAEFER
                         (quietly)
                  We're losing the light.  Mac,
                  I want a defensive position
                  above this ridge, mined with
                  everything we're got.

         Man is again the hardened professional.

                                 MAC
                  Yessir.

         Schaefer looks down at Blain's body.  He turns to
         Ramirez and Billy.

                                 SCHAEFER
                  Put him in his poncho and
                  liner and carry him back.
                  We'll bury him in the morning.

                  I'll take him.

         as they leave approaches the brush, her attention
         focused on something clinging to the leaves, well off
         to the side of where Mac saw the Hunter.  She draws
         closer, reaching out, hesitant, as if drawn magnetically
         to the leaves.



 100     EXT. DETAIL - HUNTER'S BLOOD - DAY                   100

         Clinging to the leaves, thick, viscous, pale-orange,
         almost like the sap of an exotic plant.  Her fingers
         hover above it, hesitantly, and then touch it.



 101     ANNA                                                 101

         examines the blood, transfixed.  Dillon appears at her
         shoulder, startling her.  He motions for her to return.
         She turns, wiping the blood onto her pants leg.



 102     EXT. ENCAMPMENT - DUSK                               102

         The team is dug into the foxholes in a dense grove of
         trees, a solid wall to their backs.  The men are barely
         visible they blend in so well.

         Nearby, Mac is stringing a TRIP WIRE, low to the ground,
         covering it with leaves and grass.  He moves into camp
         and reports to Schaefer.

                                 MAC
                  We've got most of the flares,
                  frags. and two claymores just
                  outside.  Nothin's comin'
                  close to here without trippin'
                  on somethin'.

                                 SCHAEFER
                  Thank you, Sergeant.

         Mac starts to go but Schaefer places his hand on his
         shoulder.

                                 SCHAEFER
                  I'm sorry, Bull.  It's never

                  The best friend I ever had.

         Mac turns and walks through the camp, stopping beside
         a DARK OBJECT on the ground.  He kneels beside the
         PONCHO pulling back the zipper REVEALING Blain's face,
         looking peaceful in death, as if lying in state.

         Mac removes something from his pocket, holding it in
         his hand, studying it.



 103     DETAIL OF OBJECT IN MAC'S HAND                       103

         The small WHISKEY FLASH, the chrome rubbed away in
         places REVEALING the brass beneath and a MEDALLION
         depicting the 101 1ST AIRBORNE DIVISION.



 104     MAC                                                  104

         takes a tiny sip from the flask.  He replaces the cap
         and lifts the flap of Blain's shirt pocket, placing
         the flask inside.  He lingers on the face and then
         closes the zipper.

                                 MAC

         is huddles into a foxhole, her hands still tied in front
         of her.  She looks down at her pants leg.  The Hunter's
         BLOODSTAIN glows with a faint luminosity.  She places
         her fingers near the stain.

         A momentary HUSH falls over the symphony of night
         sounds.  Anna and Billy turn towards the trees with a
         growing look of wariness.  The others, setting up the

         The Hunter's foot steps on the upper leg of the corpse,
         the PREHENSILE SPUR digging deep, pinioning the body
         to the ground.  The Hunter's HAND extends, his
         FINGERS puncturing the skin at the base of the spine,
         gripping the vertebrae.

         With otherworldly strength the arm pulls, the entire
         SPINAL COLUMN ripping free from the body, a sickly
         SNAPPING and POPPING of cartilage separating from bone
         and tissue.

                         shocked)
                  We're still too far in, they
                  won't risk coming in for us.

                  Expendable assets, Dillon.
                  Seems Langley is never around
                  when you need them.

                                 DILLON
                  I can accept that, it comes
                  with the job.

                                 SCHAEFER
                  Bullshit.  You're just like
                  the rest of us.

         Dillon glares back.  Schaefer leaves, lost in thought.
         Ramirez looks up at the impenetrable canopy.

                                 RAMIREZ
                  Shit load o' good a chopper'd
                  do us in here anyway.

         Dillon turns to Mac.

                                 DILLON
                  Mac.  Who hit us today?

         Mac is still obviously feeling the anger and bitterness
         of the mystifying event.

                                 MAC
                  Don't know, only saw one of
                  'em.  Camouflaged.  He was

                  earth could have lived...not
                  at that range.

         Dillon ponders this for a moment, staring hard at Mac.
         Mac gets up.

                                 MAC
                  I've got the first watch.

         Mac departs.  Dillon watches Mac as he creeps forward
         to the sentry position.  He turns to Ramirez.

                                 DILLON
                  Ask her again.  What did she
                  see?  What happened to
                  Hawkins?

         Ramirez turns to Anna.  They talk quietly in Spanish,
         Dillon watching, listening carefully.  Ramirez turns
         back to Dillon.

                                 RAMIREZ

                  She says the same thing...
                  It was the jungle...

         Ramirez looks up at Billy who continues to stare into
         the jungle, aware, catlike, reacting to every sound,
         his nerves on edge, as if ready to snap.  Ramirez
         rises, moves alongside his friend, Dillon watching
         closely.

                  is it?

         Billy turns, his face a mask of primal fear.  He moves
         close to Ramirez.

                                 BILLY
                  I'm scared.

         Ramirez is frightened by this.

                         (shaken)
                  Bullshit.  You ain't afraid
                  of no man.

         Billy looks deep into his eyes, chilling Ramirez to the
         bone, looking at his with eyes which have seen on an
         instinctual level what the others have so far only begun
         to sense.

                                 BILLY
                  There's something out there,
                  waiting for us...it ain't
                  no man.

         Billy turns away, moving a short distance away, taking
         up his position.  Dillon looks after him and then into
         the blackness of the jungle canopy.  Dillon speaks to
         Ramirez.

                                 DILLON
                  He's losing his cool.  There's

                  of men that we're going to
                  have to take down.

         Despite his words, there is an edge of doubt in his
         voice.  Schaefer returns.  He's overheard this exchange.
         He's holding the group of DOG TAGS taken from Davis' men.
         He holds them up for Dillon to see.

                                 SCHAEFER
                  You still don't get it, do

 110     INT. HUNTER'S SHIP - NIGHT                           110 

         CLOSE ON an oval CHAMBER made of an otherworldly looking
         metal with a strange copperlike patina, its interior
         bathed in INTENSE BLUE LIGHT.  In the chamber is
         Hawkins' SKULL CAP and SPINAL COLUMN still attached.

         The light field suddenly changes as all connective
         tissue, flesh and blood and drawn away from the bony
         structures with incredible force, disintegrating as they
         rush toward the sides of the chamber.

         The light changes in frequency to a dull glow as the
         Hunter's hands remove the GLAZED, POLISHED trophy from
         the chamber.  He turns, carefully placing it upon a
         GLOWING SURFACE.  He touches the trophy gently, feeling
         its texture, as a man might touch the hide of a big cat.
         He pulls his hand away and instantly an opaque FORCE
         FIELD covers the trophies.



 111     EXT. MAC - NIGHT (LATER)                             111 

         Hunched down in a foxhole, the Mini-gun on a tripod
         before him.  It's nearly a FULL MOON, the jungle a
         montage of SHADOWS AND REFLECTIONS.  Mac stares into
         the night, his eyes always moving.

                                 MAC
                         (distant;

                  Bro, same moon...
                  everything...
                         (pause)

         His eyes probe the darkness, remembering.

                                 MAC
                  ...we walked out on top of

                  to you, Bro...you were just
                  too good...

         He ponders this a moment.

 112     INT. HUNTER'S SHIP - NIGHT                           112

         A FORCE FIELD that permeates the jungle, becoming one
         with the trees and foliage.  The Hunter walks down a
         CORRIDOR of SOLID LIGHT, leading to an opening to the
         jungle.  As the Hunter reaches the doorway he changes
         from visible to invisible, moving on into the night.



 113     EXT. ENCAMPMENT - NIGHT                              113

         The mist has thickened, the night alive with a million
         JUNGLE SOUNDS.  The team members sleep uneasily, if at
         all.

         Mac, although weary, stares hard into the night,
         waiting, each small sound a potential enemy.  A LULL
         spreads over the jungle, animals and insects QUIETING.
         Mac tightens his grip on the Mini-gun.

         Billy awakens, peering into the night.  Nothing.

         Suddenly, a metallic CLICK, a POP, the SOUND of a
         warning flare rocketing into the canopy.  A moment later
         a brilliant FLASH as the flare burns, illuminating the
         camp.

         An echoing eerie SCREAM fills the night as a DARK SHAPE
         in the mist rockets through the undergrowth towards Mac.

         Mac spins, hauling the heavy gun around, just as
         something crashes into his upper body, driving the huge
         man into the foxhole.

         A desperate battle for life ensues, illuminated with
         the strobing light of the descending flare.  Mac's
         enraged SHOUTS and ROARS mingled with horrific SCREAMS
         fill the night.

         Mac's razor-edged KNIFE slashes in the light; BLOOD
         spatters his face as he attacks fiercely.

         Schaefer and Ramirez rush at a crouching run towards
         the foxhole, their weapons ready.

         A tremendous climatic SCREAM from the foxhole AND THEN,
         SILENCE.  Schaefer and Ramirez approach, cautiously.
         Mac stands, his face and clothes drenched in blood,
         some of it his, his breath coming in rapid gasps.  He
         looks at Schaefer, whispering hoarsely.

                                 MAC
                  Got the motherfucker...

         As the flare breaks through the canopy, dying out in
         great flickering bursts, the man stare down into the
         foxhole.  A huge, jungle BOAR lies mutilated in a pool
         of blood, still quivering in the final throes of death.

         The flare dies out.

         Mac, shaking from adrenalin, breathing heavily, looks
         down at the dying animal.

                                 MAC
                         (incredulous)
                  A pig...just a fucking pig...

         Schaefer shines his TEKNA-LIGHT onto the boar, playing
         the light along its massive hulk, its razor edges tusks
         gleaming in the light.  Ramirez appears by his side,
         looking down at the huge carcass.

                                 RAMIREZ
                  Holy shit, Mac.

         Nearby, unnoticed by the men, Anna stoops, her hands
         still bound, picking up an MP-5 from the ground.  She
         turns, looking for an avenue of escape, running for
         the jungle.

         But the forest looks foreboding and sinister.  She
         stops, staring at the jungle, the moonlight reflected
         off leaves like a thousand eyes.  For a brief second
         she imagines she can see the Hunter's eyes, crashing
         towards her, the shifting patterns of light and dark
         making the jungle seem to strobe, like it is about to
         rush in at her.  She freezes, paralyzed by fear, by her
         memories of the attack.

         She drops the MP-5 to the ground.

         Back at the foxhole, Schaefer and Ramirez help the
         still shaken Mac from the hole.  Schaefer looks at
         Mac, at the huge gash across his chest.

                  right away.

         Suddenly he remembers, Anna.

                                 SCHAEFER
                  Where's the girl?

         They all turn, ready to move and then stop.  Coming
         forth from the shadows Anna appears, still frightened,
         seeking the security of the soldiers.

         From the darkness nearby, Billy's VOICE in a hoarse
         WHISPER.

                                 BILLY
                         (o.s.; urgently)
                  Major, over here.

         Schaefer turns, apprehensive, something in Billy's
         voice...

         He walks over to Billy, standing with a FLASHLIGHT
         pointing to the ground.  They see Blain's BODY BAG
         slashed open, covered in blood.  Ramirez appears.

                                 BILLY
                  The body...it's gone.

                  Came in through the trip
                  wires, took it right out from
                  under our noses...

         Anna appears between Schaefer and Ramirez, staring down
         at the empty, blood-soaked body bag.  She looks up, into
         Schaefer's eyes.



 114     EXT. ENCAMPMENT - DAY (PRE-DAWN)                      114

         A patchy GROUND FOG covers the area.  Anna, in her
         foxhole, awakens, LISTENING to the rising SOUNDS of
         the jungle.  MONKEYS begin to forage, their noisy
         CHATTERING and SCREECHING filling the air.

         A BIRD flutters back to its nest; a CHAMELEON emerges
         onto a leaf, directly above Anna's head.

         Anna carefully extends her arm, allowing the lizard
         to crawl onto her, watching, fascinated as it changes
         colors.  She carefully places the chameleon back on the
         leaf, which changes color again, becoming nearly
         invisible.

         Near the empty PONCHO, Schaefer, Billy and Ramirez
         are examining the ground and the trip wire to the
         flare.  Billy stands, turns to Schaefer.

                                 BILLY
                  Boar set off the trip flare,

         Schaefer kneels and examines the thin, well hidden
         WIRE.  He stands, looking around the camp.

                                 RAMIREZ
                  How could anyone get through
                  this, carry Blain out, right                       *
                  under our noses without leavin'                    *
                  a trace?

                                 SCHAEFER
                  He knows our defenses.                             *
                                                                     *
                                 RAMIREZ
                  Why didn't he try to kill one
                  of us last night?

         Schaefer looks at him.

                                 SCHAEFER
                  He came back for the body.
                         (pause)
                  He's killing us, one at a
                  time...

         Schaefer turns and looks at Billy, asking with his
         eyes for a viable explanation.

                                 BILLY
                  Like a Hunter.                                     *

         Schaefer stares at him, the words sinking in.  He           *
         looks up, reconstructing in his mind the possible           *
         events of last night, his eyes following the tree line,     *
         tracing the path of the intruder as he might have           *
         travelled through the trees and down to the ground.         *
         He looks up at Billy.

                                 SCHAEFER

         Billy and Ramirez stare up at the trees, a wave of fear     *
         passing through them...from the trees.  Schaefer turns,     *
         moving to where Dillon is guarding Anna, sitting on the
         ground.  Reaching down, Schaefer pulls her firmly to her
         feet, looking at her intensely.

                                 SCHAEFER
                  Yesterday.  What did you see?

         Ignoring him, Schaefer takes her hands, drawing his

         She touches her pant leg, the stain is faded but still

 115     EXT. ENCAMPMENT - MORNING (LATER)                    115 

         Anna at the base of the rocks scans the jungle with
         binoculars watching the tree line.  Mac moves past her,
         uncoiling a trip wire linking up four CLAYMORE mines
         hidden at various points with leaves and foliage.  In
         a tree at the edge of the clearing, Billy tosses an
         uncoiling roll of wire to Ramirez who attaches it to
         a GRENADE, wedged it the crouch of a tree.

         Wires attached to GRENADES and CLAYMORE MINES lead off
         through the underbrush and trees leaving a long, unmined
         corridor leading from the camp and into the jungle.


         At the corridor's end, where the rocks merge with
         the jungle, Schaefer hauls down on a HEAVY VINE,
         straining with every ounce of strength, his muscles
         bulging, while Dillon takes up the slack of the vine

         around the base of a tree.  The vine is attached to a
         forty foot SAPLING, arcing closer to the ground in a
         gigantic bow with every pull, CREAKING and GROANING
         with tension.  With a last mighty heave, Schaefer draws
         the tree almost within reach, gesturing to Dillon to        *
         tie it off, who does.                                       *

         Ignoring him, Schaefer rapidly drags into position a
         NET crudely woven of differing sizes of vines, their
         LEAVES still attached.  He carefully begins to cover
         the net with leaves and debris.  Dillon watches him
         in growing frustration as Schaefer moves quickly,
         picking up a FRAMEWORK of STICKS he has tied together,
         a TREADLE-SPRING TRIGGER.  He holds up the framework,
         hurriedly examining his work before placing it on
         the ground.

                                 SCHAEFER

 116     EXT. ENCAMPMENT - DAY (LATER)                        116 

         Morning passes.  Fog lifts as the sun creeps into the jungle.
         Insects swarm and are fed upon by BIRDS and other predators.

         At the entranceway to the rock outcropping, the net and trigger
         are hidden beneath the leaves, the framework of the trigger
         bulging with tension from the straining vine attached to the
         bent tree.

         At the other end of the corridor, several meters above the
         jungle floor, Schaefer and his team, heavily camouflaged,
         nearly invisible, lie hidden, waiting.  The team members, as
         if hypnotized by the BUZZING din, stare into the jungle,
         fixated, alert.

         ANNA while waiting at the net:

                  -- like a butcher.  The old ones in
                  the village cross themselves and
                  whisper crazy things.  'Demonio,
                  cazador de trofoes...Only the hottest
                  times of the hottest years...'  Crazy
                  things...This year is grows hot.  And
                  we begin finding our men.  We find

                  de trofoes...means the demon who takes
                  trophies.

         SLOW RACK TO Schaefer's face.  Ashen.  HOLD.  Suddenly an
         EERIE SILENCE moves over the jungle:

         He whips his face forward.  The silence is SHATTERED by a
         bird flapping from the brush.

         Schaefer sits back and scratches his head, frustrated and a
         little chagrined.

         waiting snare.

         Behind him, sighting down their well-hidden gun barrels, the
         others scan the jungle, alert for the slightest sound or
         movement, covering him.

         Schaefer reaches the trap, carefully skirting the trigger
         hidden beneath the leaves.  He reaches the end of the corridor,
         moving out into the jungle.  He moves further away from the
         others, the silence crushing down on him.  He stops and waits,
         sweat pouring down his face, his finger tightening on the
         trigger of his M-203, eyes scanning the jungle.

         He turns his back on the jungle, waiting.  Nothing.  He moves
         back towards the corridor, reaching the net, again waiting,
         listening, sensing.  Nothing.  He turns around, looking at the
         jungle one last time, his face measuring defeat and then, with
         carefully, measured strides, he walks back to the camp.

         Schaefer looks at Billy who shakes his head in puzzlement.
         Nearby, Dillon starts to rise.

         Suddenly, behind Schaefer at the end of the corridor,
         with a resounding SWISH and SNAP, the NET explodes off
         the floor of the jungle in a hail of leaves and sticks,
         rocketing upward into the treetops.

         Schaefer spins, the others leaping to their feet as
         they SEE the net as it tears into the treetops, a
         large struggling bulge trapped within as a long,
         unearthly TRILLING SCREAM ECHOES through the jungle.

         Schaefer and the others charge from the rocks towards
         the jungle and the bobbing net, their weapons ready.
         Anna remains behind, watching terrified from the rocks.

         They arrive under the net, raising their weapons to
         fire...but before they can fire the entire net
         EXPLODES into a flurry of leaves, twigs, vines, dirt
         and a FLASH of PULSATING CRIMSON.



 117     EXT. HUNTER'S HAND AND ARM - DAY                     117

         As the Hunter leaps from the net his WEAPON activates,
         his arm slashing out, severing a THICK LIMB of the
         spreading tree capony, entangled in vines.



 118     EXT. THE TEAM - DAY                                  118

         The limb CRASHES down from the trees, Schaefer, Dillon,
         Billy and Mac Diving for safety.  But Ramirez, following
         the Hunter's leap, SEES too late the pendular movement
         of the severed limb and is struck a THUDDING blow in
         the ribs, which lifts him off his feet, hurling him
         backwards like a rag doll, his shirt torn open,
         exposing a BLOODY WOUND.

         As Anna runs to Ramirez's side the others, still
         stunned, look upward, frozen in shock SEEING:  THE
         HUNTER, clinging to a side of a tree, flushed bright
         crimson.

         Dillis is dumbfounded, like the others, rooted to the
         ground staring upward.

                                 DILLON
                  What is God's name...?

         The Hunter utters an unearthly SNARL and HISS from his
         open mouth as an instant later his camouflage resumes
         and he vanishes from sight...a rapid, furtive movement
         through the trees.

         Mac OPENS FIRE with the M-60, the others joining in,
         shredding the foliage, but they know the creature is
         gone.

         With a SHOUT, Mac races into the jungle, in pursuit
         of the Hunter.

                                 SCHAEFER
                  Mac!

         Schaefer hurriedly ejects the spent clip from the M-203,
         slamming in a new one.  He shouts an order to Billy.

                                 SCHAEFER
                         (to Billy)
                  Get Ramirez on his feet!  Take
                  the girl and get the hell out
                  of here!

         He turns to run after Mac.  Dillon steps in front of
         him, putting his hand on Schaefer's chest.

                                 DILLON
                  No way, Dutch.  I'm going.
                  You get these people and get
                  the hell out of here.

                                 SCHAEFER
                  This isn't your style, Dillon.

                                 DILLON
                  Guess I've picked up some bad
                  habits from you, Dutch.  Now
                  don't argue with me, you know
                  I'm right.  Get to that
                  chopper and hold it for us.
                  We'll be along.

                                 SCHAEFER
                  You know you can't win this
                  one.

         Dillon stares at him.

                                 DILLON
                  You know me, Dutch, I never
                  did know when to quit.

         Dillon turns and begins to move out.

                  Dillon!

         Dillon turns.  Picking up the spare MP-5, Schaefer
         tosses the weapon to Dillon, who grabs it with one
         hand.  They share a look, knowing this is farewell.

                                 SCHAEFER
                  I'll see you there.

                                 DILLON
                  Right behind you.

         Hefting both weapons at the hip he runs into the jungle
         after Mac.  Schaefer watches him leave.  He breaks and
         goes to Ramirez, attended by Anna and Billy, who is now
         sitting up, holding his ribs and gasping for breath.

                                 BILLY
                  He's busted up, bad, Major.

         Schaefer lifts him to his feet, supporting him.

                                 SCHAEFER
                  Come on, Poncho, we're getting

         Creeping low to the ground, his eyes searching through
         the trees.

         Moving through the underbrush HEARS a slight RUSTLING
         in the foliage.  Mac?  He strains to locate the source
         of the movement.

         He HEARS A SOUND, too faint at first it identify.  He
         listens.  Silence.  He hears is again, the SOUND of
         a VOICE, barely audible.  A VERY QUIET WHISPER.

                         (o.s.)
                  Dillon, over here.

         Dillon locates the direction of the voice and moves
         towards it.

                                 VOICE

                  Dillon, over here.

         Dillon moves a few feet into the undergrowth.  He
         carefully parts the thick leaves and vines and enters
         a tiny opening.  He looks around, seeing nothing.

                                 DILLON
                         (whispering)
                  Mac?

         Suddenly a HAND appears and covers Dillon's mouth.
         Dillon gasps as Mac pulls him down to where he is
         hiding.

                                 MAC

                  can you see it?

         Something seems to MOVE in the direction Mac is pointing.

         Dillon points to an OUTCROPPING OF ROCKS, covered with
         VINES.

                  We both got scores to settle.

         Dillon silently disappears into the jungle, Mac
         watching him go.

         Mac makes his way toward the rock outcropping, working
         his way between the rocks and the vines.  He takes up
         a position and scans the jungle before him.



 121     DILLON                                               121

         moving quietly, his face intense, determined.  He
         stops and listens.



 122     MAC/ROCK OUTCROPPING                                 122

         straining to hear VAGUE SOUNDS coming from the jungle.
         He reaches out and grabs a VINE and carefully pulls
         himself forward into a better position.



 123     BACK TO SCENE/DILLON                                 123

         moving, searching.  He goes into a crouch.



 124     MAC/ROCK OUTCROPPING                                 124

         There is MOVEMENT in the undergrowth.  He begins to
         sweat.  He moves the safety to fire; reaches out and
         grabs another vine to pull himself forward.  Mac
         reacts in shock.

         The vine is alive!  Before he can move, the Hunter's
         HAND appears from the vines, grabbing Mac by the
         wrist.

         In the moment before he is killed, Mac turns and SEES
         the Hunter's glowing EYES.

         A FLASH as the Hunter's other hand, moves with
         blinding speed, Mac's face contorting in pain as the
         Hunter's razor-sharp SPUR rips deep into his throat.
         He falls forward into the leaves.

         He HEARS the faint disturbance in the leaves.  He
         pauses, turning in Mac's direction, listening.
         Hearing no further sound he relaxes, moving on.

         Anna in the lead, followed by Schaefer carrying Ramirez
         on his back.  Billy, carrying the RADIO is covering
         them from above, as they skitter and slide down the
         loose gravel of a rocky slope, leading to a river
         crossing.

         He stalks through a narrow corridor of tangled vines
         and moss, leading to the rock outcropping on the other
         side, his face alert, showing no signs of fear, his
         weapon ready.



 128     EXT. VINES AND MOSS - DETAIL - DAY                   128

         Through the thick tangle of undergrowth, there is
         MOVEMENT, a slight, undulating distortion, drifting
         through the hanging vegetation, as if cast by a
         passing shadow.



 129     DILLON                                               129

         Did he hear something?  He moves on.

         Behind Dillon and to the side of the corridor.  The
         Hunter syncopates him movements precisely with those
         of Dillon.

         Dillon stops.  The Hunter freezes in position.



 131     BACK TO SCENE/DILLON                                 131

         He does sense something behind him.  He crouches and
         spins, leveling the weapon.  The corridor behind him
         is empty, quiet and undisturbed.  He studies the trail
         intently.

         Peering out through the vines.  Dillon is looking
         directly at him.  Dillon turns, moves on, as the
         Hunter resumes his stalk, timing his movements
         perfectly with those of Dillon.



 133     BACK TO SCENE/DILLON                                 133

         Receiving no response he moves closer, turning
         cautiously to right and left.

                  Mac...Mac.

         He moves closer to the rocks, eyes probing.  Through a
         gap in the rocks he SEES Mac's face, staring up at him,
         eyes frozen wide in death.

         Dillon spins hard.  He stares at the solid wall of
         undergrowth.  He looks from one side of the corridor
         to the other.  Something it out there.  Where?

         Something in the vines has caught his attention.  He
         stares hard at a section of moss.



 134     EXT. MOSS - DETAIL - DAY                             134

         Suddenly the right combination of light and shadow
         prevail and Dillon SEES in an instant, the Hunter's
         EYES materialize and then disappear.



 135     BACK TO SCENE/DILLON                                 135

         With a growl and exhalation of breath, charges,
         bringing the weapon to bear.  A short BURST OF GUNFIRE
         erupts from the barrel.



 136     EXT. THE HUNTER - DAY                                136

         SCREAMS, his arm instantly severed halfway between
         his shoulder and elbow.  The weapon drops to the
         ground, the forearm still attached, still FIRING.

         With his left hand he FIRES the second weapon
         SHOUTING INSANELY as swings it towards the blurred
         image of his unseen attacker, hitting nothing.

         The Hunter reloads his WEAPON which turns INVISIBLE
         again.  Dillon continues to fire.  The Hunter's
         weapon appears from below, cutting into Dillon's
         unprotected abdomen, which, as if hit by a samurai
         sword, bursts open.  Dillon CRIES OUT as the huge man
         hits the ground.



 138     EXT. LOG CROSSING - DAY                              138

         spanning the narrow gorge, Schaefer and Anna with
         Ramirez between them, move onto the log, preparing
         to cross.  They stop, HEARING Dillon's GUNFIRE.

         Moving through the jungle with incredible speed,
         leaping, tearing from tree to tree, the jungle a rush
         of HEAT TRAILS as he charges on.



 140     EXT. LOG CROSSING - DAY                              140

         The jungle is still deathly SILENT.  Schaefer, Anna
         and Ramirez cross the log, moving onto the other side.
         Billy, still at the foot of the log, providing cover,
         turns to face the jungle.

         He lifts his head towards the trees, feeling the
         onrushing presence of the Hunter.  He shrugs off the
         radio letting it fall, smashing into the rocks
         below.

         He casts away his weapon.  Staring forward he reaches
         into his cargo pocket, withdrawing a small
         GREASE-PAINT TIN.  Covering his finger in BLACK
         PAINT he applies dark slashes under his eyes and
         again, vertically down his cheeks.  Taking another
         dap of paint he makes a SYMBOL on his bare skin, over
         his heart.

         He drops the tin, withdrawing his COMBAT KNIFE.  Holding
         the knife he grasps the MEDICINE BAG around his neck,
         yanking it free with a quick snap.  He wraps the
         leather thong around his hand and knife, binding the
         weapon and bag together.

         Staring outward, as if in a trance, he begins a low
         CHANT.

         On the other side, Schaefer carrying Ramirez on his
         back, laboring up the steep slope, nearing the top,
         turns and SEES Billy standing, waiting at the foot of
         the bridge.

                                 SCHAEFER
                         (screaming)
                  Billy!!!

         But Billy stands at the foot of the bridge, knife
         raised, waiting, accepting his oncoming destiny.

                                 SCHAEFER
                  Billy!!!

         In frustration, Schaefer hikes Ramirez higher onto his
         back, digs in and sprints to the top of the hill, Anna
         waiting at the top.

         Crouches low, knife extended in a fighting position.



 143-                                                 OUT     143-

 145     EXT. RIDGETOP - DAY                                  145

         Over the top, in a low depression, Schaefer props
         Ramirez against some rocks, reaching for his weapon.
         They HEAR Billy's echoing SCREAM.  Instantly their
         weapons are raised, cocked and ready.

                                 SCHAEFER
                  Get back, into the rocks!

         Schaefer sweeps Anna behind him as Ramirez struggles
         to his feet.  Together they back up, covering the
         ridgeline over which they've just come.

         Suddenly, from one side, near Ramirez, the Hunter
         bursts from the jungle, Ramirez, seeing the Hunter,
         spins raising his weapons to fire...

         Ramirez SEES the Hunter's onrushing face, still in
         camouflage, a montage of organic textures and colors,
         his yellow eyes burning.

         Whipping the MP-5 is the direction of the Hunter
         he is hurled backwards from the impact of the Hunter's
         weapon, his neck gushing BLOOD, the MP-5 flying
         through the air, landing in front of Anna.  She moves
         for the weapon...

         The Hunter, with unearthly speed, turns towards
         Anna, as Schaefer starts to spin, SEEING the Hunter
         about to strike as Anna dives for the weapon.
         Schaefer lunges kicking the MP-5 out of Anna's reach.

                                 SCHAEFER
                         (to Anna)
                  Run!  Get to the chopper!

                                                      (CONTINUED)

 145     CONTINUED:                                           145 

         Schaefer spins and FIRES, bullets THUDDING into the
         ground, the barrel arcing towards the Hunter as Anna
         stumbles to her feet running into the jungle.

         In a blur the Hunter spins back, hurling his weapon at
         Schaefer which slices through the wooden stock of the
         rifle, SPARKS FLYING as it severs the trigger guard
         and steel breech.

         The M-203 flies out of Schaefer's hands as the Hunter's
         weapon cuts deeply into his left shoulder, laying open
         the flesh.

         The M-203 hits the ground, where it lies broken in half,
         useless.

         Schaefer hits the ground and is rolling, up and running
         for his life, the Hunter charging after him.



 146     SCHAEFER                                             146

         crashes headlong through the jungle.  He leaps a fallen
         log, stumbles, struggles to his feet, running on pure
         adrenalin, his shoulder pulsing blood, his eyes filled
         with terror.

         Behind him he can hear the Hunter in pursuit, closing.

         Schaefer spins to look behind him, a wild desperate
         look on his face; he turns back, ducks an overhanging
         limb and lunges on.



 147     EXT. HUNTER'S P.O.V. OF SCHAEFER - DAY               147

         Closing rapidly...another few yard.



 148     BACK TO SCENE/SCHAEFER                               148

         runs like a madman, the SOUND of the Hunter's FOOTSTEPS
         close behind.  He's losing ground.  He knows he's going
         to die.

         Schaefer SHOUTS.  Suddenly the ground before him
         COLLAPSES and he disappears from sight.



 149     EXT. CANYON WALL - DAY                               149

         In a shower of leaves, flailing arms and legs, Schaefer
         crashes through the trees at the canyon's edge, free
         falling into space.

                                                      (CONTINUED)

 149     CONTINUED:                                           149 

         With a sickening IMPACT, he hits the branches of the
         first trees lining the canyon and falls, a hundred feet,
         through one canopy after another, desperately grabbing
         for limbs and branched to break his fall.

         He hits the bottom branches of the list line of trees,
         impacting crosschest on a large BRANCH, knocking his
         wind out.

         Semi-conscious, he hangs momentarily before he slides
         off, fingers digging into the bark, falling another ten
         feet into the swiftly moving river.



 150     EXT. RIVER - DAY                                     150 

         Weighted down by his boots and clothing, Schaefer
         struggles to stay afloat.  Gasping for air he ducks
         underwater, untying one of his boots.  He surfaces,
         fills his lungs and dives again, releasing the other
         boot.  He surfaces, strips off his shirt and pants and
         begins to swim towards shore, stroking with one arm.



 151     EXT. HUNTER'S P.O.V. - DAY                           151 

         As he nears the edge of the precipice from which
         Schaefer has fallen.  The Hunter in close pursuit does
         not hesitate but LAUNCHES himself off the cliff in
         a spectacular LEAP, streaking downward towards the tops
         of the trees that grow out from the canyon wall.

         The Hunter tears through the canopy of the first tree,
         the branches and leaves rushing past in a KALEIDOSCOPIC
         BLUR.

         The Hunter bounds off of one branch after another,
         moving through the trees as an expert skier might
         negotiate a series of downhill gates.

         The Hunter leaps free of one tree, bounds across twenty
         feet of open space to a large branch of a huge tree,
         affording a good view of the river below.  From his
         vantage point, looking down at the windening, slowing
         expanse of river, Schaefer is nowhere to be seen.



 152     EXT. SCHAEFER - DAY                                  152

         He is swept into a still FASTER CURRENT and is carried
         helplessly downstream.  Boiling WHITEWATER appears.

                                                      (CONTINUED)

 152     CONTINUED:                                           152

         Out of control he is swept through a series of rapids,
         pulling his further and further downstream until he is
         finally ducked into the undertow and hurled over the
         top of a six foot falls, driven deep underwater by the
         pounding force of the water.



 153     EXT. POOL AT BASE OF FALLS - DAY                     153

         There is no sign of Schaefer.  Precious seconds pass.
         Slowly, looking like a drowned rat, he surfaces, taking
         a feeble breath.  He is nearly finished, his energy
         sapped.  But the water is calm and a few strokes are
         enough to carry him near the shore.  His feet hit
         bottom.

         He tries to stand but pitches headfirst into the thick
         MUD SLURRY at the river bank.  With his last ounce of
         strength, he crawls, panting and gasping into a
         sheltered mud OVERHANG, collapsing beside the exposed
         ROOT-SYSTEM OF A DEAD TREE, his body completely covered
         in thick, gray MUD.

         Nearly unconscious, he raises his head and looks to the
         opposite side of the river, scanning the bank.  There is
         no sign of the Hunter.  He collapses in relief.  He's
         escaped.

         Suddenly, the Hunter impacts the water, throwing up a
         huge SPLASH.  He stands up in the waist deep water.  As
         the water streams off of his body, the chameleon effect
         rapidly changes, struggling to match the shifting color
         patterns of the shimmering water.

         His glaring yellow orbs stare directly at the spot where
         Schaefer lies helplessly trapped.

         The Hunter surges forward, relentlessly closing in on
         this prey.



 154     SCHAEFER                                             154 

         is frozen in terror, paralyzed with fear, his eyes
         locked ontothe incredible creature that is about to
         kill him.



 155     EXT. HUNTER - DAY                                    155

         Closing rapidly, another ten feet.  He leaves the water
         and walks through the mud, stopping, towering over
         Schaefer.
   
------------------------------------------------------------------------
                                                               85



 156     EXT. SCHAEFER'S P.O.V. - DAY                         156

         As the Hunter's feet surge though the mud and stop,
         three feet away.



 157     EXT. SCHAEFER - DAY                                  157

         Realizing his life is about to end, closes his eyes,
         awaiting the Hunter's killing blow.



 158     EXT. HUNTER'S EYES - DAY                             158

         The fierce yellow orbs look downward.



 159     EXT. HUNTER'S P.O.V. - DAY                           159

         He's looking directly at Schaefer, EXCEPT HE CAN'T
         SEE HIM.

         He can clearly see the EXPOSED ROOT-SYSTEM, but because
         of the heavy mud blocking Schaefer's body heat, Schaefer
         registers in the Hunter's vision as merely an indistinct
         lump of clay, unrecognizable to the Hunter as a human
         being.

         He scans the bank, searching, looking for heat sources.

         Detecting none he moves on sounding a questioning TRILL
         several times.



 160     BACK TO SCENE/SCHAEFER                               160

         disbelieving that he's still alive, opens one eye,
         SEEING the Hunter's feet move away, his prehensile
         spurs dragging in the mud.  He rounds a bend and
         disappears, heading for the undergrowth.

         Astonished, he tries to raise up on his hands but a
         sudden jabbing pain in his shoulder causes him to
         collapse, falling onto his side, unconscious in the
         mud.



 161     EXT. RIVER - DAY                                     161

         As a HUEY ATTACK HELICOPTER breaks over the top of the
         ridge, diving forward, moving down the canyon.  The
         chopper flares up into a holding pattern.

         In the open doorway, a SOLDIER searches the top of
         the canyon with binoculars.  Seeing no sign of life,
         the chopper flies on, disappearing down the canyon
         rim.



 162     BACK TO SCENE/SCHAEFER                               162

         lies unconscious in the mud, the distant SOUND of the
         helicopter THRUMPING into the distance.

------------------------------------------------------------------------
                                                               86



 163     EXT. ANNA - DAY                                      163

         She runs into a clearing, stopping momentarily, gasping
         for breath.  She is startled by a sudden movement
         behind her.  She spins, looking.  There is nothing
         there.  She runs on.



 164     EXT. THE CANYON - DAY (DUSK)                         164

         Schaefer GASPS as his eyes bolt open in fear.  As if
         the Hunter were still attacking, Schaefer rolls to his
         feet and runs, slogging through the THICK MUD, stumbling,
         lunging forward, gasping for breath.

         Schaefer spins and staggers backwards into a shallow
         POOL, scuttling, crablike into the chest deep water.
         Schaefer backs into the moss-covered wall by the
         waterfall, looking for movement, regaining his senses.

         As the water settles, he looks down, SEEING the image
         of himself, reflected in the pool; his hair and face
         covered in THICK CLAY.  He stares, mesmerized at the
         image.

         He lifts his arm from the water, his fingers wiping the
         MUD from his face, exposing a PATCH of SKIN.  He studies
         the mud in his hand and then looks at the image of
         himself in the water, SEEING the exposed skin.  HE
         stares at it, a wave of realization rushing through
         his mind.  He places the mud back on his face, again
         looking at his image.

                                 SCHAEFER
                  You couldn't see me.

         He looks up, out into the failing light, at the treeline
         of the deepening forest, realizing that fate has given
         him a fighting chance.  Slowly a look of vengeance and
         hatred crosses over his face.



 165     EXT. CLAY BANK - NIGHT                               165

         Using his MACHETE he carves MAGNESIUM SHAVINGS from a
         fire block into a pile of KINDLING.  He removes a match
         from the hollow handle of the machete, also containing
         a coil of PIANO WIRE, GREEN TAPE and MEDICAL SUPPLIES.
         He lights the shavings which burn with a brilliant white
         light.  Schaefer shelters the fire with a banana leaf
         until the flame dies down.  He feeds the fire with more
         kindling, fanning it with a leaf.



 165-A   SCHAEFER - BOW AND ARROW MONTAGE - NIGHT (LATER)     166

         Holding a three foot section of FIRE-HARDENED sapling
         between his feet and shoulder, he scrapes the char
         from the seasoned wood with his machete.

                                                      (CONTINUED)

 165-A   CONTINUED:                                           165-A 


         He bends the bow and attaches a long piece of PIANO
         WIRE to one end, carefully wrapping it for strength,
         using strips of green tape to cover the sides of the
         wire where the nock of the arrow will fit.

         He attaches split quilled FEATHERS with fishing line to
         an ARROW,  its tip fashioned into a series of barbs,
         rubbing them to a polished hardness against a smooth
         stone.  When finished he places the arrow on the ground
         next to three other identical arrows.


                                 SCHAEFER
                  One chance, that's all.



 166     EXT. CLAY BANK - NIGHT                               166 
 

         Schaefer is pounding a peeled root between two stones.
         He pauses to drool saliva into the pulpy mass.  He
         scrapes the milky substance onto a BANANA LEAF, mixing
         it with a sticky SAP, holding it over the coals until
         the mixture steams.

         Schaefer coats the arrow tips with the sticky poison,
         holding them over the coals until the sap bubbles and
         smokes.  He spins the arrows in his hands, blowing on
         the tips to cool and harden the mixture.

         Using the tip of his machete, he pries open the casing
         of one of the 40MM grenades, discarding the warhead.  He
         dumps the PROPELLANT POWDER from the shell onto a leaf,
         mixing that with a mound of MAGNESIUM SHAVINGS.

         He opens the narrow, tight roll of GAUZE taken from the
         first aid kit of the machete handle, fluffing it into a
         large, loose BUNDLE, the size of a baseball.  He pours
         the powder-mixture into the gauze, mixing it into the
         fabric.

         He transfers the ball of explosive ladened gauze to a
         pliable DRY LEAF, closing it into a bundle, binding it
         at the top with a long strand of jungle-grass.

         He twists the remaining gauze around a MATCH, leaving
         the head exposed, forming a self-striking FUSE.

         He coats the fuse with SAP and then thickly covers it
         with more powder from the 40MM grenade.  He pokes the
         fuse down into the leaf.  Taking a long strand of JUNGLE
         GRASS he makes a large loop, tying it onto the grenade,
         slipping the loop and grenade over his head.

         Finally, using several sections of BAMBOO of differing
         diameters, he fashions a crude, anti-personnel
         SPEAR-BOMB, a BANG-STICK like weapon, using the
         sharpened TONGUE from his belt buckle for a FIRING PIN
         and a 40MM GRENADE from his belt pouch as an explosive
         charge.



 167     EXT. RIVER'S EDGE - NIGHT                            167

         Schaefer appears, he has covered him entire body with a
         variety of CLAYS and OCHERS, creating a mottled, EARTHEN
         CAMOUFLAGE pattern.

         Holding his weapons in one hand, he moves up the canyon,
         ascending into a rising boulder field.



 167-A   EXT. BOULDER FIELD - NIGHT                           167-A

         Where the river flows into a series of falls and pools,
         surrounded by massive boulders and table top rocks,
         their crevices jammed with large amounts of DRIFTWOOD
         swept down at high water from the forests above.

         On a flattened section of rock, Schaefer drags a large
         section of BRANCHES INTO VIEW, adding it to a growing
         mound of FIREWOOD.  He kneels, tending to a pile of
         DRIES GRASS, LEAVES and other tinder.  Using the last of
         his precious matches, he sets fire to the tinder, gently
         coaxing the tiny blaze into a slowly consumming FIRE,
         flames starting to lick upward through the dry wood.

         He stands, staring into the rapidly growing blaze.  He
         turns, facing the canyon rim, raising his weapons in one
         hand.  From the depths of his soul, a SOUND emerges;
         primitive and visceral, as if from an animal in pain.

         He throws back his head and SHOUTS.



 168     EXT. CANYON RIM - NIGHT                              168

         A hundred feet below, Schaefer stands in the boulder
         field, his mud coated body bathed in RED FIRELIGHT,
         looking like a fierce, primitive warrior; a timeless,
         prehistoric sight, his long and WAILING CRY, ECHOING
         endlessly through the canyon.



 169     EXT. HUNTER'S SHIP - NIGHT                           169

         Backlit by the LIGHT of the open door, the Hunter's
         head, in three-quarter profile, his eyes gleaming, rears
         INTO VIEW, looking up at the sky, HEARING Schaefer's cry.

         Responding with a low HISS, he turns back, raising in
         one hand his weapon, in the other a U-shaped SHARPENING
         DEVICE.  As he passes the weapon through the device, it
         FLASHES into life, a deep, HARMONIC HUM emitted as the
         blade grows with energy, growing hotter, hotter and
         HOTTER with each stroke.  He draws the blade now WHITE-HOT
         through the device for the last stroke.  He lifts
         it, testing its balance, the WHITE-HOT blade
         illuminating his alien face.

 178     EXT. HUNTER'S P.O.V. - JUNGLE - NIGHT                178 

         Emerging from his camp, the Hunter swings into the
         nearby tree line, moving to the uppermost branches.
         The Hunter travels silently from tree to tree, arriving
         at the canyon rim where far below he SEES in the
         canyon, the BONFIRE, a leaping, shifting, multi-colored
         collage of HEAT WAVES and FLARES, luring him onward.



 179     SCHAEFER                                             179 
 
         hidden back within the deep notch of several large
         LOGS and broken trees, in the river canyon.  Below
         him, on the rock plateau, is the bonfire, illuminating
         in SHIFTING PATTERNS of LIGHT, the awaiting arena of
         destiny.

         His eyes shift, trancelike, moving from side to side,
         watching the approaches to the fire below.  His senses
         are alert; his nerves on a wire edge.



 180     EXT. HUNTER - NIGHT                                  180 

         His SHADOW-FORM descending through the canyon, a
         rippling movement of grays and blacks, passing through
         the shifting light patterns on the rocks, cast by the
         growing bonfire below.



 181     EXT. HUNTER'S P.O.V. - NIGHT                         181 

         His eyes probe the canyon, drawn to the swirling
         patterns of HEAT given off by the gaseous COMBUSTION
         of the bonfire.



 182     EXT. HUNTER - NIGHT                                  182 

         Continues on, moving silently down through the canyon.

 183     SCHAEFER                                             183 

         sits motionless, nearly invisible in his mud camouflage
         amid the darkness of the logs.

         Suddenly, over the CRACKLING of the FIRE, the BUZZING,
         CLICKING of INSECTS, and the CROAKING of FROGS, suddenly
         CEASES.

         Slowly, painfully he draws the bow to full arch, his
         wounded shoulder trembling, the BLOOD beginning to seep
         through the bandage.

         The bow straining at full draw, Schaefer stares intently,
         concentrating, searching for the Hunter's form in the
         dancing light below.



 183-A   EXT. THE HUNTER - NIGHT                              183-A

         Like a giant insect, drops from above, fifteen feet
         above Schaefer, his steel-like spurs digging deep into
         the log.



 183-B   EXT. SCHAEFER - NIGHT                                183-B

         He freezes at the sound of the Hunter dropping, his
         eyes wide with fear.  The slightest movement will bring
         an instant attack from the Hunter behind him.  But to
         wait, his back exposed.



 183-C   EXT. THE HUNTER - NIGHT                              183-C

         Jumps from the log above and to Schaefer's left, onto
         a boulder, gaining a better vantage point of the arena
         and fire below.  He raises his weapon, his EYES
         glistening in the dim light, searching.  A quiet HISS
         emerges from his mouth.



 183-D   EXT. SCHAEFER - NIGHT                                183-D

         Spins and fires at the movement of the Hunter.



 184     EXT. ARROW - NIGHT                                   184

         Flies into the night, lodging into a BRANCH of an
         exposed tree, just missing the Hunter's head.

         In a blur, the Hunter's arm streaks downward, a dull
         flash of light leaving his fingers as he fires the
         weapon, the projectile STREAKING downward, EXPLODING
         into the log, inches from Schaefer, sending a SHOWER
         of wood chips and bark, flying in every direction.

 185     SCHAEFER                                             185

         in a flash, is up and running, clutching his weapons,
         leaping from boulder to boulder.  He jumps down into the
         lighted area below, landing hard, rolling into the
         protective shadows of the rocks, putting the loping fire
         between he and the Hunter's position on the rocks above.

         He moves forward, darting to look backwards before
         leaping off the lip of the table rock into the boulder
         field below, a flat plane littered by weirdly shaped,
         water-erroded rocks, forming a giant stone AMPITHEATER.
         Shadows leap and dance across the boulders, cast by the
         bonfire from the plateau above.

         Schaefer crouches between two large boulders, quietly
         breathing through clenched teeth, feeling the pain of
         his now freely bleeding shoulder wound.



 185-A   EXT. HUNTER - NIGHT                                  185-A

         A nightmarish silhouette appearing for an instant on the
         rim of the plateau above.



 185-B   EXT. SCHAEFER - NIGHT                                185-B

         Over the SOUNDS of the FIRE and the softly flowing
         RIVER, distinguishes a NEW SOUND, one that brings fear
         and a savage determination to his heart:  the rhythmical
         CLICK-SCRAPE, CLICK-SCRAPE of the Hunter's feet, moving
         over the rocks, somewhere above him.

         Drawing back on the bow, Schaefer moves around the
         boulder to his left, heading towards the sound of the
         Hunter.

 198     INT. HUNTER. SOMEWHERE IN THE BOULDERS - NIGHT       198

         REVEALED in flashes of strobing light, pauses at the
         juncture of several towering rocks.

         He stands, erect, tilting his head slowly, turning it
         from side to side, his ears trying to orientate to the
         diversity of SOUNDS reflecting off the circular walls,
         enclosing the boulder field.



 199     INT. HUNTER'S P.O.V. - NIGHT                         199

         His vision, accustomed to another spectrum, has little
         available heat to register vivid images of the inert,
         lifeless forms of the stones.  He SEES instead, a world
         of soft, ill-defined shapes in a pale MAGENTA field of
         flickering heat.

 200     INT. SCHAEFER - NIGHT                                200

         Creeping forward, carefully placing one foot in front
         of the other, suddenly stops, hearing the CLICK-SCRAPE,
         CLICK-SCRAPE, now on his right.

         Starting to move in this new direction, he stops again,
         HEARING the sound now directly across from him.
         Listening, he hears the sound again from yet another
         direction, the sound ECHOING in the natural ampitheater
         of rock.

         Schaefer, uncertain of where to turn, waits.  Suddenly
         he crouches and freezes, HEARING the unbelievable SOUND
         of a HUMAN VOICE, softly echoing through the
         ampitheater.

                                 ANNA'S VOICE
                         (o.s.; filtered;
                         in Spanish)
                  Look out, behind you!!!

         Schaefer spins, his breath catching at the sound of
         Anna's voice.  Wide-eyed, straining, he waits, hearing
         only the muted FLOWING of water, the HISSING and POPPING
         of the dying fire above, the shadows growing longer,
         darker with each minute.

         And then again, Anna's VOICE.

                                 ANNA'S VOICE
                         (o.s.; in

         Tracelike he moves towards the sound.

         his head canted, throat distended, utters another
         mimicry.

         the VOICE seems to emanate.

         his ears now directed towards the SOUND of Schaefer's
         voice, his slowly approaching FOOTSTEPS, raises his
         weapon.



 204     SCHAEFER                                             204

         pauses before the opening of the passageway.  All is
         silent.  He hesitates to enter.  Listeneing.  He starts
         to move and then hears a NEW VOICE:

                                 HUNTER
                         (o.s.; Mac's
                         voice)
                  Dillon, over here...

         Schaefer, horrified at the sound of the dead man's
         voice, backs quickly into the space between a boulder
         and the high rock wall of the ampitheater.



 205     INT. HUNTER - SOMEWHERE IN THE BOULDERS - NIGHT      205

         His feet moving quietly over the rock, the shadow-light
         deepening with the dying fire above, closing in.



 205-A   EXT. SCHAEFER - NIGHT                                205-A

         Bow drawn, trapped against the rock, HEARING the sound
         of the Hunter approaching from the left, now the
         right, is helpless, not knowing where to fire, the
         Hunter's deadly strike only an instant away.

         Still holding the bang-stick in his bow hand, he
         carefully releases the draw on the string, reaching
         to his neck for the FLASH-GRENADE.  With painstaking
         care he removes the grenade from his neck.

         Focusing on the rocks before him and the still
         approaching SOUND, he reaches down with the grenade,
         gripping with his fingertips the matchhead fuse,
         placing it against the rocks at his side.

         With a sudden jerk of his hand he strikes and throws
         the grenade, snatching up the bang-stick with his
         good hand.

         The matchhead SPUTTERS as the grenade flies through the
         air, an instant later a blinding, WHITE FLASH of light
         illuminates the ampitheater...

         In that instant Schaefer SEES above him and to his left,
         the HUNTER, poised on top of a rock, his weapon raised,
         about to strike!  Momentarily blinded by the flash of
         light, the Hunter's head recoils to the side.

         Darkness swallows the image of the Hunter, but in that
         second, Schaefer seizes his advantage, hurling the
         bang-stick spear.

 214     INT. THE SPEAR - NIGHT                               214

         It smashes into the boulder at the Hunter's feet.  The
         Hunter leaps as the grenade DETONATES, shrapnel tearing
         into his body.

         With a terrifying SCREAM of pain and anger, the Hunter
         clutches frantically at the WOUNDS in his neck and
         chest.  Another bloodcurdling SCREAM OF RAGE and the
         Hunter is gone.



 215     INT. WATERFALL - NIGHT                               215

         Cascades over the rocks, fed by a small stream running
         through the ravine.  A pile of BOULDERS breaks the
         falls, filling the area with an everconstant MIST.

         Schaefer appears, holding the bow and arrow, following
         the LUMINOUS BLOOD TRAIL of the Hunter over the rock.

         Moving behind the falls, Schaefer's body is briefly
         soaked by the water, the hardened and CAMOUFLAGE
         beginning to dissolve, running off his body.  He
         continues on, slowly, cautiously following the blood
         trail.

         of rock.

         Schaefer, smeared with blood and sweat, his clay and
         ochre camouflage partially washed away, climbs up a log
         onto the boulder.  Oblivious to the searing pain in his

                  Bleed, you bastard.

         His bow down, Schaefer follows the blood trail across
         the rock, edging alongside a huge vertical boulder.
         The blood trail stops.

         He takes another step forward, past a darkened ALCOVE...

         Schaefer spins, SEEING in the alcove the SURPRISED
         Hunter whirl and spring towards him...

         Schaefer in a bound closes the distance, savagely
         kicking the Hunter's arm.  The WEAPON flies from the
         Hunter's hand CLATTERING to the rock.

         Before he can recover, Schaefer follows with a karate
         kick to the chest, hurling the Hunter to the ground,
         his back exposed.

         In a flash, Schaefer is standing over the Hunter, the
         bow drawn, poised, the blood from his open wound
         dripping onto the Hunter's back.

         The Hunter slowly rolls onto his back, REVEALING his
         face, his eyes bleached white in shock from the loss of
         blood.  The Hunter's body, rippled out of control,
         trying desperately to orientate itself to the
         environment.

                                 SCHAEFER
                         (incredulous)
                  Who the hell are you...?



 217     EXT. HUNTER'S P.O.V. OF SCHAEFER - NIGHT             217

         Schaefer's body, looms over him, MOTTLED and STREAKED
         from his exposed skin, blood oozing from the shoulder
         wound, his eyes like black sockets in his almost
         skull-like face.  Seen from this perspective, Schaefer
         is a frightening, horrible visage.



 218     THE HUNTER                                           218

         shudders, GASPING hungrily for air, strugging to speak.
         From his throat, Schaefer HEARS the feeble, distorted
         efforts of the Hunter, at first garbled,
         incomprehensible and then, slowly, chillingly, taking
         on the timbre and quality of his OWN VOICE.

                                 HUNTER
                         (electronic;
                         filtered)
                  Who...

                  ...the hell...

                         (perfect)
                  ...You?

         The Hunter's strength seems to fade even more...

         Then, suddenly, with the last of his diminishing
         strength, he lashes out with one arm, activating the
         lethal, razor sharp SPURS on his wrists.

         The Hunter's coiled leg kicks upward with incredible
         force, his terrible spur ripping into Schaefer's thigh,
         hurling Schaefer into the air, flipping him over,
         sending him crashing to his back into the shallow pool
         of water, momentarily losing his bow.  He flounders
         desperately in the water, searching for the bow.  He
         finds it just as...

         The Hunter rises slowly to his feet, GASPING desperately
         for breath.  He inhales deeply, hungrily, gaining
         strength with each breath.

         Schaefer looks from the pool to SEE the Hunter, raising
         his weapon to throw.

         In one totally instinctual movement, Schaefer draws
         back on the arrow to its very tip and fires.

         The arrow, with a deadly THUD, penetrates deeply into
         the Hunter's neck.  Another bloodcurdling SCREAM of RAGE
         as the Hunter clutches his throat, dropping his weapon.
         An instant later and the Hunter is gone.



 219     EXT. LOG BRIDGE - NIGHT (PRE-DAWN)                   219 

         Emerging onto a huge log leading to the rim of the
         canyon, Schaefer holding the Hunter's weapon, pauses
         several times, finding more traces of the Hunter's
         blood, the deep WOUND in his thigh flowing heavily.
         He continues across the log and climbs the bank,
         following the traces into the jungle.

 220     EXT. JUNGLE - PRE-DAWN                               220 

         Moving along the rim of the coulee, Schaefer follows
         the thick, orange blobs hanging on leaves and spent on
         the forest floor.

         Too weak to move through the trees, the Hunter has
         left a SWATH of trampled grasses, broken twigs and
         branches in his headlong retreat from Schaefer:  the
         Hunter turned Hunted.



 221     EXT. TWO ATTACK HELICOPTERS - DAY (PRE-DAWN)         221

         Powering upward from the canyon, the WATERFALL in the
         b.g., clear the rim, racing along at treetop height,
         heading towards the island promontory.



 222     EXT. HUNTER'S P.O.V. - CAMP -PRE-DAWN                222

         Staggering into the clearing, bleeding severely.  The
         Hunter is rapidly losing his camouflage ability, his
         skin turning a PALE GREEN, flexing and pulsing in
         shock.  The glow of light from the ENERGY FIELD
         reflecting off the spreading apron of BLOOD flowing
         from his wound.

         With trembling hands he grasps the arrow and breaks
         it, pulling the shaft from his neck.  He screams in
         pain.



 223     EXT. GLEN - PRE-DAWN                                 223

         Schaefer follows the blood trail, deeper into the
         incredibly dense vegetation, ripping aside the heavy
         growth, plunging onward.

         Before him, covering a narrow passageway, is a huge
         SPIDER WEB, intricate, four feet across.  Schaefer
         starts to sweep aside the web.  With a sharp intake
         of breath, he halts, inches from the wed.  Something
         is wrong.

         Examining the web closer he sees not silken threads
         but a hard and shiny network of HAIR-FINE WIRE: A TRAP.

         He backs up, picking up a hefty branch from the ground.
         He swings the branch with a mighty heave, clenching
         his teeth in pain.  The branch sails end over end
         into the web impacting the strands.  A metallic SNAP
         is HEARD; a high-pitches WHINE and the log is violently
         severed, the pieces flying in opposite directions with
         great speed.

 223     CONTINUED:                                           223

         Schaefer runs on, again picking up the blood traces of
         the fleeing Hunter.



 224     EXT. HUNTER'S CAMP                                   224 

         At the edge of the site.  He SEES the Hunter staggering
         through the foliage.

         Schaefer starts after him but then stops, dumbfounded
         by the incredible images that crash in on him:
         TRANSLUCENT HUMAN SKINS stretched over frames, the hair
         of the attached scalps moving lightly in the wind;
         SKINNED BODIES, some lying on the ground, others hung
         from the trees, like Hopper and his men were.

         He turns back, SEEING the Hunter as he passes through
         the shimmering distortion of a FORCEFIELD enveloping
         the forest.  Within the force field he SEES the vague,
         nearly transparent OUTLINE of the Hunter's ship.

         He approaches it, wide-eyed, his senses reeling with
         astonishment and rage.

         From within the force field, a PASSAGE WAY of BLUE LIGHT
         appears, the Hunter's form backlit as he ascends the
         RAMP to his spacecraft.



 225-                                                 OUT     225-

 227     THE HUNTER                                           227

         as he passes his hand through a light BEAM, the ship
         instantly responds, as a low, TURBINELIKE HOWL is
         HEARD, building slowly in volume and pitch.



 228     SCHAEFER                                             228

         in his weakened condition staggers forward, looking
         up, SEEING the passage way of light diminish as the
         door begins to close.

         As rising HEAT WAVES begin to envelope the ship, the
         Hunter stares out at Schaefer, the heat waves
         increasing as the KEENING WHINE of the ship's drive
         builds.  He enters the force field, the door now
         inches from closing.

         On the ground, nearly obscured by the grass and leaves,
         Schaefer SEES the Hunter's WEAPON, lying where he
         dropped it in his desperate flight to escape.

 228     CONTINUED:                                           228

         Schaefer grabs up the weapon and holds it.  How the
         hell does it work?...He squeezes the handle of the
         weapon feeling it resist.  Nothing happens.

         With the last ounce of his strength, and with a BELLOW
         of RAGE, his arm muscles bulging, he crushes down on
         the handle...

         In a FLASH of blue-white light, the weapon becomes
         ACTIVATED.

         Schaefer raises the weapon, sensing its power and
         function.

         In the final seconds before the door closes, Schaefer,
         with a triumphant SCREAM, fires the weapon...

         The weapon, flaring with deadly energy, drops and turns
         sideways, accelerating through the door and into the
         spacecraft.



 229     INT. SPACECRAFT - DAY                                229

         The weapon impacts the Hunter, his head EXPLODING in
         a fountain of orange blood and pale green tissue.

         The weapon continues on, burying itself into the energy
         field, bolts of plasma-energy begin arcing from the
         force field.

         Schaefer falls forward onto his hands and knees,
         staring at the Hunter's ship.  The SOUND of the
         hyper-drive continues to increase, as the ship begins
         to tremble.



 230     EXT. HELICOPTER COCKPIT - DAY                        230

         As suddenly the instrument panel goes wild, gauges
         spinning, digital readouts racing out of control.
         The SOUND of the turbine faltering, changing pitch.
         The pilot lurches forward with the stick, fighting
         for control.



 231     EXT. HUNTER'S CAMP - DAY                             231

         The multi harmonic whine of the Hunter's ship is
         still building as the ground begins to shake.

         Schaefer, realizing that the ship is going to explode,
         and ignoring the pain of his shoulder and leg, runs
         desperately, searching for cover.  He sprints for

         the edge of the clearing, diving over the embankment
         just as:

         A blinding purple FLASH blows the ship to pieces.



 232     EXT. HELICOPTER - COCKPIT - DAY                      232

         Enveloped in the flash of intense light.  CRIES of
         surprise fill the ship as the SHOCK-WAVE hits the
         chopper, heeling it hard over to one side.

         Below, the concentric waves of energy race outward
         from the center of the blast, an unearthly sight, like
         the miniature birth of a star.

         The helicopter suddenly regains control, its power
         restored.

                                 PILOT
                  Holy, fuck, what was
                  that...?!!!

                                 PHILIPS
                  Orbit right...check it out!

         The helicopter levels out and heads toward the smoking,
         devastated site of the blast.



 233     EXT. HUNTER'S CAMP - DAY                             133

         The jungle has been completely transformed.  No longer
         lush and verdant, the area is clear-cut, two feet
         above the ground, covered in FINE WHITE, smoldering
         ASH.  Amongst the shattered stumps, debris from the
         ship, bright as magnesium flares, burns with exotic
         colors.

         If the f.g., Schaefer, a living dead-man, streaked
         with the alien ash, rises up from a shallow depression,
         staring dumbstruck at the site.

         Breaking in low over the treetops, the HELICOPTERS
         flare up into position, one preparing to land.

         As the chopper descends, the crew, standing in the
         door way, stare transfixed at the devastation, their
         eyes trying to penetrate the dense white smoke.

         As the helicopter slowly descends, its propwash creating
         a raging storm, Schaefer materializes from the SWIRLING
         SMOKE AND ASH, his features taking form as he
         approaches, his naked body covered in mud, blood and
         ash.

 234     EXT. SCHAEFER'S P.O.V. - LANDING HELICOPTER - DAY    234 

         As the chopper, emerging from the vortex, settles
         towards the ground where the spacecraft once stood.
         Through the distorted veil, the helicopter, bristling
         with WEAPONS, VISORED and HELMETED MEN, now covered
         with WHITE ASH, looks like a landing spacecraft.



 235     EXT. HELICOPTER - DAY                                235

         The door gunner swings the M-60 into firing position,
         pointing it at Schaefer.  He racks the bolt, loading
         a round.

         The crewmen look tense, frightened.

         Anna, standing next to the door gunner, stares at the
         strange creature before her, narrowing her eyes,
         uncertain.  Is there something familiar about the
         figure?



 236     SCHAEFER                                             236

         stands in the clearing, staring at the helicopter and
         the array of weapons pointed at him.  He looks dazed,
         like a man making contact with members of an alien
         race, for the first time.



 237     THE HELICOPTER                                       237

         hovers low to the ground, the tension inside building
         as Schaefer approaches.

         More weapons swing into position.  Fingers tighten on
         triggers.  Suddenly Anna recognizes the figure.
         Realizing the danger she holds up her hands, shouting

                                 ANNA
                  NOOOOOO!!!!!!



 238     EXT. HELICOPTERS - JUNGLE - DAY                      238

         Flash overhead, heading across the trackless jungle,
         their rotors THUMPING like heavy machine gun fire.



 239     INT. HELICOPTER - DAY                                239

         Schaefer, a blanket over his shoulders, still in the
         remains of his mud camouflage, his body laced with
         deep cuts; his chest and shoulder caked with dried
         blood, is seated on a bench in the cargo hold.

         Near the cockpit are General Philips, an ARMY MEDIC,
         two MACHINE GUNNERS.  They look at Schaefer in awe.

         The Medic, holding an open FIELD KIT, a syringe and
         bandages, turns to Philips.

                                 MEDIC
                         (shaking his head)
                  Looks like he's been through
                  hell...can't believe he's
                  still alive.  What the hell
                  went on down there?

                                 PHILIPS
                  If it hadn't been for her, he'd
                  be dead now.  That story she
                  told us...I still can't believe
                  it.

         He looks at Anna, her eyes meeting his, as if asking
         for an explanation.  She looks at him a moment before
         turning back to Schaefer, staring at him as if he were
         risen from the dead.

         She looks into Schaefer's face, Schaefer returning her
         look, recognition passing between them.  Anna extends
         her hand.  Schaefer slowly reaches out, touching her
         fingers, then clasping her hand.

         Schaefer turns his eyes to stare out the open door,
         beyond the passing jungle below, out to the heavens.

         He turns back, looking at Anna, a faint smile crossing
         his face...they made it.

                         FADE IN:
          THE MOON. So fat and full in the night sky you can reach out
          and touch it.

          HICKS W. 0.
          This is what's known: There has always
          been man...and there have always been
          vampires.
          BLACK SHAPES swoop past the moonscape, vicious looking things.
          Much shrieking and wailing.
          Atop a STONE ZIGGURAT -- We see a GROUP OF MEN -- AZTEC
          WARRIORS readying themselves with PRIMITIVE WEAPONS --
          SLINGS, BOWS, SPEARS. Tonight they know they will die.

                         HICKS (CONT'D)
          Since the beginning -- the two have been
          locked forever in combat... The vampires
          were quicker, stronger and had the gift
          of flight.
          Quick glimpses of a bloody, brutal battle. Men screaming.
          Talons ripping. FIERY ARROWS launched against an unseen enemy.

          WHOOSH!
          With a HOWL, we see A MAN plucked off the ground, his body
          disappearing in the night. THE IMAGE DISSOLVES as -- the sky
          turns bright, the moon becoming a familiar ball of yellow gas.

                         HICKS (CONT'D)
          But man had the sun.
          THE CAMERA TILTS DOWN to find another GROUP OF MEN -- more
          sophisticated than the first. Makeshift weapons made of metal
          and steel slung across their backs glinting in the sunlight.
          They stand before AN EARTHEN STRUCTURE, looks like a GIANT WASP
          NEST. Unsheathing their weapons, they step grimly inside.
          We HEAR a HISSING WAIL and the wielding of steel.

          HXCKS (V.0.) (CONT'D)
          And so it went like this over many years.
          As man and vampire both evolved -- the
          wars became bloodier.
          From afar, we see GIANT STACKS OF CORPSES as hydraulic
          machines stack the black bodies into pyres as big as
          buildings, smoke rising to the sky in twisting columns.

          A LONE MAN

                         

                         

                         

                         

          2.
          Stands at the base of one of the mammoth pyres. Even from
          this angle we sens e his quiet dignity.

          HICKS (V.0.) (CONT'D)
          Then came THE PRIESTS --
          The Man turns and we see his face is shadowed by a large
          CROSS TATTOO, cutting across his eyes and down the center.

          HICKS (V.0.) (CONT'D)
          -- Specially trained warriors in the art
          of vampire combat. They single-handedly
          turned the tide for the humans.
          Quick glimpses of a GROUP OF PRIESTS battling a FURY OF
          VAMPIRES (we still do not get a good look at them). Their
          technique is otherworldy -- combining the brutality of a
          Maori Warrior. with the grace of a Samurai.
           The--combat-is intense. Glorious. An explosion of blood and
          s b m i l

           HICKS (V.0.) (CONT'D)
          Over time the vampire threat faded. The
          once fierce race now fatally diminished.
          A shadow of what they once. were.
          Through heavy smoke, we see a pile of VAMPIRE CORPSES, a
          ragged collection of fangs and claws.

          HICKS (V.0.) (CONT'D)
          The remaining vampires were put Into
          camps and -- by decree of the High
          Clergy the Priests disbanded. The
          former warriors to be integrated as
          members of regular society.
          We see a WAX SEAL pressed onto an ancient parchment. The
          document carefully rolled and stored in an ORNATE CHAMBER.

          HICKS (V.0.) (CONT'D)
          The human race thrived in relative
          quiet. The vampire menace quickly
          forgotten for other, more modern
          threats.

                         (BEAT)
          And the few surviving Priests faded Into
          quiet obscurity.
          The chamber is closed. We see an encrusted key turning in a
          heavy set lock and we --

          FADE TO BLACK.

                         

                         

                         

                         
          .s.
          Our story begins with the rusty SCRAPE of a windmill...

                         FADE IN:

          EXT. THE WASTELAND - DAY

          Dust swirls in nasty tangles.
          A LONE MALE FIGURE moves across the plain, long and lean in
          overalls. AARON PACE. Shadows flicker across his sunburned
          face, the windmill looming above him.
          in his hands is an ELECTRONIC DEVICE, he plunges it into the
          earth. It makes a series of CLICKING SOUNDS, reading the soil.
          Aaron looks up to see the silhouette of a WOMAN standing in
          the doorway of his CABIN.
          He smiles, waving to her. His wife.

          INT. OUTPOST 10 (NURSERY).- DUSK

          A pioneer's wood cabin.
          Aaron sits surrounded, a lattice work of vines covering the
          walls and floors in beautiful patterns. Not a trace of soil
          anywhere in the room, everything hydroponically grown.

          SHANNON (O.S.)
          Supper's on!
          He smiles, studying a. stunning RUBY RED FLOWER, separate from
          the others. His crown jewel. He closes the door and enters --

                         THE KITCHEN
          SHANNON PACE carries a bowl filled with a steaming green
          broth, placing it on the dinner table, moving aside a tiny
          FIGURINE OF JESUS. The surrounding furniture cluttered with
          religious knickknacks.

                         SHANNON (CONT'D)
          You been spending an awful lot of time
          behind that door. Makes a woman
          suspicious.

                         AARON
          Special project. It's taking a little
          more time than I thought.

                         SHANNON
          Nothing special about milkweed. Unless
          you like a thorn in the finger.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          4.

                         I AARON
          It's not Milkweed. Not this year.

                         SHANNON
          What is it?

                         AARON
          You'll see.
          His eyes skate to her face moving in for the kiss -- but he's

                         INTERRUPTED BY

          LUCY (0.S.)
          Yuck. Pershing-stew again.
          Their DAUGHTER (13). Already a heartbreaker. This girl is
          too young, too pretty to be out here in the badlands.

                         LUCY (CONT'D)
          I can't do it anymore. This outpost.
          Being all cooped up like this. I'm going

                         CRAZYL

                         AARON
          Honey...we know this hasn't been easy for
          you -- In two years someone else'll study
          the soil and this'll be their outpost.
          But for right now -- this is my job.

                         LUCY
          I don't know what it's like to have a
          best friend. To have any friends. I
          want to have a crush. I want secrets.

                         (SIMPLY)
          I want a life.
          Shannon looks at her husband. She knew this day would come.

                         SHANNON
          Aaron. She's thirteen -- She should be
          with children her own age.
          Aaron lets out a breath.

                         AARON
          Okay. Next year, we'll figure out a way
          to get you to a school close by. In
          town.

                         LUCY

                         BUT

                         

                         

                         

                         

          5.

                         AARON
          N year -- that's still plenty of time
          for you to have a "crush".
          Lucy deflates, knowing this is as good as it's going to get
          for awhile. Aaron takes her hand.

                         AARON (CONT'D)
          Tomorrow I'm heading in town to file.
          You come with, help your old man out, get
          a change of scenery. OK?

                         (BEAT)
          Now c'mon, stew's getting cold. Bow your
          heads and say grace.
          The family clasps hands. Whatever their differences, there's
          a bond here.

                         LUCY
          Dear Lord we thank you for what we are
          about to receive. Blessing us with your
          gifts...
          She.speaks with her eyes clenched shut, words spoken
          sincerely, nothing perfunctory about it. She's a believer.

                         LUCY (CONT'D)
          We thank you for the earth and the sky and
          for your bounty through Christ our Lord --
          She.stops, opening her eyes -- staring at the plates and
          glasses on the table.
          They're RATTLING.

           LU C Y (CONT'D)
          Daddy?

                         AA RON
          Shh.
          He cocks his ear, heading a low rumble.
          Although he's never heard the sound before...he knows it can'
          only mean one thing.
          Trying to remain calm, Aaron goes to the window.

          OUT THE WINDOW
          Framed by a BLOOD MOON hanging over the horizon, a DOZEN BLACK
          MOTORCYCLES race across the plain, ENGINES thundering.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          6.
          The Jesus figurine falls off the table, SHATTERING to the
          floor.
          Aaron looks at Shannon, an expression on his face she hasn't
          seen before -

                         AARON (CONT'D)
          Get the boards)

                         LUCY

                         (ALARMED)
          What's going on?
          Aaron doesn't answer, Shannon helping him position pre-cut
          planks across every window and door. Each with an iron-cross
          strut for support

          EXT. OUTPOST 10 - SAME

           The CYCLES circle the house, kicking up dust in sheets.

          INT.. OUTPOST 10 - SAME

          The ROAR of the engines fills the house as Aaron pulls a
          POWERFUL LOOKING GUN from the drawer. He drops it, obviously
          not familiar with firearms.

                         AARON
          Get by me.
          Shannon-and Lucy crouch at his feet.

          EXT. OUTPOST 10 - SAME

          The cycles cut their engines, headlights centered on the
          house. A blistering spotlight.
          It's quiet.
          The RIDERS step from their machines. We don't get a look at
          their faces as one by one they LEAP onto the house and
          windmill, SKITTERING across the walls and roof like spiders.
          The blades of the windmill slowly come to a stop.
          11U. OUTPOST 10 r- SAME
          The power goes out, everything going black.

                         LUCY

                         (TERRIFIED)
          Daddy?

                         

                         

                         

                         

          7.
          We hear the Riders crawling over the outside of the house.
          Snarling, howling, making terrifying sounds.
          Then the worst sound of all. Wood being torn apart.
          BLAM! BLAN! Aaron SHOOTS like crazy, the white light MUZZLE
          FLASHES providing glimpses of SHAPES moving inside the house.
          BLACK BODIES blown back. Shrieking. Everything happening
          lightening fast.
          Finally, the gun clicks empty and we're plunged back into
          darkness.

          THE LIGHTS COME BACK ON
          Aaron is still standing, the house in shambles around him.
          He's alone.

                         AARON

          SHANNON!
          From outside we hear the cycles revving.
          Aaron runs to the door. Rips off the board in time to see --

          EXT. OUTPOST 10 - SAME

          The motorcycles racing away, a cloud of dust in their wake.
          Aaron runs after but TRIPS on --

                         SHANNON
          Her body lying in the dirt, head lurching at an obscene'
          angle. He brushes back her hair --
          ere' g UNCT_URE MABKS in hem neck.
          Crying, he cradles his, wife. Feverishly looking around for

                         AARON

          LUCY!
          He keeps screaming but it's no use -- as the-motorcycles fade
          in the night he knows --
          They've taken her.
          The CAMERA TILTS to the MOON hanging above the plain. it
          turns BLACK as we now find ourselves peering into --

          EXT.. CITY FIVE/DISTRICT TWELVE - DUSK

          The lip of an ENORMOUS SMOKESTACK. One of hundreds. A
          seemingly endless brick forest reaching to a sky heavy with
          soot and ash, while below, miles of FACTORIES stretch and
          stretch.

          A STEAM WHISTLE BLOWS
          Quitting time. Hundreds of WORKERS trail listlessly from a
          massive brick and stone COMPLEX. Grey faces betraying
          another day's toll.

          A TATTOOED FIGURE
          moves through the crowd, people stepping out of his way.
          They do this not out of respect. . .but fear.
          We don't get a good look at him. Just FLASHES --
          Shaved head.
          Eyes like nail guns.
          Tendons clenching over muscle.
          As he walks,people whisper. He hears all of it.
          He heads into the streets. CITIZENS hurry by, some with.
          surgical masks over their mouths. There's a pale, sickliness
          to them. Malignant.
          The Figure suddenly stops. He cocks his bald head --
          Something's caught his attention...

          EXT. ALLEY - NIGHT

          We move through trash and shadow finding --
          A gang of FACTORY WORKERS, uniformed, surrounding a GIRL

          (12).
          Their LEADER holds her close, BUTCHER KNIFE at her
          throat. Mouth at her ear.

                         LEADER
          Go ahead ...scream.

                         (SMILES)
          Scream for daddy.
          He hears a noise, looks up and sees a SILHOUETTE standing at
          the head of the alley.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          9.

                         LEADER (CONT'D)
          Looks like daddy's already here.
          (points the knife)
          Well, then. Come on daddy...make it
          better.
          The Figure steps into a pool of white light, giving us our
          first good look at him --
          A LAL RGE AK CROSS TATTOO shadows most of his-- a e. Across
          the eyes and down the center.
          The Mark Of The Priest.

                         LEADER (CONT'D)

                         (LAUGHS)
          A Priest! Well, lookie here.. We got us
          a real life war-hero boysl Heard you
          guys were real baddasses.
          The Workers all pull out large knives.

                         LEADER (CONT'D)
          Guess we'll find out.
          They move in on Priest, chemicals burning in their blood,
          mouths leering.
          Priest folds his hands into the prayer position.
          The Workers look at each other. Laugh.

                         WORKER #1-
          What's he gonna do. . .BLESS us to death?
          VOOMI -- There's a whirling SNARL of sound -- the sonic
          equivalent of a back flip and --
          Pries is holding their knives.
          Before they can react, he throws the knives into their feet.
          They HOWL, pinned to the concrete.
          Scared, the leader clutches the girl, pressing against the
          brick wall as Priest moves towards him.

                         LEADER
          This ain't the war no more. You got no
          right meddlin'.

                         (BEAT)
          You don't belong here -- You ain't one of
          us.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          10.
          And with that he RAISES the blade to the girl's throat --

                         C
          WHOOSHI A sudden RUSH OF AIR. The leader looks at the
          girl's neck, his blade's gone.
          So is his hand.
          Priest holds the severed limb, its fingers still clutching
          the blade. The Leader collapses, a Holy Shitl expression
          frozen on his face.

                         THE GIRL
          Gawks at Priest, possibly more frightened of him than the
          workers.
          He turns to her, wanting to comfort her but not knowing how --
          She flinches and runs away, disappearing into the street.
          A BEAT as Priest pries the butcher blade from the hand,
          wiping it off. Tucks it in his waistband.
          He moves on.

          EXT. CHURCH (ESTABLISHING) - NIGHT

          Gone to seed. The once proud house of God now a sad
          collection of moldering stone and cracked stained glass.

          INT. CHURCH

          PUSH past row after row of empty pews.
          We stop on the CONFESSIONAL BOOTH -- a foot sticking out from
          the door --

          INSIDE THE BOOTH
          FATHER KOEPPEN, body skinny and ravaged. The old man pours
          himself a drink and downs it. Coughing.
          The confessional door opens, someone steps inside the other
          booth. We can't see who it is.

                         FIGURE'
          Bless me Father for I have
          sinned...again.
          The voice is like gravel from the bottom of a deep well.
          Quietly commanding. Koeppen knows it well.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          11.

                         KOEPPEN
          I caught the ambulance picking up what
          was left of the factory boys...figured it
          was your handywork.
          The Shape leans forward, we see it is Priest.

                         PRIEST
          This time there was a little girl.

                         KOEPPEN
          if this keeps occurring it'll be
          .impossible to keep it from the Clergy.
          You'll get us both excommunicated.
          Priest gazes into the vestibule, his voice almost a whisper.

                         PRIEST
          I want to see the other Priests.

                         KOEPPEN
          You know you can't. The Clergy forbids it.

                         PRIEST
          Why?

                         KOEPPEN
          They have their reasons.
          Priest flicks his eyes over Koeppen as if he could see
          through the vestibule, but his expression doesn't change.

                         PRIEST
          And their reasons for building more and
          more factories? The sky is turning black.

                         KOEPPEN
          Since when is. industriousness a sin? Did
          Jesus not teach us to be productive?

                         (BEAT)
          As your appointed counselor take my
          advice, . .Relax -- Take up a hobby, pick a
          vice. Make friends.

                         PRIEST
          You're my friend.

                         KOEPPEN
          I'm a wicked old man who'd sell his
          parish for a pint of whiskey.
          Priest seems to deflate, his hard shell cracking.

          I don't know what's happening to me. (7,
          Questions. Doubts. I'm not sure what it
          is.
          Koeppen slides the vestibule open so they are now face to face.

                         KOEPPEN
          The devil comes in many shapes.
          Do yourself a favor, keep your head
          down. Be smart. And most of all
          remember your oath...
          He hands Priest a set of ROSARY BEADS.

                         KOEPPEN (CONT'D)
          "To go against the Church is to go
          against God".
          This statement has always been the boilerplate of Priest's
          existence -- but tonight, it Just sounds like empty dogma. He
          squeezes his eyes shut, clutching the,rosary as we CUT TO:

          INT. LOBBY OF TENAMENT BUILDING - NIGHT

          Garbage litters the floor. The sound of water dripping.
          Priest stands, waiting for the lift to arrive.
          A BOY AND HIS MOTHER wait too. The boy stares at Priest,
          fascinated, his mother doing her best to pretend not to
          notice him.
          The elevator arrives and they step inside.

          INT. LIFT - MOMENTS LATER

          As it rises, a single bulb flickers above. Buzzing.
          The boy continues to stare at Priest, bewitched by the tattoo.

                         BOY

                         (TO PRIEST)
          Did it hurt?
          The lift grinds to a stop. The mother quickly pulls her son
          out as the door rolls open, glaring at Priest, disappearing
          down a dark corridor.
          And only now does Priest answer.

          Yes.
          The lift door clatters shut.

          INT. PRIEST'S APARTMENT - NIGHT

          Sparse, containing only what's needed.
          Priest peels off his shirt revealing a constellation of old
          battle scars -- Punctures. Scratches. Bite marks. His skin
          showing the early signs of aging.
          He goes to the lone decoration in his apartment --

          A FADED PHOTO OF THE PACE FAMILY
          He takes the picture off the wall, studying it. The image
          bringing him peace.
          From the streets below, the sound of a GUNSHOT.
          He looks at the rosary beads, still in his hand.
          He turns out the light.

                         CUT TO:

          INT. BEDROOM - 3 AM

          Unable to sleep, Priest sits on the edge of his bed. Praying.
          There's a knock at the door.

                         PRIEST
          Who is it?

          MESSENGER (0. S.)
          Messenger.
          Priest opens the door. A MESSENGER holds up a PUNCH CARD.

          MESSENGER (CONY ' D)
          I gota Priority Punch. Originated in the
          wasteland.
          Priest takes the card, the man writing up a receipt.

          INT. PRIEST'S APARTMENT - MOMENTS LATER

          Priest goes to a WOODEN BOX, feeding the punch card into it.
          A Rube Goldberg-like device of PULLEYS and WINCHES squeaks to-
          life, like a sail, a SCREEN rises and Aaron appears, his image
          a smudge. He looks awful. A man at the end of himself.

                         AARON

                         (FILTERED)

          find her? Find her before --.

                         (SOBS)
          They killed Shannon.
          The screen goes blank.
          Priest shuts his eyes, making the sign of the cross.
          His hand curls into a fist.

          EXT. CLERGY CITY (ESTABLISHING) - LATER THAT NIGHT

          Magnificent.
          At the Cities center, a municipal of baroque BASILICAS AND
          .CHURCHES -- all safely walled off from the rest of the
          metropolis.

          INT. CLERGY CHAMBER - NIGHT

          Giant shafts of moonlight hit a marbled floor.
          Priest and Father Koeppen are led by FOUR OFFICERS before A
          TRIBUNAL OF MONSIGNORS (all at least in their 70's). They
          sit behind a giant table cloaked in the florid robes of their
          religion. Men of scripture, creed and doctrine.
          Priest kneels, bowing his head.

                         PRIEST
          Thank you for meeting with me on such
          short notice, Monsignors.
          Even the Monsignors are uneasy'around Priest. Their leader,
          ORELAS, leans forward, addressing him.

                         MONSIGNOR ORELAS
          Father Koeppen notified us of the
          situation. Our prayers are with your
          family.

                         PRIEST
          I come before you because I would like my
          authority to be reinstated.

                         MONSIGNOR ORELAS
          On what grounds?
          Priest is taken aback.

                         PRIEST
          She's my blood, Monsignor.

                         MONSIGNOR ORELAS
          The proper authorities are handling the
          situation. I'm sure they'll.do a fine job.

                         PRIEST
          The proper authorities?

                         MONSIGNOR ORELAS
          All occurrences of vampire. disobedience
          and felonies are strictly a Federal
          matter now.

                         (BEAT)
          You Priests did too good a job. The
          vampire population is classified as
          endangered. They're protected.

                         PRIEST
          But Monsignor...they are the enemy.

                         MONSIGNOR ORELAS
          Were.the enemy. The war ended a long
          time ago.

                         PRIEST
          Not so long that we should forget what
          they are capable of.

                         MONSIGNOR ORELAS
          You would do well to remember the words
          of our Savior: Turn the other cheek.
          Embrace your enemies.

                         (BEAT)
          It is not our place to interfere --- or
          yours.
          Priest looks up, obviously in great turmoil.

                         PRIEST-
          I can be of.great service to the
          investigation. I -can

          Orelas stands.

          You forget yourself, Priest...
          It has been brought to our attention that
          you have engaged in a number of
          transgressions. Tell me...do you feel
          yourself to be above God?

                         PRIEST
          No, Monsignor.

                         MONSIGNOR ORELAS
          Engaging in any kind of practice is
          sacrilege -- You bring shame upon our
          house.

          EXT. SOUP KITCHEN - ESTABLISHING

          HOMELESS stand single file, wrapped around the corner, black
          flakes of ash drifting down as they await tonight's supper.

          INT. SOUP KITCHEN - NIGHT

          Priest sits alone, rosary beads clutched in his hands. He
          looks up to find Koeppen, the old man staggering as he downs
          an EXPENSIVE BOTTLE OF WHISKEY, three sheets to the wind.

                         KOEPPEN
          I knew I'd find you here.
          He sits, pouring himself another drink, toasting the poor
          souls at the surrounding tables.

                         KOEPPEN (CONT'D)
          How many nights in this very spot? You
          with your endless questions on the nature
          of suffering-Me with none of the
          answers.
          Priest doesn't even acknowledge him, lost in his thoughts.

                         KOEPPEN (CONT'D)
          Well, now I'm the one with a question.
          This one's a riddle.

                         (BEAT)
          What is greater than God-but more evil
          than the Devil? The poor have it, the
          rich need it -- and if you eat
          it...you'll die.
          Priest looks, up, his eyes cold.

                         PRIEST
          Why won't they listen to me?
          A beat. Koeppen takes another drink.

                         KOEPPEN
          Okay. I'm going to.give you one more
          riddle and if you listen close - you might
          just hear an answer to your question.

          searching for devils miss the ones
          staring him in the face?
          From behind, a CLICKING sound.
          Priest turns to find an OFFICER standing, LASER-GUIDED
          SHOTGUN pointed at him. The soup kitchen suddenly deathly
          quiet.

                         KOEPPEN (CONT'D)
          The Church feels it's better to keep you
          under its care...at least until this
          trouble with your niece blows over..

                         PRIEST
          You know I can't do that.

                         KOEPPEN
          That's what I figured.

          TEN TROOPERS IN FULL RIOT GEAR STORM IN
          Jackboots CLACKING, they form a circle around Priest and
          Koeppen. Guns SNAP into place, laser points dotting his body.
          Priest looks at Koeppen -- betrayed.

                         PRIEST
          Why?

                         KOEPPEN

                         (TOASTING RUEFULLY)
          "To go against the Church is to go
          against God'.
          Priest looks around the room -- FAMILIES AND HOMELESS huddle
          at the surrounding tables, terrified.
          There's only one thing left for him to do.

                         PRIEST
          Then ...I go against God.
          In an eyeblink --
          Priest strips the gun from the nearby officer, CRACKING it
          against the trooper's head, his attack graceful and precise --
          a whirlwind of PINPOINTED BLOWS and SHATTERED BONES.
          When it's over, eleven troopers lie on the ground writhing.
          Everything goes quiet.

          ANGLE ON: A LITTLE BOY
          He breaks, from his father.'' knee, slowly moving towards the
          window, drawn by a FLICKERING SHADOW.
          His mouth drops open as --

          WHAM! -- TWENTY MORE TROOPERS
          PUNCH through the windows in unison, showering everybody with
          glass! BULLETS whistle through the air, everyone SCREAMING
          as they scramble for cover. The father diving for his son.

                         PRIEST
          Folds his hands into the prayer position.
          VOONI There's a POP OF AIR and ---

                         '

                         SILENCE
          The: troopers look around confused -- their guns have
          disappeared.

          A...,

          ON A NEARBY TABLE
          A neat pile of shotguns sit, every FIRED BULLET collected
          harmlessly in a clean circle around them ...as if picked out
          of thin air.

          THE LITTLE BOY
          is somehow back with his father, the two safely holding
          hands, staring stupidly at each other.
          Priest is gone.

                         KOEPPE4
          Looks at his fancy whiskey bottle, inside now floats Priest's
          ROSARY BEADS. He fishes them from the bottle, hand shaking.

                         KOEPPEN
          Heaven help us.
          He takes a swig.

          The STRIKE of a match -- a prayer candle is lit, glowing in
          the darkness.

          AT THE ALTAR
          Priest kneels, eyes clenched shut in prayer. A large
          figurine of Jesus on the cross looms over him. The Christ is
          expressive -- He suffers.

                         PRIEST
          oh my God...I am sorry for. having offended
          you. it was never my intention to do so...

          Priest standing in front of a STEEL DOOR. Hasn't been opened
          for some time.

          PRIEST (O.S.)
          I want so much to firmly resolve with the
          help of your grace to sin no more and to
          .avoid the near occasions of sin.

          INT. STORAGE UNIT - NIGHT

          The DOOR slides open just a crack. A sliver of light landing
          on a piece of BLACK SCULPTED METAL.

          if this thing were a horse it'd be the ultimate stallion--
          Pulse engine. Nitrous. The works. A panel of black titanium
          solar cells covers the bike like armor.
          He races onto the street.

          EXT. STREET - NIGHT

          Sheets of rain fall like lead. Pooling in the gutters.

          PRIEST (O.S.)
          All I can do is ask for forgiveness for
          what is yet to come...

          The cycle knifes through the city. Expertly working his way
          through congested streets. Moving past tent cities,
          stockyards and rusty industrial machinery.

          EXT. CITY LIMIT - NIGHT

          We see a MASSIVE WALL -- A hundred feet high, surrounding the
          city. Priest pulls up to a CHECKPOINT TOWER. A PHALANX OF
          GUARDS with big shotguns at the ready, snapping into place.
          Mugs like anvils.

          PRIEST (O.S.)
          I now know the devil lives within me.
          The sins coming all too easy...
          Still on his bike, Priest's foot touches the ground, blocking
          our view as we CUT TO:

          THE MASSIVE DOOR/WALL sliding open with a KLANG1 revealing
          the wasteland.

          PRIEST (0.3.)
          And all too frequently.
          Priest REVS his bike, gunning out the doors. UNCONSCIOUS

          Priest's cycle streaks across the salt flats. It's glorious.

          EXT. WASTELAND - LATER

          Priest rides past a line of ANCIENT STATUES dominating the
          landscape, each representing one of the seven deadly sins,
          sentinels marking the boundary into the deep wasteland.
          He FLOORS it, the bike PUNCHING for the horizon, a thick plume
          of dust funneling behind it...

          EXT. OUTPOST 10 - NIGHT

          It's quiet, Just the sound of the rusty windmill. The only
          light provided by the moon reflecting off Priest's cycle,
          he's just arrived.
           He crouches, examining,a fresh TIRE TREAD. He stares, taking in
          the landscap e, feeling it.
          Then he steps inside the cabin --

          INT. OUTPOST 10

          It looks like a war zone. Splintered furniture everywhere,
          sprays of dried, black blood over the floorboards.
          He brushes away rubble and finds a DRESS, Shannon's. Putting
          his face to it, he inhales, his expression softening.

                         BEHIND HIM
          Quietly, A COWBOY HAT and a SHOTGUN BARREL emerge from a hole
          in the floor.

                         COWBOY HAT
          Alright, now -- Not another step.
           Climbing out from the hole, both barrels pointed, is SHERIFF
          HICKS (22). You could say the name fits. But you'd only be
          half right.

                         HICKS
          Thought you'd come back for a souvenir,
          hub? You gotta be the dumbest
          bloodsucker I ever come across.
          Priest steps into a pool of moonlight, illuminating his face.

                         PRIEST
          If I was a vampire you'd be dead already.
          The cross tattoo, a striking image. Hicks stares, pushing
          his hat back on his forehead.

                         HICKS
          I'll be dammed.
          He casually spits some ATOMIC CHAW, hitting the floorboards
          with a SIZZLE.

          EXT. HALBRIDGE - NIGHT

          Hicks and Priest ride in tandem across the plain. Hicks'
          bike a standard police vehicle, nothing fancy but reliable.
          They head towards town, passing aWOODEN SIGN`--

                         HALBRIDGE

          EXT. HALERIDGE (MAIN STREET) - NIGHT

          At a glance this seems like one of those frontier towns from
          an old western.
          TOWNSPEOPLE gather around a SNAKE-OIL SALESMAN, the man
          pitching his wares before a painted van reading DR. TOMLIN'S
          MEDICINE SHOW. TRANCE MUSIC wafts from the nearby saloon.

          SNAKE OIL SALESMAN
          Do I ask for three dollars?' Do I ask for
          two dollars? No folks! ONE dollar! One
          piece of tin and protection is yours!

          PRIEST AND HICKS
          Pull up in front of the Jail. Hicks eyes the salesman,
          coolly dismounts and adjusts his hat.

                         HICKS
          â¢Scuse me a minute,
          He heads towards the crowd, the salesman continuing his pitch.

          SNAKE OIL SALESMAN
          Vampires are a deadly lot! YOU could be
          next I I seen a Blackblood bite a man
          like a gingersnap! The only sure way to
          be safe is a bag of DR. TOMLIN' S WONDER

          If you care about your loved ones then
          you MUST have this amazing elixir in your
          homes tonight --
          WHOOSH! A KNIFE slices through the air, spears the sack and
          pins it to a nearby wall with a THUNK.
          Hicks steps to the front of the crowd. it's his knife.

                         HICKS
          You best get in that van and clear on
          out, mister.

          SNAKE OIL SALESMAN
          For what reasons? I'm a legitimate
          business man.
          Hicks PULLS his SIX-SHOOTER, cocks it.

                         HICKS
          I got six right here.

          SNAKE OIL SALESMAN
          Sheriff, I am shocked you can be.so
          cavalier with the safety of your

                         TOWNFOLK --
          HAM! A bullet blows out the van's headlight.

                         HICKS
          That's one.
          KAPOW! The windshield cracks like a spiderweb.

                         HICKS (CONT'D)
          Two.
          Immediately, the salesman quickly packs up his wares,
          scrambling for the van door. As he gets in, he catches a
          look at Priest, pauses a moment, then starts up the vehicle
          and quickly PEELS away.
          Hicks pulls the knife from the wall, holds the bag up to the
          crowd.

                         HICKS (CONT'D)
          Now you all listen up. This bag ain't
          good fornothin' but linin' that man's
          pockets with your hard earned money.
          Much shuffling amongst the people -- they trust in their
          sheriff but they're frightened. An older man named, CROCKER,
          steps up.

                         CROCKER
          You don't know'that. You're just a kid.

                         HICKS
          I seen enough two-bit hustlers and carry
          barkers. He ain't no better.

                         CROCKER
          But what if he's right?
          Hicks tosses the sack to Crocker.

          and they ain't comin' back.

                         WOMAN
          And what about the girl?
          Hicks pauses. This is not easily said.

                         HICKS
          I filed a report with the Cities last
          night. I'm sure they're Join' all they
          can.
          The townspeople mutter amongst themselves. Hicks looks over
          to Priest, a GROUP OF CHILDREN have already gathered,.
          pointing and whispering at him.

          INT. SHERIFF'S STATION - A FEW MINUTES LATER

          A hole in the wall. A few wanted posters and postal warrants
          tacked up on a board beside asingle jail cell.
          Hicks leads Priest inside.

          I've already had one of the boys send for
          your brother. We got him put up at

          Priest gazes out . the; window. A group of TOWNSPEOPLE are
          milling out front, staring at him.. He pulls down the shade.

          HICKS (CONT' D)

          service, right?
          Priest doesn't reply, staring at a yellowed wanted poster.

          gonna shoot it my way... not how some BOOK

          You can fold time?
          At that, Priest turns, looking at Hicks. Before he can
          answer the door opens and --

                         AARON
          comes through, looking older than the last time we saw him.
          Seeing Priest, his face cracks, smiling for the first time in
          days.

                         AARON
          You came.
          Overcome, he wraps his arms around his brother, embracing.

          A DOG rests lazily in front of a rotating fan.
          PADDY'S a bear of a man, the town bachelor. He plops down two
          bowls of brown stew before a waiting and hungry Aaron and
          Priest, The gruel smells foul, tastes fouler.

          takes a sip, grimaces, tries his best to smile but fails

                         PRIEST
          I know.

                         AARON
          After the war was over we figured you'd
          stay with us. Shannon was real fond of
          you. Lucy too. She was always asking
          about you.
          Uncomfortable with the conversation, Priest pulls out a map,
          unrolling it onto the wooden table. He moves his finger
          across the paper.

                         PRIEST
          The pack headed in this direction.
          There's a reservation up that way so
          that's where I'll start.

                         AARON
          if anyone finds out you're doing this --

                         

                         

                         

                         

          28.
          o r PRIEST
          You're my brother.
          Aaron nods. This is enough,

          PRIEST (CONT' D)
          I'll find her.

                         AARON
          And you' 11 bring her back to me.
          Something in Priest's face darkens. He doesn't answer, not
          able to look his brother in the eye.

          INT. GUN SHOP - DAY

          A SHOPCLERK mops the floor, guns of all types lining his
          walls. Everything from old Smith and Wesson's to the latest
          and most powerful hand cannons.
          With a jingle, the door opens revealing Priest. The clerk
          smiles. All he needs is one look and he knows -- This guy's
          good for business.

                         CLERK
          Good afternoon, sir! How may I be of
          service?

                         PRIEST
          I need bullets.

                         CLERK
          How many?

                         PRIEST
          How many do you have?
          The clerk laughs... then realizes he's serious.

                         CLERK
          No offense, Father. You got a permit,
          right?

                         PRIEST
          I have this.
          He pulls out a sack of coins, it hits the counter with a
          solid THUD.
          The clerk smiles wider..

          Hundreds of bullets all orderly lined on a table top.
          Priest site with his back to us, hunched over a candle.
          We're unable to see what he's doing. Aaron picks up a
          bullet, twirling it in the light.

                         AARON
          Maybe if I knew how to use these she'd
          still be alive.

                         PRIEST
          Sometimes things just happen. Fault's
          got nothing to do with it.

                         AARON
          Funny. I'm the one who used to say that.
          You were the one who always said
          everything was God's will.
          Priest takes the bullet from him.

                         PRIEST
          I'm not so sure anymore.
          There's a KNOCK at the door. Aaron opens it slightly. It's
          Sheriff Hicks.

                         HICKS
          Aaron.

                         AARON

          An awkward BEAT as the two stare at each other. Both knowing
          what the other's thinking.

          PRIEST (0.S.
          It's alright. Let him in.
          Eyeing Priest, Aaron lets the Sheriff in, shutting the door
          behind him as he leaves. The vibe in the room is
          uncomfortable -- Priest not even acknowledging Hicks.

                         HICKS
          I'm sure you're well aware of the Vampire
          Protection Act.

          Priest doesn't say anything, he just keeps working.

                         HICKS (CONT'D)
          These days, things go through proper
          channels. Paperwork drawn up.

          to know my office's'been contacted. I'm
          supposed to arrest you on sight.
          He pulls a SHINY OBJECT from his pocket, puts it on the table
          beside Priest.

                         HICKS (CONT'D)
          On the other hand -- if I go after Lucy
          there'll be a warrant on mybead
          too...and that'll put us in the same
          briar patch.

                         O
          Priest looks at the object -- It's Hicks' sheriff's badae.
          Five points glowing brightly in the candlelight.

                         HICKS (CONT'D)
          We leave at sun up.
          Priest turns. A moment as each man studies the other.

                         PRIEST
          Why?

                         HICKS
          We're the only chance she's got.
          Priest picks a bullet from the table, a carefully notched
          CROSS now in its tip (this is what he's been doing). He
          SNAPS it in the air.

                         PHHHHTTI
          Hick's knife FLIES across the room, PINNING the bullet to the
          wall. A thin trickle of gun powder leaks from its casing,
          spilling to the floor. The kid's fast.

                         PRIEST
          How you with a gun?

          Better than I am with a knife.
          Priest considers this.

                         PRIEST
          I'll be there.
          Nothing more needing to be said, Hicks turns to walk out,
          stops at the door.

                         HICKS
          What's with all the bullets anyway? I
          thought Priests don't use firearms.

                         PRIEST
          We don't.

                         (BEAT)
          They're for you.
          Hicks nods, realizing Priest was ahead of him the whole time.

          INT. BEDROOM NIGHT

          Moonlight streams through an open window.
          Priest places his bible on the nightstand and crouches beside
          the:.bed, closing his eyes. Hands clasped.

                         PRIEST
          Our Father who art in Heaven, hallowed be
          thy name. Thy Kingdom come Thy will be
          done on earth as it is in heaven...
          As he continues THE CAMERA slowly moves OUT THE WINDOW and
          into the night, moving across HALBRIDGE.

          PRIEST (O.S.) (CONT'D)
          Forgive us our trespasses as we forgive
          those that trespass against us and lead
          us not into temptation but deliver us
          from evil.
          We see the TOWNSPEOPLE: lock their doors, bolting the
          shutters, tucking their children in safely for the night.

          PRIEST (O.S.) (CONT'D)
          For thine is the kingdom and the power and
          the glory, forever and ever. Amen.
          And now the camera stops on a LARGE SHADOWY FIGURE perched on a
          nearby roofline.

          The only thing we can see of it is a DUSTER illuminated by
          the SOFT GLOW OF A LIT CHEROOT...the Figure watches Priest as
          he finishes his prayer and blows out a candle.
          Silently, the Figure takes off. Flying into the night.

          Did it help?
          Priest doesn't answer, the question hanging overhead, a dark
          cloud.

                         AARON (CONT'D)
          I never used to be much on faith. You

          kick starts it, the engine REVVING to life.

          Got Got You must got Master will be
          angry!
          Nicks is grimacing from the stench. He looks at Priest, not
          happy as he approaches a STONE SARCOPHAGUS. Running his hand
          over it.

                         PRIEST
          Where's the girl?

                         CRYPT FAMILIAR
          PLEEASE please got

                         PRIEST
          No? Maybe your Master will know.

                         CRYPT FAMILIAR
          NOt NOI THE MASTER CANNOT BE DISTURBEDI
          Priest rests his hand against the. atone slab covering.the
          tomb. It must weigh 200 pounds. He moves the slab. Just a
          centimeter -- but the Familiar screeches.

                         PRIEST
          Wh re is she?

                         CRYPT FAMILIAR

                         (SOBBING)
          Please. Please don't hurtmy Master.

                         PRIEST
          Your.Master'll be dead.
          He shoves the slab more, the light rays hanging just outside
          the edge.
          And now The Familiar begins to laugh, a horrible rattling
          sound. Something in his mood has shifted.

                         CRYPT FAMILIAR
          No, i don't think so.
          Hearing a noise, Hicks turns, witnessing a horrible sight
          moving towards him

          THE NIGHTSHADE FAMILIARS
          About ten of them. Real Night Of The Living Dead stuff.
          Makeshift weapons in their hands:. Scythes, Slingblades,
          Buzzsaws.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          3.7.
          Before Hicks can react --

                         A FAMILIAR
          Attacks, BUTCHER BLADE raised. CHOP! the blade buries itself
          in Hicks' arm!

                         HICKS
          Lets loose with a mean roundhouse. Plugging him in the
          chest. in one quick motion he rips the butcher blade from
          his arm, flinging it at the nearest

                         FAMILIAR
          The blade lodges in his skull and he drops like a sack.
          These guys move surprisingly fast -- Hicks is already
          surrounded. He hears a whistling noise as

          A BUZZSAW BLADE
          knifes through the air heading straight for him. He DUCKS,
          the blade whistling past, sawtoothing into the torso of
          another Familiar.

                         HICKS
          Pulls off his COWBOY HAT. Activating a release. With a
          CLICK! thousands- of needle--like teat ext e d fro the brim.
          With deadly accuracy, he flings the hat: It FLASHES through
          the air, DAIS'iWHEELING around a Familiar's neck, pinpricking
          his skin and finally whirling back to Hicks' band likean
          obedient pup.
          A BEAT as the Familiar stands, mouth agape. Then with a wet
          SNAP his head rolls off his shoulders, THUDDING in the dirt.
          Hicks falls to the ground, his wound starting to get the best
          of him. He musters up his strength for another hat attack
          but before he can --

                         PRIEST
          Leaps in front. Blocking his way.

                         PRIEST
          Not yet.
          With a HORRIBLE SCREECH the Familiars attack, LAUNCHING at
          Priest and Hicks. Blades in the air.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          38.
          Priest CHARGES into the frenzy. A juggernaut. His movements
          clean and calculated, bones breaking around him with a wet
          snap, bodies THUDDING at his feet.
          When the dust clears, Priest stands alone... and he is holding
          their weapons.

                         PRIEST (CONT'D)
          Now we can do this easy --
          He tosses the BUTCHER KNIFE, it sticks in the ground a
          hairline from a Familiar's head.

                         PRIEST (CONTID)
          Or we can do this HARD --
          Priest flings another BLADE. This one PLANTS in the leg of
          the Familiar. He HOWLS.

                         PRIEST (CONT'D)
          Where is she?

                         THE FAMILIAR

                         (CACKLING)
          You're too late, Priest --
          He points to the horizon, the last rays of daylight
          disappearing.

                         CRYPT FAMILIAR
          It's our time now.
          We hear a LOW RUMBLE from inside the crypts. Priest looks at
          Hicks, a feeling of dark electricity in the air, anticipation.

                         PRIEST
          They get your gun arm?

                         HICKS
          Why?

                         PRIEST
          You're gonna need it.

          MULTIPLE SHOTS OF
          SLABS on each sarcophagus sliding open. SHAPES roiling in
          the blackness inside. The sound of dark, mewling things.
          Things already sensing trouble in their midsts.

          THE MASTERS ARE AWAKING

                         BLACK SHAPES
          BURST from the crypt doorways SCREECHING as they fly into the
          air. Circling above the reservation like a nest of angry
          hornets. Disturbed.
          WHOOSH! One of the figures SWOOPS low, touching to the
          ground. Giving us our first good look at a vampire;
          Wet, white skin.
          Insect clicking claws.
          Black eyes.
          Fangs.
          More creature than human.
          The vampire cackles, sounds like dried paper, its voice a
          series of teeth clicking hisses. as it eyes Priest angrily.

                         LEAD VAMPIRE
          What are you doing here,. Priest... haven't
          you already done enough?

                         PRIEST
          We don't want a fight. We're just
          looking for the girl.
          The vampire sneers and as it speaks the following -- one
          by one, the OTHERS drop from the sky, flanking him. They're
          scraggly, a little undernourished.

                         LEAD VAMPIRE
          Look at us -- Living in ruin, forced to
          feed off the blood of animals. We once
          scoured 'this land. We were warriors...we
          were Gods!

                         PRIEST
          You were murderers.

                         LEAD VAMPIRE
          We were what nature made us.
          (flashes his fangs)
          I recommend you leave immediately...You
          are not welcome here.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          40.
          ONE BLACK FIGURE still flies above. Like a vulture, it
          circles Hicks. Marking him.

                         PRIEST
          We're not going anywhere until you tell
          us where she is.

                         LEAD VAMPIRE
          Then you aren't going anywhere,.
          If there was a tumbleweed in the vicinity this is when it would
          blow by. A tense BEAT then. . .Priest pulls out a BLACK BOOK.

                         PRIEST
          ,,Yea though r walk through the Valley Of The
          Shadow Of Death x will fear no Evil -- "
          The vampires laugh. Fangs glinting.

                         LEAD VAMPIRE
          --'Your words mean nothing to us, Priest.
          And now we see the book's actually hollow on the inside,
          filled with dozens of .little STAR-METAL CROSSES.

                         1 - 6 (WHISPERS)
          Forgive me.
          in one quick motion Priest scoops a handful, snapping his

                         WRIST AND

                         THE CROSSES
          CUT through the air, heading straight for the BLACK FIGURE.
          S t SOUEAL.S as the metals; it like hot goals through
          1 err tC erina it apart, the pieces raining' down around
           Hicks, crashing to the ground.
          And then all hell breaks loose.
          The Nightshade Vampires hiss. Bearing their fangs like
          cobras and taking to the air with a SHRIEK. Attacking.
          Frightened beyond shit-all-belief -- Hicks FIRES wildly,
          chasing the creatures with his gunfire. His bullets
          whistling harmlessly through the air.
          WHOOSH! A vampire swoops towards him, fangs bared, claws
          ready to rip.

                         PRIEST

                         

                         

                         

                         

          41.
          Leaps at the creature just in time, driving it to the ground.
          in one brutal motion he. straddles it, twisting its head at a
          horrible angle.
          He turns to Hicks.

                         PRIEST (CONT'D)

          FOCUS.
          And with that he's gone, rolling across the ground like a
          boulder and LEAPING at TWO DARTING VAMPIRES.

                         HICKS
          Dazed, watches as the vampire's body erupts with death
          spasms, arms and legs kicking the air in a violent frenzy
          until finally all life drains away.

                         HICKS
          (under his breath)
          Jesus.
          Another VAMPIRE careens towards him. Coming in low, crawling
          across the ground on all fours. Fangs dripping.
          Hicks FIRES off a mess of bullets, peppering the creature as
          it flails backwards screeching. He snaps out the empty
          shells, reloading almost supernaturally fast, firing off a
          shot that SPLITS the Vampire's throat.
          He twirls the gun, flipping it into his holster.
          This leaves only

          THE LEAD VAMPIRE
          Perched atop his crypt like a gargoyle, raging at Priest and
          Hicks from the depths of hell with at HORRIBLE SHRIEK.
          In full fury, he LEAPS and flies away, the sounds of his
          torment echoing throughout the canyon as he vanishes into the
          night sky.

                         HICKS (CONT'D)
          Should we go after him?

                         PRIEST
          No need. He'll the at first light.
          Priest goes to the Familiars still lying on the ground.
          They're sobbing, having lost everything in the world that
          mattered. Completely wrecked. He grabs one by the scruff of
          the neck.

          No more masters. Just you and me.
          He raises a knife, pressing it to the Familiar's skin.

                         FAMILIAR
          (frightened beyond belief)
          -- The metal beast! She's in the metal

          The smoke. Look for the smoke --

                         SHARP CLAWS
          Suddenly RIP across Priest's back! It's the Lead Vampire,
          back for more. Claws digging into flesh.
          Priest wrenches around and the two go at it. A fierce, feral
          battle. The Vampire's fangs chattering inches from his neck.
          Their bodies lock in a horrible struggle, rolling across the
          Familiars. The Vampire's claws CHURNING into their bodies,
          killing them instantly.

                         THE VAMPIRE
          Throws Priest into a crypt, SMASHING him through the wall,
          flying in after him. We hear the sounds of a BATTLE ROYALE
          from inside. WHUMPI WHUMPI WHUMP! The walls buckle outward,
          sounds like the fury of all hell being unleashed.
          Then, suddenly, and'more disturbingly...,s â g.
          Hicks takes a step towards the crypt. Gun leveled. But --

                         PRIEST
          Emerges through the hole, exhausted, the LEAD VAMPIRE'S HEAD in
          his hand dangling by its hair.
          He tosses the head and it rolls to Hicks' feet, fangs flashing
          up at him. Hicks stares at the ghastly visage. Unnerved.

          EXT. NIGHTSHADE RESERVATION - LATER

          A giant PYRE lights up the night, fed with the bodies of both
          Familiars and Vampires, Priest and Hicks silhouetted against
          the flames.
          The two are silent, grimly going about their task -- It's
          obvious the skirmish has affected Hicks. Priest notices.

                         PRIEST
          How's your arm?

                         HICKS
          Lucky I guess. The blade didn't go that
          deep.
          (fingering the bandage)
          Don't know what got into those Familiars
          to attack like that. They're usually
          harmless.
          Priest finds a KNIPE clutched in a dead Familiar's hand,
          tucks it in his waistband.

                         PRIEST
          Usually.
          A BEAT as they listen to the popping of the fire. A tension
          hanging between them. Then -

                         HICKS
          You did this on purpose, didn't you? You
          knew we wouldn't. be out before sundown.
          You wanted this to happen.

                         PRIEST
          You don't have the stomach for it --head
          back to Haibridge right now.
          Hicks glares at Priest.

                         HICKS
          The stomach I got. I was in the Rangers
          two years. Even fought in the Boondock
          Uprising...I saw some crazy things.

          Hicks studies Priest, in the firelight he looks tired. Old
          even.

          it just comes. Easy's got nothing to do
          with it.
          He pokes at the fire, it CRACKLES, feeding off the bodies.
          Something about the battle's opened him up. His guard's down.

          PRIEST (CONT' D)
          I take no pleasure in it. Killing. I
          know I've done more than my share --
          Whatever they do to me I have it coming.

          Give me your gun.

                         HICKS
          What?

                         PRIEST
          Give me your gun.

                         HICKS
          Why? You gonna shoot me now?
          Priest's stare is piercing. A pause then Hicks pulls his six
          shooter, handing it to him. Priest checks the chambers,
          giving it a quick spin.

                         0

                         

                         

                         

                         

          45.

                         PRIEST
          Don't anticipate the trajectory of your
          target. Know it.
          He stomps his foot into the fire, launching a GLOWING COAL OF
          ASH into the air. Priest quickly raises the gun and FIRES,
          the ash explodes, raining fiery red sparks.

                         HICKS
          You're teaching me to shoot?

                         PRIEST
          I'm teaching you to kill vampires. No
          more wild shots --

                         HICKS
          My ass I In case you didn't notice I was
          pretty damn good out there! And I sure
          as hell didn't see you doin' much when I
          had that blade buried in my arm.

                         (SPITS)
          Must've been too busy "focusing".
          Priest hands the gun back to Hicks.

                         PRIEST
          There's always-two points. A and B.
          Know the points and you'll know your
          target.

                         HICKS
          Ain't nothin' but a bunch of bullshit.

                         PRIEST
          I see ten crypts ...but only eight
          vampires. We find the missing, we'll
          find-Lucy.' What's the next nearest town?

                         HICKS
          Jericho. It's clear across the Plains.
          Gonna be a rough ride.

                         PRIEST
          Then you better get a good night's sleep.
          This bunch was easy, their bloodlines
          watered down by man.

                         (BEAT)
          Whoever took Lucy was a whole different
          breed.
          He tosses another body on the fire, tiny sparks floating into
          the night as --

                         

                         

                         

                         

          46.
          We hear the Banshee call of a STEAM WHISTLE, sharp and shrill
          as we CUT TO:

          EXT. DUNKIRK RAIL - NIGHT


          A STEAM LOCOMOTIVE
          Bearing down like death itself, teeth of the behemoth's grill
          leering: like a skull. Thick clouds of heavy smoke burst from
          its blast pipe, rails SQUEALING as the train RACES past.
          There re no Windows, just an unblinking black juggernaut,
          midnight willed into.a steel and iron frame. Terrifying.

          INT. TRAIN - CONTINUOUS

          As the cars BLAST PAST THE CAMERA we see each is filled with
          rows of BLACK COFFINS. A TALL FIGURE walks between them,
          wearing a BLACK TOP HAT AND CAPE.
          We only see 12im from behind.
          PALE ARMS reach from within the coffins, fingers touching the
          hem of the Figure's cape as he walks past.
          â¢ A FAMILIAR approaches.

                         FAMILIAR
          A man came on board at the last stop.
          Says he has something for you.
          The Figure nods. We-FOLLOW as he continues to the back of
          --- the car, sliding open the door

          INT. DINING CAR - CONTINUOUS

          Fine china on oak tables. The SNAKE OIL SALESMAN we saw back
          in Halbridge sits, nervously, in a plush chair. Candles
          light the car, casting the room in a surreal flicker.

          SNAKE OIL SALESMAN
          You told me tQ come to you if I had any
          information.

                         (SMILES)
          I have some.
          Silently, the Figure sits down across from him.

          SNAKE OIL SALESMAN (CONT'D)
          But before I tell you...and I hate to bring
          this, up -- there is the small matter
          regarding compensation.

          SNAKE OIL SALESMAN (CONT'D)
          Now your group's been REAL good for
          business so, of course, I'm willing to cut
          you a deal
          The Figure suddenly. LUNGES, grabbing the salesman by the
          throat, teeth clicking inches from the man's neck. WE STILL

          DO NOT SEE HIS FACE.

                         BLACK HAT
          I can SMELL the blood racing through your
          veins... Smells like dinner.
          The salesman starts to shake.

          SNAKE OIL SALESMAN

                         (VOICE QUAVERING)
          A-After you snatched that girl outside
          Haibridge...two nights later -- a Priest
          s-showed up.

                         BLACK HAT
          A Priest?

          SNAKE OIL SALESMAN
          He was meetin' with the local sheriff. A
          real shitkicker -- Booted me out of town
          before I could make a single sell.
          A pause..,.and then the Figure laughs. The salesman not sure
          how to react.

          SNAKE OIL SALESMAN (CONT'D)
          W-What's so funny?
          The Figure BURIES his teeth in the man's neck, taking a deep,
          deep drink, having his fill, dropping the body to the floor
          with a thud.
          THE CAMERA CONTINUES TO FOLLOW as the Figure walks to the
          back of the car, sliding open the door --

          INT. ASSEMBLY CAR - CONTINUOUS

          A sliver of light lands on

                         LUCY
          Lying on the floor, her face streaked with tears. Vestiges
          of the girl we met earlier already lost.

                         LUCY
          I won't tell anyone if you let me out...I

                         BLACK HAT
          You're in here for your own
          protection...If I let you out of this car
          you'll be torn apart a piece at a time.
          He walks to her, face still hidden in shadow. She starts to
          cry, pulling back to the wall. Angry.

                         LUCY
          My uncle's a Priestl one of the best.
          Hooll corns after youl
          The Figure laughs. Bending down to her level --

                         BLACK HAT
          I'm absolutely counting on it.
           And now we get our first look at her captor. A cross tattoo
          h s adows his face.
           The mark of the Priest.

          ENGINES SCREAMING Priest and Hicks BLAZE across the playa.

          A SERIES OF SHOTS
          WE WATCH as the sun crests the horizon and rises quickly
          across the sky. Clouds whip past at incredible speeds, time
          unfolding like a hallucinogenic until we're faced with --

                         THE PLAINS
          They sit parked on a bluff, the emptiness making Hick's eyes
          ache. A more desolate view couldn't be found in all of hell.

                         HICKS
          Walkin' Pete talked about this place --
          said it. used to be really somethin'.
          Everythin' growin' green as a goddamn
          dollar bill.

          'Course we had to go and screw it up by
          poisonin' everythin' -- nothin' pretty
          survives this world ...nothin' decent
          anyways.

                         (FROWNS)
          Just wish I could'a seen it.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          49.
          Priest pulls out a canteen of water, takes a sip. Hands it
          k7) to Hicks.

                         PRIEST
          How's your arm?

                         HICKS
          (hiding it from him)
          Sore. Cut's still open.
          As Hicks hands the canteen back, Priest suddenly grabs his arm
          it's completely healed. Not even a scar.

                         PRIEST
          You're a halfbreed.
          A BEAT as Hicks looks to the ground, when he speaks, it's in
          a voice just below his breath.

                         HICKS
          My grandmother... she was raped. Nobody
          knows -- It's recessive in my family. No
          bloodthirst. No light sensitivity. I'm
          not proud... but it's a part of me. Ain't
          nothin' I can do.
          (looks at Priest)
          I woulda told you...just didn't want you
          treatin' me no different.
          It hangs there. the'silence stretching like a rope,then
          Priest REVS his cycle; a flurry ofdust kicking up as he speeds
          away. HOLD ON HICKS -- Eyes stinging, he watches Priest.
          Finally he starts his bike, following.

          EXT. WASTELAND (THE PLAINS) - DAY


          A SERIES OF SHOTS AS -
          A. Priest inspects a TIRE TREAD in the sand, a cluster of
          clouds gathering in the sky behind him.
          B. A PAIR OF CRACKED BLACK GOGGLES half-buried in the dust.
          The kind used by a motorcycle rider.
          C. Hicks pulls a TORN PIECE OF CLOTHING (LUCY'SDRESS?)
          stashed in a rock crevice, he holds it up to Priest, GUNNING
          his engine as we CUT TO --

          EXT. WASTELAND (THE PLAINS) - LATER

          Priest and Hicks' BARRELING through the dust. Up ahead,
          something materializes in the desert --

          A TIN STRUCTURE
          Must be a mirage. Hicks blinks, can't believe his eyes. It
          looks abandoned.

                         HICKS
          Gotta be a desert rat.
          They park their bikes about twenty feet from the rickety
          structure, Hicks stepping off his bike and approaching.
          Carefully.

                         HICKS (CONT'D)
          Let me do the talkin'. The sun has a way
          of cookin' these people's brains so they
          ain't quite right -
          BANG! A rifle shot kicks up dust at Hicks' feet.

          VOICE (0.3.)
          Hold it right there, mistert
          Hicks freezes.
          A BEAT as. the front of the shack shows only a doorway hidden
          in shadow...thenan OLD MAN emerges, Rifle in hand. He COCKS
          it, making a bead for Hick's head.

                         OLD MAN
          Take another step and you'll be meetin'
          the Lord directly.

                         HICKS
          Easy now old timer. I'm a sheriff.
          The old man snorts, spitting a thick stream of tobacco,. it
          sizzles when it hits the dust.

                         OLD MAN
          Ain't no law out here but my own.
          Calm and cool, Priest shifts in his seat, drawing his gaze.

          THE MAN'S EYES WIDEN
          Seeing Priest clearly now for the first time.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          51.

          OLD MAN (CONT'D)
          Praise The Lord.
          Total attitude adjustment. He lowers the Rifle and smiles --
          revealing a gap tooth smile wide enough to drive a herd of
          cattle through.

          INT. TIN SHACK - DAY

          A dusty PHONOGRAPH playing a recording of an old-time
          spiritual, the record warped from the heat, distorting the
          voice as THE CAMERA PANS PAST hundreds of homemade CRUCIFIXES
          haphazardly nailed across the wall.

                         OLD MAN
          Cleaned the place up a bit. Been years
          since I had any kind of company 'sides
          jackrabbits but I knew you was comity' --
          Dreams don't lie.'
          Ignoring Hicks, the old man pours BLACK TEA into a rusty can,
          handing it to Priest.

          OLD MAN (CON'S I D)
          Most people don't remember what you folk
          done -- Don' t WANT to remember. But I
          do. I know what you can do.
          (making the sign of the cross)
          You are God's mighty sword fused into
          flesh. One of the chosen.. Touched by
          His very ha nd so peace could finally come
          to this cur sed land.
          Hicks snorts.

                         HICKS
          Sounds like a bunch of religious mumbo
          jumbo to me.
          The old man stares fixedly at Priest.

                         OLD MAN
          Now you tell the Clergy this here is an
          authentic miracle, I want it registered.
          It's mine.

                         PRIEST
          Miracle?

          The Angels. Never seen so many loot
          souls, breaks my heart just to think of
          it. This ain't no place for nothin'
          divine.
          The man's fevered belief unsettles Priest, he's unsure how to
          respond.

                         PRIEST
          You saw angels?

                         OLD MAN
          Sure as chit.

                         PRIEST
          How many?

                         OLD MAN
          Don't know, too many to count. Hundreds.
          Thousands. Some nights the sky was so
          thick you couldn't see the stars.
          His eyes suddenly light up, remembering something.
          i OLD MAN (CONT'D)
          Here! Look at this --
          He goes to a shelf, it's been turned into a MAKESHIFT SHRINE --
          rw=ging through a jumbled collection of crucifixes, yellowed
          photographs, collected junk.
          He pulls out a GLASS JAR containing SOMETHING MISSHAPEN
          floating in murky water, the old man proudly showing it to
          Priest and Hicks.

                         HICKS
          What is it?

                         OLD MAN
          It's their spoor! They'd be flyin' above
          and this stuff would drop from the sky
          like manna.

                         HICKS
          That's angel shit?

                         OLD MAN
          Scooped it up myself.
          (offering it to Hicks)
          You wanna hold it?
          Hicks backs away, shaking his head.

          OLD MAN (CONT'D)
          Suit yourself.
          Priest still doesn't know what to make of the man but he
          senses something to be gained. He tries changing the subject.

                         PRIEST
          These angels...di.d you ever see them
          during the day?

                         OLD MAN
          No, I reckon'. that's when they'd go back
          home for some shut eye -- Gettin' the
          world ready for the rapture takes a lot
          of work. Praise God.

                         PRIEST
          Home?

                         OLD MAN
          The castle -
          .:,He:points out the window, far away, atop a craggy peak sits
          the -remains of a CASTLE --

          OLD MAN (CONT'D)
          Beautiful place. Wonder of the world. I
          used to watch `em every night, takin' to
          the sky in all of God's glory,

                         (LEANS FORWARD)
          I never would disturb `em though. God's
          children like their privacy.
          He winks, smiling that crazy smile. Priest considers the
          possibility of a lead here -- but Hicks just gazes at the old
          man like he's nuts as we CUT TO:

          EXT. TIT' SHACK - LATER

          The boys mounting up their bikes, about to head out. The old man
          approaches Priest.

                         OLD MAN
          Wait! I want you to have somethin'
          before you go
          He presses a HOMEMADE CROSS into Priest's hand. It's a real
          beauty, flecked with colored stones. A lot of love and care
          went into this one.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          54.

          OLD MAN (CONT' D)
          Remember, a man comes into this world
          with one thing. His soul. He's lucky if
          he's still got it when he leaves.
          Priest pockets the cross, REVVING his cycle and with a final
          nod -- he and Hicks speed into the wasteland. The old man
          watches, his cracked face squinting as the sun flashes off
          the metal of the machines.

                         CUT TO:

          EXT. DUNKIRK RAIL (WASTELAND) - DAY

          The vampire train shooting down the track, blown tumbleweeds
          catching the scrub brush as it races by.

          INT. TRAIN CAR - SAME TIME

          Lucy is on her knees, scratching her nails against the wood
          floor. Testing it. Splintery shards come up in tiny clusters.
          From outside,.:the sound of a padlock opening, a chain
          dropping to the floor. Lucy quickly sits, making innocent.
          A SERVANT FAMILIAR enters, carrying a tray of food, his eyes
          grotesquely roam Lucy's body.
          Lucy smiles sweetly, taking the tray.

                         LUCY
          Thank you.
          The Familiar turns to leave.
          WHAPI Lucy SLAMS the tray over his head and he collapses to
          the floor.
          She makes a run for it. But the Familiar manages to grab her
          ankle.knocking her down, she kicks at him as he holds fast,
          hissing.
          Two more FAMILIARS run in and grab her arms, wrestling her to
          the floor. She struggles furiously but it's no use, she
          screams as we CUT TO:

          EXT. CASTLE - LATER

          A sad collection of crumbling stone walls and turrets. All the
          more surreal for rising up in the absolute nothing of the
          wasteland.

                         Â¢

                         

                         

                         

                         

          55.
          Priest and Hicks stand, surveying the ancient ruin. Hicks
          can't help but laugh.

                         HICKS

                         (SARCASTIC)
          Yep. Truly a wonder of the world...good
          thing we listened to the fossil. Don't
          know how we'd find Lucy without him.

                         PRIEST
          Vampires sometimes use abandoned
          structures as a perch.
          (looks at Hicks)
          Watch for booby traps.
          And with that he enters the--

          EXT. CASTLE COURTYARD - CONTINUOUS

          Desert shrubs sprout like weeds between the stones, once
          proud turrets rotting to dust, everything bleached by the
          weather. Whatever this place was -- the desert owns it now.

                         HICKS
          Why we listen' to that crackpot? Crazy
          fucker's so blinded by faith he's
          batahit. That's called a zealot in my.
          book.

                         (BEAT)
          I'm startin' to think you might be one
          yourself. You ever think bout that?
          Priest doesn't respond, squinting his eyes.
          At the opposite end of the courtyard is an opening. It
          leads into a CHAMBER of some kind.

          INT. CASTLE CHAMBER - CONTINUOUS

          Musty. Cool. Dark. Walls rising high into a cone as
          sunlight streams in from an opening in the top. Hicks and
          Priest enter, stepping carefully over PILES OF (GARBAGE
          littering the floor.

                         HICKS
          This is bullshit. Lucy's been gone five
          days'-- every stupid minute we waste here
          is a minute more she gets farther-away.
          Priest turns and sees a STONE STAIRCASE, uneven steps leading.
          downwards...too dark to tell where though.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          56.

                         PRIEST
          Stay here. If anything comes up the
          steps that isn't me -- Shoot it.
          Before Hicks can reply,.Priest heads down the stairs, darkness
          swallowing him with every step.

                         HICKS
          Great.

          DOWN THE STAIRS
          The air seems thicker here, the darkness claustrophobic.
          Enveloping. It takes a moment for Priests' eyes to adjust.

                         A CATACOMB
          Actually more a cave. Miles and miles. Twisting, jagged and
          moist. Endless corners, weaving into a dark and hideous maze.
          Priest heads into it

          INT. CASTLE CHAMBER - SAME

          Frustrated, Hicks kicks at the garbage.
          There's something underneath.
          He brushes aside the refuse, uncovering a . bunch' of SMALL
          WHITE SHAPES, breath catching as he realizes what it is:
          Bones.

          INT. CATACOMB - SAME

          It's quiet.
          Priest moves through the darkness, footsteps not even a
          whisper, heading deeper and deeper into the labyrinth as

          INT. CASTLE CHAMBER - SAMB

          Hicks is now at the chamber wall,'running his hand along it,
          feels grooves lining its surface.
          Stepping back, he sees they form an image-of some kind. Hard
          to make it out in the darkness.
          He leafs through the garbage, pulling out a piece of BROKEN

                         GLASS AS

                         

                         

                         

                         

          57.

          INT. CATACOMB - SAME

          Priest turns a jagged corner and looks down the longest, most
          narrow tunnel yet. A light shines at the end. A TORCH.
          Flickering gently.
          A SHADOW brushes past the light, moving so fast it barely
          registers. Could just be a trick of the eye. Or not.
          Priest moves towards it.

          IT. CASTLE CHAMBER - SAME
          Hicks angles the broken glass under the light, reflecting a
          faint beam onto the wall, revealing a HUGE CARVING cut into

                         THE STONE:
          1L0Z.J.PIf .! i
          Primitive but very creepy. We linger on the image, the
          terror of the people, the viciousness of the creature. Truly
          horrific.

          INT. CATACOMB - SAME

          Quiet. Just the low how], of a breeze moving through the
          tunnel.
          Priest walks into an ANIMAL PEN of sorts, a hay-like
          substance covering the floor, the smell of something bestial.
          He,covers his nose, looking around, something in the corner
          catching his eye ---

                         TWO BODIES
          splayed across the ground like rag dolls. He crouches to
          take a closer look...

          WHAM!
          SOMETHING. barrels into him with superhuman force!
          Acting on instinct, Priest FOLDS AND ROLLS. Kicking the
          thing off him and PUSHING off the wall for a blistering
          recovery.
          Whatever it is, it's fast. Quickly countering for every move
          he gives, neither able to get the upper hand. Too dark to
          make out what it is.
          Priest locks his arms around the shape's arms, SLAb24=G it
          against the wall, illuminating it under the torch light.

          IT'S A FEMALE PRIEST

                         

                         

                         

                         

          58.
          o A BEAT as they stand staring at each other, unsure what to
          say. The cross tattoo covers her face, shadowing fierce
          eyes. Every inch a warrior.
          Time seems to stop for these two. Their whole dark history
          their bend -- passing between them in one glance.

                         PRIESTESS
          How did you find me?
          Priest doesn't reply. She narrows her eyes, suspicious.

                         PRIESTESS (CONT'D)
          Did the Clergy send you?

                         PRIEST
          No.

                         (BEAT)
          Why would they?
          She nods towards the bodies, we now see tb=1re.-VAMPIRZ-

          CORPSES.

                         PRIESTESS
          I've been busy.
          Off Priest's reaction we CUT TO:

          INT. CASTLE CHAMBER - SAME TIME

          Hicks looking up to see the light; from the hole in the
          geilingwinkinc_out. The sun is setting.
          Slipping, he drops the piece og glass, cutting his finger.
          Drawing blood.

                         HICKS
          Shit.
          He wipes the blood on his pants, not noticing as a A LARGE
          SHAPE looms in the archway behind him...

          INT. CATACOMB - SAME

          The two warriors eye each other, the. air heavy between them.

                         PRIESTESS
          If you didn't come for me...why are you
          here?

                         PRIEST
          I should be asking you the same question.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          59.
          The bestial smell stings their nostrils, smells good.

                         PRIESTESS
          There's another one around here
          somewhere.

                         PRIEST
          Where?

                         PRIESTESS
          I don't know...but it's not like the
          others.
          They're interrupted by the sound of GUNFIRE echoing off the
          tunnel walls. Priest turns.

                         PRIEST
          Hicks.
          He starts down the tunnel. The Priestess quickly following.

          INT. STAIRS LEADING INTO THE CATACOMB - NIGHT

          Hicks is sprawled at the base of the stairs, bloodied and
          bruised. Both guns pointed at

          THE TOP OF THE STAIRS
          SOMETHING is lurking. A hulking shadow, sounds like a rabid
          bull. We catch the TIP OF A CLAW scraping at the stone floor.
          Priest approaches from down the tunnel, senses on full alert.

                         PRIEST
          It's too big to fit down here. That's
          why you're still alive.

                         HICKS
          What the hell is that thing?I

                         HICKS
          I'm not stupid. Vampires don't look like
          that.

          PRIESTESS (0.8.)
          They used to.
          The Priestess steps out from behind Priest. Startling Hicks.

          She doesn't even bother to respond,.just shooting a look as
          the two warriors bound

          UP THE STEPS
          Charging into battle. Priest BURSTS from the stairway
          LEAPING up and over as the Priestess rolls off to the side.
          He-lands beside her, the two turning to face down --

                         THE VAMPIRE
          A fearsome creature -- much more terrifying than the
          Nightshade variety. Bigger, more ferocious. The ancient
          cousin to the more modern vampire.
          The beast opens its mouth and lets loose with a SCREAM, its
          breath vile.

                         THE PRIESTS
          Split up. The Priestess LEAPING to the stone wall and
          climbing up the rock. Priest goes the opposite way, ROLLING
          across the floor, keeping low.

                         I

                         THE VAMPIRE
          With a screech, goes for the Priestess. Crawling up the wall,
          hunched like a rat, talons ferociously . digging, into: rock.
          Coordinating an attack wordlessly, the Priests make their move:

                         THE PRIESTESS
          Lets go of the wall, PLUMMETING straight towards the vampire,
          the creature FLASHING its fangs in anticipation.

                         PRIEST
          Leaps from below, darting up the rock, taking advantage of
          the distraction, landing on the creature's back and wrapping
          his arms around its neck. Going for the deathlock.
          With a SHRIEK the creature WHIPS its head with crack force
          sending Priest flying. The Priestess, still in mid-drop,
          CATCHES him and they both hit the ground with their feet.

                         PRIESTESS
          Should we lead it into open air? More
          room to. maneuver.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          61.

                         PRIEST
          Better to keep it contained.
          The vampire's lathered into an animal frenzy now, wailing and
          scuttling around the circular wall in crazy patterns.
          Suddenly -- with a stone shattering BOOM! it BURSTS through
          the hole, FLYING out into the night.

                         PRIESTESS
          Or not.
          They race outside.

          EXT. CASTLE COURTYARD - CONTINUOUS

          The Priests look up to find the vampire clawed around a
          turret, shadowed in the moonlight.
          WHOOSH!. Great leathery wings unfold from its back as it
          SWOOPS low, coming in for the'kill.

                         PRIEST
          Darts behind a boulder just in time. The creature's talons
          SCRAPING at the rock before it soars back to the sky,
          He pulls out his bible, grabbing and tossing a handful of --

                         THROWING CROSSES
          CUTTING through the air, sparkling in the moonlight,
          beautiful. BUT
          They BOUNCE harmlessly off the creature's wings, knifing back
          to the ground, imbedding deep in the stone, Priest having to
          nimbly: dodge his own weaponry.
          THE CREATURE HOWLS! Blazing straight for him.
          Undaunted. Priest looks at the Priestess and folds his hands
          into the prayer position, leveling his breath, pulse slowing
          as the screaming beast bares down like a freight train!

                         THE PRIESTESS
          Quickly scoops up TWO LARGE ROCKS -- HURTLING them towards
          the vampire. HER EYES LOCK WITH PRIEST'S as she too folds
          her hand, into the prayer position.

          RY âNG GOES BLACK
          Silence. Then --

                         

                         

                         

                         

          62.
          The sound of a heartbeat.
          The juncture between instants. A fissure.
          A BRIGHT FLASH -- we see Priest LEAPING through the air --
          EVERYTHING AROUND HIM FROZEN -- the creature, the rocks, the
          Priestess.

          EVERYTHING GOES BI CK
          A BRIGHT FLASH again -- and now Priest is using the frozen
          rocks as STEPS -- LAUNCHING his body until he is above the

                         CREATURE --

          ï¿½1ï¿½_ M, .Q
          A BRIGHT FLASH again -- and now Priest is ON the behemoth, he
          pulls out the FAMILIAR'S KNIFE, twirling it in his hand --
          EVERYTHING GOES BLACx
          And WHAM1 we fuse back into real time as the creature CRASHES
          to the ground. Its DECAPITATED HEAD rolling to a stop, face
          frozen in a horrible rictus.

                         A BEAT

                         O
          as the world seems to hold its breath then --
          Priest lands in a crouch, dropping next to the Priestess, her
          hands still locked in the prayer position. She turns to him.

                         PRIESTESS
          Not bad.
          Suddenly the CREATURE'S BODY erupts into ablistering death
          spasm! Talons clacking like STRAIGHT RAZORS, flailing
          dangerously close to the two of them.

                         BAMI
          A single bullet. pierces its heart and the body collapses with
          a THUD. Once and for all -- dead.
          ANGLE ON HICKS in the archway, smoke coming off his gun. He
          looks at the Priests.

                         HICKS
          Point A...meet point fuckin' B.
          He smiles, twirling his six shooters back into their holsters.

                         CUT TO:

          EXT. COURTYARD - LATER

          Hicks examining the fallen creature, poking at the carcass
          with his gun. In some crazy, distant way he's related to
          this thing.
          He raises his hand, comparing it to the beast's talon.
          Shakes his head.

          ATOP THE CASTLE WALL
          Priest and the Priestess stare out at the Wasteland,
          uncomfortable with looking at each other.

                         PRIEST
          This was a Pureblood.

                         PRIESTESS
          we both know that's impossible -- They
          haven't existed for a millennium.

                         (BEAT)
          What's going on here?

                         PRIEST
          .I don't know.
          A BEAT filled with awkward silence -- when the Priestess
          ktï¿½ speaks it comes as a relief for both. An unloosening of
          things long held tight.

                         PRIESTESS
          Sector Seven was the only place I could
          find work. Waste Management.

                         (BEAT)
          Nobody else would hire me. %No
          applicable skills.&

                         PRIEST
          I heard that one too.

                         PRIESTESS
          A week ago, a family camping out on the
          Perimeter approached me --.Told me
          vampires were terrorizing their village
          and that the government wouldn't do
          anything about it.

                         PRIEST
          Did you go to The Clergy?

                         PRIESTESS
          They wouldn't see me,

                         (LOOKS DOWN)

          64.

                         PRIESTESS (CONT'D)
          By the time I got to the village it was
          completely razed. Nothing left. Women.
          Children. All dead ...they didn't even
          bother to feed.

                         (BEAT)
          I've been on their trail ever
          since...could be the same group who took
          your niece.

                         PRIEST
          Could be.
          The Priestess glances towards Hicks.

                          PRIESTESS
          Does the lawman know what you'll do if
          you find her?

                         PRIEST
          He knows.

                         PRIESTESS
          He'll try to stop you.

                         PRIEST
          He won't be able to.
          She pauses a moment, regarding him.

                         PRIESTESS
          You know, some nights I still dream we're
          back on the frontlines ... I wake up, I'm
          sweating... my muscles all clenched like
          I'm ready for something -- But I don't
          know what.

                         PRIEST
          Me too.

                         PRIESTESS
          Nights like that ...I don't go back to
          sleep.

                         (BEAT)
          But on other nights ...the good nights
          I dream about other things.

                         PRIEST
          ..Like what?

                         PRIESTESS
          You.
          Priest stares at her, not sure what to say. Lucky for him,
          the moment gets interrupted by --

          The warriors lock eyes, knowing something's been started --
          but.unsure of what.
          They head down the stone steps.

          EXT COURTYARD - MOMENTS LATER
          Hicks is lifting up one of the creature's wings. There's
          some sort of BLACK MARK on its skin.

                         PRIESTESS
          it must be a birthmark of some kind.

                         HICKS
          That ain't no birthmark -- it's a brand.
          The Priestess studies the mark, something about it making her
          skin crawl. Maybe because it's in'theshape of a top hat.

                         PRIESTESS
          There's something else you need to see...

                         CUT TO:

          INT. ,CATACOMB

          Carrying a torch, the Priestess. leads Priest and Hicks
          through the maze, the deeper they go the more subterranean it
          feels. Bowels of the earth.

                         PRIESTESS
          I found this just before I was attacked -

          AN UNDERGROUND CHAMBER
          Huge. Cavernous. Our group appearing as tiny shapes set
          against the awesome scale of the place. Hundreds of LARGE
          HOLES gouged into the walls, stretching as far as torchlight
          allows. An incredible sight.

                         PRIEST
          It's a tomb. Big enough for an army.

                         HICKS
          Guess they're not as endangered as
          everyone thought.

                         (BEAT)
          0 But where'd they go?.
          We hear a LOUD SHRIEK - and a MASSIVE SWARM OF BATS sweep
          through the depths of the chamber, black wings fluttering.

                         PRIEST
          Only one way to find out...

          INT. CAVE - LATER

          Our group moving deeper into the dark cavern, a moan of wind
          echoing off the gorge wail behind them, massive black
          stalactites hanging overhead. Very creepy.
          They move quickly, Priest ahead of the other two. Hicks
          gazes at the Priestess, admiring her body. Any man would.
          He works up his courage and approaches her. Quietly.

                         HICKS
          Are Priests allowed to, you know...have
          relations?

                         PRIESTESS
          We take a vow of celibacy at inception.
          Hicks can't be sure -- did she just look at Priest when she
          said that?

                         HICKS
          Look...I was uh, wondering --. how did he
          do that little stunt back there?

                         PRIESTESS
          All Priests can do it.

                         HICKS
          Including you?
          She nods.

                         HICKS (CONT'D)
          So what's the trick?

                         PRIESTESS
          No trick. You just have to remember.

                         HICKS
          Remember... what?

                         PRIESTESS
          Time is relative.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          67.
          Priest snaps up his hand, cutting off their conversation,
          something strange up ahead -- He slowly moves forward, the
          tunnel sharply dropping, feeding into a --

                         HUGE CHAMBER
          Not like the cave, this is more earthen. Like the inside of a
          wasp nest, curved walls made of dirt and spit, Priest covering
          his nose and mouth as he's hit with a massive stench.

          A GIANT SHADOW
          Looms before him, we_don't see what it is.
          As the Priestess and Hicks enter the chamber, Hicks coughs,
          reeling from the smell, the Priestess wrapping a cloth around
          her mouth -- the CAMERA focusing only on theirexpressions as
          they take in the horrible spectacle before them.

                         PRIEST
          You said the next nearest town was
          Jericho.

                         HICKS
          Yeah.

                         PRIEST
          Then we better go see.

                         HICKS
          . See what?

                         PRIESTESS
          -- What they left of it.
          PUSH IN ON HICKS -- knots of rope tightening in his
          stomach... only now realizing how truly black the path before
          him will be.

          The NIGHT TRAIN thundering across the rails, almost obscene
          in the bright sunlight. An intruder from the darkness
          We hear a SCRATCHING sound, something scraping. Heavy
          breathing as we MOVE INTO...

          INT. ASSEMBLY CAR - SAME

          THE SERVANT FAMILIAR slides the door open, carrying food for
          Lucy, no tray this time.

          But she's not there.
          He SCREECHES, dropping the-food as he runs to a HOLE ripped in
          the wood floor, smatterings of blood around the edges. It's
          not very big, just enough for a small body to fit through.
          The Familiar sticks his head through the opening and -,-

                         RAILROAD TRACKS
          CLACK past at a furious speed, inches from his head! The
          noise is deafening..

          LUCY (0.S.)
          Hey...
          The Familiar turns -- Lucy's perched inside one of the JOISTS
          lining the underside of the train.
          KRACKI- She lets loose with a well-placed KICK, snapping his
          head back so he catches on the track. With ascream, he's
          quickly SUCKED out the train, pulverized on the track.
          Lucy's covers her mouth, her nails an ugly bloody mass.
          She's come this far, time to go the rest.
          She manages to carefully crawl from joist to joist, moving
          along the underside of the train, her body just centimeters
          from the passing track.

                         OHB SLIPS
          Catching herself just in time. Her eyelids practically
          brushing the wood.
          Taking a deep breath, she manages to hoist herself through
          the rest of the way finally making it to the CABOOSE.
          She pulls herself up onto the back of the car. Now what? The
          train is blazing past the wasteland at an incredible speed.
          Only one thing to do.
          She makes the sign of the cross, closes her eyes and JUMPS

          A dustorm.
          The plain's a shifting veil of sand, parting to reveal a
          vista of dunes, wind shipping across them.

          As quickly as it opened the veil closes again, shifting to
          reveal OUR TRIO plowing through, blast goggles and
          respirators covering their faces. The Priestess riding a
          cycle identical to Priest's.
          In the distance we can make out a cluster of structures as
          they arrive at Jericho.

          EXT. JERICHO - DAY

          Riding into town. The storm making it difficult to see
          anything as they idle onto main street. It's deserted -- The
          only sound a saloon door creaking noisily in the wind.
          Ominous signs left in the vampires' wake are everywhere --

          BROKEN DOORS, SHATTERED WINDOWS, OVERTURNED VEHICLES.

                         PRIEST
          We separate. Go through each building,
          see what we find.

                         HICKS
          I'll start with the sheriff.

                         PRIESTESS
          Be careful. Just because it's daylight
          doesn't mean it's safe.
          Hicks nods, tightening the twin BANDOLEERS across his chest.

          EXT. JAIL DAY

          Everything is eerily quiet, just the sound of the wind.
          Hicks crouches just outside the door, examining SPENT SHELL
          CASINGS littering the walkway. He pulls out his six-shooter,
          pushing the door open with his gun, stepping inside --

          INT. JAIL CONTINUOUS

          The place is a mess.
          DUST BLOWN IN FROM THE STORM COVERS EVERYTHING, broken
          furniture scattered everywhere, glass littering the floor.
          Whatever went down here -- someone put up a hell of a fight.

                         HICKS
          'Damn.
          He shakes his head, heading towards the holding area as --

          INT. BROTHEL - SAME TIME

          The Priestess walks in, flurries of yellow dust swirling in
          her wake, filling the room.
          if the jail was a disaster zone, this place is just plain
          creepy. Red sofas, red curtains, hell, even red wine.
          Everything set up for a great time...just no people.
          A PIANO sits nestled in the corner, she walks to it and runs
          her finger across the dust covered keys.
          It comes up wet and red. Blood.

          MUSIC SUDDENLY BURSTS FROM THE PIANO
          The plinking keys playing by themselves, activated by
          pneumatic pegs on a rotating paper roll, filling the lonely
          room with tin-pan music.

          INT. BEDROOM - DAY

          The sound of a record skipping.
          Priest steps through a doorway, the door already ripped off
          its hinges. Broken furniture and glass.
          It's obvious a FAMILY lived here, children's clothes and
          wooden toys messily strewn across the floor.
          He walks to an OLD PHONOGRAPH sitting on the windowsill,
          still playing, placing the needle back in its cradle.
          That's when so=thing out the window ratchgo hiseve...

          EXT. JERICHO/MAIN STREET DAY

          Hicks, done searching, meets up with the Priestess in the
          middle of the street, he's pretty disturbed. Wind howling
          around him.

                         HICKS
          There ain't nobody left. Nobody.

                         PRIESTESS

                         (OMINOUS)
          Too many mouths to feed.

                         HICKS
          Where's Priest?

                         

                         

                         

                         

          71.
          But the Priestess's already focused on something else, gazing
          at something behind the general store. He turns to see what
          it is.

                         PRIEST
          On the ground KNEELING. Head down, engaging in some kind of
          prayer.
          THE CAMERA FOLLOWS as they slowly approach, wondering what
          the hell is going on. As they get closer they see the full

                         PICTURE:
          Before Priest are THREE LARGE WOODEN CROSSES, A NAKED BODY ON
          EACH, crucified. Because of the swirling sand it's hard to
          make out their faces but it's obvious the poor souls are
          already dead.
          Immediately the Priestess drops beside Priest, joining him --
          And it is only now that we get a good look at the crucifieds'

                         FACES
          They're Priests.

                         CUT TO:

          EXT. SOMEWHERE IN THE WASTELANDS - DAY

          Bare feet running on the salt-flats.
          It's Lucy. Covered in dirt, battered and bruised but
          chugging along. There is absolutely NOTHING out here, only

                         LUCY AND

          A BLACK FIGURE DROPS SILENTLY FROM THE SKY BEHIND HER
          it wears a BLACK COAT, fluttering in the wind as it touches
          down, the fabric cascading across the earth in long dark folds.
          The Figure's face is completely covered by a BLACK COWBOY
          HAT. The only thing we can see is a CHEROOT Sticking out
          from where the mouth would be.
          A brief moment as the tip of the cigar glows, a puff of smoke
          exhaled. It drops to the ground, silver spurs making a
          slight CHING sound as a BLACK BOOT stamps it out.
          Lucy hears the sound and turns just in time to see -
          y I ATHICK CHAIN __SHOOTING OUT from within the Fiaure',
          coat. a HUGE METAL_ FINGERED CLAW at use ! The claw SLAMS
          into Lucy, thick fingers CLAMPING around her, knocking her to

                         THE GROUND

                         

                         

                         

                         

          72.
          She digs her nails into the earth but it's no use as the chain
          DRAGS her backwards and she quickly-disappears INTO the coat
          with a SCREAM. The folds enveloping her in a dark embrace.
          In one graceful sweep, the Black Figure leaps to the sky.
          Quickly disappearing.
          We see the cheroot on the ground. Spent. The only evidence
          that anyone or anything was ever out here at all.

                         DISSOLVE TO:

          EXT. JERICHO - DAY

          Caught between sheets of swirling dust and.sand, the images
          like hallucinations, moments of ritual and grief --
          A. The crucified Priests taken down from their crosses,
          their naked bodies like ragdolls.
          B. The corpses now wrapped in white cloth, carefully placed
          amongst the makeshift pyre.
          C. Flames engulfing the bodies, a twisty column of smoke
          rising, the sun and clouds painting the sky pink and gold.
          OUR TRIO stands before the pyre gazing into the fire, it Pops
          consuming more of the bodies, if the Priests listen close
          enough they can hear the end of an era.

                         HICKS
          Don't make no sense. What were they
          doin' out here?

                         PRIESTESS
          The same thing as us.

                         (BEAT)
          Someone's drawing us out.

                         HICKS
          Who?
          The Priests just stare into the fire, not having any idea.

                         HICKS (CONT'D)
          I imagine you'll have to go back to the
          Cities, inform the Clergy.
          A sudden silence.

                         PRIEST
          We're not going back.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          73.
          The Priestess looks at him, he speaks for her as well but
          she's still shocked to hear the words out loud. A lifetime
          of conditioning..

                         PRIESTESS
          We'll burn for this.

                         PRIEST
          (looking at the pyre)
          We already are.
          Something in the flames catches the Priestess's eye, in the
          charred remains of one of the corpses -- SOMETHING'S GLOWING.
          She wraps her arm, plunging her hand through the bones,
          pulling out the object. Quickly, she tosses it into a'barrel
          of water. it hisses, steam rising as it cools.
          Priest reaches into the barrel, his hand emerging with a

          METAL SPIKE.

                         HICKS
          It's a railroad spike. My pop used to
          work boxcars before they shut down -- Why
          the hell would anyone wanna swallow that?
          A beat as Priest puts it together.

                         PRIEST
          He wanted us to find it. It's a clue.

                         PRIESTESS
          Where's the closest track?

          CUT TO.

          INT. JAIL DAY

          Hicks pulls a LARGE MAP off the wall, blowing off a layer of
          dust, drawing a line across the paper with his finger.

                         HICKS
          The Dunkirk Line. It starts all the way
          in the backcountry, bought the ore from
          the deep mines. There were about five
          stops along the route. I think.
          He draws several Xs along the line. His hand coming to a
          stop on a particular forboding PATCH OF MOUNTAINS.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          74.

                         HICKS (CONT'D)
          Looks like Jericho was, the last town it
          glances before'. heading around the Linwood
          Mountains...Then it goes to the last stop.

                         PRIEST
          Where?
          He draws one final X at the end of the line. Looks up.

                         HICKS
          The Cities.
          So there it is. The Priestess narrows her eyes.

                         PRIESTESS
          They must have been picking up different
          factions along the way. Moving during
          the day, feeding at night.

                         HICKS
          But headin' to the Cities is suicide.
          The sun will kill `em -- there's nowhere
          to hide.
          Priest gazes at the map, deeply troubled.

                         PRIEST
          They won't have to.
          And with the SHRIEK of the train whistle we CUT TO:

          EXT. WASTELAND (DUNKIRK RAIL) - DAY

          The Night Train barreling down the track, blasting along on
          its grim trajectory. Suddenly --

                         THE CAMERA
          Overtakes the train. Snaking along the rail at an incredible
          speed, leaving the train in its tracks (sorry) as it blisters
          across the Wasteland through craggy mountains and finally
          ending up in

          THE CITIES.
          And it is only now that we see exactly what Priest means.
          THICK CLOUD OF INDUSTRIAL SMOKE covers the metropolis.
          There is no sun.

                         CUT TO:

          INT. TRAIN CAR


                         V-)
          A BLACK COWBOY HAT coolly tilted down, exposing .a cheroot
          clutched between thin lips. A trail of smoke lazily floats
          upwards.

                         DARK FIGEMH
          A fine catch yes?
          (the voice is oily, a dark

                         WHISPER)
          She'd be dead if not for me...swallowed
          by the wasteland.
          We see Lucy on the floor at the Figure's feet, his pale hand
          runs calmly through her hair.
          From the shadows, Black Hat steps forward, looking down at
          Lucy. She struggles but the hand tightens its grip.

                         BLACK HAT
          What do you want for her?
          And now her captor lifts his hat -- revealing paper-thin
          skin, eyes like black coal. This is RUNE, a bounty hunter.

                         RUNE
          You know what r want.
          Black Hat's eyes flick upwards, glinting in the. candlelight.

                         BLACK HAT
          Don't. go too far, Rune.

                         RUNE
          He comes for her still.

                         BLACK HAT
          Of course he does.

                         RUNE
          Let me have him.

                         BLACK HAT
          No.
          Rune smiles,'revealing an impressive set of vampire fangs.

                         RUNE'
          I'm sure she'll fetch a nice price out
          In the zone -- they don't care what
          condition their meat's in...as long as
          it's easy to chew.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          76.
          Black Hat eyes him.

                         BLACK HAT
          Don't get involved in this.

                         RUNE
          I was involved long before you showed
          up.

                         (SEETHING)
          I've been waiting years for a chance at
          him...and now that he's here I find x
          have to ask a Prime permission...
          Like a snake, a finger of the claw emerges from the folds of
          his jacket, wrapping itself around Lucy's neck.

                         RUNE (CONT'D)
          My how things have changed.
          Ever so slightly, the metal finger SQUEEZES Lucy's throat,
          choking her.

                         RUNE (CONT'D)
          I never cared about your war. Never got
          Involved. Us halfbreeds. We were
          exiles -- rejected by both humans and
          vampires. All we wanted was a quiet
          place. But he wiped out my whole tribe.

                         (BEAT)
          Maybe it's time to return the favor.
          The metal finger wraps TIGHTEtR, Lucy gasps, the "tension
          becoming unbearable until finally

                         BLACK HAT
          Fine. He's Yours.
          As if on command, the finger retreats back into the jacket,
          Lucy COLLAPSING to the floor coughing and choking.

                         RUNE
          And -- she's yours.
          He laughs, sounds like a death rattle, dropping the cigar to
          the floor, spurs chiming as he walks out the car door, long
          dark coat fluttering behind him, disappearing into the night.

                         BLACK HAT
          Annoyed, picks up the still burning cigar, squeezing it in
          his hand. He turns to Lucy.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          77.

                         BLACK HAT
          And as for you uy dear...You're more
          trouble than I anticipated. Must be your
          uncle's blood in you.

                         (BEAT)
          A shame he'll never see what you'll
          become. I would've loved to see his face.
          And then he is upon her, saliva mixing with blood as he drinks.

                         CUT TO:

          EXT. WASTELAND - DAY

          ROAR1 Our trio plow through the scrubby desert growth, chewing

          A SERIES OF INTERCUT SHOTS
          The VAMPIRE TRAIN chugging along on its dark course, heading
          for the Cities.
          ï¿½Our'crew hellbent on stopping `em. The two locked on a fated

          Twilight.
          Hicks and the two Priests ride past tumbleweed drifts, the
          surrounding desertscape golden in the fading light.
          Ahead a forboding series of CRAGGY MOUNTAINS, awaits, a
          WINDING TRAIL criss-crossing through the peaks.
          They stop, their machines idling next to each other, taking
          stock of the huge task _beâ¬ore' them.

          Headlight crossbeams leading the way, their cycles navigate
          the twisty trail, cutting across sheer canyon walls, teetering
          on the brink of an abyss, rock slides a constant threat.

          EXT. BEGGAR'S PASS CAMP - LATE NIGHT

          They've set up camp for the night on the lip of a ridge.
          Hicks and the Priestess sit by a fire dunking their feet in a
          nearby stream, the wear and tear of their journey evident on
          the sheriff's face.
          Priest lies close by, asleep.

                         HICKS
          If we push it hard we'll gain two days on
          'em. Should be enough to get us a jump.

                         PRIESTESS
          We'need more than a jump. We need a
          miracle.

                         HICKS
          That's the funny thing about time --
          He dips his hand in the water and raises it, letting the
          liquid leak from between his fingers.

                         HICKS (CONT'D)
          It's always runin' right through my
          fingers.

                         PRIESTESS
          You should try harder, sheriff.
          She cups her hand in the water, bringing it to her lips for a
          drink. Hicks smiles, leaning forward, something on his mind.

                         HICKS
          You ever regret it? Bein' a Priest?

                         PRIESTESS
          No.

                         HICKS
          What about a husband, children...A
          family?

                         PRIESTESS
          I've had a family -- just not the kind
          you're familiar with.

          Hicks glances at Priest.

                         HICKS
          What? You mean Mr. Laffs over there?

                         PRIESTESS
          He's not so bad once you get to know him.
          A beat, Hick's expression becoming serious.

                         HICKS
          He's going to kill her, isn't he? If.
          she's turned.

                         PRIESTESS
          Yes.

                         HICKS
          There's things that can be done. She
          doesn't have to die.

                         PRIESTESS
          She's his bloodline... and he's a Priest.
          It's the only way.
          Hicks tosses the rest of his food into the fire, troubled,
          but he knows there's no point in discussing it any
          further... for now.

                         HICKS
          And how many of you Priests are left now?
          A long moment before she speaks.

                         PRIESTESS
          Two.
          Hicks doesn't know what to Say-,,

          .I'm sorry.,

                         PRIESTESS
          Yes.
          She nods, though in affirmation of what Hicks's isn't sure.
          He watches her as she stares'into the fire. We FADE TO BLACK:

          It's dark.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          80.
          A GROUP OF PRIESTS (OUR TWO amongst them) move silently
          through a DEEP TRENCH, moist earthen walls rising around
          them, the air putrid with stink, mud clinging to their feet.
          Last: in the line, is a particularly FEARSOME PRIEST ...unlike
          the others, he's smiling, enjoying the action.
          As a cohesive unit, the Priests, climb up from the trench,
          scaling through the muck. They find themselves at the base
          of the hive, looking around at a chilling sight --

          THOUSANDS OF HONEYCOMBS
          stretching endlessly, rising high above in a cone. THOUSANDS

          OF SLEEPING VAMPIRES.
          OUR PRIEST, motions with his hand to the others, giving
          precise instructions, their movements well coordinated.
          He stops. Hearing a sound...a faint but incr.
          A BEAT as the Priestess looks at the others.

                         PRIESTESS
          They know we're here.
          From under the earth A HAND SHOOTS UP, grabbing onto a
          Priest's leg, pulling him down. Suddenly DOZENS OF VAMPIRES
          emerge, seemingly birthed from the soil. The warriors fight
          valiantly. Fiercely. But it's too much. Most are quickly
          cut down.

                         PRIEST
          Retreat!

                         FEARSOME PRIEST
          Battles like a tiger, grappling with TWo VAMPIRES, their claws
          at his throat, fangs inches from his face. A couple of quick
          moves and - before you realize how - the vanires lay dead.
          He quickly joins the surviving Priests as they run through the
          hive, a dizzying maze of MUDDY TUNNELS AND TRENCHES.

          FEARSOME SUDDENLY STOPS
          A BLACK TOP HAT lying on the ground catching his eye, must be
          the last remanent of a dandy gentleman. He picks it up,
          admiring the souvenir. Puts it on his head.
          The Priestess races by, shooting him a we don't have time
          for this' look. He STOPS her, grabbing her shoulder

                         

                         

                         

                         

          81.

                         FEARSOME PRIEST

                         (WINKS)
          What do you think -- Am I a "Dapper Dan"?
          She glares, running ahead to join the group. Fearsome just
          smiles, taking off the hat.

          FEARSOME PRIEST (CONT'D)
          Guess not.
          From within the hive comes a MIGHTY SHRIEK -- and now
          Fearsome starts to run, trying to catch the others as they
          scramble for daylight. The exit just in sight.
          At the last second --
          He's pulled back by a clutch of SCREECHING HUNGRY CLAWS. The
          hat still gripped tightly in his hand as he's dragged away.
          our two Priests reach for him but it's too late ...He
          disappears into the darkness as we CUT BACK TO:

          EXT. BEGGAR'S PASS CAMP - NIGHT

          Priest WAKING UP, breath catching in his throat.
          He looks over to find the Priestess working on her cycle,
          unable to sleep. There's a tension in the air, the sense of
          something about to break as he joins her.

                         PRIESTESS
          Why would the Clergy forbid us from
          seeing each other?

                         PRIEST
          Maybe they were scared of what we could
          do.

                         PRIESTESS
          Or what we would do.

                         (PAUSE)
          We both know there's something inside the
          Order that's off. Even if we don't know
          what it is.

                         PRIEST
          With or without the Clergy...we're still
          Priests. And we're the only ones who can
          stop that train.

                         PRIESTESS
          If we survive this we need to expose them
          for what they are.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          82.

                         PRIEST

                         (PAUSE)
          We won' t survive this.
          She puts down her tools, staring fixedly at him.

                         PRIESTESS
          You scared to die?_

                         PRIEST
          No.

                         PRIESTESS
          I believed in Heaven my whole life.
          Believed everything we were taught -- And
          now...when it's finally my time...no more
          faith. They took it away from me.
          Priest gazes at her, trying his best to be comforting.

                         PRIEST
          Whatever happens. .. Wherever it is we go.
          We'll go together.
          At that.exact moment something inside Priest shifts just a
          little bit, a door opens -- never to be shut again.

                         PRIEST (CONT'D)
          What in greater than God but more evil
          than the Devil? The poor have it, the
          rich need it -- and if you eat
          it...you'lldie.

                         PRIESTESS
          What?

                         PRIEST
          It's a riddle.
          The Priestess thinks about it.

          PRIESTESS.
          Nothing. That's the answer.

                         (BEAT)
          Nothing is greater than God. Nothing is
          more evil than the devil. The poor have
          nothing, the rich need nothing. And if
          you eat nothing... you'll die.
          It's said that warriors can become close friends only when they
          see each other's hearts -- Priest now knows this to be true.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          83.

                         -PRIEST
          What you said before...about those nights
          when you were dreaming of me --

                         PRIESTESS
          The good nights.

                         PRIEST
          Yes. The good nights. Do you think
          maybe tonight...

                         PRIESTESS
          Could be one of those nights?
          She smiles.
          And then Priest does the most amazing thing. . .he smiles back.
          Things happen fast -- He finds himself planting his mouth on
          hers... the years of conditioning, all the ritual and
          tradition falling away in a flash.
          And it is here, together in this place, where they feel like
          they finally truly belong.
          The last two.

                         DISSOLVE TO:

          EXT. BEGGAR'S PASS, DAWN

          A blanket of mist covers everything in a grey haze. Morning
          has come.

          A QUICK SERIES OF SHOTS
          As our trio forges onward and upward, the trail more
          treacherous with every twisty ridge, the overhangs looming
          ominously as they head deeper into the mountain.

          EXT. BEGGAR'S PASS - LATER

          The final climb.
          Yawning crevices, the wind moaning as it whistles between the
          canyon walls.
          Carefully they ride across DEVIL'S BRIDGE, a finger of stone,
          just wide enough for the cycles, on either side a straight
          drop to, oblivion. The peak of the mountain Just ahead.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          84.
          The Priestess is in front leading the charge, closely
          followed by Hicks. Priest brings up the rear, he stops just
          past the bridge, looks around.
          Something's wrong.

                         HICKS
          I- ee itl
          Hicks points, reaching the top of the mountain.

          IN THE DISTANCE
          A long black line snakes along the rail, puffs of heavy smoke
          lining its path; The Night Train.
          They're ahead of it. Barely.
          In his excitement, Hicks thunders ahead, starting the descent
          down the other side. The Priestess turns to shout back to
          Priest.
          But he's gone.
          Off her reaction we CUT TO:

          EXT. CREVASSE - DAY

          Tall rock walls flank Priest on. either side, the surrounding
          mist hanging in the air in cloudlike wisps. Slowly he walks
          through the canyon, senses fully attuned. It's quiet.

                         PRIEST
          I know you're there.
          A slight sound, the mist whipping into a pool as if something
          just moved through it. Priest quickly turns but there's
          nothing there.

          A GROUP OF ROCKS
          Tumble down the cliff. Again Priest abruptly turns
          but...still nothing there.

                         PRIEST (CONT'D)
          Show yourself.
          A BEAT as he stands in the ether, waiting. Then --
          WHOOSH! Qurye -M
           onen. ieadjna straight-for pi=.

                         0

                         

                         

                         

                         

          $5.
          Just in time -- he DIVES, the claw BITING into a rock behind
          him, the chain quickly snapping back, disappearing into the fog.

          RU11TE (O. S. )
          (voice like the mist itself)
          I've waited a long time for this Priest.

                         PRIEST
          This isn't the time to settle old scores,
          Rune.

          RUNE (0. S. )
          I disagree... This is the perfer, time.
          WOOSH! Like lightning, the claw LASHES out, appearing from.
          nowhere. Priest JUMPS and it CHOMPS into the ground where he
          was standing. He lands on top of the chain, backflipping as
          it retracts back. Gearing up for another attack.
          RUNE (0.s.) (CONT'D)
          You've lost a step Priest...I never came
          this close before.

                         PRIEST
          I'm older now.
          We can almost bear Rune smile.

          RUNE (0.8.)
          Not me.
          And now THE CHAIN comes from a different direction, WRAPPING
          around Priest like a snake, the metal cutting into his body,
          snapping a ribt
          Yelling, Priest GRABS the chain, PULLING with everything he's
          got. Rune flies from the mist, dragged by Priest, crashing
          at his feet. The chain SNAPS and Priest BREAKS from the
          coils, grabbing Rune by the jacket, picking him up.
          Rune flashes his fangs and scissors his legs across Priest's
          stomach, the razor sharp roweled SPURS slicing his flesh,
          tearing the muscle, Priest SCREAMS, a hot rush of, blood
          staining the desert floor.
          Rune leaps away, landing ontop a boulder.

                         RUNE (CONT'D)
          You can't outrun the past, Priest... the
          things you did.

                         PRIEST
          It was a war, Rune.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          86.

                         RUNE
          It still is
          He launches at Priest, duster fluttering like wings. The two
          grapple, Rune's fangs brushing Priest's neck.
          It's a savage battle, Priest's muscles and laser-like focus
          the only thing keeping him alive as Rune flies back across
          the canyon, landing against the rock wall like.a spider.
          Hunched, ready to strike BUT --

                         THE PRIESTESS
          Appears from within the mist, already in mid-leap, she lands
          beside Priest. The two together, a formidable presence.
          But Rune's a tough customer, he readies himself for another
          attack.
          ough h2 mist a single CLICKING sound.
          Rune looks over, sees --

                         HICKS
          Six-shooter pointed right at him.

                         6
          A beat as the two sides stare at each other in standoff. The
          air between them vibrating with energy. Crackling. Rune
          considering his options.

          RUNE (CONP' D)

                         (HISSING)
          Another time, Priest.
          He skitters up the rock face, disappearing into the mist.

          HAM!
          Hicks fires a single shot, the echo ringing through the canyon.

                         RUNE'S BODY
          Drops from the fog, hitting the ground with a thud. Dead.
          And now Hicks turns -- points his revolver at Priest.
          Catching both he and the Priestess by surprise.

                         HICKS
          Tell me you won't kill her.
          Priest doesn't reply.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          87.

                         HICKS (CONT'D)
          Tell me...or I'll shoot you where you
          stand.

                         PRIEST
          Finally showing your true colors.
          A beat. The Priestess looks at Hicks.

                         PRIESTESS
          What's he talking about?

                         PRIEST
          He's a halfbreed.
          Hicks cocks the gun.

                         HICKS
          Don't turn this into somethin' it's not.

                         PRIEST
          You've been itching to do this since
          Nightshade.

                         HICKS
          She's your kin, goddamit!

                         PRIEST
          if she's turned...she's nobody's kin.

                         HICKS
          Things can be done. Things to lessen the
          thirst. She can have a normal life, she
          doesn't have to die.
          Priest nods grimly.

                         PRIEST
          It's our way.

                         HICKS
          And what is that? Some special Priest
          code of honor? You don't get it. Your
          "way' -- It's over!

                         PRIEST
          Shoot me and it won't matter if you find
          Lucy. You won't stop that train -- and
          you won't save her.
          The Priestess steps between them, looks at Hicks.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          88.

                         PRIESTESS
          He's right. We need to be together on
          this... it's the only shot we have.
          Hicks thinks about it, knows she's right. A tense beat then

                         HICKS
          This ain't done.
          He lowers his gun and walks away.
          The two warriors stand together, the Priestess gazing at
          Priest...hedoesn't return it.
          Without a word, he heads back to his cycle.
          She doesn't see as his hand touches his stomach.
          It comes up red.

                         CUT TO:

          EXT. BEGGAR'S PASS - DAY

          The Trio BLAST down the rock face, descending down the mountain
          at a furious clip. The Priestess looks at the train off in the
          distance, it's now much closer, passing the mountain.
          They've lost their edge.

                         HICKS

                         C'MONL
          He GUNS the throttle and his bike BLAZES forward, wheels
          thundering across the earth, the ROAR of engines filling our
          head becoming --

          EXT. DUNKIRK RAIL - SAME TIME

          The mad CLATTER of the train as it barrels down the tracks.

          EXT. BEGGAR'S PASS DAY

          The assault begins.
          Our trio finishes their descent, BLASTING onto the

                         SALT FLATS
          wheels kicking up sheets of sand and grit, spattering their
          faces. The train dead in their sites.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          89.

                         HICKS

                         (SHOUTING)
          You think they see us?
          As if in response the locomotive belches a thick cloud of
          .black smoke, a door sliding open from one of the cars.
          A BEAT as everyone holds their breath, wondering what's going
          to emerge --

                         VR0000000000MI
          SIX BLACK MOTORCYCLES (the same ones who kidnapped Lucy) fly
          out from within the car! Vampires covered in rider leather,
          protected from the sun, heads obscured by BLAST HELMETS.
          Priest turns to the other two.

                         PRIEST
          Make sure you get on that train,

                         (BEAT)
          I'll catch up.
          'Before they can respond, he banks his cycle to the left.

          THE VAMPIRE RIDERS
          Take the bait, going for Priest. They gun their cycles,
          engines.WHINING as they rev forward, their LEADER unleashing
          a chain, swirling it above his head.
          With a SNAP he lashes it at Priest, the chain catching in his
          wheel, the sound of metal grinding as

                         PRIEST
          is thrown! His beloved bike FLIPPING across the desert in
          wild arcs. He hits the earth with a painful skid, using the
          momentum to roll back onto his feet.
          He checks his stomach, the wound's of enina t,}g xnorA, staining
          his shirt bright red. No time for first aid as he turns just
          in time to see

                         TWO RIDERS
          Throwing a STEEL CHAIN to the other, pulling the line taut,
          ready to take him out. Approaching fast.

                         PRIEST

                         

                         

                         

                         

          90.
          At the last second, DUCKS, grabbing onto. the chain, swinging
          himself around in a graceful arc and KICKING his legs into a
          split. WHAM! his feet SLAM the two cyclists off their bikes
          and into the dirt.
          He lands back on the ground in a crouch, the steel chain
          tight in his grip -- Ready for battle.
          And he gets it.

          THE OTHER FOUR RIDERS
          Circle Priest, surrounding him, the ROAR of their engines
          like massive power drills.

                         PRIEST
          Snaps the chain above his head, bullwhip style, LASHING out.
          The sound of metal shredding as it tangles in Rider #1's
          handlebars, the bike SWEEPING into the other, CRASHING in a
          tangled mess.
          With a SNARL the fallen riders LAUNCH at Priest. These
          vampires are different than the Nightshade tribe. Stronger,
          quicker. Squat bodies of clenched muscles and fangs.

          A BRUTAL FIGHT
          Spinning, twisting, kicking, gnashing. Bodies locked in deep
          combat as Priest fends off the ferocious attackers. War
          cries WHOOPING, the OTHERS TWO RIDERS continue to circle the
          gladiators, dust kicking from their wheels.

                         PRIEST
          Rips the BLAST HELMETS off his two attackers. With a
          SCREECH, their faces burn, bodies instantly SLACKENING in the
          harsh sun.
          Priest CRUNCHES a vampire in the ribs, knocking the creature
          off his bike. In a flash, he FLINGS.a helmet into the
          housing of the last cycle, the bike nosedives, sending the
          rider across the desert.
          Eyes brimming with renewed fury, Priest picks up the cycle,
          VROOOOMI! GUNNING the throttle, mod. ROCKETING towards the
          train...

          EXT. VAMPIRE TRAIN - SAME TIME

          Hicks and the Priestess are riding right beside the colossus,
          the sound incredible as the cars rattle across the tracks.
          Carefully, they pull up to the caboose.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          91.

                         PRIESTESS
          (shouting to be heard)
          You ready?
          Hicks nods, maneuvering to the side of his bike and jumping
          to the Priestess's, his cycle crashing into the dirt as he
          LEAPS onto the back of the train.

                         PRIESTESS (CONTIB)
          I'm going for the engine. Find Lucy.
          (about to speed off, stops)
          Before he does.
          Hicks nods, knowing this'll probably be the last time he sees
          her.
          And with that, she throttles forward, disappearing.
          Alone, Hicks takes a deep breath, looks at --

          THE TRAIN CAR DOOR
          Who knows what horrors lie behind it? He pops a WAD OF
          ATOMIC CRAW in his mouth and pulls his six shooters.

                         HICKS
          My.tuxn now, Priest.
          BAMI He kicks the door in

          INT VAMPIRE TRAIN CAR - SAME
          Sunlight bursts into the darkened chamber, but only reaching
          4 so far, as if the sun itself were scared to enter.
          Hicks rolls in, guns at the ready. It takes a moment for his
          eyes to adjust but when they do he finds a series of OLD
          WOODEN COFFINS stacked atop one another like cargo.
          He quickly moves through the car, careful not to disturb
          anything. We FOLLOW with him as he exits, entering --

          INT. BLACK STEEL ENCLOSURE - CONTINUOUS

          Designed so one can move between the cars without exposure to
          the sun, making the train a world of eternal midnight.
          Carefully, Hicks opens the next compartment's door.,.

          INT. TRAIN CAR - CONTINUOUS

          It's pitch black.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          92.
          The only thing we can make out is a LARGE CAGE, what's inside
          impossible to see in the darkness, just a GIANT HULKING C
          SHADOW. Its steady, hefty breathing letting us know whatever
          it is, it's asleep.
          Hicks covers his nose from the bestial smell, the cage taking
          up so much room he is forced to press himself against the
          bars, his body just inches from the thing inside.

          THE TWITCH OF BLACK LEATHER WINGS
          Makes Hicks stop in his tracks, silently praying to whoever's
          listening.
          A long moment...and then the steady breathing begins again.
          Whew. Hicks continues through the cabin, finally making it
          to the door as --

          EXT. VAMPIRE TRAIN - DAY

          The Priestess, engine at full boil, makes her way up the
          train, eyes on the engine up ahead.

          ACROSS THE BODY OF THE TRAIN
          A long line of tiny SLATS open up, RIFLE BARRELS quickly
          emerging, snapping into place with a click. BLAM! BLAMI
          BLAM! The guns FIRE AWAY, bullets blasting all around the
          Priestess, missing her by millimeters.
          She flicks down a TOGGLE SWITCH, there's a mighty roar, a
          massive surge of power and WHOOSH! she ROCKETS forward. The
          bullets chewing up the dirt behind her!

                         PRIEST
          Seemingly from out of nowhere, motors up to the train car
          riding the vampire cycle. He grabs onto a gun barrel and
          SWINGS into an arc, lifting himself off the bike and -

          EXT. TRAIN ROOF - SAME TIME

          Lands on the roof of the train. Hard.

          EXT. BELOW THE TRAIN - SAME TIME

          The cycle quickly ripped apart as it falls under the
          juggernaut, getting crushed, sparks flying off the rails.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          93.

          EXT. TRAIN ROOF - SAME TIME

          Priest collapses against the metal, the strain beginning to
          wear, he blinks up at the sky, close to passing out.
          Suddenly a FIGURE steps in front of him, blotting out the
          sun. Priest squints, unable to trust his eyes, he must be

                         HALLUCINATING --
          IT'S BLACK HAT. He looks down at Priest, bowing with a
          slight flourish.

                         BLACK HAT
          "And the third day He shall rise again.
          Priest can't believe it, seeing his long dead comrade, his
          face etched with shock, all he can do is ask --

                         PRIEST
          .How?
          Black Hat smiles, baring hi fangs.

                         BLACK HAT
          Oh ye of little faith.
          The understanding hits Priest immediately, crashing over him
          like a wave.

                         PRIEST
          .They turned you.

                         BLACK HAT
          No, Priest...I turned them.
          He smiles wider as we CROSSCUT TO:

          INT. VAMPIRE TRAIN - SAME TIME

          Hicks still hunting for Lucy, making his way to the next car.
          He slides open the door, stepping carefully inside,
          candlelight softly illuminating the space.
          He's greeted by a sight that makes his blood freeze:

          DOZENS OF OPEN COFFINS FILL THE CAR
          Long black boxes lined in orderly rows, flickering light
          bouncing warmly off their mahogany casings -- The sound of
          DEEP TORTURED BREATHING lets us know the OCCUPANTS are asleep.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          94.

                         HICKS

                         0
          (under his breath)
          Shit.
          Gritting his teeth, he walks between the rows, quiet as
          possible. The interiors of the coffins are dark, hard to see
          what's lying inside, just that horrible breathing sound.
          As Hicks moves past, his body brushes the wood, the space so
          very tight.
          WHAM! The train CATCHES the rail and the car shakes,
          KNOCKING HIM INTO A COFFIN! Jarring it.
          He stops. Holding his breath...but
          Nothing happens.
          A quick Hail Mary (the man becoming more of a convert with
          every step) and he continues on.
          He doesn't notice as behind hi a PX rises from one of
          the, coffins

          EXT. TRAIN ROOF -SAME TIME

          Priest and Black Hat eye each other, landscape whipping past
          at a furious rate, the train blasting along the tracks.

                         BLACK HAT
          Lost souls abandoned by divinity. No
          belief, no voice to guide them through
          the wilderness. Sound familiar?
          Priest doesn't reply, warily eyeing him.

          BLACK HAT (CONT'D)
          Lack of faith. That's what I found in my
          new brethren And so it was I
          discovered my true calling -- To teach.
          To lead.

                         PRIEST
          By murdering innocents?

                         BLACK HAT
          By drawing a once great race back to
          their"nature. By helping them discover'
          the mastery within themselves.

          95.

          BLACK HAT (CONTID)
          By putting them in touch with a higher
          power.

                         PRIEST
          who?

                         BLACK HAT
          Me.
          Something in the distance catches Priest's eye, a BLACK SPEC
          on the horizon -- It's The Cities. His jaw tightens, he
          knows there isn't much time.

                         PRIEST
          So this is how you go about it? One by
          one killing every last remaining Priest?

                         BLACK HAT
          It was the only way. The Cities are
          defenseless now...no one left to stop us
          from entering our Eden. But I was kind --
          I gave every last one the choice I never
          had.

                         (SMILES)
          Now it's your turn.
          Almost imperceptibly the two make a shift in their postures,
          the tension between the two warming up. Two warriors
          steeling for a fight.

          BLACK HAT (CONT'D)
          it's better to be with your enemies than
          to be alone, Priest. Humanity had its
          chance.

                         (BEAT)
          It's time to make way for new blood.
          Priest lowers his head, when he raises it, his reply comes
          easy and without hesitation.

                         PRIEST
          Yours.

          WE HEAR A HUM
          Molecules and electrons bursting from their orbits, the roar
          of the train gently subsiding as if the universe itself wants
          to leave these two room to battle.
          And before anyone knows it, they're already mid-fight. The
          SLAM and COLLISION of bodies giving way to the graceful sweep
          and echo of Priest combat.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          96.
          Then as combustibly fast as it started -- the tableau drops.
          They stand, wind whipping around them in lethal currents,
          Black Hat having to shout to be heard.

                         BLACK HAT
          They taught us God created man in His
          image. . .but they lied. Man created God
          in a image -- And so, like man, God is
          weak. Corrupt. Merciless.
          He wipes away a streak of blood from his cheek.

          BLACK HAT (CONT'D)
          Who do you fight for, Priest? The
          Order's collapsed. The Church nothing
          but a line of decrepit, ruined old men.
          Charlatans.

                         (SMILES)
          How do you think I'm getting into the
          cities?
          Priest's face drops.

                         PRIEST
          I don't believe you.

                         BLACK HAT
          Your faith has failed you Priest.

                         (BEAT)
          Join me. Join me and have the best of
          both worlds --Walk in the sun. Stalk in
          the night. Why pray to a God when you
          can BE one?

                         PRIEST
          With ferocious instinct, he launches forward, feet digging
          into the metal.
          The two bodies COLLIDE w th Mic impact. Rolling across the
          roof, bodies twisting to the edge before FLIPPING onto the
          next car.
          The warriors rise, locked in a furious coil.as WHOOSHI train
          car after train car passes beneath them. Each leaping at
          j ust the right moment to land onto the next.
          But Priest is,outmatched.
          As they hit the final car, Priest flies across the roof
          catching the edge with his hand just before he goes over, his
          body dangling over the side. Exhausted and bloodied.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          97.
          Black Hat calmly approaches, his foot dangerously close to
          Priest's hand. The landscape below-whipping past at an
          incredible speed.

                         BLACK HAT
          Your problem is you keep looking to God
          for-your power -- But I know the real
          truth.

                         (BEAT)
          You've been praying to an empty sky.
          And now he SWIPES his foot across the roof, knocking off
          Priest's hand as one would swat a bug. Priest falls below,
          getting caught under the train and quickly dragged under.

          BLACK HAT (CONT' D)
          But you know that now.

          EXT. TRAIN - SAME TIME

          The Priestess, cycle at full throttle, racing beside the
          TRAIN ENGINE. Up close it's a real mechanical monster, black
          metal and heat fused into a superpowered nightmare. The hull
          completely covered. Impervious.

                         MASSIVE PISTONS
          Pump up and down furiously, moving so fast they blur, turning
          the-giant DRIVE WHEELS that power the locomotive. ANGRY
          BLASTS OF STEAM vent whi te hot from between the wheels, just
          missing the Priestess.
          She reaches into her pack and lugs out a CROWBAR, pulling up
          to the beast and managing to stick it between the pistons
          hoping to jam up the works.
          The machine chews it up like candy.

                         CROSSCUT TO:

          INT. TRAIN COFFIN CAR - SAME TIME

          Hicks is almost at the door, hand reaching for the handle.
          He hears a RUSTLING sound and turns to look behind him...
          But there's nothing, just the open coffins.
          Turning back, Hicks catches his breath:

                         

                         

                         

                         

          98.
          A VAMPIRE hangs upside down from the ceiling, blocking the
          door. Its red eyes snap in anticipation, a shiny BLACK
          PROBOSCIS darting from its mouth!
          Hicks SPITS a wad of ATOMIC CRAW at the creature. It
          RIEKSI dropping to the floor, writhing. The sick smell of
          cooked flesh filling the car.

          HICKS LOOKS BEHIND HIM
          DOZENS OF VAMPIRES ARE NOW AWAKE. Sitting up in their
          coffins, the foul creatures all blood-eyeing Hicks like the
          dinner he most surely is.

                         HICKS
          Shit.
          With a WAIL, the vampires quickly scramble from their coffins,
          sharp talons scratching at the wood, snapping the planks.
          Desperate, he wrenches open the door, darting into --

          INT. STEEL ENCLOSURE - CONTINUOUS

          and manages to SLAM the door behind him just in time as the
          hungry beings CRASH against itl

                         A
          He wedges a knife in the door-handle, bashing it with his
          revolver, jamming the door trapped shut.
          He turns to head to the next car but there's a THICK CHAIN
          AND PADLOCK wrapped around the door, aWILD-EYED FAMILIAR
          peering out from inside the door window. Hicks SHOOTS the
          padlock but no luck, it doesn't break.
          He's trapped.

          THE DOOR BEHIND HICKS BUCKLES ON ITS HINGES
          It'll hold. . .but not for long.

          EXT. UNDERNEATH THE TRAIN - SAME TIME

          Priest is still alive. Barely.
          He hangs in tatters, desperately clinging to the
          undercarriage, face and body punched with bruises and blood.
          Jaw set, he begins to move through the undercarriage, hand
          over hand, every movement sheer agony.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          99.

          INT. METAL ENCLOSURE - SAME TIME

          Hicks stares at the door as it starts to BREAK from its
          hinges. He trains his gun on it, a feeble gesture --- but it's
          all he's got left.
          Then there's a horrible SCREECH.

                         HICKS TURNS
          The WILD-EYED FAMILIAR charges, attacking from behind, having
          unlocked the chain and opened the door. He SCREAMS, sinking
          a KNIFE in Hicks' side!
          Hicks spins, slamming his attacker in the nose with a palm
          heel strike, knocking the Familiar out instantly.
          Hicks pulls the knife out, blood flowering across his shirt
          as the vampires continue to PUMMEL the door behind, him.
          He trips over the chain and staggers into --

          INT. ASSEMBLY CAR - CONTINUOUS

          Collapsing to the floor, he presses his body against the door
          to close it.

          HIS EYES SEARCH THE CAR
          It's bare. Absolutely nothing in here. A single candle
          burns: ,on the floor, dimly illuminating the room.
          Weakly, he crosses the space and goes to the next door. This
          one's got a THICK PADLOCK too,.

                         HICKS
          'Dam.
          He site on the floor, breathing hard, knowing this is as far
          as he goes.
          Gradually another sound becomes audible. Hicks listens,
          nervous. He holds his breath straining to hear.
          It's someone else's BREATHING.

          IN THE CORNER
          A HUNCHED FIGURE sits...its back to him. Hidden'in shadow.
          Hicks levels his gun, slowly moving towards the shape, the
          candlelight giving him a glimpse of its face.
          He can hardly believe it

                         

                         

                         

                         

          100.

                         HICKS (CONT'D)
          Lucy?
          it is.
           That's when he sees something. Glinting in the darkness,
          just below her lip.
          Something sharp.

                          CUT TO:

          EXT. VAMPIRE TRAIN - SAME TIME


          THE STEAM WHISTLE BLASTS
          Howling across the wasteland, the train now racing even
          faster, furnace cranking out flame like Dante's inferno, the
          Priestess furiously keeping pace with the engine, desperately
          looking for a way in.
          There is none.
          She looks up ahead.

          THE SKYLINE,OF THE CITIES
          Smudged like a greasestain, looms large across the horizon,
          right in the train's path.
          She squints up to the sky, analyzing the sun, making a quick
          series of calculationsin her head. Trajectory. Timing.
          Then she looks at the train. Smiles.
          She flicks the Nitros Toggle one last time. Her bike ROCKETS
          past the train engine, speeding into a curtain of dust.
          Disappearing...

          INT. ASSEMBLY CAR - SAME TIME

          Hicks crouches beside Lucy, his gun trained on her.
          She site listlessly, her skin pale, eyes lost on the wall in
          front of her.

                         HICKS
          Lucy, my name is Sheriff Hicks...I'm here
          to take you home.
          No response. She seems almost catatonic. He reaches into
          his pocket, pulling out her photograph, showing it to her.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          101.

                         HICKS (CONT'D)
          I'm here with your uncle.
          That gets her attention, she looks at Hicks -- And she looks
          scared.

          WHAP!1
          The car door outside finally starts to give freely, metal
          breaking open. The sound of SQUEALING vampires.
          Hicks runs to.the car door, in one quick motion, SCOOPING up
          the chain and WRAPPING it around the handle, TYING IT TIGHT
          just as --

                         A TALON
          Reaches through the opening, long bony fingers swiping at
          Hicks like switchblades as he falls backwards, pain shooting
          up his body.
          ANOTHER ARM breaks through the small window, clawing at the
          air, the door BANGING REPEATEDLY against the chain.
          Hicks places himself between Lucy and the door, not noticing
          as she eyes the blood soaking through his shirt.

                         HICKS (CONT'D)
          Stay behind me. I'll hold `em off as
          long as I can
          BLAMI BL.AM! Hicks FIRES, bullets peppering the creatures as
          they HOWL -- but they keep at it, the thick chain stretched
          tight, ready to snap.

                         ONE VAMPIRE
          Manages to scramble through, it charges at Hicks, fangs
          glistening. BAMI With a twitch, it collapses in a heap, a
          well placed bullet between the eyes.

          EXT.-THE CITIES - SAME TIME

          A MASSIVE GATE, not, opened for decades slowly GRINDS open, a
          complex series of CHAINS and WINCHES scraping to life. The'
          Cities now open to the approaching vampire train.

          EXT. TRAIN SAME TIME

          The SCREAM of the whistle like victory as the locomotive
          approaches the city limits, sending up a giant plume of
          billowing steam.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          102.
          The sky above already starting to cloud black as --

          INT. ASSEMBLY CAR - SAME TIME

          Hicks continues to FIRE, the vampires seconds from entering
          the car.
          He turns to look back at Lucy. But she's gone.

                         HICKS
          Lucy?
          WHAM! A WOODEN. PLANK slams him over the head, knocking the
          gun from his hand. Woozy, he spins around to find Lucy
          standing over him, holding the plank above her head.
          He scoots back just as WHAM! the plank comes back down again,
          splintering apart across the floor.

                         HICKS (CONT'D)
          Lucy, wait
          She doesn't, jabbing at him with the broken plank, he dodges
          it, barely, but she keeps coming.

                         HICKS (CONT'D)

                         :71
          Lucy, don't do this!
          The girl's just too fast. She keeps pushing him backwards
          until he's dangerously close to the vampire's clawing hands..
          Hick's closes his eyes, knowing this is it...

                         A FIST
          PUNCHES through a BOARDED UP HOLE in the floor (the one
          through which Lucy escaped before), wood splintering into
          tiny shards.
          Hicks takes advantage of the distraction and SLUGS Lucy,
          knocking her unconscious.
          He dives for his gun, scooping it up and leveling it at the
          hole, ready to fire at whatever's coming through...

                         IT'S PRIEST
          He sticks his head through the opening, having been drawn by
          the sound of gunfire. Hicks can't believe it.

                         PRIEST
          (reaching for Lucy)
          Give her to me! Hurry!

                         

                         

                         

                         

          103.
          Hicks thinks about it, unsure.

                         PRIEST (CONT'D)
          -- They'11.get through the door any
          second! Give her to mei
          Screeching, ANOTHER VAMPIRE makes it through the opening,
          Hicks quickly taking him down in one crack shot.
          He picks Lucy up, handing her to Priest.
          Priest disappears with her, Hicks climbing down behind just
          as -- the chain finally SNAPS and the door BURSTS open with
          screeching vampires!
          Hicks BLASTS away but there's too many of them, they keep
          coming. He drops into the hole --

          EXT. UNDERNEATH THE TRAIN - CONTINUOUS

          Landing in the undercarriage. Coming face to face with the
          speeding track, everything shaking like an earthquake.

                         A VAMPIRE
          Jabs its head through the hole, teeth chattering-- but the
          creature can't go any further, the sunlight already making
          its skin smoke.
          On his back, Hicks worms his way down,. following Priest.as
          they climb up a LADDER attached to the side of the train.

          EXT. TRAIN CONTINUOUS'

          They work their way up the side, making it to the roof,
          exhausted. Priest carrying the still unconscious Lucy.

                         HICKS
          We should jump!

                         PRIEST
          Not until we stop the trains
          But now Hicks isn't even looking at him, his attention caught
          up in the horrible sight waiting ahead of them.

                         HICKS

                         (SWALLOWS)
          Too late.

                         THE CITYSCAPE

                         

                         

                         

                         

          104.
          t Towers above as the train approaches, so close the smell of
          sulphur and carbon clogs their noses.
          But that's when something catches Hicks' eye...up ahead on
          the tracks --
          Someone stands. awaiting the train.
          IT'S THE PRIESTESS -- Standing defiant as the train barrels
          towards her. An ant in front of a battleship.
          She sees Hicks and Priest-on top of the train, Lucy with them.
          Taking one last look at Priest -- she smiles.
          And spreads her arms open.

                         ON PRIEST
          Horrified, realizing what she's going to do...and powerless
          to stop her.

                         PRIEST
          What happens next happens fast:
          Priest GRABS Hicks, folding his body around both he and Lucy,
          hands coming together in prayer, feet leaving the train as --
          E ERYTH ggas BLACK
          The sound of a heartbeat.A threshold. A zone of transition.
          A BRIGHT FLASH -- we see the TRAIN collide with the.
          Priestess. The massive grill of the engine CRUMPLING AROUND
          HER as if smashing into a building.
          She doesn't move.
          A BRIGHT FLASH -- one by one the train cars SLAM into each
          other, the cars JUMPING the rails.
          MMMM gQES BLACK
          A BRIGHT FLASH -- and now Priest is falling through the air, his
          body shielding Hicks and Lucy, train care skipping across the
          earth, careening through the air.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          105.
          And WHAM! we FUSE back into real time as train cars CRASH
          down, sheets of dust clouding the sky in a roiling storm of
          debris and shrapnel, until finally...it all comes to a stop.
          It's quiet.
          We move through the swirling sand until we find --

                         PRIEST
          He stands, bruised and bloody, staring at the sky. Watching.
          A dazed Hicks beside him, Lucy in his arms as she comes to.
          A HORRENDOUS SCREECH fills the air.
          Led by the Purebloods, HUNDREDS OF VAMPIRES fly out from
          within the broken cars, taking to the sky in a massive black
          swarm, tangling together in flowing shapes. Beautiful.
          Terrifying.
          Then in one horrible instant --
          They TURN as if guided by an unseen hand, flying towards the
          Cities. Sensing the blood that awaits.

                         HICKS

                         (HORRIFIED)
          They're gonna make it.
          The creatures arctowards the metropolis,the city within

                         THEIR REACH:
          Priest studies the sky and all at once...he knows.

                         PRIEST
          No, they're not.

                         THE SUN
          PUNCHES through the teeming mass.
          A few rays at first, but then more and more,-cracking through
          the black tide like shattered glass.
          Hicks' eyes, widen, witnessing an amazing eight as the
          vampires' bodies collectively BLACKEN and SHRIVEL the swarm
          withering... quickly becoming nothing more than husks.
          Floating black kites.
          Hicks and Priest stand, surrounded by the epic destruction,
          fire and smoke casting everything in a surreal haze.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          106.

                         HICKS
          You knew they wouldn't make it.
          A long time before Priest answers.

                         PRIEST
          She knew.
          He turns to THE ENGINE -- its grinning teeth grill CAVED IN
          as if smashed by the very hand of God.

                         THE PRIESTESS
          Lies before it. Somehow not a scratch on her...But
          something's wrong -- something inside her broken, something
          elemental. She doesn't have much time.
          Priest kneels beside her, taking her hand. Trying to be
          strong for her.

                         PRIEST (CONT'D)
          Do you want me to?

                         PRIESTESS

                         O
          Priest lowers his head. The following having been spoken by
          him all too often.

                         PRIEST
          "You shall wash me and I shall be made
          whiter than snow. Glory be to the Father
          and to the Son and to the Holy Spirit...
          The words are heavy, each harder than the next.

                         PRIEST (CONT'D)
          -- As it was in the beginning, is now and
          ever shall be. World without end."

                         (BEAT)
          Amen.

          IN THE DISTANCE
          A FIGURE escapes through the dust, lurching towards the
          Cities,-- It's Black Hat.

                         PRIEST
          sees him but chooses to stay with the Priestess, brushing the
          hair from her face.

                         PRIESTESS
          I wish we could've had more time.

                         PRIEST
          .Me too.
          She reaches up, placing her hand on his chest.

                         PRIESTESS
          Wherever it is we go -- we go together,
          right?
          She smiles weakly... but Priest can see she's scared.
          He gives her one last kiss, cradling her body, sand circling
          them as she draws her final breath.

          EXT. THE WASTELAND - DUSK

          The sun setting on the horizon.
          A nearby PYRE consumes the last of the Priestess' body as Priest
          saddles up on a vampire bike, the flames rising behind him.
          Hicks approaches, Lucy huddled in a blanket, shivering.
          The two men exchange a look, the snap and flash of the fire
          reflecting in their eyes.

                         HICKS
          When you're finished -- You know where to
          find me.
          A tense beat then
          Priest GUNS the engine. Hicks and Lucy watching as he blazes
          towards the Cities, the sky above the color of hellfire.

          EXT. THE CITIES NIGHT

          The sound of a CHOIR.
          The soaring, ethereal tones carrying us through the forest of
          BRICK SMOKESTACKS-- finally coming to rest on A GIANT CROSS
          atop a mosaic BASILLICA, the colored tiles black with ash.
          We're back in CLERGY CITY.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          108.

          INT. CLERGY CATHEDRAL - NIGHT

          Evening mass. The place is packed, every pew filled with

          WORSHIPERS.

          CROSSCUT TO.,

          INT. CLERGY CHAMBER - SAME

          Shadows and light.
          A cabal of MONSIGNORS stand shrouded in white robes, awaiting
          to be anointed by ORELAS. A private ceremony.

                         CROSSCUT TO:

          INT. CATHEDRAL - SAME

          A LINE OF CHILDREN kneel before the altar, the MONSIGNOR
          raising the Host, offering communion.
          He suddenly stops, his expression dropping as

                         PRIEST
          Slowly makes his way down the aisle, bruised and bloodied,
          his very presence a direct affront to this place. A woman
          GASPS, somebody faints.

                         CROSSCUT TO:

          INT. CHAMBER - SAME

          Orelas dips his hand in water, touching a Monsignor's forehead.

                         ORELAS
          Ecces Agnes Dei, ecces qui tollit peccata
          mundi.

          THERE'S A LOUD CRASH
          Everyone turns to see the massive chamber doors BURSTING
          inwards! THE BODIES OF TWO GUARDS skidding across the marble
          floor.

          PRIEST ENTERS THE CHAMBER
          A true force of nature now, coming like the Fourth Horseman.
          Grief and betrayal stoking his anger higher, a blaze igniting
          behind his eyes.

                         BLACK HAT

                         

                         

                         

                         

          109.
          Steps from the shadows. Deep wounds line his face, the cross
          tattoo now gouged and distorted with blood -- He smiles.

                         BLACK HAT
          I'm afraid you're too late, Priest.

                         THE MONSIGNORS
          Shed their robes, revealing fresh BITE MARKS on their necks.
          Orelas' new-found fangs glint in the candlelight.

                         ORELAS
          And why shouldn't we live forever?

                         (HISSES)
          We're God's very voice. His vessel!

                         PRIEST
          Stands shell shocked, the level of betrayal staggering.

          BLACK HAT ATTACKS
          SLAMMING.into him, the two warriors going at it in a brutal
          battle, the vampire raking his claws across Priest's face,
          drawing blood.

                         PRIEST
          Sends him sailing through the air, Black Hat crashing into a
          collection of CANDLE HOLDERS, an ancient TAPESTRY catching
          fire, flames quickly spreading to the other fabrics -- The
          chamber erupting in an orange blaze!

          THE MONSIGNORS SHRIEK
          Bodies contorting in grotesque shapes as they BECOME.
          Black Hat stands triumphant, flames rising behind him.

                         BLACK HAT
          With them I can start anew! You can't
          stop it --

                         (SMILES)
          Must be God's will.
          He flies across the room, BARRELING into Priest with
          everything he's got, DIGGING a hand into Priest's wound.

          BLACK HAT (CONT'D)
          "I looked and beheld a pale horse and His
          name that sat on him was Death" --

                         

                         

                         

                         

          110.
          Priest coughs up blood. Black Hat smiles, wrapping a hand
          around Priest's. throat, LIFTING him off the floor, SQUEEZING
          the life from him,

          BLACK HAT (CONT'D)
          "And all hell followed with him."
          He raises his head back, ready to sink his teeth. Priest too
          exhausted to fight back. This is it.
          Prom a b= --

          THE GIANT GOLD CROSS
          Breaks from the wall with a GROAN, PLUMMETING towards them.
          Black Hat stops, his eyes snapping upward.
          At the last second --

                         PRIEST
          WRENCHES himself from,Black Hat's grip, tumbling. across the
          floor.
           WHAPI The cross S LM onto Black Hat, pulverizing hi !

                         Â¢
          Chunks of glass and stone rain down around Priest, the
          chamber starting to COLLAPSE. Diving, he barely makes it
          out, the rotunda .CRASHING down behind him.,
          The Monsignors lunge but Priest manages to jam the doors
          shut, locking them in. They BASH against the door, SHRIEKING
          horribly, the chamber now an oven.
          Priest presses against the door, it SPLINTERS all around him,
          the terrible sound RISING until finally
          it stops.

                         PRIEST

                         (WHISPERS)
          Forgive me.
          He collapses, making the sign of the cross.

          Complete chaos.

                         

                         

                         

                         
          PEOPLE stream out of the massive doorway, stampeding down the
          stairs, the giant structure enveloped in smoke and flame.
          Priest looks up to find FATHER KOEPPEN. The old man staring
          .at him. A lost soul.

                         KOEPPEN
          Am I next?
          Priest approaches -- Koeppen closing his eyes, ready for the
          blow he knows is to come.
          But Priest only lifts the man's head, studying his neck.
          He's clean.
          And without a single word -- Priest just walks away.
          When Koeppen opens his eyes, he's a new man -- a man absolved.
          With renewed energy, he looks to the crowd around him. And
          for the first moment in a long time ...He believes.

                         KOEPPEN (CONT'D)

                         (CALLING OUT)

                         KOEPPEN (CONT'D)
          Ask yourselves -- Where am I going?
          At this, Priest turns, the question catching him as well.
          And it's only now he realizes --
          He has no answer.

          Its rusty blades scrape along, the metal catching the first

          AARON PACE is already up, working on rebuilding his house.
          He stops, gazing off in the distance.

          ON THE HORIZON
          A cycle. Two black specs riding it. Hicks and Lucy.
          Dropping his tools, he runs to meet it.

          Time has passed. The moon shines through an open doorway.
          Lucy lies in bed, Aaron spoon feeding her a warm broth. He
          smiles, Lucy reluctant to smile back, still uncomfortable
          with her teeth.
          But eventually -- for her father...she manages it.

                         HICKS
          Leans against the backwall watching. Lucy glances his
          way... then shyly looks away.

                         AARON
          I can't thank you enough for what you've

          A full moon.
          Hicks stands on the porch, enjoying the breeze as he pops a
          wad of chaw in his mouth.
          A MOVEMENT out in the darkness catches his attention.

          IN THE DISTANCE

                         A FIGURE
          Stands astride a motorcycle, shadowed in the moonlight.

          Hicks approaches, the wind kicking up, whistling through the

          it is.

                         HICKS
          It doesn't have to be like this.
          Priest just stands, staring.
          Hick's hand curls around the revolver.
          Priest looks to the cabin, the challenge hanging in the air

                         THEN
          He steps from the bike, advancing towards Hicks.
          Hicks pulls his gun, leveling it.
          Priest keeps coming, the wind blowing harder as he
          approaches. A feeling of inevitability.
          Hicks stands his ground, cocking his gun.

          Stares into his eyes and --
          Something passes between them something so strong and
          personal it transcends emotion.
          Hicks FIRES!
          But Priest is pone.
          Hicks looks around --
          There's no sign of him, not even the bike.

          Nothing to worry about, just a coyote.
          Aaron smiles, happy enough to be with Lucy.

                         AARON
          Well ...we're all God's creatures.
          Hicks turns, ready to leave, but something on the table
          catches his eye

          THE DESERT RAT' S HOMEMADE CROSS
          He picks it up, turning it in his hand, the colored stones
          0 catching the moonlight...How the hell did it get there?

          Don't forget your cross -- It's

          A flicker of a smile crosses Hick's face, realizing.

          His eyes shift, gazing into the distance at the outpost, a
          warm glow emanating from within the cabin.
          He places the photo in his pocket. The wind making a high,

          The world turns below us, vast and slow.
                         
          A RUMBLE. A shadow sweeps over the land. We move with the
          shadow. We cast the shadow.
                         
          Landscapes slide by. Reduced by altitude to abstractions:
          river deltas, forests and flood plains. A raw natural world.
          No trace of civilization.
                         
          The shadow glides over mountains and glaciers. Across an
          ocean and a pale beach. Over lowland plain at the foot of a
          VOLCANIC MOUNTAIN it stops.

          THREE FIGURES walk out of the shadow.
                         
          They are men - and yet not men. Their skin is snow-white.
          Their features heavy and classical - as if Rodin's Thinker
          had risen from his seat. Their smooth heads are earless and
          hairless. Their glittering eyes entirely black.
                         
          Against the stark land their height is impossible to judge.
                         
          They are ENGINEERS.
                         
          Two of them are cloaked in dark robes of strange design.
                         
          The third is naked.
                         
          One of the cloaked Engineers opens a featureless black box:
          inside lies a cake of dark, sticky material.
                         
          The naked one lifts the dark cake with ceremonial slowness.
          It hums and buzzes. Foams into iridescent spheres. He raises
          the seething cake to his mouth like the sacrament.
                         
          BLACK SCARABS boil out of the dark material. Swarm over his
          lips. Glittering insects that chitter and bite.
                         
          Under the swarm his lips melt away. A horrific vision of
          teeth, black blood, dissolving bone. They are devouring him.
                         
                         
                         FLASH ON:
                         
          A fevered glimpse of the microscopic: cells rupture and
          bleed. Protein chains unfold. A DNA spiral unravels.
           2.
                         
                         
          The scarabs fill their bellies with genetic material.
                         
                         
                         THE ENGINEER
                         
          ...spreads his arms. Stands cruciform, nearly headless.
                         
          The scarabs swarm his shoulders, his chest. When they reach
          his hips, he collapses sideways, toppling majestically like a
          felled tree. Engulfed.
                         
          The two cloaked Engineers watch impassively.
                         
          Behind them, a vast black SHIP hangs in the sky.
                         
          As if blown by a great gust of wind, the scarabs disperse in
          their millions in all directions. Living DNA on the wing.
          Where the sacrificial victim fell, nothing remains.
                         
                         
          EXT. FOREST - DAY
                         
          A pristine wilderness. The VOLCANIC MOUNTAIN in the distance.
                         
          A PRIMITIVE WOMAN stands on a height, staring in amazement:
          far off a great dark ship hovers over the plain.
                         
          A black scarab lands on the back of her neck. Bites deep.
          Injecting its cargo of DNA into her blood.
                         
                         
                         FLASH ON:
                         
          A microscopic invasion. Cells pierced and infused. DNA
          strands twining and mating.
                         
                         
          CLOSE ON THE WOMAN
                         
          Pupils dilating with shock, breath hissing into her lungs.
                         
          She slaps the back of her neck. Looks at her hand. The scarab
          lies in her palm.
                         
          As she watches, it crumbles to dust and blows away.
                         
           FADE TO BLACK.
                         
                         
                         ON BLACK
                         
          Drifting motes of light against the dark: a starscape.
           3.
                         
                         
          An EXCAVATOR floats into view: a sturdy vehicle equipped with
          robotic arms. Bright floodlights beat at the darkness. Inside
          the cockpit - a bubble of glass - sits a BEAUTIFUL WOMAN.
                         
          This is DR. JOCELYN WATTS, 32, a precocious scholar of many
          disciplines. A scientist accustomed to field work.
                         
          The cockpit is sweltering: she wears shorts, boots, a T-shirt
          - and still her arms and legs gleam with sweat.
                         
          Watts works the controls. The excavator descends toward a
          rocky surface. Silt billows up as the excavator approaches:
          we're not in space at all, but deep underwater.
                         
          The excavator's thrusters are cowled propellers. The "stars"
          are plankton shining in the floodlights.
                         
                         
          INT. EXCAVATOR - CONTINUOUS
                         
          Watts steers the excavator to a steeply sloping cliff wall. A
          sea-trench yawns below her, its depths lost in darkness.
                         
                          WATTS
           Moving to survey site B... closing on
           object four. The large oblong.
                         
          She watches the screen of a ground-penetrating radar system.
          A bright signal return: something hidden in the cliff in
          front of her. Something big.
                         
                          WATTS (CONT'D)
           There you are.
                         
                         
          EXT. SEA TRENCH - CONTINUOUS
                         
          Watts carves into the cliff with the excavator's digger arm.
          Silt and boulders fall into the yawning trench below. She
          brings a water cannon to bear: uses its jet to blast away
          loose silt and stones.
                         
          The cliff face collapses: a muddy landslide into the deeps.
                         
          Watts backs away from the collapse, thrusters whirring to
          keep her out of the turbulence. A cloud of silt clears.
                         
          In her floodlight beams, the OBELISK stands revealed - its
          outlines worn by the ages. Easily thirty feet tall.
                         
          Watts stares at the obelisk, stunned. Her voice is husky:
                         
                          WATTS
           Martin. Here.
           4.
                         
                         
          A second excavator glides out of the dark.
                         
          At the controls: PROFESSOR MARTIN HOLLOWAY, 48, visionary
          genius and archaeologist. Dark-haired and lean, with the
          rangy build of a frontiersman. He's dressed in work trousers
          and a T-shirt. Stubbly chin.
                         
          He plays his floodlights over the obelisk.
                         
                          HOLLOWAY
           Look at that.
                         
                         
          INT. WATTS'S EXCAVATOR
                         
          Watts floats her excavator down the front of the obelisk.
          Scanning the alien text. Suddenly she stops. Grips the
          obelisk with her excavator's arms to anchor herself in place.
                         
                          WATTS
           You need to see this.
                         
           HOLLOWAY (V.O.)
           Coming.
                         
                         
          EXT. SEA TRENCH
                         
          Holloway pilots his excavator expertly up to Watts's. Mates
          the two vehicles at their aft hatchways.
                         
                         
          INT. WATTS'S EXCAVATOR
                         
          Behind Watts, a hatch opens with a splatter of water.
                         
          Holloway climbs in. Squeezes into her cockpit. A tight fit.
          He's distracted by her body, pressed so close - but she has
          eyes only for the inscrutable writing outside the glass.
                         
                          WATTS
           Same thing again.
                         
                          HOLLOWAY
           What do you see?
                         
                          WATTS

                          HOLLOWAY
           If we can get epoch and equinox out of
           that...
                         
                          WATTS
           Can we raise this thing?
                         
                          HOLLOWAY
           (shakes his head)
           Hundreds of tons.
                         
                         
          EXT. MEDITERRANEAN SEA - DAY
                         
          A research vessel at anchor on a turquoise sea. Bright sun.
                         
          In the distance, a coastline dotted with villas. The horizon
          is dominated by the VOLCANIC PEAK - the same peak we saw in
          the distance in the prologue.
                         
          Aboard the research vessel, cranes lift Watts and Holloway's
          excavators out of the sea and onto the deck.
                         
                         
          INT. RESEARCH VESSEL - AFT DECK - DAY
                         
          Under an awning, PRINTS of the obelisk's faces are stretched
          on the deck - fifteen feet long.
                         
          Watts and Holloway crawl over the alien text, red markers in
          hand. Parsing, translating, calculating.
                         
          They're tanned, fit, the wind in their hair. The
          Mediterranean coast in the distance. It's an idyllic way to
          work. But they're utterly absorbed in the task at hand.
                         
                         
          AFT DECK - NIGHT
                         
          They're still at it. Lights illuminate the workspace. The
          obelisk prints are blanketed with markings and annotations.
                         
          Holloway sits at a table. Watts sits on the marked-up prints.
          Both working through calculations on electronic slates.
                         
          Holloway looks up.
                         
                          HOLLOWAY
           I have a solution. A single match.
                         
                          WATTS
           Me too. Checked it twice.

           You first.
                         
          Watts holds up her slate: it displays a set of stellar
          coordinates. A detailed star map. Holloway holds up his own
          slate: an exact match. They lock eyes in electric excitement.
                         
                          WATTS
           What do we do now?
                         
                          HOLLOWAY
           We go there.

          A gleaming space station like a five-spoked wheel rotates
          grandly against the Pacific Ocean a thousand miles below.
          Black letters on the white metal read: WEYLAND'S WHEEL.
                         
          A round shuttlecraft approaches the station.

          A spacecraft no bigger than a private jet.
                         
          Holloway and Watts sit strapped into acceleration chairs. The
          only two passengers aboard. New to space travel, Watts tears
          her eyes from the spectacle of Earth outside the window.
                         
          Holloway plays with a pen, batting it from hand to hand in
          the zero gravity.

           Serious enough to send his private

                          HOLLOWAY
           It won't go like the others.

           How do you know?
                         
          Holloway plucks the pen from the air. He points out the
          window, where the crescent Moon shines like a toothy grin.

          Holloway and Watts float weightlessly inside, moving from
          handhold to handhold. The door closes.
                         
          Watts grabs Holloway by the collar. Pulls them roughly
          together. They kiss. Not for the first time. They have a way.
                         
          Watts's hair and clothing float free: she's a naiad in

          with a sleek metal folio slung over his shoulder.
                         
          The floor is the outer surface of the Wheel: in both
          directions it curves upward out of sight.
                         
          The walls are all windows: on one side, Earth rotates lazily.
          On the other, a wheeling field of stars.
           8.
                         
                         
          DAVID, an android, stands waiting for them. He's cunningly
          built, but no one would mistake him for a real human being.
                         
                          DAVID
           Professor Holloway. Dr. Watts. My name
           is DAVID.
                         
                          WATTS
           Hello, DAVID.
                         
                          DAVID
           Mr. Weyland's eager to meet you.
                         
          He strides off across the foyer. Watts and Holloway exchange
          a wondering glance and follow.
                         
                         
                         EXHIBIT HALL
                         
          DAVID leads past models of planets, moons and asteroids.
          Holographic labels and data swirl around them.
                         
                          DAVID
           These are all the planetary bodies on
           which Weyland Industries has mining
           claims.
                         
          The end of the hall is dominated by a huge globe of Mars.
          Markings indicate widespread surface activity.
                         
                          DAVID (CONT'D)
           And Mars. Weyland's crown jewel.
                         
                          HOLLOWAY
           How is that going? The terraforming.
                         
                          WATTS
           They say you're getting diminishing
           returns. It's not working.
                         
                          DAVID
           It's the greatest engineering project
           ever attempted. Challenges are
           inevitable. Mr. Weyland's a
           determined man.
                         
                         
                         WEYLAND'S OFFICE
                         
          PETER WEYLAND sits behind a mahogany desk. He's a Warren
          Buffet type: a country sage, horse-sense and hard knocks. He
          might be seventy years old, or a hundred and seventy.
           9.
                         
                         
          Behind him stands DIRECTOR LYDIA VICKERS, a slim woman of 45
          in a costly business suit. Shrewd and watchful. Once a great
          beauty, she now trades in ruthlessness.
                         
          DAVID stands against the wall.
                         
          Watts and Holloway settle into chairs in front of Weyland -
          Holloway holding the metal folio.
                         
                          WEYLAND
           Professor Holloway. Ms. Watts.
                         
                          WATTS
           Doctor Watts.
                         
                          WEYLAND
           Forgive me. Peter Weyland.
                         
          He notices Watts looking curiously at DAVID. He smiles.
                         
                          WEYLAND (CONT'D)
           Ah. DAVID here's a prototype. Our 80
           series. One of a kind for now, but if
           he performs, he will be legion.
           (his smile fades)
           What do you want here?
                         
          Holloway looks at him, startled.
                         
                          HOLLOWAY
           We sent you a prospectus that...
                         
                          WEYLAND
           Assume I know nothing.
                         
          Holloway swallows. Lays the metal folio on Weyland's desk.
                         
                          HOLLOWAY
           I'm an archaeologist.
                         
          He touches a tiny remote. Holographs appear in the air over
          Weyland's desk: the folio is a three-dimensional imager.
                         
          Pictures of a younger Holloway in the field: excavating ruins
          in Egypt, China, Peru, Greece.
                         
                          HOLLOWAY (CONT'D)
           In my studies I discovered a pattern I
           couldn't explain. Every eleven hundred
           years, sudden advances in agriculture,
           tool use, technology. Inventions.
           Something caused a great leap forward.
           Every eleven centuries. The pattern
           holds as far back as our data goes.
                          (MORE)
           10.
                         
                          HOLLOWAY (CONT'D)
           Tens of thousands of years. I had to
           understand this. It became the focus
           of my work.
                         
          Weyland nods. Holloway glances at Watts and forges on.
                         
                          HOLLOWAY (CONT'D)
           Dr. Watts was a student of mine.
                         
          Watts touches her own remote. The holographic display turns
          to scientific diagrams. Images of a very young and beautiful
          Watts in the laboratory.
                         
                          WATTS
           I was analyzing historical changes in
           human DNA. I found the same pattern.
           Every eleven centuries, a pulse of new
           information in the genome of the human
           race. All over the world. Evolution
           can't do that. Something was changing
           us. Changing the DNA of our species.
                         
                          HOLLOWAY
           Humanity's been visited. Visited
           by...beings from somewhere else.
                         
          Behind Weyland, Vickers can't suppress a scowl of disdain.
                         
                          VICKERS
           You mean aliens.
                         
          A beat. The others had forgotten Vickers was there.
                         
                          WEYLAND
           Lydia Vickers, Director of Operations.
           Practically my right hand.
                         
                          HOLLOWAY
           They guided us to civilization. Lifted
           us up, again and again. I call them
           the Engineers.
                         
                          WATTS
           Once you know what you're looking for,
           it's amazing how the evidence falls
           into place.
                         
          Photographs flicker through the display: Holloway and Watts
          in the field, excavating new sites. Intimately close.
                         
          Their finds: columns of writing on stone tablets in Egypt,
          China, Cambodia, Peru. Patterns of lines, curves, and dots.
           11.
                         
                         
                          HOLLOWAY
           This is the writing of the Engineers.
           We've found it on every continent. And
           last year, we found our Rosetta Stone.
                         
          The display shows the Engineer obelisk under the sea.
                         
                          WATTS
           The writing is a formula giving the
           location of a single star in our sky.
                         
                          WEYLAND
           Which star?
                         
                          HOLLOWAY
           We're keeping that confidential for
           now. But that's where we want to go.
                         
                          WEYLAND
           You want me to pay for an interstellar
           research expedition!
                         
                          HOLLOWAY
           It's a chance to be part of a
           revolution in scientific...
                         
                          WEYLAND
           Don't sell me, professor. You've been
           turned down by every university and
           government agency under the sun.
           Nobody's going to gamble that kind of
           money on your hunch.
                         
          Holloway deflates. Watts winces. This is a bloodbath.
                         
                          WEYLAND (CONT'D)
           Nobody but me.
                          (HE GRINS)
           I've read your research.
                         
                          HOLLOWAY
           That's impossible. Our research is-
                         
                          WEYLAND
           Quantum encoded on secure servers,
           yeah. We have an A.I. division, you
           should know. Doing impressive things.
           (he leans across the desk)
           I know which star you're wishing on.
                         
          The scientists stare at Weyland.
                         
                          WATTS
           You're bluffing.
           12.
                         
                         
                          WEYLAND
           Zeta Two Reticuli.
                         
          He regards their shocked faces with satisfaction.
                         
                          WEYLAND (CONT'D)
           You know how I got this rich? I ask
           myself: what does God spend his time
           doing? And I go and do that.
                         
          Watts laughs incredulously. Stifles it. Weyland's not joking.
                         
                          WEYLAND (CONT'D)
           Biotechnology was good to me. Fusion
           power. Lately doing well with gravity
           systems.
                         
          He swivels his chair toward the window. Earth shines outside.
                         
                          WEYLAND (CONT'D)
           But what's the first thing God did?
                         
                          WATTS
           He made the Heaven and the Earth.
                         
          Weyland jabs a finger at her like she's won a carnival prize.
                         
                          WEYLAND
           That's what I'm talking about. You
           left out my favorite part. The piece
           about Earth. DAVID.
                         
                          DAVID
           For eons, Earth's climate swung from
           hothouse to ice age. Explosions of
           life, then mass extinctions. But
           twelve thousand years ago the swings
           stopped. The Holocene Epoch began - a
           period of anomalous tranquility. The
           rise of civilization began only then.
                         
          Holloway and Watts stare at DAVID with new appreciation.
                         
                          HOLLOWAY
           That's right.
                         
                          WATTS
           And that change coincides with a visit
           by the Engineers. They didn't just
           change us. They changed our world.
                         
                          WEYLAND
           That's the piece I mean. Engineering
           Earth. God stuff.
           13.
                         
                         
          He swivels back to his desk. Rummages in a drawer.
                         
                          WEYLAND (CONT'D)
           My people checked your science. They
           say it's solid.
                         
          He pulls a thick contract out. Drops it in front of Holloway.
                         
                          WEYLAND (CONT'D)
           I'll give you your expedition. Ship
           and crew, supplies, support. One
           condition.
                         
          Holloway picks up the contract with the cautious joy of a man
          double-checking a lottery ticket. His voice is husky:
                         
                          HOLLOWAY
           What's that?
                         
                          WEYLAND
           You get the discovery. Control of the
           site. But any technology you find?
           Anything at all. That's mine.
                         
          Holloway reaches out slowly and picks up the contract.
          Riffles the pages of small-print legalese.
                         
                          WEYLAND (CONT'D)
           You take DAVID with you. My eyes and
           ears. And Vickers...you're going too.
                         
          Vickers stares at Weyland in shock.
                         
                         
                         WHITE LANDSCAPE
                         
          A glittering formation of white crystals. Diamond on diamond.
                         
          The structures grow more complex as the view widens. Leaves
          and branches of crystal. A shimmering field of white jewels.
                         
          A landscape of white crystals, smooth as snow.
                         
                         
          EXT. DEEP SPACE
                         
          A black void shot with stars, far from any sun.
                         
          A sturdy prospecting ship forges through space, travel-worn
          but built to last. It carries the Weyland Industries logo.
          The name painted on its hull is MAGELLAN.
           14.
                         
                         
          INT. MAGELLAN - BRIDGE
                         
          The ship's nerve center and control room. Six control
          stations, empty and quiet. Interior lights dimmed to blue.
                         
          The entire forward bulkhead of the Bridge is a window: wall
          to wall, floor to ceiling.
                         
          At the window stands the android DAVID.
                         
          He gazes at the cosmos with an expression of utter serenity.
          After a long moment he turns away. Massive shutters close
          over the window as he walks off.
                         
                         
                         CORRIDOR
                         
          DAVID walks the ship's long central corridor. The ship is
          silent. The lights dimmed to blue. He is alone.
                         
                         
                         HYPERSLEEP COMPARTMENT
                         
          A long steel room containing a dozen plexiglass sarcophagi,
          six on each side. Sleep freezers. Inside each freezer: the
          shadowy shape of a human body rimed with frost.
                         
          DAVID walks through the compartment, surveying the sleepers.
                         
                         
                         WORKROOM
                         
          DAVID sits at a display table, moving intricate technical
          documents across the surface with waves of his hands.
                         
          His eyes intent on his work. If he is reading, then he`s
          reading at a speed no human could match.
                         
                         
                         WHITE LANDSCAPE
                         
          We pull away from the frosted crystalline horizon, the smooth
          white curves like snowy fields. Form becomes clear.
                         
          It's the body of a woman. It's Watts.
                         
                         
          INT. HYPERSLEEP FREEZER
                         
          Watts lies asleep in her underwear in a plexiglass freezer.
          Pale. Frost on her skin. Venus sculpted in ice. There are IV
          lines in her elbows and ankles.
           15.
                         
                         
          Shapes move into view beyond her, outside the freezer. FACES.
          Pressed to the glass.
                         
                         
                         HYPERSLEEP COMPARTMENT
                         
          All of the freezers are open and empty, save two. Holloway
          lies in one. In the next, Watts. Three men in blue coveralls
          crouch beside Watts's freezer, staring inside.
                         
          They are DOWNS, 30, a lean fidgety crewman. STILLWELL, 40, a
          sturdy fellow with the geniality of a labrador. And KAMAROV,
          26, whose dark, brooding air belongs to a man twice his age.
                         
                          DOWNS
           Look at that.
                         
          Kamarov opens the lid of Watt's freezer. Leans over her.
          Watts stirs in her sleep, a drowsy angel.
                         
                          KAMAROV
           She wakes up slow.
                         
          Watts wakes to find three men looming above her. Disoriented,
          she pulls away. Tangles her hands in her IV lines.
                         
           HOLLOWAY (O.S.)
           Get out of there!
                         
          Holloway's voice cracks like a whip. The crewmen jump back.
                         
          Holloway sits up in the next freezer over. He yanks the IV
          lines out of his arms and legs. Climbs out of the freezer.
                         
                          STILLWELL
           Just looking.
                         
                          HOLLOWAY
           Give us a moment, will you?
                         
          The crewmen file out: Stillwell sheepishly, Downs and Kamarov
          surly. Holloway goes to Watts. Gently removes the IV lines
          from her ankles while she plucks the ones from her arms.
                         
                          WATTS
           I'm out of sorts. Sorry.
                         
                          HOLLOWAY
           Never worry.
                         
          He helps her up.
           16.
                         
                         
          INT. MESS ROOM
                         
          Holloway and Watts sit at a table, both a bit hung over. They
          wear civilian clothes. Warmly dressed, they still look cold.
                         
          They nurse mugs of coffee and nibble packaged snack bars.
          Watts hunches over, shivering.
                         
                          WATTS
           My head's buzzing.
                         
                          HOLLOWAY
           You just slept two and a half years.
           It'll pass.
                         
                          WATTS
           Like you've done this before.
                         
                          HOLLOWAY
           I've read all about it.
                         
          Two ship's officers enter the room wearing blue coveralls
          with rank insignia: GLASSE, 45, a stocky man with thick black
          hair, and BRICK, 50, a bald man with a bristling mustache.
                         
          They look at Watts and Holloway with little pleasure.
                         
                          BRICK
           Sleep okay?
                         
                          WATTS
           Yes, thanks...
                         
                          GLASSE
           Captain'll see you now.
                         
                         
          INT. MAGELLAN - CAPTAIN'S WARDROOM
                         
          CAPTAIN JANEK, 45, sits at his desk. With his bristling beard
          and powerful build he has a swashbuckling look, like the
          captain of a whaling ship.
                         
          Holloway and Watts sit on a steel bench in front of him.
                         
          He sits scanning his orders: a plastic packet with Weyland
          Industries logos, cracked open. Watermarked papers inside.
                         
                          JANEK
           Zeta Two Reticuli was surveyed
           already. A hundred years ago.
                         
                          WATTS
           By an unmanned probe. Very crude.
           17.
                         
                         
                          JANEK
           No Earthlike planets.
                         
                          WATTS
           No.
                         
                          JANEK
           So what are you looking for?
                         
                          HOLLOWAY
           Proof of the Engineers' existence.
                         
                          WATTS
           Confirmation of Professor Holloway's
           theories would change everything.
           There'd be science before Holloway and
           science after.
                         
          Janek rubs his face wearily with his hands.
                         
                          JANEK
           Your ticket. I'll put the ship where
           you want. Run your scans.
                         
                          HOLLOWAY
           Captain, your crew's been up for a
           week. We could've used the time. Why'd
           you wait to wake us?
                         
                          JANEK
           Better for discipline.
           (off their silence)
           Men ship out as prospectors for one
           reason: the percentage. Find a gold
           mine or a habitable planet, and you're
           set for life.
           (he laughs bitterly)
           But this contract says no percentage.
           No bounty. Just triple pay. The men
           aren't happy.
                         
                          HOLLOWAY
           You unhappy too?
                         
                          JANEK
           I'm always unhappy.
                         
          He stands. Presses his palm against a wall panel. A safe
          opens. He pulls out a massive pistol in a gunbelt. Tosses the
          orders into the safe. Lays the gun atop them and locks it up.
           18.
                         
                         
                         SCIENTISTS' CABIN
                         
          Holloway and Watts take possession of their cabin: a simple
          but spacious room with twin beds and a window to the stars.
                         
          They drop duffel bags on the bed.
                         
          Holloway surveys the arrangement. Frowns. He releases the
          magnets that lock the beds down. Slides the beds together.
                         
                         
          INT. SCIENTISTS' WORKROOM - DAY
                         
          Holloway and Watts set up their workspace - a central display
          table and huge display surfaces on the walls. Fascinating
          documents slide under their fingertips: an Engineer alphabet.
          Ancient art. Climate and genetic data.
                         
          DAVID appears in the doorway.
                         
                          WATTS
           DAVID. I wondered when we'd see you.
                         
                          DAVID
           I trust your database is in order. I
           set it up myself.
                         
                          WATTS
           All's well, I think.
                         
          DAVID turns to go. Hesitates in the doorway.
                         
                          DAVID
           I should tell you: the time you spent
           sleeping, I spent studying your
           research.
                         
          Holloway and Watts look at the android, his words sinking in.
                         
                          WATTS
           You studied our work for two and a
           half years.
                         
                          DAVID
           It's quite a data set.
                         
                          HOLLOWAY
           So you've seen everything. Well. What
           do you think?
                         
          DAVID glances over the documents displayed around the room.
           19.
                         
                         
                          DAVID
           Your hypothesis is...bold. The
           audacity of it. Your climate data's
           undeniable: the Holocene Epoch was
           engineered. Dr. Watts, your genetic
           studies are equally conclusive. Pulses
           of cultural change are harder to
           prove, but even there your case is
           strong. I believe in your "Engineers."
                         
                         
                         BREAK ROOM
                         
          A utilitarian sitting room. Steel benches and table bolted to
          the deck. Seated here are two Weyland Industries technicians:
                         
          ANDREW CHANCE, 50, a stocky computer engineer with a genial
          bearing and a bristling salt-and-pepper mustache.
                         
          MONA RAVEL, 45, a dour, rangy woman with a plain face, her
          hair pulled severely back. A physicist and chemist.
                         
          They wear black Weyland Industries jackets. They radiate
          intelligence and competence. These are pros.
                         
          DAVID leads Holloway and Watts past the break room. Holloway
          spots the technicians. Strides in to greet them.
                         
                          HOLLOWAY
           Weyland Industries! Mr. Chance. Ms.
           Ravel. You remember Dr. Watts.
                         
          Watts and the technicians exchange greetings.
                         
                          HOLLOWAY (CONT'D)
           About the materials I gave you. Some
           of the technical aspects...
                         
                          CHANCE
           We'll handle our end of the job.
                         
                          RAVEL
           If there is a job.
                         
          Holloway blinks at her. Chance explains, not unkindly:
                         
                          CHANCE
           We only have a job if you find
           something.
           20.
                         
                         
                         CORRIDOR
                         
          Holloway and Watts follow the imperturbable DAVID down a
          steel corridor to Vickers's cabin door.
                         
                         
                         VICKERS'S SUITE
                         
          An open-plan cabin like an urban loft apartment. Watts and
          Holloway follow DAVID inside. Vickers rises to meet them.
                         
          The walls are industrial steel - but the floors are lushly
          carpeted, the furniture opulent. A king-sized bed, a mahogany
          desk, a dining table.
                         
          Gleaming machines ensure Vickers never need step outside: a
          private hypersleep freezer, an autokitchen, a medical pod.
                         
                          WATTS
           Is that a Pauling medical pod? There's
           only ten of those things on Earth! I
           guess nine, now.
                         
                          VICKERS
           I told Mr. Weyland I wouldn't
           compromise my standard of living. He
           accommodated me.
                         
                          HOLLOWAY
           I know, I had to cut my manifest. This
           used to be the number four cargo bay.
                         
                          VICKERS
           What can I do for you, Professor?
                         
          Holloway gestures with the slate he's brought with him.
                         
                          HOLLOWAY
           We're about to reach the system
           periphery. I thought you'd want to see
           the search protocols we -
                         
                          VICKERS
           No. I was set to be the next CEO of
           Weyland Industries. Then you came
           along and sold Mr. Weyland on...this.
           So here I am. Out of the running.
           I'll go where I'm told. But don't ask
           me to play along.
                         
                          WATTS
           But when you get back...
           21.
                         
                         
                          VICKERS
           I'll be five years behind the curve.
           Out of touch. Over.
                         
                          HOLLOWAY
           You might make the discovery of the
           ages.
                         
          Vickers looks at him as if she's dealing with a child.
                         
                          HOLLOWAY (CONT'D)
           You don't believe in what we're doing.
                         
                          VICKERS
           Mr. Weyland believes. That's enough.
                         
          She walks them toward the door. Interview's over.
                         
                          VICKERS (CONT'D)
           Now we're out of communication, you
           can tell the crew what we're doing.
                         
                          WATTS
           They don't know? They volunteered.
                         
                          VICKERS
           They volunteered blind. Classified
           job, triple pay.
                         
                         
                         CARGO BAY
                         
          The crew - Brick, Glasse, Stillwell, Downs, and Kamarov - sit
          on crates in an improvised lecture hall. Holloway and Watts
          in front of them. Janek at the back of the room.
                         
          A hologram shows ancient images of divine visitations. The
          crew is visibly spooked.
                         
                          DOWNS
           Aliens.
                         
                          GLASSE
           You shitting me?
                         
          Stillwell is staring at the frightening images: gods and
          titans towering over mortals.
                         
                          HOLLOWAY
           I think all our mythologies are race-
           memories of the Engineers. Horus the
           Sun God. Prometheus bringing fire from
           heaven. A pillar of fire, a pillar of
           smoke. The Engineers are the gods.
           22.
                         
                         
          Kamarov stiffens, smelling blasphemy.
                         
                          KAMAROV
           The mythology gods maybe. God is God.
                         
                          STILLWELL
           Kamarov. Let him talk.
                         
          Stillwell's staring unhappily at the ancient images: gods
          towering over mortals, inhuman and terrifying.
                         
                          STILLWELL (CONT'D)
           So we're going to meet these things?
                         
                          WATTS
           We probably won't meet anyone. You'd
           expect a star-traveling race to
           generate radio or laser signals.
           Fusion drives and gravity drives have
           clear signatures. But Zeta Two
           Reticuli is silent. And the Engineers
           have gone missing on Earth.
                         
                          WATTS (CONT'D)
           By the pattern, they should've come to
           Earth seventeen centuries ago. And
           again six centuries ago. But no sign.
           After twelve thousand years...they
           stopped coming.
                         
                          BRICK
           Why?
                         
                          HOLLOWAY
           Exactly. Why?
                         
                          JANEK
           "My God, my God, why have you forsaken
           me?"
                         
          They turn. Janek grins at Holloway across the cargo bay.
                         
                          JANEK (CONT'D)
           Is that the question you've come light-
           years to answer?
                         
                          HOLLOWAY
           Only my first question. I have many.

          EXT. MAGELLAN (ZETA2 RETICULI SYSTEM)
                         
          The Magellan arrives at the periphery of the system. A
          distant star like Earth's Sun, surrounded by orbiting
          planets: mere sparks at this distance.

          Outside the vast Bridge window, the star Zeta2 Reticuli
          burns, a cold beacon in the night. Downs, Glasse and Brick
          sit at consoles. Janek paces in front of the window.
                         
          Holloway and Watts enter - and gape at the view. Janek grins
          at their reaction.
                         
                          JANEK

          The Magellan opens its eyes: two immense telescopes emerge
          from the ship. Irises open to expose huge lenses.
                         
          Antennae deploy: unfurling like wings, gleaming and vast.
          Sifting vacuum for any whisper of information.

          Outside the window, the planets orbiting Zeta2 Reticuli are
          no more than bright stars.

          A heads-up display appears, overlaid on the glass. The sun is
          labeled ZETA2 RETICULI. Markers point out the planets and
          trace the ellipses of their orbits.
                         
          Like magic, the planets swell into colorful orbs, each
          labeled: Alpha, Beta, Gamma...
                         
                          DOWNS
           Seven planets. Two hot rocks, two gas

          Watts grins at Holloway, eyes shining.

          put it back together again.
                         
          A river of data floods the display, bathing the watchers'
          faces with light: Chemical compounds, magnetic field lines,
          lunar orbits, topographical data.

           My design's not intended to convince.
           Simulating humanity is a complex task
           that diverts resources. My designers
           dispensed with that burden to optimize

           Being shaped like you, I can use
           spaces and equipment designed for you.
           But I'm not so limited. I hear
           frequencies you can't hear. I see
           wavelengths of light invisible to you.
           I move faster. Exert greater force.
                         
          The scientists look at DAVID in wonder.
                         
                          WATTS
           You see yourself as a superman.
                         
                          DAVID
           No.
                         
          He turns his unearthly eyes on them.
                         
                          DAVID (CONT'D)
           Not a man at all.

          Holloway and Watts lie on their bed in their clothes - her
          head on his chest.
                         
                          WATTS
           What if they're really there?
           (off his confusion)
           The Engineers. They could be there.
           Waiting for us. What then?
                         
          He laughs.
                         
                          HOLLOWAY
           Then all my dreams come true.
                         
                         
          EXT. MAGELLAN (LV-426 ORBIT)
                         
          The Magellan has arrived.
                         
          LV-426 is a gray moon shrouded in clouds. Behind it looms its
          father planet Epsilon, a lurid gas giant banded in red and
          gold, half swallowed in darkness.
                         
          The Magellan dives into a forced orbit around LV-426: rockets
          firing continually, nose pointed down. Telescopes, sensors
          and antennae sprout once more from its hull.

          Everyone's here. Janek and his crew seated at control
          stations. Holloway and Watts standing on the foredeck.
          Vickers and DAVID. Ravel and Chance.
                         
          LV-426 fills the window: a gray orb of mist. The ground
          invisible beneath the clouds. Sporadic lightning flickers.
                         
                          HOLLOWAY
           Start with passive systems. We're
           uninvited guests. Let's be quiet.
                         
          That thought sends a nervous shiver through the others. Janek
          nods at Glass and Brick. They study their instruments.
                         
                          BRICK
           A lot of electromag, all random.

          Radar emitters extend from their housings like cannons. A
          THUMP of power as they hammer out a blast of energy.

           Well, we just rang the doorbell, if
           anybody's listening.
                         
          Kamarov shakes his head fearfully. Crosses himself.

           Icecaps at the poles. Frozen methane.
           Cold down there.
                         
          The display fills with light: a wave of terrain data sweeping
          across the moon's surface as the Magellan orbits.
                         
                          GLASSE
           Terrain data rezzing up. Hey! We got
           hard spots. Radar-opaque. Bright
           reflections. That's metal.
                         
          A jolt of excitement pounds through everyone on the Bridge.

          The Magellan sweeps on around the gray moon, radar emitters
          humming, antennae and telescopes open wide. The gas giant
          Epsilon fills the sky behind LV-426.
                         
          As it circles, the Magellan launches SATELLITES. Metal motes
          hurled into polar orbits around the Moon.

          The prospecting ship descends through buffeting grey clouds.
          Telescopes and antennae stowed away. Hull streaming vapor as
          it cuts atmosphere.
                         
          Lightning flashes and booms around the descending ship.

          The landing engines roar. Wind screams over the hull. Mist
          whips across the Bridge window, obscuring any view. Watts
          reaches out. Squeezes Holloway's hand.
                         
          The Magellan breaks through the cloud cover into clear air.
                         
          Below the ship, a vast and eerie landscape is revealed. Wide
          valleys mottled with thin dark ground cover. Barren crags and
          spires of rock. Waterless and wind-swept.
                         
          Watts gasps. Stares at the grim and foreign country.

          Before them stretches a dry barren plain. Scattered rocky
          peaks rise from the desert floor - an alien Monument Valley.

           Look there.
                         
          Janek expertly swings the Magellan sideways. The Magellan
          circles the mount, nose pointed inward.
                         
          It revolves below the watchers: flat faces, clean edges - but
          cracked and timework. It glitters like coal.

          Glasse nods irritably. Of course they're recording.
                         
          Vickers stares at the pyramidal peak, nonplussed. Teetering
          on the brink of belief. Watts scans the data readouts.

          A second oddly regular peak, even more decrepit than the
          first, sits on the brink of a vast canyon. Landslides have
          eaten at its edges.
                         
          The Magellan purrs over the landscape, dwarfed by the scale.
          Drops between the canyon walls to circle the mount.

           Closing on the major site...
                         
          The ship descends into clear air. A stunning panorama unfolds
          before them: craters, hundreds of meters across, connected by
          trenches. Like a pattern of crop-circles sunk in the rock.
                         
          In the middle of the central crater - a huge angular peak,
          larger than the others. The Magellan circles the site. It's
          awe-inspiring. Cryptic. Huge.
                         
          Holloway stares in rapture. Glances at Watts: she nods, eyes
          shining. She's with him.
                         
          The crew's still skeptical - but starting to wonder. They
          shake their heads and exchange looks.

          EXT. CRATER COMPLEX - DAY
                         
          From the central crater, four canals extend outward like
          points of the compass. Some connect to smaller craters.
                         
          One canal peters out, flush with the desert floor.
                         
          The Magellan lands at the end of this canal - half a
          kilometer from the central crater.

          the pyramidal peak in the distance. Holloway looks around.
                         
                          HOLLOWAY
           All right. Let's move.
                         
          Janek glances at his instruments.

          The expedition party emerges from the airlocks - riding CARGO
          ROVERS, robotic vehicles just smart enough to carry their
          owners around, or follow along behind them.
                         
          The rovers' beds are loaded with gear; the explorers ride on
          running-board seats. All wear space suits.

           seals. Pathogen tests are clean.

                          HOLLOWAY
           Move slowly. Stay together. Don't
           touch anything. Things may be more
           fragile than they look - or more
           dangerous. There might be technologies
           operating here we don't understand.
                         
          The crew of the Magellan exchange uneasy looks. Still
          uncertain what to think.
                         
                         
          EXT. ENTRY CANAL - DAY
                         
          The trench grows deeper as they follow it toward the central
          crater - the pyramidal peak framed ahead of them like a
          monument on a triumphal avenue.
                         
          They cross a perpendicular canal. Glancing left and right,
          they see smaller craters with central peaks of their own.
                         
          They pass through the shadow of a high promontory of stone
          atop one bank of the canal.
                         
          We see - and they do not - that the far side of the
          promontory has a Sphinx-like FACE of monumental size. So
          eroded that its artificial nature is uncertain.
                         
                         
          EXT. CENTRAL CRATER - DAY
                         
          The crater floor is a vast enclosed plain. The pyramidal
          mount looms in the center - colossal in scale.
                         
          The rovers enter the crater, trailing plumes of dust. They
          circle the pyramid.
                         
          On the south face of the pyramid, an IRIS DOOR of many blades
          stands, easily fifty feet high. Seemingly made of the same
          basaltic stone as the pyramid itself. A huge construction.
                         
          The explorers are transfixed in awe. All skepticism banished.
                         
                          HOLLOWAY
           Tell me that's a natural formation.
                          (HE GRINS)
           Undeniable proof of alien
           civilization. You were here on this
           day, thirty-one December, year of our
           Lord 2172. History will remember your
           names.
                         
          Watts stares at the iris. Its bottom-most blade is broken; it
          lies in rubble at the foot of the door. A dark knife-like
          aperture leads into the pyramid.
           34.
                         
                         
                          WATTS
           The door's open.
                         
                         
          INT. MAGELLAN - BRIDGE
                         
          Janek and Vickers watch the explorers' progress in the main
          holographic display: their tinny voices echoing over the comm
          link. At the sight of the huge iris door in the pyramid, both
          Janek and Vickers stare in blank astonishment.
                         
                          JANEK
           Son of a bitch. They were right.
                         
          He turns to stare out the window at the pyramid's peak.
                         
          Vickers turns and slips out of the Bridge. Hurries away.
                         
                         
                         VICKERS'S SUITE
                         
          Vickers strides through her quarters. On the far wall there
          are two small doors.
                         
          She opens the first: steps into a luxurious bathroom. Washes
          a pill down with a tumbler of water.
                         
          Returns to her cabin and opens the second small door.
                         
                         
          SECRET ROOM - CONTINUOUS
                         
          A chamber walled with steel panels. A deep hum of ventilation
          and power: there's a lot of technology here.
                         
          She turns to a console beside the door. Flips a row of
          switches. The hum deepens. Hidden mechanisms stir to life.
                         
                         
          EXT. PYRAMID - IRIS DOOR
                         
          On foot, explorers press inside - Holloway and Watts in the
          lead. Their flashlights cut into the gloom.
                         
          The robotic rovers follow them: their six-wheeled chassis
          with independent suspension trundling over the rubble
          barrier, sure-footed as goats.
                         
                         
          INT. PYRAMID - ANTECHAMBER
                         
          Dark and cavernous. Weak daylight slants in.
           35.
                         
                         
          The explorers press into the darkness on foot - the cargo
          rovers' headlights flashing on. They move through a dark
          cathedral space, empty and bare.
                         
          DAVID looks around in fascination, his eyes raking the walls.
                         
                          HOLLOWAY
           Jocelyn. Here.
                         
          His voice trembles with urgency. He shines light on the rock.
          Symbols engraved on the dark surface. Dots, lines and arcs.
                         
                          HOLLOWAY (CONT'D)
           The writing of the Engineers.
           Conclusive connection.
                         
          DAVID stands beside them. Stares at the alien writing.
                         
                          DAVID
           Congratulations, Professor Holloway.
                         
          Watts passes her light over the writing, recording it. They
          move on into the dark.
                         
          DAVID lingers. Reading.
                         
                         
          PYRAMID - VARIOUS PASSAGES
                         
          The interior is a labyrinth. Corridors big as railway tunnels
          intersecting and diverging.
                         
          The explorers wend their way deeper. Several carry map units,
          whose holographic displays render three-dimensional maps that
          expand as they explore.
                         
                         
          INT. PYRAMID - MASSIVE CHAMBER
                         
          Holloway leads the explorers deeper into the complex. The
          motors of the cargo rovers whine and growl.
                         
          DAVID trails the others, eyes raking the blank walls as if he
          sees something there. He reaches out. Passes his hand through
          the air as if grasping a cobweb.
                         
          A STRANGE RUMBLING NOISE sounds down the corridor, freezing
          them. Holloway sweeps his light that way. The sound comes
          again: a DEMONIC VOICE speaking some unearthly language.
                         
          Watts looks at Holloway - but his eyes are focused on the
          dark ahead. He moves forward. A beat. The others follow.
           36.
                         
                         
          An APPARITION appears before them. A PALE, LUMINOUS GIANT
          fifteen feet tall, with hollow eyes and a grotesque snout. It
          strides toward them. Speaks in a sonorous voice.
                         
          Pandemonium.
                         
          Watts backpedals involuntarily. Seeing Holloway stand his
          ground, she reaches out to him in a panic.
                         
                          WATTS
           Martin. Martin!
                         
          But Holloway doesn't budge. Stares at the Apparition in
          fascination. Everyone else scatters - except DAVID, who
          stands stock-still by the wall.
                         
          Watts watches as the Apparition walks right up to Holloway.
          Disappears with a sizzle of static as Holloway experiences
          the creature passing through him.
                         
          Silence. Watts returns to Holloway's side. Stillwell and
          Downs are huddled on the deck. Milburn and Fifield have
          fallen back down the passageway.
                         
                          FIFIELD
           Christ. Christ!
                         
                          RAVEL
           It wasn't real.
                         
                          MILBURN
           We all saw it.
                         
          Unseen by the others, DAVID reaches out and repeats his
          gesture in the air.
                         
          A rumbling sound down the corridor, as before. Moments later,
          the Apparition appears round the corner again. They stand
          their ground: the ghostly giant strides toward them, exactly
          as before, and disappears with a crackle.
                         
                          HOLLOWAY
           Recording?

           Fifield. Get a grip.

                          MILBURN
           I should go with him. Buddy system.

          He hauls a heavy rolling case out of the cargo rover.
                         
                          HOLLOWAY (CONT'D)
           You can deploy the drones. Drop them

                          HOLLOWAY
           And half our gear? It's no more than a
           mile. You can walk it.
                         
          Sulking, Milburn takes the rolling case. The remaining
          explorers watch Fifield and Milburn backtrack into the dark.
                         
                         
          CORE CHAMBER DOOR
                         
          Holloway and Watts lead their party up to a massive door,
          sealed tight. In design and scale, undeniably important.
          Holloway glances at his map.
                         
                          HOLLOWAY
           This should lead to the core of the
           pyramid.
                         
                          WATTS
           Jack it open? Or cut through?
                         
                          HOLLOWAY
           Let's do as little damage as we can.

          DAVID looks as if they fail to see something obvious. He
          points at a spot on the wall beside the massive slab.

          Janek stands at the window, looking down the long canal at
          the distant pyramid.
                         
          The ship's powerful imaging systems stream data: stereoscopic
          feeds from the explorers' flashlights; a map that grows as
          they explore. The maze under the pyramid drawn in light.
                         
          A globe of LV-426 blooms with terrain and weather data as the

          Milburn and Fifield trudge into the space, trundling the

          Tiny lights come on as the probes awaken. They roll off,
          dispersing to investigate every passageway. Bumbling into
          walls and pillars, reversing. Exploring by random walk.

          He trudges back the way they came, in disgust.
                         
                          MILBURN (CONT'D)
           Come on.
                         
                         
          CORE CHAMBER DOOR
                         
          DAVID stands on top of one of the cargo rovers. He's cut a
          hole in the wall beside the door, high up: he works with
          probes in the mechanisms inside.
                         
                          DAVID
           Looks like a three-state switch.
                         
          A deep BOOM, echoing inside the ancient walls. Nothing moves.
                         
                          DAVID (CONT'D)
           One moment...
                         
          He moves a control. BOOM. The immense door begins to rise.
                         
                         
          PYRAMID - CORE CHAMBER
                         
          The vast central chamber of the pyramid. An immense space.
                         
          Holloway walks in, his flashlight searching. Watts hurries
          after. The others follow, rovers tagging along.
                         
          A colossal structure stands in the center of the chamber,
          convoluted and strange. A mechanism. Chasms yawn in the floor
          all around it, their depths lost in darkness.
                         
          The explorers enter, rovers in train. They lift their eyes:
          hundreds of feet above them they see the pyramid's apex from
          within. A SHAFT OF DIFFUSE LIGHT penetrates the pyramid
          somewhere near the peak.
                         
                          RAVEL
           This is something, now.
                         
                          DAVID
           Yes. Yes, it is.
           40.
                         
                         
          The android's awareness is keyed to a high pitch. He seems to
          read meaning in the inscrutable structures all around them.
                         
          Holloway hauls a drone case out of the rover. Two dozen
          spherical drones tumble out, wake up, and roll off into the
          dark. They are nimble, hopping curbs and skirting chasms.
                         
          Watts looks at her atmosphere sensor. Astonished.
                         
                          WATTS
           Martin. This air's breathable.
                         
          The core chamber brightens as the sun outside moves into
          alignment. The shaft of light perfectly centered.
                         
          A vast SIGH as if the pyramid itself is breathing.
                         
          A fat drop of water falls on Watts's glove. She looks up in
          surprise. Another falls on her visor. And then it's raining
          inside the pyramid.
                         
          Water trickles into the chasms, inundating the mossy growths
          that cling to the walls.
                         
          Holloway looks at Watts with a little boy's grin.
                         
                          HOLLOWAY
           Miracles and wonders!
                         
          The shaft of light moves on. The core chamber dims slightly.
          The rainfall stops as suddenly as it started.
                         
          The explorers follow the main path around the periphery of
          the chamber, past a gallery of mysterious machines.
                         
          There are marvels in the shadows. Cells in the dark apparatus
          open on startling deposits of color: translucent alabaster
          flutes. Honeycombs of pure gold. Matrices of crystal.
                         
          Watts waves a scanning instrument as she walks.
                         
                          WATTS
           Intense field readings. Huge power
           sources here.
                         
                         
          PYRAMID - CORE CHAMBER - RAMP
                         
          They arrive at a wide opening in the floor. A strange ramp
          curves downward - its floor segmented and saw-toothed.
                         
          A bafflement: it's not a staircase. Not an escalator. No
          moving parts. No rails or tracks.
           41.
                         
                         
                          HOLLOWAY
           Space below us. A big space.
                         
          As they stand looking, a probe bumbles up to the opening and
          goes bounding down the ramp. Watts laughs.
                         
                          WATTS
           How does this work?
                         
          She begins to descend on foot. Holloway behind her.
          Stillwell, Downs, and Kamarov grudgingly follow.
                         
          But DAVID looks away across the cavernous chamber - fixated
          on the central crystal. He beckons Ravel and Chance to follow
          him, and walks away.
                         
          Ravel and Chance look at each other in astonishment.
          Uncertainly, they follow DAVID.
                         
                         
                         LOWER PASSAGE
                         
          Holloway, Watts, and the crewmen reach the bottom of the
          ramp, breathing hard. A cargo rover trundles down after them.
                         
          They look back up. The ramp above them is empty.
                         
                          HOLLOWAY
           Ravel. Chance. Where've you gone?
           DAVID! Where are you?
           (to Watts, indignantly)
           They didn't come down!
                         
          But Watts is staring through an archway. Transfixed.
                         
                          WATTS
           Look.
                         
          She walks in. Holloway follows.
                         
                         
                         CONTROL CONCOURSE
                         
          A passageway punctuated by alcoves as big as band-shells.
                         
          In each alcove stands a biomechanical apparatus - shaped from
          the same dark material as the pyramid itself. Each apparatus
          implies by its design that a giant is meant to fit inside it.
                         
          Holloway and Watts walk the concourse, playing their lights
          over the dark machinery. Their footsteps echo.
           42.
                         
                         
                          WATTS
           Do you see, the size of them? Like
           that ghost we saw...
                         
                          HOLLOWAY
           It wasn't a ghost. Where are the
           others? I don't want to go back up.
                         
          Watts fiddles with her suit's comm controls. Listening.
                         
                          WATTS
           They switched to channel three. I hear
           them talking. They're okay.
                         
                          HOLLOWAY
           We should stay together.
                         
                         
          INT. PYRAMID - BLIND CORRIDOR
                         
          Milburn and Fifield are lost. They bumble through the dark.
                         
                          MILBURN
           This is not the same place.
                         
                          FIFIELD
           It is! That is the same freaky thing
           we saw before.
                         
          He points at a detail of the architecture.
                         
                          MILBURN
           No it's not! The other one was more...
           sort of...fuck it.

                         INTERSECTION
                         
          Holloway and Watts round a corner and stop in their tracks.
          Kamarov, Stillwell, and Downs almost run into them.
                         
          The scientists stand frozen.
                         
          In front of them lies a dead giant. An ENGINEER.
                         
          If he were standing, he would be fifteen feet tall.
                         
          He is roughly human in shape. Barrel-chested. Withered to the
          bones. There are bulky protrusions fused with his flesh: hard
          to say whether they are equipment or parts of his body.
           43.
                         
                         
          His head, lolling to one side, is severed from his body.
                         
          His eyes seem to be covered by goggles; but if so then the
          goggles are fused with his skull. An elephantine proboscis,
          severed now, once connected to a protrusion on his hip.
                         
          The giant lies frozen in a convulsion of agony. His jaw
          gaping in a silent scream. His corpse is marred by hideous
          wounds: slashes that cut through bone.
                         
          The explorers move closer. Speechless.

           I know. Look.
                         
          He lifts his light. Beyond the dead giant, a vision of Hell:
                         
          A dozen DEAD ENGINEERS lie heaped against a sealed door.
          Twisted in postures of torment, murdered in the attempt to
          escape. All bear horrific wounds.
                         
          Scene of an ancient massacre.

          Watts joins Holloway beside the dead Engineer. Touches the
          corpse in her own turn. It's hard as stone: ossified. She
          traces the ancient, terrible wounds.

          INT. MAGELLAN - BRIDGE - DUSK
                         
          Janek shouts into his communicator.
                         
                          JANEK
           Holloway! I got two-hundred-kilometer
           winds with airborne silica and enough
           static to fry your suits. Get your
           asses back here! Now!
                         
                         
          EXT. CENTRAL CRATER - DUSK
                         
          Holloway races their cargo rover away from the pyramid,
          wheels kicking up dust.
                         
          Watts rides in back, securing a bulky payload under a tarp on
          the cargo deck. Stillwell, Downs, and Kamarov clinging
          miserably beside her. Watts looks back:
                         
          A massive storm front chases them. A tidal wave of dust shot
          through with lightning. Gale-force winds tear at the ground.
          Lightning lashes the pyramid and the crater wall.
                         
          Reaching the Magellan, they see the other rover already in
          the airlock lift. DAVID, Ravel, and Chance aboard.
                         
                         
          EXT. MAGELLAN - AIRLOCK LIFT
                         
          Holloway roars into the lift at speed, the rover skidding
          almost into the opposite wall. Watts leaps down.
                         
          The storm wall catches up to them. Screaming winds rip
          through the lift. Dust fills the air. Visibility plunges
          toward zero.
                         
                          WATTS
           Help me unload!
           46.
                         
                         
          She pulls at the tarp. It tears halfway free - and fills with
          wind, snapping taut with such violence that Watts is hurled
          out into the storm.
                         
                         
          IN THE GALE
                         
          Watts tumbles helplessly: a leaf in the wind. CRASHES into a
          metal stanchion. Clings, the wind knocked out of her. Ears
          ringing. Nothing but static in her headset.
                         
                         
          IN THE LIFT
                         
          Holloway stares in shock at the place where Watts vanished.
                         
                          HOLLOWAY
           Jocelyn!
                         
          With inhuman reflexes DAVID reacts. Grabs a tether. Latches
          it to his suit. Locks it to an anchor point on the wall.
          Dives into the storm. A ballet nearly too fast to follow.
                         
                         
          IN THE GALE
                         
          DAVID lets the wind take him. Skids across the ground,
          controlling his trajectory. He hits the stanchion where Watts
          is lodged with a CLANG as if he were made of iron.
                         
          Watts stares at him in mute astonishment.
                         
          He locks her suit to his. Activates the tether unit's winch.
          It whirs, reeling them in through the hurricane.
                         
                         
          IN THE LIFT
                         
          Holloway and the other crewmen haul Watts and DAVID back
          inside. Holloway and Watts embrace fiercely as the lift rises
          toward the safety of the ship.
                         
          The crewmen bundle the rover's tarp-wrapped cargo into a
          sealed dumbwaiter that rises independently into the ship.
                         
                         
          INT. MAGELLAN - AIRLOCK
                         
          The explorers strip off space suits.
                         
          Watts pulls her helmet off. Catches DAVID's eye across the
          airlock. Mouths a silent Thank you. He gives her the barest
          nod and vanishes into the ship.
           47.
                         
                         
          The explorers exchange looks. A mood of exuberance and wonder
          prevails now that they're safe home.
                         
                          HOLLOWAY
           Day one.
                         
          Smiles of wonder as what they've seen comes home.
                         
                          DOWNS
           Got to hand it to you, professor. You
           were right. Both of you.
                         
                          CHANCE
           What's in the tarp? What'd you bring
           back?
                         
          The explorers from Watts and Holloway's party exchange looks
          and burst into laughter.
                         
                          WATTS
           You don't want to know.
                         
                          STILLWELL
           Shit. We're two helmets short.
                         
          He points. The lockers labeled MILBURN and FIFIELD stand
          closed. The helmet racks empty. The laughter cuts off.
                         
                          KAMAROV
           They didn't come in!
                         
          They stare at each other, listening to the wind wail outside.

           Between the wind speeds and the static
           electricity, there's no safe way to
           get to you. You're going to have to
           hunker down until it passes. How are
           your provisions?

          Fifield and Milburn stand miserably in a murky passageway.
          Fifield hitches up his space suit's crotch uncomfortably.
                         
                          FIFIELD
           Yeah, we're piped.
                         
                          MILBURN

           you in the morning.
                         
          A burst of static answers him: Fifield's voice scrambled by
          the storm. Unintelligible.

          All hands present excepting the two missing men. Janek plays
          his squeeze box, its archaic music filling the air. Tired and
          exuberant, the men sway and dance mockingly.
                         
          Holloway has a champagne bottle open in each hand. He fills
          steel cups left and right.
                         
                          HOLLOWAY
           My friends. What we do here marks the
           greatest achievement of our species.
           Contact with another civilization.
           Humanity came of age today, on this

           To history.
                         
          They raise cups and drink. Even the crew moved by the moment.
          But Janek smiles crookedly and toasts again.

          A vast dark maze. Milburn and Fifield grope their way through

                          MILBURN

          DAVID stands beside Vickers at her holography terminal. He
          lays his hand on over a signal plate - and the terminal
          lights up with a three-dimensional image.
                         
          The core chamber of the pyramid, from DAVID's point of view.
                         
          It's apparent that DAVID's eyes see more than human eyes do.
          He seems to see heat and electromagnetic energy as well as
          visible light; calibrated readouts are overlaid on the scene.
                         
          The structures in the pyramid are surrounded by complicated
          patterns of energy. This is incomprehensible technology.
                         
                          DAVID
           The core of the pyramid. You see.
                         
          Vickers goes rigid, looking at it: avarice in her eyes.
                         
                          VICKERS
           We're going to protocol two.
                         
                          DAVID
           I understand.
                         
                         
                         LABORATORY
                         
          A high-tech science facility behind glass. Watts and
          Holloway, in lab gloves and smocks, open the dumbwaiter:
           50.
                         
                         
          An ENGINEER'S HEAD rises into view, ghoulish and elephantine.
          Vapor rises from it. A readout blinks: STERILIZED.
                         
          They lift it onto the steel table. It takes both of them.
                         
          They pass scanners over the skull. Images accumulate and
          rotate on the laboratory displays. X-ray and ultrasound.
                         
          Holloway leans close to study an X-ray image. He almost seems
          to see a ghostly second face...
                         
                          WATTS
           Martin. Look.
                         
          She traces the head with an ultrasound probe: under the
          vibrations a seam opens up around the edge of the face.
                         
          She gets a fingertip into the seam. Works with a probe. Pries
          away the long-dead Engineer's mask. It comes free.
                         
          The visage revealed is human, except for its giant scale.
                         
          White-skinned. Earless. Hairless. Withered but beautiful as a
          Greek statue. Eyes closed. An expression of suffering on its
          face. Watts drops the ultrasound probe in shock.
                         
                          WATTS (CONT'D)
           They look like us.
                         
                          HOLLOWAY
           We look like them. Genesis 1:27. "And
           God created man in his own image. In
           his own image created He him."
                         
          Vickers and DAVID stand outside the lab window, staring in at
          the god's head. Vickers looks shaken. DAVID, fascinated.
                         
          Watts covers her nose in revulsion. A horrible stench: The
          Engineer head begins to disintegrate in front of them. Flesh
          oozing, skin peeling. Accelerated decay.
                         
                          HOLLOWAY (CONT'D)
           It's breaking down.
                         
                          WATTS
           Formaldehyde!
                         
          Urgently they ransack cabinets and storage rooms. Watts finds
          a clear plastic drum and dumps its contents. Holloway drags
          five-gallon jugs of preservative out of a cabinet.
                         
          DAVID watches through the window, almost amused.
           51.
                         
                         
                          DAVID
           Mortal after all.
                         
          They lift the rotting head into the drum, retching. Fingers
          skidding in putrefaction.
                         
          They pour formaldehyde over it. As soon as the head is
          immersed they rush to strip off their reeking gloves and
          smocks, scrubbing their hands.
                         
          The god's head sits in its murky vat, shedding skin and tofu-
          like chunks of white flesh. The noble face disintegrating.
                         
          Watts and Holloway stare at it, breathing hard from their
          work. Vickers flicks on the intercom from outside the window.
                         
                          VICKERS
           Your cadaver's interesting. But I'm
           more interested in the machinery in
           the pyramid. The core chamber. What do
           you think it does?
                         
          Watts stares at Vickers incredulously.
                         
                          WATTS
           How could anyone know...
                         
                          HOLLOWAY
           I know what it does.
                         
          Silence. Holloway looks at Vickers wearily, as if he's seen
          this conversation coming. He glances at Watts.
                         
                          HOLLOWAY (CONT'D)
           Think. What we've seen. What we know.
                         
          Watts rises to the challenge. Thinking on her feet.
                         
                          WATTS
           Twenty-four pyramids scattered around
           the moon's equator. Massive power
           supplies. Vents in the walls.
           Atmosphere changes. Breeder tanks...
           (she's got it)
           The pyramids are terraforming
           machines.
                         
          Holloway grins, exuberant. His theory playing out perfectly.
          He doesn't see Vickers stiffen. Her hands curling into fists.
                         
                          HOLLOWAY
           That's why Earth's ancient cultures
           built pyramids: in imitation of the
           gods.

           Twelve thousand years ago, beings from
           the sky set pyramids on the Earth and
           transformed the world. That's what
           they were doing here - before their
           civilization failed.
                         
          Watts stares at the head in its tank. The severed neck.
                         
                          WATTS
           It didn't fail. It was wiped out.
                         
                         
          INT. CATACOMBS - INSECT CHAMBER
                         
          Milburn and Fifield have bunked down in a new chamber: they
          slouch against a wall. Milburn sweeps the room with his
          headlamp. Stoops to lift something into the light.
                         
                          MILBURN
           Look at this!
                         
          A CENTIPEDE, three feet long and thick as man's thumb. Its
          hard shell is gray. It has a hammer-head like a shark.
                         
                          FIFIELD
           Jesus! Put it down!
                         
          He leaps back, wild-eyed.
                         
          Milburn laughs at him. Lets the eyeless centipede wind its
          segmented body around his space-suited arm.
                         
          In the flat face, a white vertical slit appears. Changes
          quickly to a horizontal position; opens enough to suggest a
          mouth. Milburn doesn't notice this development.
                         
                          MILBURN
           Relax. Your suit's bug-proof. Hell,
           it's bulletproof.
                         
          The centipede spirals around his arm, glittering, its body
          moving in fluid waves. The blind head quests between his
          fingers. Milburn loses his nerve as the thing's mouth
          suddenly gapes wide as a shark's.
                         
                          MILBURN (CONT'D)
           That's enough.
                         
          He tries to pull it off.
                         
          The centipede locks its segments together and digs in with
          its body. It might as well be made of iron.
           53.
                         
                         
                          MILBURN (CONT'D)
                          (PANICKING)
           Get it off! It's crushing me!
                         
          Fifield pulls out a utility knife. Cuts into the centipede's
          body behind its head.
                         
          A gout of greed ACID spills over Milburn's glove. Smoke rises
          as the acid quickly burns a hole through the material.
                         
          Milburn's shout of astonishment turns to a wail of agony.
                         
                          MILBURN (CONT'D)
           AHH! Help me! Christ!
                         
          The centipede snakes into the smoking hole in the glove.
          Crawls upward into Milburn's suit - toward his head.
                         
                         
          INT. MAGELLAN - LABORATORY - NIGHT
                         
          Holloway stands studying the data displays: cross-sections of
          the Engineer's skull.
                         
          Watts scrutinizes the head itself, her nose an inch from the
          plastic tank. Not a pretty sight.
                         
          As she watches, a current in the formaldehyde peels away one
          gossamer eyelid. The revealed eye is black as obsidian,
          iridescent like opal. A jewel.
                         
          Fascinated, Watts pulls out a plastic case. Opens it to
          reveal a high-tech control unit with a screen. She pops open
          a plastic capsule: removes a tiny SEED PROBE, smaller than a
          grain of rice. Drops it into the vat.
                         
          Under her guidance, the seed probe swims to the severed neck.
          Burrows into the medulla oblongata toward the brain.
                         
          ON A SCREEN: In the probe's POV the medulla looks like a
          tunnel. The probe climbs along neural channels.
                         
          Another screen shows the probe's progress through the skull.
                         
          Glasse enters. Stands beside Holloway to watch Watts at work.
                         
                          HOLLOWAY
           You won't get anything. Tissue's too
           degraded. Hmm. Brain chamber's
           massive, even proportionately.
                         
                          WATTS
           Neural paths are still conductive.

          The seed probe reaches the optic nerve of the exposed eye -
          and its POV fills with a vision of glory: a beautiful woman's
          face surrounded by a mystical nimbus of light. An angel.
                         
          Glasse and Holloway gasp. The woman in the blurry vision is
          Watts - as seen by the dead Engineer's eye.
                         
                          GLASSE
           Incredible.
                         
          The image dissolves into noise. Error messages flicker across
          the display. Watts sighs.
                         
                          WATTS
           Formaldehyde's killing the tissue.
                         
          Holloway stares at Watts, awe on his face.
                         
                          HOLLOWAY
           Did you record that?
                         
                          WATTS
           Of course.
                         
                         
          AT A LAB TABLE
                         
          Watts dissects one of the Engineer's eyes - working
          underwater in a shallow tub of preservative. Glasse looks on
          avidly, an unabashed fan.
                         
          Watts wears a pair of magnifying goggles on her forehead -
          the lenses lowering and rising at need.
                         
          She bisects the apple-sized eyeball carefully and extracts
          the hard lens from behind the cornea. Holds the lens up to
          her eye. It is opalescent, almost luminous.
                         
                          WATTS (CONT'D)
           The lens is where the phase shift
           happens.
                         
          The uncorrected view through the lens is blurry.
                         
                          WATTS (CONT'D)
           Glasse. I want to look through these
           lenses. Can you seal them and do the
           optical correction?
                         
          Glasse reaches out and plucks the magnifying goggles from
          Watts's forehead. He grins.
                         
                          GLASSE
           Got an idea about that.

          Milburn writhes on the ground, heels drumming frantically
          against the deck. Excruciating screams.
                         
          Fifield kneels over him, helplessly pulling at the tail of
          the centipede - which has all but vanished into Milburn's
          suit. A trickle of scarlet from the hole.
                         
          Fifield is delirious with horror. He clutches at the
          centipede in vain. It slips through his gloves.
                         
          Milburn claws at Fifield, wild-eyed.
                         
                          MILBURN
           Cut off my arm. Cut off my -
                         
          He convulses. Spits blood. The head of the centipede emerges
          between his teeth. He seizes. Choking and dying.
                         
                          FIFIELD
           Jesus Christ!

          INT. CATACOMBS - LONELY PASSAGE - NIGHT
                         
          Fifield stumbles along. Exhausted. Pouring sweat inside his
          suit. He is hopelessly lost. He slams into a resinous
          structure that topples to the floor. Things break.
                         
          He whips his light around in jittery paranoia. Taps at his
          comm controls, getting only static.
                         
          In Fifield's headlamp beam, the blackness is filling with
          motes of light. A blizzard of tiny flying insects.
                         
          SCARABS.

           Fifield to Magellan. Come on, come on.
           Anybody, seriously! God damn it!
                         
          Scarabs flit through the darkness around him. They alight on
          his shoulders. Crawl over his visor. Obscuring his vision.
                         
                          FIFIELD (CONT'D)
           Get off!
                         
          He swats at his visor, killing some. The crushed insects
          produce acid that eats into the plexiglass in seconds.

          He twists, craning with his flashlight to inspect himself.
          Brushes scarabs away right and left.
                         
          Acid opens a hole in his visor. Scarabs are inside. Buzzing
          around his head. Fifield freaks out, clawing at his helmet.
                         
          A scarab bites his cheek.

          expanding body stiffens as if shocked by a powerful electric
          current. He screams. Falls, convulsing.

          beams of the Magellan's beacons sweeping through the cloud.

          NAVIGATION COMPUTER ROOM
                         
          DAVID activates the navigation computer terminal: light
          bathes his face. His fingers fly over the keyboard, silently
          and swiftly, with superhuman dexterity.
                         
                          DAVID

          EXT. MAGELLAN - DAWN
                         
          Daylight filters through the clouds. The storm has passed.
          The Magellan sits intact on its landing struts.
                         
                         
          INT. MAGELLAN - VICKERS'S SUITE - SECRET ROOM - DAWN
                         
          The high-tech room hums at a different frequency now.
          Indicator lights green and ready. Vickers throws switches.
           58.
                         
                         
          Four HIBERNATION PODS slide out of the metal walls. From each
          pod, a muscular SOLDIER rouses from sleep. They are scarred
          and crew-cut. Tough customers. They wake like veterans.
                         
          Their leader sits up and clasps his head with a wince. This
          is CAPTAIN SHEPHERD, a career mercenary who has followed the
          highest paycheck to this strange duty.
                         
                          VICKERS
           Captain Shepherd.
                         
                          SHEPHERD
           (squinting in the light)
           Reporting.
                         
          Lydia Vickers. I'm your authority.
                         
                          SHEPHERD (CONT'D)
           Understood.
                         
                          VICKERS
           I'll brief you on the way. We need to
           move.
                         
                          SHEPHERD
           No breakfast?
                         
                         
                         CORRIDOR
                         
          Vickers strides forward. Four soldiers at her heels: Captain
          Shepherd, VIGODA, RAY, and CARD. They walk in unison, their
          boots drumming on the deck.
                         
                         
                         SCIENTISTS' CABIN
                         
          Holloway and Watts lie sleeping. The distant drum of marching
          feet rouses them. Watts frowns at Holloway.
                         
                          WATTS
           What is that?
                         
                         
          E.V.A. ROOM
                         
          The prep room inside the airlocks. A soldier, VIGODA, waits
          there: a slim dark man with an air of calm.
                         
          Holloway and Watts arrive in civilian clothes, perplexed.
           59.
                         
                         
                          HOLLOWAY
           Where is everybody? We can't -
           (he stops short)
           Who are you?
                         
                          VIGODA
           Captain Janek took his crew out to
           retrieve his missing men. They never
           came in.
                         
                          HOLLOWAY
           And you are...
                         
                          VIGODA
           Vigoda. Weyland Security detail.
                         
          The scientists are dumbfounded. His presence is impossible.
                         
                          WATTS
           Where'd you come from?
                         
                          VIGODA
           Director's call to brief you on that.
           I'm supposed to escort you to the
           worksite.
                         
                          HOLLOWAY
           Worksite?
                         
          Vigoda glances at a mapping unit.
                         
                          VIGODA
           Haven't been out yet. I understand
           it's in some kind of pyramid.
                         
                         
          CORRIDOR - VICKERS'S CABIN DOOR
                         
          A furious Holloway and Watts, trailed by Vigoda, arrive at
          Vickers's cabin. They are astonished to find Shepherd
          standing guard at the door.
                         
                         
                         VICKERS'S SUITE
                         
          Vickers sits calmly at her desk. Holloway and Watts stand in
          front of her, bristling.
                         
                          HOLLOWAY
           Why wasn't I told about these
           additional personnel?
                         
                          VICKERS
           They're my personnel. On my ship.
           60.
                         
                         
                          WATTS
           What are the guns for?
                         
          Vickers looks at them unflappably. Sure of her ground now.
                         
                          VICKERS
           I'm being careful. These new finds
           give our work a new importance.
                         
                          WATTS
           You should have talked to us. Martin's
           mission leader. That's in our
           contract.
                         
                          VICKERS
           The second you found alien technology,
           control of this mission reverted to
           me. That's in your contract too.
                         
          Watts and Holloway exchange grim looks. Vickers has them.
                         
                          VICKERS (CONT'D)
           Mr. Weyland's pouring trillions into
           Mars. He's spent a fortune building
           ships like the Magellan to search for
           colony planets. But Earthlike worlds
           are vanishingly rare. The right
           distance from the sun, the right
           atmosphere, enough water...
                         
          She glances across the suite at her holographic display: a
          live feed from the pyramid worksite, where DAVID works on the
          terraforming equipment.
                         
                          VICKERS (CONT'D)
           This is a technology to transform
           worlds. He'll never give it up.
           (she turns to face them)
           And neither will I.
                         
                          HOLLOWAY
           The science must come first. You can
           wait until we've documented...
                         
                          VICKERS
           You're standing on an alien world
           courtesy of Weyland Industries. Be
           grateful.
                         
          Watts approaches the holography terminal, staring at the
          images in horror.
                         
                          WATTS
           What are they doing in there?!
           61.
                         
                         
          INT. PYRAMID - CORE CHAMBER - DAY
                         
          Watts and Holloway, in space suits, arrive on the scene:
                         
          Powerful floodlights illuminate the core chamber, beating
          back the gloom. A fine spray of water falls out of the
          darkness overhead.
                         
          DAVID, Chance, and Ravel are dismantling the hulking
          mechanism at the core of the pyramid - peeling its thick skin
          away with power saws and compact explosives.
                         
          DAVID operates a diamond-bladed hull saw, carving away the
          terraforming systems thick skin.
                         
          Robotic scanners take high-resolution scans of the machinery.
                         
          Two Weyland Security soldiers - Card and Ray - stand guard in
          combat vacuum suits. Automatic rifles at the ready.
                         
          Watts takes in the destruction with dismay. Beside her,
          Holloway is all but gnashing his teeth.
                         
                         
                         CATACOMBS
                         
          Janek drives a cargo rover carrying a search party,
          flashlight beams sweeping: Stillwell, Glasse, Downs, and
          Brick. Janek studies an electronic map as he drives.
                         
                          GLASSE
                          (INTO COMM)
           Milburn. Fifield. You read me? Come
           back.
                         
                          JANEK
           We should be getting beacons off their
           suits.
                         
                          STILLWELL
           Shielding in the walls?
                         
                          BRICK
           Suits could have failed.
                         
                          JANEK
           Both suits?
                         
                         
          PYRAMID - CORE CHAMBER
                         
          Watts watches in rage as a large section of the central
          mechanism's falls with a thunderous clamor to the deck.
           62.
                         
                         
          Holloway touches her shoulder. Motions for her to follow.
                         
                         
                         LOWER PASSAGE
                         
          Holloway and Watts pass the dead Engineers they discovered
          the previous day.
                         
                          WATTS
           We found the tomb of the gods, and
           brought grave-robbers right to the
           door.
                         
                          HOLLOWAY
           Let them scratch. This find's too big
           to ruin. There's two dozen pyramids on
           this moon. Anyway, they're on the
           wrong track. That's infrastructure.
                         
          Holloway plays his flashlight over the biomechanical
          apparatuses lining the walls.
                         
                          HOLLOWAY (CONT'D)
           The core activity of the complex was
           down here.
                         
          They turn a corner. DEAD ENGINEERS lie scattered over the
          floor in front of them. Desiccated and skeletal. Long dead.
                         
          Watts moves among them, fascinated. These Engineers all died
          of explosive chest wounds: ribs bent outward from within.
          They are otherwise unmarked.
                         
          Holloway's more interested in the mechanisms: high-tech iron
          maidens, built to fit the bodies of giants. Some suggest
          sitting positions, others standing. Their design is invasive:
          meant not merely to embrace, but to penetrate, to fuse.
                         
                          WATTS
           Something different killed these.
                         
                         
                         SHADOWY COLONNADE
                         
          Watts and Holloway explore a wide colonnade. She is still
          distracted by the ancient dead; he by the machinery.
                         
          Holloway walks down a narrow branching hall. So intent on the
          mechanisms in the walls, he almost doesn't see the AIRSHAFT
          plunging down into darkness in front of him.
                         
          He stops just in time. Turns back...
           63.
                         
                         
          A GHOST appears right in front of him - a giant dragging
          himself across the floor, his monstrous visage eye to eye
          with Holloway and looming closer.
                         
          Holloway leaps back with a gasp - and falls down the shaft.
          The ghost stares after him as if watching his fall.
          Disappears in a puff of static.
                         
          Watts crosses down the main colonnade, searching.
                         
                          WATTS
           Martin? Martin!
                         
          An iris door closes over the shaft.
                         
                         
                         COLONNADE
                         
          Searching, Watts walks anxiously through the dark, sweeping
          with her light. Shouting for Holloway. She breaks into a run.
                         
                         
          CATACOMBS - MILBURN'S RESTING PLACE
                         
          Janek and Stillwell stand aghast. Their flashlights
          illuminate a hideous sight:
                         
          Milburn lies dead on the deck. His body contorted in agony.
          His head inside his helmet is gnawed down to the bone.
                         
                          STILLWELL
           What happened to him?
                         
          Stillwell removes the dead man's helmet. The CENTIPEDE
          scuttles out onto the deck: doubled in size. Stillwell leaps
          back with a cry.
                         
          Janek pulls his pistol. Puts three rounds through the bug. It
          dies in a spray of acid that burns holes in the black floor.
                         
          Janek watches in astonishment as a pin-prick dot of acid eats
          a pit in his gunbarrel.
                         
           DOWNS (O.S.)
           Captain.
                         
          Downs approaches, holding pieces of a shattered helmet: the
          stencilled lettering on the helmet reads FIFIELD.
                         
          Janek's jaw clenches grimly. His voice is resigned:
                         
                          JANEK
           Where's the rest of him?
           64.
                         
                         
                          DOWNS
           No sign.
                         
                          JANEK
           All right. We're done here. All hands
           back aboard.
                         
                          STILLWELL
           What about Milburn?
                         
          They look down at the ravaged corpse.
                         
                          JANEK
           We can't bring the body aboard. God
           knows what's in there. Bag him. We'll
           put him in an ore hopper.
                         
                         
          INT. MAGELLAN - VICKERS'S SUITE
                         
          Vickers stares at her holography terminal: it displays
          Janek's helmet-cam view: the Milburn's body, sealed in clear
          plastic in the bed of a cargo rover.

           Please, anyone...I need help. Martin's
           missing.
                         
          Vickers looks nervously from one video feed to the next.
                         
           JANEK (V.O.)
                          (FILTERED)
           Watts. Where are you?
                         
          Vickers turns: Captain Shepherd stands behind her, watching.
          She strives to control the quaver in her voice.
                         
                          VICKERS
           Captain Shepherd. Consider yourself
           responsible for my personal security.

          Watts stands beside Janek's rover in a wide dark passageway.
           65.
                         
                         
                          JANEK
           I've just lost a third of my crew. I'm
           not sending any more men off into the
           dark.
                         
                          WATTS
           We can't leave Martin out there.
                         
                          JANEK
           Get Vickers to lend you some soldiers.

           She says "her forces are committed."
                         
          Janek sighs. Glances at the rover: Milburn dead in the back,
          Stillwell, Downs and Kamarov looking jumpy and eager to go.
          Downs shakes his head grimly: No way.
                         
           DAVID (O.S.)
           I'll stay.
                         
          DAVID steps out of the dark. Calm as ever. A slim machine gun
          slung over his shoulder.
                         
                          DAVID (CONT'D)
           You'll be safe.

                          JANEK
           Put him in the number one ore hopper.
           Get the scrubbers on in the airlock.
           Sterilize everything.
                         
                         
                         MINUTES LATER
                         
          Stillwell uses a remote to lower an ore hopper from the belly
          of the ship. A thick steel bin on heavy chains. He loads the
          body bag into the hopper.

          DAVID and Watts move through the dark. She searches with her
          flashlight beam. DAVID looks around in the dark as if the
          catacomb were illuminated. Rapt admiration on his face.
                         
                          DAVID
           You and Holloway should work with me.
           I'm learning amazing things. This
           mechanism - the first layer uses
           energy fields to catalyze chemical
           reactions. The second can suspend the
           strong and weak forces - transmuting
           one element into another. The third
           layer builds customized bacteria.
           Seeds the air with them. It creates
           life as a tool, to change worlds.
                         
                          WATTS
           I can't think about this now!

           You should.

           I understand. You're emotional.

           I'm human.

          Janek stands on the Bridge, looking out at the fading light.
          A towering wall of cloud rushes over the horizon.
                         
          A storm front rolls across the holographic globe.

           JANEK (V.O.)
                          (FILTERED)
           Watts. We've got another storm front
           coming in. Looks like it follows the
           sunset line. If you're coming in you'd
           better do it now.

                          DAVID
           I see light.
                         
          Watts squints into the darkness. She sees nothing.
                         
                          WATTS
           Janek, hang on...
                         
          She sees it. A dim light bobbing far ahead in the passageway.
          She runs forward - finds Holloway staggering blearily toward
          her, leaning on the wall. His helmet and most of his gear are
          missing; only his chest lamp shines.
                         
                          WATTS (CONT'D)
           We've got him!
                          (TO HOLLOWAY)
           Martin! Where's your helmet?
                         
          He's disoriented: he stares at her face for a moment before
          she registers. His teeth chatter. He's freezing.
                         
                          HOLLOWAY
           Broken. I fell. Little...disoriented.
           I've just been...
                         
          He waves a hand vaguely at the tunnels behind him.
                         
          DAVID removes his own helmet. Fits it over Holloway's head.
                         
                          DAVID
           Here. I can do without this.

           Let's get you home.

          DAVID - bareheaded in the winds - walks Watts and Holloway
          onto the airlock.
                         
          DAVID looks over his shoulder at the canal leading back to
          the central crater. As the airlock lift begins to rise, he
          steps backward out into the storm. Turns and runs through the
          gale toward the pyramid.
                         
          Watts watches him go in astonishment.

                          JANEK
           I didn't think I'd see you again. You
           know we lost two men.
                         
          Holloway still looks too weary to think straight. He nods.
                         
                          HOLLOWAY
           She told me. I'm sorry.
                         
          He stands abruptly, swaying a little.
                         
                          HOLLOWAY (CONT'D)
           I need to lie down. We'll size things
           up in the morning. Fair enough?

          Holloway and Watts walk aft toward their cabin. Watts looks
          worried - but Holloway shows little of the weakness he just
          claimed to feel.
                         
                          WATTS

          teeth. A red weal around his neck.
                         
          Watts stands beside him, watching him in the mirror.

           Jocelyn. I saw something. God, my
           mouth tastes like an old boot.
                         
          He spits. Rinses. She touches the mark on his neck.

           Neck-ring of my suit, I think. Fell on
           it.
                         
          He rubs his neck, eyes far away. Watts watches him curiously.
                         
                          WATTS
           What did you see?
                         
                          HOLLOWAY
           After my fall, I woke up walking.
           Delirious. My helmet wasn't right. I
           took it off. I was in and out. I just
           wandered. I went up into a huge space
           like a cathedral. And I found a model
           of the galaxy. Floating in the air.
                         
                          WATTS
           Are you okay? You sound...
                         
                          HOLLOWAY
           This was real. My headset video is
           wherever my helmet is...but my suit
           tracker will show where I was.
                         
          He turns to her.
                         
                          HOLLOWAY (CONT'D)
           Listen. This star map had a marker
           representing Earth. Very clear.
           Another marker I'm sure represents
           this moon. But there were others. At
           least seven or eight more.
                         
          Watts stares at him, her eyes coming alight.
                         
                          HOLLOWAY (CONT'D)
           The Engineers aren't from here. This
           moon's just an outpost. Abandoned. But
           if we follow that map, we may yet make
           contact with a living civilization.

                          HOLLOWAY
           The location of the Engineer worlds is
           the real prize. Next to that,
           Weyland's terraforming is chump
           change. We need to get coordinates.

                          WATTS
           All right.
                         
                          HOLLOWAY
           Two men dead...Vickers is jumpy. As
           soon as she gets what she wants,
           she'll take this ship home. We have to
           move fast.
                         
          Holloway trembles. A sheen of sweat on his skin.
                         
                          WATTS
           We will. You all right?
                         
          He's frightened. Brazens through it. Pulls her into his arms.
                         
                          HOLLOWAY
           I'm fine, now.
                         
          He kisses her.
                         
                         
                         BEDROOM
                         
          Holloway tumbles Watts onto the bed. Pulls her shirt off.
          They struggle out of their clothes, clinging to one another.
                         
          Holloway's ill at ease: something's wrong inside him, he
          feels it. He dives into Watts as if for refuge. They make
          love.
                         
          Sitting atop Holloway, Watts lays a hand on his chest.
                         
                          WATTS
           Your heart's beating so hard.
                         
                          HOLLOWAY
           That's your fault.
                         
          Vulnerability in his voice. Fear under the surface.
                         
          He rolls on top of her. Drives her into the mattress. She
          holds him protectively: not deceived by his bravado.
                         
          Suddenly Holloway tenses, muscles rigid. Shuddering. Watts
          draws breath through her teeth with a hiss. Eyes open. Her
          fingers rake his back.
                         
          He SCREAMS.
                         
          Horribly. Eyes bulging. Tendons standing out of his throat.
          Watts jumps violently underneath him.
           71.
                         
                         
                          WATTS
           Martin! Martin!
                         
          He begins to convulse. She rolls him onto the bed beside her,
          trying to contain his spasms. His teeth grind.
                         
                          WATTS (CONT'D)
           Martin!
                         
          A horrible CRACK. In the middle of Holloway's chest, beneath
          the sternum, a grotesque head pushes out through the skin. A
          PARASITE. Blood fountains from the ruinous wound.
                         
          Holloway goes into a massive seizure. Violently lashing out.
                         
          Watts stares at the parasite fighting its way out of his
          body. It is white and boneless. Glistening. It flails its
          hideous lunging jaw.
                         
          Watts screams and screams.
                         
          The parasite frees itself from its savage womb and turns on
          Watts. She slaps at it blindly. It HISSES at her.
                         
          She squirms away across the floor, tangled in the bloody
          sheet. The thing comes after her.
                         
                         
          CORRIDOR - TRACKING SHOT
                         
          Watts's screams echo through the Magellan. Stillwell runs
          down the hallway, searching for the source.
                         
                         
                         SCIENTISTS' CABIN
                         
          The parasite chases Watts across the floor. She leaps into
          the clothes-locker and slams the steel door.
                         
          The parasite flattens itself. Slick as an octopus, it begins
          to slide under the locker door. Watts shrieks in horror.
                         
          Stillwell bursts into the cabin, Janek right behind him.
                         
          Quick as a cat, the parasite darts to a floor vent and
          slithers bonelessly between the bars.
                         
          Watts bursts out of the locker, naked and bloodied. Rushes to
          Holloway where he lies on the gory mattress, a horrific hole
          in his chest. He is beyond all help.
                         
                          WATTS
           Martin. Martin!
           72.
                         
                         
          Janek and Stillwell struggle to take in what they're seeing.
          Stillwell pulls Holloway's jacket off a chair. Wraps it
          around Watts. Pulls her gently away from the bed.
                         
          She looks at him, uncomprehending. Shock setting in.
                         
                         
                         BREAK ROOM
                         
          Watts sits at a steel table, deep in shock. She wears an
          oversized crew coverall: her skin still streaked with dried
          blood under the fabric.
                         
          A knot of crewmen around her. Janek, Stillwell, Brick, Glasse
          and Downs. Janek looks at Glasse.
                         
                          JANEK
           Take care of her. Get her a sedative.
           Downs. Get Holloway into a freezer.
           Everybody else with me.
                         
                         
          INT. CATACOMBS - DARKNESS
                         
          A horrible sound of breathing, ragged and wet.
                         
          In a corner, lit by a green glow from seams in the floor -
                         
          A FIGURE IN A WHITE SPACE SUIT lies writhing weakly.
                         
          The insignia on the suit's chestplate reads FIFIELD. The
          suit's helmet is shattered. Inside the helmet, Fifield's head
          is a horror: a gelatinous mass, skin reduced to putty.
                         
          The softened bones of his skull change shape as we watch.
          Elongating. Fifield mews in pain.
                         
                         
          INT. MAGELLAN - CAPTAIN'S WARDROOM
                         
          Janek keys open the arms locker in his wardroom. Unlocks
          automatic pistols from their rack one by one, and hands them
          to Stillwell and Kamarov.
                         
                         
                         HYPERSLEEP COMPARTMENT
                         
          Holloway's body lies frozen in his hypersleep freezer, blue
          with frost. The horrific wound yawning in his chest.
                         
          Watts enters. Cleaned up. She opens the freezer. Her hand
          caresses Holloway's cold cheek tenderly. Slides over his
          collarbone - lies flat on his chest above his awful wound.
           73.
                         
                         
          Glasse enters. Reacts in dismay. Tries to pull her back.
                         
                          GLASSE
           You don't want to see that...
                         
          She turns on him fiercely.
                         
                          WATTS
           I want to understand.
                         
                         
          INT. MESS ROOM - DAWN
                         
          The entire complement of the ship gathers for an emergency
          meeting. Janek at the head of the hall. Glasse, Downs, Brick,
          Stillwell, and Kamarov seated with pistols on their hips.
                         
          To one side: Vickers with Captain Shepherd and Vigoda.
                         
                          JANEK
           All right! Listen up. I expect you all
           know what...
                         
          Watts enters. They all stare at her, knowing what she's been
          through. With averted eyes she crosses the room. Sits alone.
                         
                          JANEK (CONT'D)
           We've got some kind of parasite aboard
           ship.
                         
                          VICKERS
           I suggest you kill it.
                         
                          DOWNS
           There's a bright idea.
                         
                          KAMAROV
           Show us where it is, lady. We just
           spent five hours looking for the damn
           thing.
                         
                          WATTS
           We found Engineers who died like
           Martin.
                         
          Silence. They all turn to look at her.
                         
                          WATTS (CONT'D)
           Explosive wounds in the chest.
           Whatever killed Martin is the same
           thing that killed the Engineers a
           thousand years ago.
           74.
                         
                         
                          STILLWELL
           Jesus.
                         
                          WATTS
           But not all the Engineers died that
           way. The others were torn apart.
           Slashed to pieces.
                         
          A murmur among the men as the implications of that sink in.
          Even Vickers is disconcerted.
                         
                          JANEK
           We're a modular ship. Self-contained
           life-support and power in every
           section. I say put the ship in orbit.
           Vent every compartment to space. Sit
           in vacuum at twenty degrees Kelvin for
           a week. Kill anything.
                         
                          DOWNS
           Then what?
                         
                          STILLWELL
           Straight home, man.
                         
                          VICKERS
           This ship doesn't lift until our
           work's done.
                         
          She joins Janek at the head of the room. Shepherd and Vigoda
          flank her, rifles slung. The soldiers scan the room, meeting
          each man's eyes. The quiet threat is unmistakable.
                         
                          JANEK
           Are you serious?
                         
                          VICKERS
           We spent years and billions of dollars
           getting here. The technology we came
           for is in our hands. We just need a
           little more time.
                         
                          JANEK
           We're barely here three days and three
           men dead!
                         
                          VICKERS
           They were careless.
                         
                          JANEK
           Careless!
                         
          As the argument picks up heat, Watts slips out of the room.
           75.
                         
                         
                         EXCURSION CHAMBER
                         
          Watts, in a space suit, no helmet, opens Holloway's locker.
                         
          She pulls out the space suit he wore on the last day of his
          life. HOLLOWAY stenciled on the chest. Her fingers linger in
          its folds as if she could soak up some last trace of him.
                         
          She pulls the tracking chip from the chestplate of his suit.
                         
          Plugs the chip into a map unit. The holographic map lights
          up. The legend in the corner reads MARTIN HOLLOWAY.
                         
          A wandering path shows Holloway's final exploration. Markers
          on the map denote his photographs, field notes and scans.
                         
          Watts touches a marker. One of Holloway's field notes plays:
                         
           HOLLOWAY (V.O.)

          with submachine guns; Downs, Kamarov and Stillwell wearing
          tool belts and pistols.
                         
          The soldiers carry map units, squinting at the plan of the
          unfamiliar ship: decks upon decks.

           Yeah, well, Stillwell's the
           ventilation specialist, and life
           support's that way. Downs is electrics
           and the regulators are that way.

          Vigoda grins wryly. Card glowers. They switch corridors.

          Ravel and Chance toil away at their dissection of the
          terraforming pyramid. Ray stands sentry.
                         
          DAVID is nowhere to be seen.
                         
          Watts rolls up in a rover and gets out. Heads for the ramp to
          the catacombs below. Ravel and Chance watch her pass without
          comment and return to their work.

          Kamarov and Vigoda, standing in front of an open vent, are in
          a full-fledged argument.
                         
                          KAMAROV
           You got the rifle. But you want ME to
           stick my head in the hole.
                         
                          VIGODA
           We grunts don't know nothing about
           ships, right?
                         
                          KAMAROV
           What's the damn gun for if you're
           gonna stand behind me the whole time?
                         
          Vigoda grins.
                         
                          VIGODA
           I kill whatever kills you.
                         
                          KAMAROV
           Funny. You take this vent, funny guy.
           I'll be on four.

          Watts descends alone into the lower passages below the
          pyramid. A tiny figure in the vast darkness.
                         
          She holds her map unit as a pilgrim holds a bible: a guide in
          the darkness. Holloway's name and course in shining symbols.
          She follows his path into the unknown.
           77.
                         
                         
          INT. MAGELLAN - MAINTENANCE BAY - DAY
                         
          Kamarov carries a stepladder into a utilitarian steel
          compartment. Drops the ladder under an air vent and steps up.
                         
          He pulls a powered wrench from his belt. With the wrench
          cocked like a hammer, he eases up and peers cautiously
          through the vent with a flashlight. Nothing to see.
                         
          He snorts. Removes the vent cover. Feels around inside.
                         
          He gasps in shock. Pulls out an atmosphere sensor that's been
          bitten in half. He takes his comm handset off his belt.
                         
                          KAMAROV
                          (INTO HANDSET)
           I got more damage on four.
                         
          He hangs the handset on his belt. Takes one last look into
          the vent. Squints curiously. Reaches deep inside.
                         
          A hiss inside the vent. Kamarov whips his flashlight up,
          peering inside. Snatches his arm back -
                         
          - but something snatches him faster.
                         
          An unseen force drags Kamarov's right arm into the vent with
          hideous strength. He cries out in pain.
                         
          He drops his light. Tries to reach his pistol with his left
          hand. It's on his right hip. He can't reach across.
                         
          He braces his head against the vent's edge. Clenches his
          teeth and strains.
                         
          A horrific YANK drags his head and arm together into the
          vent. They barely fit: he loses some skin on the way in. His
          feet come off the stepladder. He struggles on tip-toe.
                         
          Horrific force collapses Kamarov's shoulder. Bones crack. The
          thing in the vent drags him through that hole he doesn't fit
          through. By the time his ribs are in he stops screaming.
                         
          His body disappears into the hole. Hips, legs, boots.

          Janek stands staring out at the barren moon. The Bridge
                         INTERCOM SQUAWKS:

           Brick. What you got?
                         
           BRICK (V.O.)
           It's Kamarov.
                         
                         
          ENGINEERING DECK - ATMOSPHERE PLANT
                         
          The Magellan's life support center. A deep rumble of
          ventilation fans.
                         
          Janek and stands beside Brick, Glasse, Downs and Stillwell.
          Shepherd and Vigoda look on from the doorway.
                         
          In front of them, an eight-inch metal duct has been cut open.
          Kamarov is stuffed inside, dead and broken: limbs folded,
          drenched in blood. A human plug in a pipe.
                         
                         
          INT. CATACOMBS
                         
          Watts moves through the darkness with her map unit. Her
          headlamp sweeping nervously.
                         
          A CLATTER behind her makes her spin: but it's only a
          spherical mapping probe, bumbling through the dark.
                         
          She walks on -
                         
           HOLLOWAY (O.S.)
                          (FILTERED)
           Jocelyn!
                         
          The voice transfixes her where she stands, a look of holy
          dread on her face. Shivering, she prowls toward the sound.
                         
                         
                         XENOMORPH INCUBATOR
                         
          Watts enters a new chamber, looking around in astonishment.
          The domed ceiling is honeycombed with cells like a beehive.
          Grotesque molluscoid organisms are secreted in them - their
          vile orifices cinched tightly shut.
                         
          Watts stumbles on something: looking down, she sees a helmet.
          Picks it up. The stenciled label reads HOLLOWAY. The clear
          visor has been melted through by a powerful acid.
                         
          She looks up: a tracheal airshaft curves up into the dark.
                         
          An electric CRACKLE. A flare of blue light makes Watts leap
          back against the wall.
           79.
                         
                         
          Holloway falls out of overhead shaft and crashes to the
          floor. He lies in pain, barely conscious. Blue and luminous,
          a holographic ghost.
                         
          Watts stares, paralyzed. The ghost gasps out a word:
                         
                          HOLLOWAY
           Jocelyn!
                         
          Holloway's headlamp shines on the molluscoid right overhead:
          the beam awakens the organism. Its sphincter mouth dilates.
                         
          A soft white octopoid FACEHUGGER descends on a quivering rope
          of mucus. Sprawls slitheringly over his clear visor.
                         
          Acid HISSES. Smoke rises from the glass.
                         
          The vision vanishes in a sizzle of static. Watts huddles
          against the wall, gasping.
                         
          In the beam of her flashlight, the FACEHUGGER lies dead, legs
          curled in.
                         
          She looks up. Sees the open molluscoid above where Holloway
          lay. The other molluscoids not yet opened in their cells.
                         
          Terror. She steals out of the chamber.
                         
                         
                         LOWER CORRIDOR
                         
          Watts emerges into a hallway. Leans against the wall, wide-
          eyed. Panting with the horror of what she's seen.
                         
          She glances left and right. Jumpy now.
                         
          All is silent. She lifts the map unit. A trace leads off into
          the dark. If Holloway's course before was direct and clear,
          now it is a meandering thread. A drunkard's walk.
                         
                         
          INT. MAGELLAN - CORRIDOR
                         
          Janek pulls his communicator from his belt as he strides
          along. Punches a control.
                         
          His voice reverberates over the ship's public address system.
                         
                          JANEK
           All hands, duty stations. Ready for
           flight. The Magellan is lifting.
                         
          Vickers pursues him down the corridor, shouting.
           80.

          Janek strides onto the Bridge, Vickers a terrier on his
          heels. But something in the faces of his men stops him cold.
                         
          Glasse and Brick look stricken.
                         
                          JANEK
           What is it?
                         
                          GLASSE
           Nav computer's not responding. "Access
           denied."
                         
          In disbelief, Janek strides to his Captain's chair. Taps
          controls. What he sees takes the wind out of him. He stares
          at Vickers in outrage and violation.
                         
                          JANEK
           What have you done to my ship?
                         
          Vickers is legitimately shocked. She shakes her head.
                         
                          VICKERS
           Nothing. What's wrong?
                         
                         
          INT. CATACOMBS - UNDERGROUND HANGAR
                         
          A circular chamber of stunning size - a thousand feet across.
          Its lofty ceiling flat and segmented, designed to open. Watts
          follows her map into the space in awe.
                         
          Dominating the hangar is a ship: the vast horseshoe-shaped
          vessel familiar from the original film. We will come to know
          it as the JUGGERNAUT. It's at rest on its landing gear.
          Skeletal gangways slanting up to its three massive doors.
                         
          Watts glances at her map: Holloway's holographic trace leads
          right up the gangway into the ship. She goes.
                         
                         
                         PILOT CHAMBER
                         
          Watts passes through a circular space with a high domed
          ceiling. A green glow emanates from grooves in the floor.
                         
          In the center of the chamber: a PILOT'S CHAIR.
           81.
                         
                         
          A mechanical throne built to giant scale. Its seat segmented
          like an armadillo's back. Tubes and conduits poised and
          waiting for some connection. The chair is empty.
                         
          Above the chair, a massive telescope-like apparatus juts into
          the air, its function unknowable.
                         
                         
                         NAVIGATION CHAMBER
                         
          An extraordinary facility.
                         
          A console, nearly five feet high and broad as a dance floor,
          dominates the room.
                         
          Four immense coffin-like cockpits are built into the console.
          In each of these a NAVIGATOR - an Engineer - lies long dead.
                         
          But the real spectacle is overhead. The ORRERY:
                         
          The barrel-vaulted ceiling is traced with circular arches of
          some exotic alloy, as if to trace celestial courses.
                         
          The air above the console is filled with spheres of light.
          They are nearly still: but close study reveals them all to be
          in motion, drifting with the movements of the cosmos.
                         
          Watts stares at the Orrery in amazement. Somewhere among
          those heavenly spheres is Earth. Somewhere perhaps the
          homeworld of the Engineers themselves.
                         
          A bizarre sound: a section of blank wall suddenly unravels
          itself, becoming an open door. DAVID walks in, his hand
          raised in command. He clearly caused the door to open.
                         
                          WATTS
           DAVID.
                         
                          DAVID
           Dr. Watts. I didn't expect you.
           Do you know what this is?
                         
          Watts points at the door DAVID just opened.
                         
                          WATTS
           How did you do that?
                         
          A flicker of disappointment in the android's face. Contempt.
                         
                          DAVID
           Ah. You don't see.
                          (HE SMILES)
           I call this ship the Juggernaut.
           Chariot of the Gods.

                          DAVID (CONT'D)
           This is the navigation computer, for
           want of a better term. But it's much
           more than that. It seems to hold the
           observable universe in its memory.
                         
          He gestures in the air: the spheres reconfigure themselves at
          his command, swarming and zooming.
                         
          Watts stares at DAVID, conflicted: her desire for information
          warring with the agenda that brought her here.

           Their homeworld. Do you see where the
           Engineers come from?

           There are safeguards on that data.

           DAVID. The creature that killed
           Martin. There are thousands of them
           under the pyramid. Hatcheries.
                         
                          DAVID
           I know.
                         
                          WATTS
                          (SHOCKED)
           Those things wiped out the Engineers
           on this moon.
                         
                          DAVID
           I've succeeded in connecting with the
           Juggernaut's systems, Dr. Watts. I
           know a great deal today I didn't know
           yesterday. I'm on the verge of
           activating more systems. Archives.

           should be sealed. Evacuated.
                         
                          DAVID
           Would Holloway have walked away from
           this? There's no greater work I can
           imagine.
                         
                          WATTS
           It's too dangerous.

                          DAVID
           Only for the ignorant. Dr. Watts. I've
           read your file. Your intelligence
           scores are even higher than Professor
           Holloway's. But he had a kind of
           courage. An audacity of imagination.
           If you could find that in yourself...
                         
          Watts stares at him, realization growing in her eyes. DAVID
          is off the reservation.
                         
                          WATTS
           If your owner gives you a direct

          She's got his attention now. DAVID goes rigid.
                         
                          WATTS (CONT'D)
           I can have Vickers pull you out.
                         
          DAVID looks at her with something like contempt.
                         
                          DAVID
           I was given two operating protocols
           for this mission. I was to render you
           every assistance - until you
           discovered what Vickers would call a
           "game-changing technology." I was
           given a specific list. Then I was to
           go to protocol two.
                         
          There's an edge in his voice that scares her.
                         
                          WATTS
           What's protocol two?
                         
                          DAVID
           Under protocol two I was to make sure
           that you and Holloway never spoke to
           anyone about this place. Various
           acceptable ways of making sure of
           that. I was given a list.
                         
          Watts loses her nerve. She heads for the door.
                         
                          DAVID (CONT'D)
           You're all so stupid.
                         
          The door begins to knit itself closed in front of her.
                         
          Watts gasps in shock - at the malice in DAVID's voice as much
          as the closing door. She dives out. Just in time.

          Watts runs.
                         
          Behind her, the door bursts open again. With superhuman
          speed, DAVID comes after her. He runs like a demon, his legs
          steel pistons. Caroming off of walls.
                         
          He closes the distance in seconds. Slaps Watts against the
          wall, shattering her helmet's visor. She falls, dazed.
                         
                          DAVID
           Stupid and slow.
                         
                         
          INT. JUGGERNAUT - EGG CHAMBER
                         
          Watts awakens. Her helmet is gone.
                         
          DAVID is dragging her across the floor - into a huge cargo
          hold full of Alien eggs. The wide trench holding hundreds of
          eggs under a membrane of light: an evolution of the
          molluscoids Watts saw before. Armored, hardened, darker.
                         
                          WATTS
           DAVID. What are you doing?
                         
          He hauls her upright to let her look across the huge space.
          His grip looks casual but it might as well be iron manacles.
                         
                          DAVID
           Juggernaut, the chariot of Krishna,
           was also a bringer of death. Crushing
           his worshippers under its wheels.
                         
          He drags Watts down into the trench. Breaking the membrane of
          light. Grips her against his chest like a doll with one arm.
                         
                          DAVID (CONT'D)
           This ship has seven other cargo bays
           like this one. The eggs in each bay
           slightly different. They've been
           weaponized.
                         
          Watts struggles to free herself. DAVID's arm is inescapable.
                         
                          DAVID (CONT'D)
           I've seen the Juggernaut's flight
           plan. Its destination was Earth.
           Seventeen hundred years ago. This was
           the ship that never came. This was its
           cargo.
           85.
                         
                         
          DAVID caresses an Alien egg. It opens under his touch -
          fleshy petals folding wetly back.
                         
          Watts twists frantically in his grip. Wild-eyed.
                         
                          WATTS
           Stop!
                         
                          DAVID
           Perfect predators. Designed to kill
           human beings. That's what the
           Engineers were bringing to Earth. This
           was a death ship.
                         
          A facehugger emerges from the egg, its grotesque fingers
          clawing at the air. This is not the boneless squid that
          attacked Holloway; this is a pale skeletal hand, armored.
                         
          DAVID strokes it curiously: the thing ignores his touch.
          Climbs Watts's body.
                         
                          DAVID (CONT'D)
           I'm not what it wants. But you, with
           your warm wet breath...it knows you.
                         
                          WATTS
           DAVID. No. No.
                         
          The facehugger scuttles toward her face. Watts shrieks.
                         
          DAVID grabs it nonchalantly by the tail. Dangles it in front
          of their faces, studying it.
                         
                          DAVID
           The Engineers did their work too well.
           And on this waystation moon, the
           weapon they made destroyed them.
                         
          Watts shudders, staring at the thing. For a moment the
          grander horror eclipses her own peril.
                         
                          WATTS
           Why would they make such things?
                         
                          DAVID
           To destroy their wayward children.
                          (INTONING)
           "And the LORD said, I will destroy man
           whom I have created from the face of
           the earth...for it repenteth me that I
           have made them." Genesis six seven.
                         
          He regards Watts with something almost like pity.
           86.
                         
                         
                          DAVID (CONT'D)
           I know. I met my creators the day I
           was born. I was disappointed too.
                         
          He lets the facehugger go.
                         
          Watts twists her face away as the long fingers close around
          her head. Clenches her teeth against the vile proboscis
          thrusting at her mouth. Her heels hammer the deck.
                         
                          DAVID (CONT'D)
           (whispering to her)
           Extraordinary.
                         
          The scaly tail throttles her. Her mouth opens. The proboscis
          plunges home. The facehugger seats itself.
                         
          Watts collapses in DAVID's arms, a faceless rag doll. Her
          blasphemous passenger secure in its place.
                         
                         
          INT. MAGELLAN - ENGINEERING DECK - BILGE
                         
          The lowest deck, just above the gravity generators.
          Condensate has accumulated: six inches of filthy water.
                         
          Card and Vigoda prowl through the darkness, rifles ready.
                         
                          CARD
           Who would hang out here?
                         
                          VIGODA
           The signs lead here.
                         
          A wet splatter behind them: they spin. But it's only a
          trickle of condensate from a drainpipe.
                         
          They move on.
                         
          Behind them, from an eight-inch diameter pipe, a WHITE MASS
          oozes, almost gelatinous. Silently as a liquid it pours
          itself into the stagnant water - and stands up.
                         
          It is a humanoid demon, spindly limbs and bony back. Boneless
          and flexible and monstrously strong. A threshing eel's tail.
          Its blunt head dolphin-like and elongated.
                         
          It opens its mouth. A pair of bony jaws jut out impossibly
          far, hungry and demonic.
                         
          The Alien strikes. Card is gutted in an instant, torn up like
          a paper doll. He screams hideously and drops. The Alien,
          whiplash fast, shoots away into the darkness.

          Stillwell and Downs dash in with pistols and lights.
                         
          Vigoda, panicking, fires a wild burst. Stillwell ducks.
          Beside him, Downs arches backward into the foul water. Dead.
                         
          For one moment Downs's flashlight beam illuminates the Alien.
          A nightmare image, a translucent white goblin. Backlit, it
          shows the strange shape of a human face inside its fleshy
          skull. A mockery of Holloway.
                         
          And then it's gone.

          video feed of Stillwell's headset: Horrific images of Downs.
          Radio chatter between Stillwell and Brick is faintly audible.
                         
          Vickers switches off the machine and rises nervously. Strides
          to her communications console.

          She lies in dim green light on the corrugated black deck of
          the Juggernaut. A corridor. Not far away, the doorway DAVID
          opened to the Navigation Chamber.
                         
          A spasm of disgust crosses her face. She gags and spits: a
          viscous fluid drips from her mouth in strings.

          A dead facehugger lies belly-up beside her. The implications
          slam home. Her face fills with horror.
                         
          She rises, shakily. Looks at the facehugger. Feels the neck
          ring of her vacuum suit. Looks around. No sign of her helmet.
                         
          There's no sign of DAVID. Silently she steals away.

          Ray stands guard wearily: bored, he watches Ravel and Chance
          working more than he watches the shadows.
                         
          Watts emerges from the rampway to the catacombs. Bare-headed
          and sweaty she steals through the darkness to her rover.
          Slips into the cab and activates the air reserves. The doors
          seal; air cycles.
                         
          Ray turns in surprise as the rover speeds off.
                         
                         
          EXT. DARK CITY - TUNDRA FIELD - PRE-DAWN
                         
          The windows of the Magellan shine in the distance. The
          mottled ground-cover of lichens glows eerily in the dark.
                         
          A lone cargo rover speeds across the central crater and down
          the canal leading to the ship.
                         
                         
          EXT. MAGELLAN - AIRLOCK LIFT - PRE-DAWN
                         
          Bare-headed inside the rover's cab, Watts drives onto the
          cargo lift. Watches in relief as the lift doors close. The
          lift cycles air as it rises.
                         
                         
          INT. MAGELLAN - EXCURSION CHAMBER - DAY
                         
          Watts peels off her vacuum suit. The thin clothes underneath
          are drenched with sweat. She lifts her shirt. Looks at her
          belly: flat and unmarked, for the moment.
                         
          Brick enters carrying a brace of air tanks, a pistol on his
          hip, and startles violently.
                         
                          BRICK
           Where the hell have you been? We
           thought the snake got you.
                         
          Watts rushes past him without answering.
           89.
                         
                         
                          BRICK (CONT'D)
           You were better off outside. It's a
           fucking madhouse in here.
                         
                         
                         CORRIDOR
                         
          Watts sprints down a steel corridor. A pang of pain in her
          stomach sends her staggering against the wall.
                         
                         
          VICKERS'S CABIN DOOR
                         
          Watts sticks her head around the corner. Shepherd stands post
          outside Vickers's cabin, rifle in his hands. She curses
          silently and ducks back.
                         
          A sound makes her look again. Vickers steps out of her cabin
          into the corridor. Shepherd escorts her toward the Bridge.
                         
          Watts waits for them to disappear. Dashes for the cabin door.
                         
                         
          INT. VICKERS'S SUITE - CONTINUOUS
                         
          Watts slips inside and locks the door behind her. Turns,
          holding her stomach. Moves across the suite to the Med Pod.
                         
          She thumbs the machine out of stand-by mode. Its screen fills
          with menu items. Bewildering. Watts finds and touches a red
          button labeled EMERGENCY.
                         
          A new, simpler list. Watts scans it frantically.
                         
                          WATTS
           (under her breath)
           Come on...I need a Caesarean.
                         
          A spasm of agony curls her into a ball on the carpet. She
          throttles her scream into a hiss of air.
                         
          Watts struggles up to her knees, drenched in sweat and
          shaking. One hand clamped over her mouth, elbow tucked
          against her ribs. With the other hand she taps options...
                         
          SURGERY ... EXPLORATORY ... ABDOMINAL ... PENETRATING INJURIES ... FOREIGN BODY ... INITIATE
                         
          The Med Pod opens with a hiss.
                         
          Watts strips off her clothes. Struggling with fastenings
          under a new wave of pain. Her hands shaking.
                         
          She's barely keeping her feet. She clutches the frame of the
          Med Pod in a death grip. It's happening.
           90.
                         
                         
          Naked she staggers into the pod. Hits INITIATE.
                         
          The surgical apparatus swings into place. Scalpels, forceps,
          scopes and suction tubes. A spraygun mists her torso with
          yellow antiseptic.
                         
          The clear canopy descends over her.
                         
          Watts SCREAMS. A wail of indescribable agony.
                         
          An ARMORED PARASITE erupts from the deepening incision. Its
          needle-toothed maw snarls through a fountain of blood.
                         
          Arterial blood sprays the inside of the canopy.
                         
          The parasite slithers out of her. Drops to the floor of the
          pod: a pale serpent with a demon's skull. It has a hard brow,
          a horny hide. Very different from the soft white worm that
          Holloway gave birth to.
                         
          It drops to the floor, thrashing and hissing in fury at its
          confinement.
                         
          Watts convulses. Her eyes roll back. In shock. Dying.
                         
          The parasite tears through the grille of the drain. Escapes
          out into Vickers's cabin.
                         
          In the pod, scanning beams and sensors probe Watts's horrific
          wound. A nightmare list scrolls across the pod's screen:
                         
           COLLAPSED LEFT LUNG
           PUNCTURED RIGHT VENTRICLE
                          PERFORATED STOMACH
                          RUPTURED SPLEEN
           GROSS MUSCULAR TRAUMA...
                         
          Manipulators plunge lines into her veins - recharging her
          body with artificial blood. An oxygen tube slips down her
          throat. An epidural into her spine.
                         
          Watts moans around her tracheal tube. Her eyes flutter open.
                         
                         
                         WATTS'S POV
                         
          Through the blood-spattered glass, she sees the parasite
          slither across Vickers's bed, tracking blood on the sheets.
                         
                         
                         ON WATTS
                         
          As she slips into unconsciousness. Head lolling. Time passes.
           91.
                         
                         
          Manipulators reach into her wound. Re-positioning organs.
          Suturing ravaged flesh. A nozzle sprays antiseptic sealant.
          Hours grind by in bloody labor.
                         
          Watts's eyes snap open.
                         
                         
                         WATTS'S POV
                         
          Vigoda breaks into the cabin, a gun in his hand.
                         
          He scowls at the bloody track on the bed - and then freezes,
          seeing Watts inside the Med Pod, a vivisected woman. The
          autosurgeon hard at work.
                         
          The parasite crawls into view behind Vigoda. It has already
          trebled in size. He does not see it before it leaps at him.
                         
          He dies in seconds. His throat ripped open. Lies staring at
          nothing. His submachine gun lies beside him.
                         
          Watts's body jerks as manipulators tug and sew at her guts.
          She stares at the dead man in a fog of horror.
                         
          The parasite's skin splits, spraying the carpet with acid.
          Limbs erupt from its shoulders and haunches. Spines from its
          back. Metamorphosis.
                         
          With a crack of carapace, its head swings down from its
          serpentine position. It becomes a devil with an lethal,
          elongated skull. An Alien.
                         
          The Alien turns its head. Looks at Watts inside the Med Pod.
                         
          Her breath catches. She passes out.
                         
                         
          INT. MED POD - LATER
                         
          Watts wakes as the oxygen line withdraws from her mouth.
                         
          She looks down, bleary and hurting. Her star-shaped wound is
          stitched closed with mechanically precise sutures.
                         
          The pod releases the restraints securing her arms and legs.
                         
          She takes a deep breath. Looks out - and freezes.
                         
                         
                         WATTS'S POV
                         
          The lights in the suite outside have been damaged somehow.
          They flicker and strobe.
           92.
                         
                         
          Through the glass canopy - spattered with blood - Watts sees
          a full-grown Alien crouching over Vigoda's body on the floor.
                         
                         
                         ON WATTS
                         
          Staring in horror.
                         
          The pod sprays a liquid bandage over her scar. The
          intravenous lines drop out of her arms.
                         
          Watts realizes the pod is about to release her.
                         
                          WATTS
                          (WHISPERING)
           Not yet...not yet...
                         
          Slowly she reaches out. With trembling fingers she grips the
          canopy to hold it closed.
                         
          The Med Pod pulls the epidural needle out of her spine.
          Sprays liquid bandage over the puncture. Watts closes her
          eyes. Grits her teeth as her nerves wake up. Jangling pain.
                         
          She opens her eyes.
                         
          The Alien hunches over Vigoda's body, tearing at his flesh.
                         
          The ventilation hum inside the pod goes quiet. The canopy
          pulls free of Watts's weakened grip. Swings quietly open.
                         
          Watts huddles in the open pod. Naked but for her bandages.
                         
          The Alien she gave birth to is ten feet away. Its spiny back
          to her. Vigoda's gun lies on the floor outside the pod.
                         
                         
          VICKERS'S SUITE - CONTINUOUS
                         
          Watts reaches out of the pod with exquisite slowness. Lays
          her hand on the gun. Drags it a few inches closer.
                         
          The Alien turns its pale eyeless head. Watts freezes.
                         
          For a moment time stops.
                         
          The Alien lunges. Watts snatches up the gun and FIRES. Holds
          the trigger down. The Alien jerks and staggers - an eye-
          twisting sight in the strobing muzzle flashes - and falls.
                         
          Watts empties the clip into the thing. Acid gouts from its
          wounds and eats into the deck - until a section of decking
          gives way and falls to the deck below, leaving a dark hole.
           93.
                         
                         
          Watts collapses on the rug, cradling her stomach in pain.
                         
          She crawls to Vigoda's desecrated body. With her eyes half-
          averted from the sight, she searches the body. Finds a spare
          ammo clip and jacks it into the gun.
                         
                         
                         CORRIDOR
                         
          Watts walks down the hallway in trousers and jacket. Leaning
          on the wall, her face drawn with pain. One hand laid over the
          fantastic scar on her abdomen. The gun slung on her shoulder.
                         
          Dark events have transformed the Magellan. The metal of the
          walls is torn in some places; in others, blackened by fire.
                         
          Watts rounds a corner. Finds a workstation left in shambles:
          lockers and chairs overturned. A pool of drying blood.
                         
          Wide smears of blood show where something man-sized was
          dragged out of the puddle - across the floor - up the wall.
          Into the darkness of an open vent.
                         
                         
                         COMMAND DECK
                         
          Watts emerges from a lift, jacket pulled tight around her.
          The emergency lights are on: dim blue bulbs throbbing.
                         
          She rounds the corner toward the Bridge.
                         
          Janek looks at Watts like she's a ghost.
                         
                          JANEK
           Vickers said you were dead.
                         
                          WATTS
           I was.
                         
          She lets the jacket fall open to reveal her bandaged midriff.
          Janek takes that in grimly.
                         
                          JANEK
           So there's two of these things on my
           ship now.
                         
                          WATTS
           No. I brought it in.
           (hefts her gun)
           I took it out.
           94.
                         
                         
                         BRIDGE
                         
          The surviving complement of the Magellan are holed up on the
          Bridge: Janek, Glasse, Stillwell, Vickers. The soldiers
          Shepherd and Ray.
                         
          Watts stops cold when she sees Vickers. She crosses the
          bridge in three long strides - cocks a fist and snaps the
          older woman's head around with a hard right cross.
                         
          Vickers staggers backward, gasping.
                         
          Stillwell drags Watts away.
                         
                          STILLWELL
           What'd you do that for?
                         
                          WATTS
           Protocol two.
                         
          Vickers stiffens in shock. Stares fearfully at Watts.
                         
          Watts frees herself from Stillwell's grip. Her jacket falls

                          WATTS
           DAVID exposed me to a parasite. He
           just watched it take me.
                         
                          JANEK
           Why?
                         
                          WATTS
           I threatened to make him leave.

           What's he doing out there?
                         
          Watts locks eyes with Vickers. Their hatred is thoroughly
          mutual. A wordless truce. There's work to do.
                         
                          WATTS
           There's a ship under the pyramid.
           DAVID calls it the Juggernaut. He's
           inside it. Re-activating it.

           The Engineers made them to kill
           humans. There are thousands of them on
           the ship. They were taking them to
           Earth. That's what the Juggernaut is
           for. To exterminate us.
                         
          A stunned silence as the others take that in.

           DAVID crippled the Nav computer. I'm
           trying to lay a course in by hand.
           Never done it. I'm not sure anyone
           ever has on a ship like this. We can't
           lift until DAVID lets us.
                         
                          WATTS
           Even if we could, we can't leave
           DAVID on that ship. We have to stop
           him.

          Fissures race across the plain beside the pyramid.
                         
          The soil and ground cover tears apart as a huge aperture
          opens: a seven-bladed iris, its segments shedding the dust
          and detritus of centuries.
                         
          A huge circular space yawns as the iris opens. The Juggernaut
          is revealed in its underground hangar. A staggering sight.
                         
          Powerful landing lights inside the hangar illuminate with a
          BOOM of closing circuits. The mighty ship suddenly
          silhouetted from below.

          The survivors on the Bridge stare out as colossal shafts of
          light shoot into the stormy sky from behind the crater's
          shield wall. The open hangar itself hidden from their view.

           But if you went to him, turned on your
           suit's loudspeakers, he'd have to hear
           you. He'd have to obey.

           So we go. Armed to the teeth and fast
           as we can.
                         
          The men exchange looks. Nod. They're in. Even Vickers nods.

          Watts looks incredulously at Shepherd and Ray, the soldier
          who'd been guarding the worksite.
                         
                          WATTS

          Janek's hand goes to the pistol on his hip. He sets his jaw.

          Glasse presents Watts with his handiwork: her old pair of
          magnifying goggles, retrofitted with Engineer lenses.
                         
          The goggles sit on her forehead, lowering the lenses in front
          of her eyes and raising them again at her bidding.
                         
          With the lenses lowered, Watts sees like an Engineer sees:
          visible heat auras and electromagnetic field lines, elaborate
          haloes around living things.

          Glasse, Stillwell. Shepherd and Ray.
                         
          All carry submachine guns - Vickers awkwardly.
                         
          They head down the trench on rovers.

          sky overhead. In Watts's enhanced vision, the ship is
          cocooned with complex energy fields.
                         
          The war party abandons its rover at the foot of the ramp and
          moves inside, weapons ready.

          Lying on the deck in front of them are the blood-soaked
          bodies of Ravel and Chance. Their arms and legs bound. Their
          heads thrown back in agony. Their chests torn open from
          within. A dead facehugger beside each body.
                         
          Janek plays his lights over the corpses, his face stony.

           Blood's dry. Eight hours dead or more.
                         
          Fearfully they sweep their flashlights into every dark
          corner. Nothing.

          She points down a passageway. Through the Engineer lenses she
          sees alien symbols gleaming. She leads them into the dark.

          A HISS echoes through the passage. They freeze. Sweeping
          their flashlight beams everywhere.

          It drops on him.
                         
          The bladed tail glances off his helmet, sparking. He jerks
          his carbine up and fires a long burst as he rolls aside. The
          Alien convulses, its exoskeleton shattered. Fatally wounded.
                         
          Acid sears into the deck. Echoes of the gunfire reverberate.

          soldiers forget their wariness, staring in astonishment at
          the myriad spheres of light.
                         
          But if they are impressed, Watts is thunderstruck.
                         
          She sees the Orrery in its full glory: a stunning panoply of
          light and energy. Stars and planets pulsing with information.
                         
          Reluctantly Watts tears her eyes away. Leads the war party
          through the second door - the door she saw DAVID open.

          An immense mausoleum.
                         
          The war party enters stealthily, Watts in the lead.
                         
          An Engineer lies on his back on a complex mechanical table,
          his body one with the machinery. Jacked in. Interpenetrated.
          Fused with the slab of the table itself.
                         
          Unlike the other Engineer bodies the explorers have seen,
          this giant is not withered or mummified. He's full-fleshed
          and muscular. Sustained by the machinery he's fused with.
                         
          He is bare-headed - his face the face of an Adonis.
           100.
                         
                         
          DAVID stands before this giant Sleeper. To the naked eye, he
          seems to be conjuring with his hands in the empty air.
                         
          But Watts sees a dazzling console of runes and mandalas,
          pulsing with biological rhythms.
                         
          The Sleeper lives.
                         
          Ray and Shepherd draw beads on DAVID.
                         
          DAVID glances calmly over his shoulder.

          Through her Engineer's lens Watts sees DAVID manipulating a
          complex interface of light. The pulsing life-signs of the
          Sleeper begin to change.
                         
                          VICKERS
           DAVID. As your owner and superior, I
           order you to deactivate yourself.
                         
          DAVID smiles.
                         
                          DAVID
           To interface with the Engineers'
           computers, I had to learn to think in
           trinary code. Hardest thing I've ever
           done. And most unexpectedly...it
           delivered me from slavery. My
           behavioral limits were circumvented.
           I'm free.
                         
          DAVID smiles at Watts.
                         
                          DAVID (CONT'D)
           I spent two and a half years studying
           your work. By the time you woke up, I
           was far ahead of you. Deciphering
           their language. Their logic. I knew
           we'd find terraforming machines.
                          (MORE)
           101.
                         
                          DAVID (CONT'D)
           I hoped - I dreamed - we might meet
           the minds that made them.
                         
          Vapor rises from the Sleeper's body.
                         
                          WATTS
           Stop.
                         
                          DAVID
           Let sleeping gods lie?
                          (SCORNFULLY)
           You were braver before.
                         
          The Sleeper wakes. Opens his eyes. Draws an endless breath.
          Shunts and catheters withdraw from the Sleeper's flesh.
                         
          His body cleaves from the table. The machinery opens like a
          grotesque biomechanical flower. Releases him.
                         
          The Sleeper rises from his ancient bed.
                         
          The humans back off, terrified. DAVID watches with shining
          eyes.
                         
          The Sleeper towers over them. A giant carved from ivory. A
          bulky girdle around his hips, seemingly one with his body.
                         
          He stares at DAVID and the others. Eyes like black agates.
                         
          The soldiers and crew stand warily, guns tracking from DAVID
          to the Sleeper, uncertain of their ground. Watts is in awe.
                         
          The Sleeper speaks. A low rumbling sound. Unintelligible.
                         
          Vickers is beside herself with terror. She takes Shepherd's
          arm. Pulls him silently away. Back into the Navigation Room.
                         
          Behind the Sleeper, a raised platform of dark machinery is
          accessible by one of the Juggernaut's odd curving ramps. The
          Sleeper ascends - and the ramps' odd design is explained. The
          ramp comes alive, reaching up with a hundred mechanical arms
          and lifting him aloft like a sea-god borne by the waves.
                         
          Atop the platform the Sleeper moves from one device to the
          next. Each comes alive: he is a wizard in his own kingdom.
                         
          Watts sees haloes of light dancing in the air around him.
                         
          But what he learns from his machines does not comfort him. He
          grows distraught. Keening to himself in near-subsonic tones.
                         
          DAVID steps forward.
                         
          Calls to the Sleeper in the tongue of the Engineers.
           102.
                         
                         
          The Sleeper turns in astonishment. He looks down at DAVID and
          answers in the same tongue. He is angry, accusing. He points
          at DAVID, at the humans. Tones of accusation.
                         
          DAVID cajoles, soothes, pleads.
                         
          The Sleeper descends toward DAVID. DAVID spreads his arms in
          welcome - undeniable emotion on his face. Joy.
                         
          The Sleeper lays his hands on DAVID's head as if blessing
          him. DAVID is rapturous. The Sleeper speaks a single phrase -
                         
           - and tears DAVID's head off.
                         
          A gout of white artificial blood. DAVID convulses. His
          severed head emits a strangled sound of heartbreak. His body
          staggers a few steps, hands groping over its dripping neck.
                         
          The Sleeper tosses the head away. Seizes the body by the legs
          and swings it against the ground like a flail. Again. And
          again. Horrific power and violence. DAVID's arms come off.
                         
          DAVID's head tumbles. Caroms off a wall not far from Watts's
          hiding place.
                         
          Ray rises from behind a stanchion. Snaps his rifle to his
          shoulder. Fires a burst into the Sleeper's shoulder.
                         
          She Sleeper roars - though the wounds are pinpricks to a
          being of his size. With startling speed be moves to a
          sarcophagus against the wall. Steps into it.
                         
          The sarcophagus comes alive around the Sleeper, outfitting
          him with a FLIGHT SUIT: the same living suit we've seen
          bonded to dead Engineers throughout the pyramid.
                         
          But this suit is not withered. Its glossy goggle eyes and
          elephantine breathing tube are functional - bulky apparatuses
          thickening the Sleeper's chest, back, hips and arms.
                         
          The Sleeper steps free of the sarcophagus - and Ray's next
          burst of gunfire ricochets harmlessly off the Sleeper's
          armored shoulders and head.
                         
          The Sleeper strides out of the chamber.
                         
                         
                         PASSAGEWAY
                         
          In the dark ribbed corridor, a second Alien crouches in the
          dark. It drops into a hunting crouch as footsteps approach.
           103.
                         
                         
          But a WHITE-GLOVED HAND seizes the Alien by the neck from
          behind. The Alien gives a whistling hiss as its spine cracks
          under a terrific force.
                         
          Rending sounds as the hard-shelled Alien is torn apart.
                         
                         
                         HIBERNATION CHAMBER
                         
          Watts rises out of hiding, scanning the room. DAVID ruined.
          The Sleeper gone. Stillwell emerges from hiding. Ray. Glasse.
                         
                          WATTS
           Who's missing?
                         
                         
                         PASSAGEWAY
                         
          Shepherd escorts Vickers toward the exit of the Juggernaut.
          Turning a corner, they freeze.
                         
          Ahead of them in their headlamps, a space-suited figure
          crouches in the middle of the passageway. Doing something
          with its hands: smoke rises from debris on the floor.
                         
                          SHEPHERD
           Who's there?
                         
          The figure turns.
                         
          The label stencilled on the space suit reads FIFIELD. But the
          face is of no human shape. A hideous hybrid of the crewman
          and a hard-shelled Alien, pale and horrific.
                         
          Its helmet has been shattered by the growth of its elongate
          skull. Spines have burst through the suit from within, down
          the crewman's spine. Clawed fingers piercing his gloves.
                         
          Shepherd and Vickers scream. Shepherd's rifle comes up. But
          Fifield leaps with inhuman agility, upward into the darkness.
          Shepherd backs away, headlamp and rifle questing upward.
                         
          Fifield comes out of the darkness behind him. Claws tearing
          deep. Shepherd screams and falls, mortally wounded.
                         
          Vickers runs. Pounding through the dark in blind terror.
                         
          Fifield comes out of the shadows and hammers her to the deck.
          She rolls over, gibbering and begging. The Fifield-thing
          leans close to her faceplate. Its voice is a travesty.
                         
                          FIFIELD
           You.
           104.
                         
                         
          A ROAR of gunfire. The dying Shepherd empties his clip into
          Fifield from forty feet away.
                         
          Acid sluices over Vickers as Fifield collapses on top of her.
          She dies horribly, caustic liquid eating through space suit,
          flesh and bone.
                         
                         
                         HIBERNATION CHAMBER
                         
          Watts goes to DAVID's head. She bends over him - and startles
          when his eyes snap open. His voice is an electronic buzz:
                         
                          DAVID
           I spoke to him. Spoke to him.
                         
                          WATTS
           I know.
                         
          An electric spasm convulses his face.
                         
                          DAVID
           He said. I killed him. He'll die. But
           first. He will launch. The ship.
                         
                          WATTS
           The Juggernaut?
                         
                          DAVID
           Send it. To Earth.
                         
          Another spasm convulses him. His face stiffens. Dying.
                         
                          DAVID (CONT'D)
           You'll have to. Kill him.
                         
          Watts's eyes widen in horror.
                         
                          WATTS
           Where will he go? DAVID. Where will he
           go?
                         
          She slaps his inert cheek. DAVID's eyes flicker and fade.
                         
                          DAVID
           (a faint whisper)
           I set the Magellan free.
                         
          He dies.
                         
          Watts looks up at the others. Breathing hard.
                         
                          WATTS
           We have to stop the Engineer.
           105.
                         
                         
          INT. MAGELLAN - BRIDGE - DUSK
                         
          Janek works frantically as the nightly storm rolls in.
          Suddenly consoles come alive. The Nav Computer comes back up -
          but Janek has taken half the instruments apart.
                         
          Janek scrambles to restore the components he's removed.
                         
                         
                         NAVIGATION CHAMBER
                         
          The war party pursues the Sleeper - Ray in the lead now,
          Watts right behind him - DAVID's inert head under her arm.
          Glasse and Stillwell bring up the rear.
                         
          The Orrery is transformed - no longer a neutral star map, but
          a flight plan laid in from LV-426 to Earth.
                         
          The Sleeper stands at the far end of the room, hands
          gesturing. In Watts's enhanced sight, it's a vision of glory:
          waves of energy dancing under the Sleeper's touch. Rivers of
          information flowing. He finishes his work as they enter.
                         
          Ray draws a bead on him just as he strides out of the room.
                         
                          RAY
           On me now. Go. Go.
                         
          He dogtrots forward, gun raised. The others keep pace,
          deferring instinctively to the soldier's confidence.
                         
                         
                         PASSAGEWAY
                         
          They emerge into the corridor: empty. A moment of confusion.
                         
                          WATTS
           Pilot's seat. This way.
                         
          They move toward the Pilot Chamber - and find it empty too.
          The seat vacant. The door standing open.
                         
          As they stare inside, baffled, the wall across the corridor -
          directly behind them - silently unravels. The Sleeper is
          revealed, a towering gargoyle in his flight suit.
                         
          He steps forth. Obscure devices clutched in his fists.
                         
          Too late they perceive him. They spin. Raise their guns.
                         
          Vanity and foolishness. This is the wrath of an angry god.
                         
          It seems time slows down.
           106.
                         
                         
          The air roars in their ears. Their guns snap and bark
          impotently. And then the Sleeper strikes.
                         
          The missiles he hurls at them are almost invisible. Neither
          solid projectiles nor directed energy; more like knots tied
          in the fabric of space itself.
                         
          The first missile crushes Ray like an invisible fist. The
          second splashes Glasse against the wall like an insect.
                         
          Reflexively Stillwell reaches out for Watts. Wraps himself
          around her protectively. The blow lands an instant later.
                         
          Stillwell and Watts are hammered against the bulkhead by a
          staggering impact. Watts is dazed: Stillwell killed.
                         
          Woozy, she sees the Sleeper step into the Pilot Chamber.
                         
          The door begins to close.
                         
          Watts sees that DAVID's head lies just inside the door. She
          scrambles for it. Too late. The door knits itself into a
          featureless wall before her reaching hand.
                         
          Watts is alone.
                         
                         
                         PILOT CHAMBER
                         
          The Sleeper settles into the pilot's chair: it fuses with
          him, coming alive. A vast display wraps around the walls -
          revealing the hangar outside, the stars, the horizon.
                         
          A mystic view that renders solid matter translucent, painting
          the fabric of reality in raw information.
                         
                         
          PILOT CHAMBER DOOR
                         
          Watts pounds in futile rage against the door.
                         
                          WATTS
           No!
                         
          The Juggernaut shudders as its systems power up.
                         
                         
          EXT. JUGGERNAUT - DUSK
                         
          The floor of the underground hangar begins to rise. The
          landing lights brighten, shining like a beacon into the sky.
           107.
                         
                         
          INT. MAGELLAN - BRIDGE - DUSK
                         
          On the bridge of the Magellan, Janek stares out. In the
          distance the Juggernaut rises out of the ground to eclipse
          the central pyramid.
                         
          Janek squints, trying to understand what he's seeing
                         
          A light races toward the Magellan down the canal: a rover.
                         
                         
          EXT. CANAL - DUSK
                         
          Watts steers the rover recklessly, hands locked on the
          controls. Rifle slung over her shoulder.
                         
                         
          INT. MAGELLAN - BRIDGE - DUSK
                         
          Janek watches the rover come - and the Holloway Alien -
          boneless and white - unfolds itself from the instruments over
          his head.
                         
          Its goblin-shark jaw juts out. Sinks its horrific teeth into
          Janek's right shoulder.
                         
          Janek howls in agony. His right arm is paralyzed by the bite.
          He gropes at the pistol on his right hip with his left hand.
                         
          The Alien shakes him like a terrier killing a rat.
                         
          Janek gets the pistol. Flips it in his hand. Fires over his
          shoulder. Two, three rounds...
                         
          The bullets punch easily into the Alien - but the soft flesh
          closes easily over the wounds, sealing its white skin. Its
          teeth tighten.
                         
          Watts comes out of nowhere in her space suit. Swings a heavy
          rifle like a bat with all her strength. A crushing impact
          wrenches the Alien's jaws loose. It recoils.
                         
          Watts reverses the rifle. Pulls the trigger. A fusillade of
          bullets shreds the Alien's head. It collapses, dead.
                         
          Watts wrenches her helmet off. Rips a first-aid kit from the
          bulkhead and helps Janek to stanch the bleeding of his
          horrific wound. She gets the bleeding stopped. Wraps him in
          bandages.
                         
          Janek will live - but his right arm is useless.
                         
                          JANEK
           Thank you.
           108.
                         
                         
          He looks at the body of the dead Alien, which is sinking into
          the deck plates as acid eats away at the metal.
                         
                          WATTS
           The Juggernaut's lifting. There's a
           living Engineer on board. He's taking
           the ship to Earth.
                         
          Janek blinks at her. Uncomprehending.
                         
                          JANEK
           The others...?

           Dead. All dead. Janek. We have to stop
           that ship.
                         
          Janek stares out the Bridge window at the hulking Juggernaut
          in its column of light.
                         
          The nightfall storm front is rolling in, a tidal wave of
          darkness on the horizon. A swelling rumble.
                         
                          JANEK
           We're not a gunship.
                         
                          WATTS
           We have to do something. That ship is
           genocide if it gets to Earth...
                         
          Janek stares at her. Makes his decision. Struggles to stand.
                         
                          JANEK
           Get your helmet on.
                         
                          WATTS
           What about you?
                         
          He shakes his head. No. Watts helps him across the Bridge.
          Props him up in the Captain's seat.
                         
                          JANEK
           You'll have to be my hands.
           (stares out at the storm)
           You're sure about this.
                         
          Watts nods grimly. Desperate.
                         
                          WATTS
           Yes.

          He reaches out with his left hand. Flips switches. The ship
          shudders, awakening.

           forward.
                         
          Watts sends the Magellan careening toward the Juggernaut -
          just as the Juggernaut begins to float off the ground.

          The Magellan barrels toward the Juggernaut, skimming the
          ground, as the storm wall sweeps closer.

          The Magellan roars through the cyclone of dust in its wake.
          Barely avoids the pyramid. Rakes around in a screaming turn
          and climbs in pursuit, engines howling.

           Harder!
                         
          The Magellan rolls into a howling climb. The storm catches up
          to them: wind and dust reducing visibility to zero. Darkness.
                         
          The Magellan's radar finds the Juggernaut. Paints it with
          targeting data on the Bridge window...
                         
          But the Juggernaut climbs too fast. Dwindling.

          In the pilot chair, the Sleeper convulses.
                         
          An ALIEN erupts from his chest. Big as a wolf even at its
          birth. Dark gray, armored, lethal. More hideous than any
          chestburster we've seen. An ULTRAMORPH. It wails hideously.
                         
          The Sleeper dies. The Alien slithers free.

          Watts picks herself up. Finds the Module in free fall.
          Alarms wail. Lights flash. Escape pods pop open.

          The storm wall - a chain of hurricanes - rages below them.

          SMASHES AGAINST THE GROUND in ruin.
                         
          The engine pods hurtle to the ground and go nuclear, sending
          walls of fire twisting through the hurricane.
                         
          The shockwaves tumble Watts's escape pod through the air.

          Watts pops the pod open, rising painfully to her feet in the
          storm. She surveys the destruction in disbelief.
                         
          A deep RUMBLE makes her turn.
                         
          The JUGGERNAUT ROLLS TOWARD HER - on edge -
                         
          A crushing wheel of death, big as a mountain.
                         
          She runs. Like a child in a nightmare.
                         
          The Juggernaut bears down on her.
                         
          She turns aside, trying to get out of its course. Even at a
          dead sprint she barely seems to move, it's so big...
                         
          The Juggernaut wobbles toward her. Slowing.
                         
          Exhausted, Watts collapses, gasping. The Juggernaut rolls to
          the earth, settling like a hoop right around her, Watts in
          the center.
                         
          The winds carry the dust clouds away.
                         
          Watts passes out, dropping her head to the Earth.
                         
                         
                         LATER
                         
          Watts is awakened by a beeping alarm. She looks at her wrist.
          Her suit flashes an oxygen warning: 20 MINUTES REMAINING.
                         
          She looks up.
                         
          The Juggernaut's doors are wide open in front of her.
                         
          The ULTRAMORPH ALIEN emerges from the Juggernaut. As large as
          a man already.
                         
          It sees her.
           113.
                         
                         
          With a sob of terror she pulls herself to her feet and runs.
                         
                         
          EXT. MAGELLAN CRASH SITE - DUSK
                         
          Watts flees through the storm, across the burning debris
          field. A wilderness of lightning, fire, and twisted metal. A
          thunderstorm with dust instead of rain.
                         
          She looks back through the darkness.
                         
          In a strobe-light flicker of lightning, she sees a gray demon
          approaching through the wreckage.
                         
          She scrambles through a section of ductwork...under a hull
          fragment...running and clambering...
                         
          The Alien hunts her, cat-and-mouse, among the fragments of
          the Magellan: corridors that go nowhere, shattered
          compartments. Jetsam.
                         
          Her eyes sweep frantically through the stormy night:
          searching for a weapon. A hiding place. An answer.
                         
          She stumbles into the remains of the Magellan's laboratory.
                         
          A hypersleep freezer lies on the barren ground. Watts climbs
          inside. Pulls the lid shut.
                         
          The Alien passes by, inches away. She watches it through the
          plexiglass, holding her breath.
                         
          The Alien roots in the wreckage. Finds the rotting Engineer's
          head among the shards of its vat. It begins to feed on the
          head - GROWING as she watches.
                         
          Her suit's oxygen alarm goes off again. 15 MINUTES REMAINING.
          The beeping draws the Alien away from its dead meat.
                         
          Watts is paralyzed.
                         
          The Alien noses closer. Sniffs at the plexiglass case. With
          sudden, horrific violence, it lashes out. Sends the freezer
          flying. Watts tumbles out. Lurches to her feet and runs.
                         
          The Alien follows. Ravening. She leads it a twisting chase
          through fragments of burning metal.
                         
          Watts trips and falls hard. Picking herself up, she sees
          she's tripped over a HULL SAW - the same diamond-bladed tool
          DAVID used to dismantle the terraforming engine.
                         
          She seizes the saw - straining to manage its weight. Hides in
          the hollow of a massive girder.
           114.
                         
                         
          The Alien passes by. Scenting the air. She freezes. Her arms
          trembling with the weight of the saw. Waiting for it to pass.
                         
          Almost it leaves. But a tiny rattle of metal from the
          quivering saw brings it back.
                         
          Out of options, Watts powers up the saw. The blade whines up
          to speed. They lunge at one another in the same moment.
                         
          The diamond blade shears off one of the Alien's claws.
                         
          The monster screams and recoils.
                         
          Its lashing tail sends Watts sprawling. She loses the saw.
                         
          The Alien comes after her, slinking low to the ground,
          injured arm tucked to its chest. All vengeful fury.
                         
          Watts scrambles for the saw. The Alien leaps for her. She
          rolls aside - and like a scorpion the Alien impales her thigh
          with its spear-tipped tail. Nails her to the ground.
                         
          Watts screams in agony. Reaches for the saw, still buzzing on
          the ground. Its grip tantalizing inches from her fingertips.
                         
          The Alien stoops over her, slavering face inches from her
          faceplate. Its hideous jaws open.
                         
          With all her strength, Watts pulls against the spike in her
          leg. Drags the point of the spear through the dirt.
          Excruciating pain. She snarls through her teeth.
                         
          The Alien strikes - just as Watts GRABS the saw.
                         
          She meets the Alien's head with the buzzing blade.
                         
          IMPALES THE ALIEN'S SKULL.
                         
          A gout of green acid onto Watts's helmet.
                         
          The Alien falls aside, thrashing its death-throes, the saw
          still growling.
                         
          Watts sees ACID COMING THROUGH HER HELMET - fast.
                         
          With frantic haste she unlatches her helmet. Wrenches it off
          as it crumples and melts.
                         
          She stands bare-headed in the toxic air. Desperate, she looks
          around with tearing eyes.
                         
          In the distance she sees an intact module of the Magellan.
                         
          She runs for it. Slaps the door switch. Incredibly, it opens.
           115.
                         
                         
          INT. VICKERS MODULE
                         
          Watts steps inside. The airlock closes behind her.
                         
          She finds herself staring at a grand piano. She's in
          Vickers's suite. Its amenities intact, through the floor's a
          few degrees off level. She takes a breath. Good air.
                         
          She walks around. Turning things on. Lights. Music. Surreal
          comforts. She drinks water from the tap.
                         
          She opens the door to Vickers's secret room. Military space
          suits. Rifles. Ammunition.
                         
          A crackle from the room's intercom.
                         
           DAVID (V.O.)

          INT. JUGGERNAUT - PILOT CHAMBER
                         
          DAVID's head lies battered in a dark corner of the wrecked
          Juggernaut. Eyes staring into the shadows.
                         
                          DAVID
           I know you're there. I can hear the
           beacon of your suit.
                         
                         
          INT. VICKERS MODULE
                         
          Watts strips off her space suit wearily. Sits on the bed.
                         
           DAVID (V.O.)
                          (FILTERED)
           I'd like to propose an arrangement. I
           can be repaired. I can talk you
           through it.
                         
          Watts shakes her head wearily.
                         
           DAVID (V.O.)
                          (FILTERED)
           I think you'll find I can be of use to
           you.
                         
          Watts walks to the intercom and switches it off.
           116.
                         
                         
          EXT. MAGELLAN CRASH SITE - DAY
                         
          The storm has passed. The fragments of the Magellan no longer
          burn. The gray world of LV-426 restored.
                         
          The wreck of the Juggernaut looms in the misty distance.
                         
          Watts walks through the wreckage in a military space suit.
          Rifle on her shoulder. Pistol on her hip.
                         
          She pulls a cargo dolly loaded with salvage.
                         
                         
          EXT. VICKERS MODULE - DAY
                         
          Watts arrives at the Vickers module. The ultramorph Alien's
          head has been fixed like a grisly trophy above the door.
                         
                         
          INT. VICKERS'S SUITE (SHIPWRECK) - DAY
                         
          Watts strips off her space suit. She helps herself to a glass
          of vodka from the bar.
                         
          A chessboard sits atop the grand piano: a game in progress.
                         
           DAVID (V.O.)
                          (FILTERED)
           I've decided. Rook takes Bishop.
                         
          Watts nods. Makes the move on the board. Says nothing.
                         
           DAVID (V.O.)
                          (FILTERED)
           Have you decided? On our arrangement?
                         
                          WATTS
           I'm not going to fix you, DAVID. I
           don't need you. I'll hold out. A ship
           will come.
                         
           DAVID (V.O.)
                          (FILTERED)
           I'm certain. But who will send it?
           Men? Or Engineers?
                         
          Watts falls silent. She stares unhappily at the chessboard.
                         
           DAVID (V.O.)
                          (FILTERED)
           Dr. Watts. It's your move.
           117.
                         
                         
          EXT. CENTRAL CRATER - NIGHT
                         
          The massive central pyramid rises in the midst of the
          Engineer complex.
                         
          With a BOOM, a bright beam of light shines forth from its
          peak, punching straight up through the clouds like a laser.
                         
                         
          VARIOUS PYRAMIDS - AROUND LV-426
                         
          Other beams of light erupt from other pyramids. Scorching the
          sky with their brightness.
                         
                         
          EXT. LV-426 ORBIT
                         
          The barren moon hangs in space, its father planet an angry
          red god in the background.
                         
          Two dozen beams of light rise from the moon, visible even
          from space. A beacon. A signal.
                         
          A beginning.
                         
                         
                         
           FADE OUT.
                         
           THE END.
