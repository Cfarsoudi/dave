     FACE IN ON

     THE SURFACE OF THE OCEAN

     sunny and placid then slowly WE BEGIN DESCENDING UNDERWATER

     Moving down from the bright surface waters, through layers
     of fish and marine life...

     A school of vibrantly colored fish move with the current,
     their numbers are enormous, their movements in unison.
     Suddenly out of the darkness a barracuda cuts through the
     school, taking out four or five before disappearing into the
     shadows.  The school moves on as if nothing happened,
     quickly closing ranks where the missing ones swam only
     seconds before.

     WE MOVE DEEPER AND DEEPER

     Fish disappear, darkness envelopes us.  Cold and lifeless
     where light has never penetrated...Five thousand feet, ten
     thousand.  Deeper, where only strange, self-illuminating
     echoniderms move eerily through the currents.  Then suddenly
     WE HEAR STATIC from RADIO TRANSMISSION.  THEN VOICES...

                                JONES
                   Burritos...Enchiladas...

                                DEJESUS
                                (hispanic voice)
                   Oh, gag, man, how can you eat that
                   stuff?...

                                BOWMAN
                                (female)
                   I can't wait for fresh vegetables...

     Several voices suddenly break into argument..."vegetables?"
     "shit," "burgers"...Suddenly another voice rises above the
     others.

                                BECK'S VOICE/ RADIO
                   Okay, cut the chatter.  You're
                   not out of here, yet.  Who's the
                   hook?  Seven?...You got a hook on
                   container 22?

     A pause, then more voices.

                                SIXPACK'S VOICE/ RADIO
                                (redneck drawl)
                   The man's asking if you're hooked
                   on 22, you dumb shit.

                                JONES' VOICE/ RADIO
                   Watch your mouth, Sixpack.  Hello,
                   Shack, Seven, here.  I ain't the hook,
                   over.

     A light flares out of the darkness, suddenly illuminating an
     IMMENSE SHAPE--fifteen hundred pounds of hardened metal
     nearly seven feet tall.  It is a motorized diving suit and
     we see the stenciled name, WILLIE across the front
     breastplate.  As it pivots we see the stationary worklights
     around the base of a large underwater mining operation, THE
     SHACK.  Then a woman's voice.

                                WILLIE'S VOICE
                                (woman's voice)
                   Six to Shack.  I'm the hook.

     INSIDE THE SHACK/ CONTROL ROOM

     littered with papers, half-full coffee cups, and a confusion
     of wires and very low-tech, high-tech equipment BECK sits at
     the monitor controls.  He is younger than we expected,
     twenties, clean cut good looks.  He'll be a hell of a good-
     looking man at thirty-five, he just needs to be hardened.
     From the looks of the coffee cups around him he's on his
     way.

                                BECK'S VOICE/ RADIO
                   Okay, Six, let's wrap this container
                   and call it a day.

     Above him a bank of monitor screens.  Each one labeled with
     a crew member's name and providing a video picture from a
     camera mounted on their helmet.  Beck reaches above him and
     throws a console switch which activates another monitor
     labeled ROV.  With a joystick he manipulates an outside
     camera(the ROV), its picture we see on the monitor.  It is
     moving.

     UNDERWATER

     WILLIE'S POV  The inside of her helmet is a grid of LED
     gauges monitoring air reserve, body temperature,
     atmospheres, heart rate, blood pressure.

     She stops next to a pair of railroad-like tracks and removes
     the tool attached to the end of her arm.  The move is
     practiced and professional, like a cook changing the tool on
     a set of egg beaters.  First, she inserts the existing tool
     into a lock on her opposite arm which holds it while she
     disengages the tool.  Next, she selects the next tool from
     the storage compartment at her waist and punches it into
     position.  Sixpack's voice comes over the radio.

                                SIXPACK'S VOICE
                   Hey, Willie, you trip on a
                   tit or something?  We're all
                   waiting on you, honey.

                                WILLIE
                                (under control)
                   Keep your pants on Sixpack.
                   I promise you'll be inside before
                   "Mr. Rogers' Neighborhood" comes on.

     OVER THE RADIO WE HEAR other men's voices laughing.  They
     like Willie and cheer her on.  "Tell him, Willie," "Atta
     girl," etc...

     Willie CLICKS in her last tool and turns.  Expertly she
     hooks a large dumpster-like container, the container to what
     looks like an underwater parachute--A CONTAINER
     TRANSPORTER--which when filled with oxygen it lifts the
     massive container onto the tracks where it can be hauled-in
     by a winch.

                                WILLIE'S VOICE
                   Six to Shack...Hook's on.  Ready
                   to winch.

     UNDERWATER MACHINERY

     Halogen lights illuminate bits and pieces of dredges and
     dumpsters squatting in the gloom.  A winch begins grinding
     and the big, newly hooked container lurches down the tracks.
     It comes to the end where a winch fits it into place with
     several others to complete a set.  We hear BECK'S VOICE.

                                BECK/ RADIO
                   Ok, that's it.  Come on in.

     More motor suited DIVERS appear, their helmet lights
     glaring.  Their breastplate names catch in the dim lights:
     COBS, BOWMAN, WILLIE.

     As they approach the UNDERWATER LOCK, where an elevator will
     transport them up into the Shack, we see signs of human
     life:  a basketball goal attached to the side of the
     building; stickers and signs:  "No Bozos," etc.  A formal sign
     towers over the entrance.  It says: TRANSOCEAN CORP. SHACK 6.

     ON ONE OF THE CREW

     He moves behind the others.  Suddenly he freezes in his
     tracks and slowly rotates his helmet--on his shoulder in the
     glare of his helmet beam WE SEE the a hideous looking SEA
     SPIDER.  It's thick legs moving eerily down his arm.

     Carefully, so as not to disturb the creature, a mechanical
     motor hand moves into position below it, and in one quick
     movement, snares it.

     CLOSE ON METAL WAIST POCKET.  The latch opens and the
     writhing sea spider is shoved inside.  From the pocket WE
     MOVE UP the diver's suit until we see the name SIXPACK on
     the breastplate.  He looks around to see if anyone has
     noticed then continues on toward the shack.

     ON TWO DIVERS(JONES AND DEJESUS)

     They walk together to the Shack.  A Latino VOICE, DEJESUS,
     comes over the radio singing an old Miller Beer jingle in an
     exaggerated accent.

                                DEJESUS
                   When it's time to relax....
                   One thing stands clear...

     INSIDE ON BECK

     As he listens to the singing over the tinny speaker, we see
     he aches to be a part of their comaraderie, but is alienated
     by age and rank.  He is the shack boss, management.  He
     listens as a BOOMING BLACK VOICE joins in off-key.

                                JONES' VOICE(O.C.)
                   Mil-ler's tastes too good to
                   hurry through...

     As the singing continues, Beck looks over at an empty chair
     in front of a bank of equipment monitors.  The vital signs
     of each miner and his equipment are registered on this
     console.  The chair in front of them sits conspicuously
     empty.  This doesn't please Beck, neither does a hand
     written sign under the console which states:  THE DOCTOR IS
     OUT.

     DEJESUS' POV

     Inside his helmet we see the grid of LED gauges monitoring
     vital signs.

                                DEJESUS
                   ...beer after beer...

     Suddenly a red warning light begins blinking in the bottom
     corner inside DeJesus' helmet.  The words to the song freeze
     in his mouth.  His voice becomes edged with panic.

                                DEJESUS(cont'd)
                   Oh, shit...

                                JONES/ RADIO
                                (to DeJesus)
                   Hey, Hazy, I'm not that bad, man.

                                DEJESUS
                                (rising terror)
                   Jonesy!  I'm losing compression...
                   I'm going to blow my suit, man!
                   Beck!  Doc!  Help me!...

     INSIDE

     Beck grabs his microphone.  He tries to remain calm but
     there is a definite tremble in his voice.

                                BECK
                   Give me a readout, DeJesus.

                                DEJESUS(ON RADIO)
                                (gripped with panic)
                   Ahhhh!

     OUTSIDE

     The other divers move quickly to DeJesus.

                                BECK (ON RADIO)
                   DeJesus!  A readout!

                                JONES
                   He don't need a readout,
                   man, he needs help!

                                BECK(RADIO)
                                (anything but calm)
                   Stay calm!

                                BOWMAN
                   Calm!?  Where's Doc?

     INSIDE

     Beck stands in front of the equipment monitors, lost.

                                BECK
                                (trying to
                                keep control)
                   The internal monitors read
                   normal.

     ON THE MINERS, PANICKED

                                COBB
                   Where's Doc?!

                                BECK(RADIO)
                   He's not at his station.

                                DEJESUS
                                (panicked)
                   Oh, mother of Jesus, forgive
                   me of my--

                                BECK'S VOICE
                                (making a decision)
                   Get him into the Shack.

     DeJesus' gauges begins a countdown to implosion.  "15, 14,
     13..."  DeJesus is grabbed by his co-workers and hurried the
     last few yards to the SHACK.

     INSIDE/SHACK - SAME

     ON BECK  sweating bullets, turns a dial on the instruments
     and suddenly, DeJesus' gauges jump to life.  We see the same
     countdown in progress on the Shack's gauges!..10, 9, 8...

     OUTSIDE

     ON DEJESUS  He is forced into the LOCK, the underwater
     elevator room is eerily lit.  His readout continues inside
     his helmet...5, 4, 3...DeJesus screams.

     ON BECK

     DeJesus' scream comes over his radio in the control room.
     Beck hits the elevator switch--nothing happens.  He hits it
     again harder and suddenly DeJesus voice is drowned out by
     the SCREAMING VACUUM PUMPS of the elevator.  It's moving!
     Beck looks up at the monitor of the interior Lift Lock.

     INSIDE/LIFT LOCK

     WE SEE DeJESUS'S SUIT dripping wet.  It stands inside the
     Lift Lock, ankle deep in greasy bilge water.

     CLOSE ON HIS EYES, for a moment they remain closed, then
     suddenly they flutter.  He's alive!

     THE MESS - LATER

     The blackboard prominently displayed on the wall of the Mess
     features neatly stenciled letters that say:  "DAYS TILL
     PICKUP".  The number scrawled on the chalk-smudged board
     obviously changes daily.  Right now, it's a "3"...

     A CLUNK, CLUNK and a Coke can rolls out of a compact COKE
     MACHINE.  A big, sandy-haired man, SIXPACK, takes the soft
     drink, pops the top and downs it in one long pull while he
     looks over an arguing group of deep sea miners:  JONES,
     Black, athletic, 30's;  COBB, 50's, a career miner with a
     mouthful of gum;  BOWMAN, 35, attractive, hardened woman, she
     has seen more of the world than any of them;  WILLIE,
     twenties, fresh good looks, master electrician, optimist.
     DEJESUS, Latino, wiry muscles, he keeps his head down, still
     shaken from his experience.

     The strain of a month of working two miles beneath the
     ocean's surface has drawn nerves tight.

                                BOWMAN
                   I'm telling you, it's the suits!

                                JONES
                   Fuck the suits, it's the people
                   monitoring them.  It Doc had been
                   there like he's supposed to it never
                   would've happened!

                                SIXPACK
                   And just what the fuck would he
                   have done to stop it, huh?

     Sixpack looks over the group, then suddenly crushes the
     empty Coke can in his hand, punctuating the action with a
     huge belch.

                                SIXPACK(cont'd)
                   That would have been you, DeJesus...

     DeJesus keeps his head down.

                                SIXPACK(cont'd)
                   Yeah...I was standing next to a guy
                   who blew a suit once in the
                   Indian Ocean...little tiny hole
                   in the fucking toe of his suit
                   ...ocean came in and the
                   pressure crammed his whole
                   fucking body up into his helmet.
                   They just buried his helmet.

                                DEJESUS
                                (coldly)
                   I know all about implosion, man.

                                SIXPACK
                   Yeah, I bet you do.
                                (laughs)
                   I bet you were imploding in
                   your pants.
                                (laughs then imitates
                                a hysterical DeJesus)
                   Jonesy!  Doc!...Help me!  Help me!

     DeJesus springs for Sixpack's throat AS WE CUT TO

     BECK - SAME

     Beck's eyes are blazing with cold authority as he speaks.

                                BECK
                   Knock it off, Sixpack!  I know
                   it's been a long month for every-
                   one, but we can't let something
                   like this tear us apart...

     Beck glares, ready for an argument, but as WE PULL BACK we
     see he's talking to the mirror, in his tiny quarters.

     Apparently he fails to convince himself because his hard
     look fades and he mutters unhappily as he turns away.

                                BECK
                   Shit...

     He turns around to face a smiling picture of himself at
     college graduation with his Eastern establishment looking
     father.  Leadership "how-to" books like The One Minute
     Manager, etc. line his bookshelf with technical manuals on
     underwater mining.

     He opens his door to leave when SUDDENLY A LOUD METALLIC
     GROANING NOISE stops him cold.  The entire Shack seems
     shifting, like a giant waking from a nap.

     MESS

     The NOISE stops the fight between DeJesus and Sixpack cold.
     All eyes go to the ceiling and walls.

                                JONES
                   Fuck the suits man...this
                   place is going to kill us first.

     Just as suddenly as it began the GROANING NOISE STOPS and in
     its place WE HEAR an intermittent RATTLE in the air system.
     Only Cobb seems undisturbed by this sound.

                                DEJESUS
                                (listening)
                   There it is again...
                                (sitting down again)
                   Two more days.  I tell myself
                   'you can make it two more days--'

                                BOWMAN
                   What's the weather like up top?

                                WILLIE
                   Clear for pickup.

                                JONES
                   Let's hope it holds.

     Cobb looks up disgustingly.

                                COBB
                   Then what?  Huh?
                                (to everyone)
                   Then what?  You folks think
                   going up top's the answer to
                   all your problems.  Well, it ain't.

                                BOWMAN
                   Give us a break, Cobb...

                                COBB
                   A break?  You folks don't need a break,
                   you need psychiatrists.  'Know what
                   you'd be doing if you were up there,
                   right now?

                                SIXPACK
                                (a boorish leer)
                   Eating pussy and drinking brew...

                                COBB
                   Eating pussy my ass.  What about
                   lines at the bank:  What about
                   getting stuck in traffic?

                                SIXPACK
                                (grinning)
                   Wherever I can find it.

     Everyone laughs but Cobb, WE SEE he's serious.

                                COBB
                   Bullshit!  I'll tell you
                   what you'd be doing!  You'd
                   be watching news on TV
                   that's so fucking bad it
                   makes you nauseous.  So you
                   go out and get in your car
                   to get some fresh air and
                   after you've been driving for
                   five minutes you realize the
                   air's so damn dirty you don't dare
                   breath it!  That's what you've
                   got to look forward to...

     LOWER RING CORRIDOR

     Beck approaches the Mess and as he nears it we hear Cobb
     ranting inside.

                                COBB'S VOICE(O.S.)
                   ...And if you're lucky
                   enough to make it back home
                   to your house that looks the
                   fucking same as everyone else's,
                   you'll find your wife's just as
                   fat as she was when you left and
                   the only reason your kids ain't
                   strung out on the drugs they were
                   using when you left is that
                   they've found some new drugs
                   which fuck 'em up even more!...
                   You people just don't appreciate
                   how good you've got down here...

     BECK hesitates at the door to the Mess, as though screwing
     up his courage, then takes a deep breath and enters as we

                                                        CUT TO

     INSIDE THE MESS

     Everyone looks up as Beck enters and the room goes quiet.
     Beck notices Doc's empty chair.

                                BECK
                   Doc eat already?

                                JONES
                   The good doctor hasn't showed yet.

     Looks are exchanged.  Sixpack smirks knowingly.

                                BECK
                                (to DeJesus)
                   How do you feel, DeJesus?

                                DEJESUS
                                (obviously embarrassed
                                to be singled out)
                   Okay.

                                BECK
                   Better let the Doc take a
                   look at you, after dinner.

                                SIXPACK
                   Yeah, since he was busy earlier
                   when you needed him.

     He cracks up and Beck turns on him.

                                BECK
                   Cut it, Sixpack.

     Sixpack shuts up, but Beck notices the others feel the
     seriousness of Doc's absence during the emergency.

                                BECK(cont'd)
                   Leave the Doc to me.  I'm
                   going to talk to him.

                                SIXPACK
                                (sarcastically, under his
                                breath to Bowman)
                   'Makes me feel better already...

     Beck gets his tray but it is clear he is thinking about
     something else.  He clears his throat.

                                 BECK
                   I've been looking at the duty
                   roster...at the shack hours
                   outstanding...

                                 JONES
                   Uh, oh...I see where this
                   is going...

                                 BECK
                                 (ignoring Jones)
                   ...all of you owe time and I
                   thought tonight would be a good
                   time to---

                                 COBB
                                 (erupting)
                   No way, Mister Beck!  No
                   fucking way!  We just did a
                   full shift, you can't call
                   Shack duty on top of a full
                   shift.  It's a contract violation!

                                 JONES
                   Whooo!  Right on, Cobb!  Let's
                   hear it for our shop Steward!

                                 SIXPACK
                   Hear that Becky, er, Mr. Beck?
                   Company got to abide by the rules.

     FIVE FACES STARE AT BECK.  THEY'RE LOOKING FOR WEAKNESS.
     THIS IS A CHALLENGE TO HIS AUTHORITY.

                                BECK
                   I know all about the contract.
                   The point is you can follow the
                   goddamn contract to the letter and pull
                   your shack duty tomorrow...or you
                   can get it done tonight and call
                   tomorrow a down day.  It's up to you.

     This leaves the group momentarily speechless.  Even DeJesus
     comes out of his stupor.

                                DEJESUS
                   You giving us a day off?

     Beck nods.  Cobb eyes him suspiciously.

                                COBB
                   What about our quota?

                                BECK
                   You're only twenty-five
                   tons off quota.  Barring an
                   unforeseen problem you should
                   reach it easily on the last day.
                                (he looks at the group)
                   It's just a day off.  You don't
                   have to take it, I just thought it
                   might help.

     The others look around for agreement but Jones doesn't need
     anyone else's approval, he's already made up his mind.

                                JONES
                   Count me in.

     Bowman nods her head also and the others unanimously agree.
     Buoyed, Beck moves ahead, businesslike...

                                BECK
                   Cobb, Jones, I want you to do
                   something about that damn rattle
                   in the air system...
                                (to Bowman and Sixpack)
                   Bowman and Sixpack...living quarters...

                                SIXPACK
                                (disgustedly)
                   Shit...

                                BECK
                   Williams...get DeJesus' suit on
                   the "sick rack" and do a diagnostics.
                                (to group)
                   Any other suit problems she should
                   know about?

     Sixpack suddenly looks up as the group disperses.

                                SIXPACK
                                (to Willie)
                   My pocket.  Check my pocket,
                   will ya, honey?

                                WILLIE
                                (annoyed)
                   Your pocket?

                                SIXPACK
                   The latch is screwed up.  Or
                   the hinge.

                                WILLIE
                                (disgusted)
                   Right.

     LOWER RING CORRIDOR - SAME

     ON BECK  He starts out of the Mess and by chance finds
     himself walking with Willie.  Beck is obviously
     uncomfortable with the crew, even after 28 days together.
     She smiles, friendly, at ease.

                                WILLIE
                   You did good...

                                BECK
                                (a little surprised)
                   What?

                                WILLIE
                   Today...with DeJesus.  That
                   was smart thinking to get him
                   inside...

                                BECK
                   There probably wasn't anything
                   wrong with his suit...

                                WILLIE
                   Still...you did the right thing.

     She turns off toward the Swamp, leaving Beck with the tiny,
     but honest compliment.  He savors it.

     THE SWAMP - LATER

     The "Swamp" (where DeJesus came up), is ankle deep in greasy
     bilgewater.  The door slides open, Willie enters, and
     switches on a bank of fluorescent lights.  The room is
     spooky even with the lights.  The giant machine suits, we
     saw earlier outside, hang from racks like sleeping monsters.

     Willie straps on a utility belt and checks her tools--a
     motorized screwdriver, a power wrench, a long-necked,
     laser-tipped soldering iron(looks like a long-necked
     screwdriver)--then splashes through the bilge water to the
     control switch and hits the START button.

     NNNNNNNNNN.  A motor moves one of the suits along the track
     toward Willie.  As it turns the corner toward us we see it
     says:  DEJESUS.

     DOC'S OFFICE - SAME

     Beck opens the door to Doc's quarters and we see Doc putting
     on a fresh shirt.  A man in his 50's, he must have once been
     quite handsome and intelligent, but has now gone to seed.

                                DOC
                   I must have dozed off.

     Beck looks on the cabinet and sees a bottle of Old Granddad
     Whiskey.  He picks it up.

                                DOC(cont'd)
                   Snakebite medicine...Never
                   pack my bag without it.

     Beck doesn't smile.  He puts the bottle back down and Doc
     watches him in the mirror.

                                BECK
                   Are you planning on working tomorrow?

                                DOC
                   Well, I'll be on the golf course
                   in the morning.  Then, if I don't
                   have any babies to deliver--

                                BECK
                                (cutting him off)
                   We almost had an accident today.
                   DeJesus' suit...

     The Doc stops buttoning his shirt and locks eyes with Beck.

                                DOC
                   You got something to say to me, son?...

     Beck definitely has something to say, but confronted, he
     falters.

                                BECK
                   I...I think it's important to
                   have the second officer on deck.

     Doc smiles, and goes back to buttoning his shirt.

                                DOC
                   I'll keep it to nine holes
                   in the morning.

     THE DORMITORY - SAME

     Small but functional.  The bunks can be closed-off with a
     privacy door.  Photographs and bumper stickers on the walls
     of the bunks provide the only personal touches in an
     otherwise sterile environment.

     Willie's bunk is wallpapered in detailed interplanetary
     maps;  Sixpack's privacy door has a bumper sticker which
     proclaims:  "I MAY BE FAT, BUT YOU'RE UGLY AND I CAN DIET."
     DeJesus' has posters of the Alps, and the Rockies;  Bowman's
     has clipped pages from "Gourmet" of meals she dreams for;
     Cobb's has nothing, as if perfectly content to be where he
     is instead of somewhere else.  Inside Jones' bunk is an
     indoor basketball goal.

     Bowman and Sixpack scrub down the walls of the dorm with a
     sponge and pail.  Sixpack pauses and smirks, his eyes on
     Bowman's chest.

                                SIXPACK
                   Christ...what a pair...

                                BOWMAN
                                (sharply)
                   What was that?  What'd you say?

                                SIXPACK
                   I said, "What a pair" the
                   boy wonder Shack Boss and his
                   drunken doctor buddy make...
                                (innocently)
                   Why?  What did ya think I said?

     CORRIDOR "A" - SAME

     Jones and Cobb are kneeling in a corridor, unfastening a big
     plate on the floor with a power wrench.  Overhead a huge
     plexiglass conduit flows with water from the desalinization
     system.  The interior wall of the corridor is meshed wire
     exposing the throbbing machine floor of the Shack.

     Cobb removes the last bolt and Jones lifts off the
     floorplate exposing the guts of the shack--the BILGE--dark
     and wet.  Without the plate the RATTLE in the air system is
     much louder and sinister.

                                JONES
                   Listen to it for Christsake.

                                COBB
                   Ah, it's just old, like me.
                   You don't see the Doc opening
                   me up every time I get a new creak
                   in my joints...I say, as long as
                   it's recycling the air let
                   the next shift deal with it.
                   But, 'long as we're here...

     He pulls a retractable ladder from inside the hole and drops
     it down into the wet darkness, without hesitating he climbs
     down, stopping at the bottom to look up at Jones.  Jones
     seems in no hurry to accompany him.

                                COBB(cont'd)
                   You gonna sit there on your
                   butt or give me a hand?

     Jones reluctantly starts down after him.

     BECK'S QUARTERS - SAME

     Beck in his quarters.  He seems to be talking to himself but
     as we move around him we see he is talking to a video
     monitor.  On screen we see MARTIN, 30's, a slick
     bureaucratic executive with TransOcean Corp. whose face is
     all we see on the video monitor.

                                BECK
                   Two hundred and fifty-two
                   tons of Magnesium and 15 tons
                   of Sodium.

                                MARTIN
                                (taking notes)
                   Sounds like a good week, Beck.
                   In fact...I put your folder
                   in front of the Vice President
                   of District Operations last night...

     Beck stops.  Martin notices his concern.

                                MARTIN(cont'd)
                   You're good executive timber,
                   Beck.  A lot of management trainees
                   wash out when they have to go under
                   for their first tour.  But you've done well.

                                BECK
                                (smiles, relieved)
                   Thank you, Martin.

                                MARTIN
                   Don't thank me, yet, but it is
                   important to know where you're
                   going and who your friends are...
                   'Know what I mean?

     He stares hard at Beck, but doesn't wait for an answer.

                                MARTIN(cont'd)
                   The one thing I've learned in
                   this company is you can't have
                   enough friends.  It's the only
                   way to survive.

     CLOSE ON A BOOM BOX/ LOWER RING CORRIDOR - SAME

     The boom box sitting on a wall pipe is blaring John Denver's
     Rocky Mountain High.

     DeJesus is singing along loudly in his thick accent as he
     works on the intercom system.  He finishes, closing a metal
     box which says:  ONBOARD COMMUNICATIONS.

     SWAMP - SAME

     ON WILLIE  She has connected DeJesus' suit to the diagnostic
     computer and is going through the computerized
     checkpoints--an electronic list of literally hundreds of
     possible problems.

                                WILLIE
                                (to herself)
                   Probably a short.

     Suddenly, the computer pauses on one:  It says:  Electrical
     Short.

                                WILLIE(cont'd)
                   Good guess, Williams.

     She types in a "help" command and the computer screen
     displays an electrical circuit pattern that would leave most
     Electrical Engineers baffled.  Willie hardly bats an eye.

                                WILLIE(cont'd)
                   Piece of cake.

     She immediately opens the circuit panel on DeJesus' suit and
     pulls the laser soldering iron out of her tool belt.  With
     two quick spot welds she repairs the short, then replaces
     the panel.  Finished, Willie presses the control switch and
     the suits begin to move along the track.  A new suit rounds
     the corner toward us.  It says SIXPACK.

     THE BILGE - SAME

     The walls are dark and moist.  Water drips from the pipes.
     The rattle in the air system continues loudly as Jones leans
     over and hands Cobb another tool.  Crouched in the humming
     machinery, Cobb spits his wad of chewing gum into a greasy
     hand, kneads it a couple of times, then grins at Jones.

                                COBB
                   Okay, watch this..

     THE SWAMP - SAME

     The monotonous clatter of the air system is the only sound
     in the gloomy SWAMP as the huge suit labeled SIXPACK stops
     directly in front of Willie.  She reaches up to open the
     pocket latch when she stops...listening.  THE NOISE IN THE
     AIR SYSTEM HAS STOPPED.

     THE BILGE - SAME

     Jones looks incredulously at Cobb.  He can't believe that's
     all it took.  Cobb starts gathering up the tools.

                                JONES
                   So that's all you do?...

                                COBB
                   Shhhh...don't tell no one.
                                (winks)
                   Job security.

     THE SWAMP - SAME

     In the gloomy silence, Willie reaches for the hinged pocket
     in the waist of Sixpack's suit.  Some water drips out.  She
     pushes the spring a second time.  The pocket opens.
     Nothing.

                                WILLIE
                                (miffed)
                   Nothing wrong with this...

     SUDDENLY THE HIDEOUS SEA SPIDER SPRINGS OUT onto the
     workbench where it wriggles grotesquely toward Willie.  She
     backs away and it drops into the water at her feet.

     THE DORMITORY

     Bowman looks at DeJesus who comes to the door, then to
     Sixpack who convulses with laughter against the bulkhead.

                                WILLIE'S VOICE(O.C.)
                                (over intercom)
                   Fuck you, Sixpack!  You think
                   you're funny?  You're not funny!

     ON BECK

     He hesitates then presses the TALK button on the intercom.

                                BECK
                   This is Beck.  Is there a
                   problem, Williams?

     SWAMP

     Willie watches the Sea Spider move in the water toward her
     as Beck's words come over the P.A.  Ignoring Beck she
     watches the spider right as it moves to her feet then brings
     the soldering iron down into the water with a LOUD HISS
     skewering it.  She presses the intercom button and lifts the
     skewered sea spider out of the water.

                                WILLIE
                                (to Beck)
                   A little problem, sir...but I've
                   got a handle on it now.

                                           TIME CUT TO:

     THE MESS - LATER

     BOWMAN sits at a portable computer terminal and watches
     stock prices scroll across the screen.  Every so often she
     freezes a stock and types the command:  INFO.  The screen
     immediately changes to a financial report of the company in
     question as if prepared by a broker.  In a matter of seconds
     Bowman can learn all the major aspects of the company.

     Across the room from her, Willie exercises with dumbbells
     while she studies an astronaut training manual.  She looks up
     at Bowman.

                                WILLIE
                   Made your million, yet?

                                BOWMAN
                                (studying the screen)
                   Not yet.

                                WILLIE
                   How's TransOcean doing?

     This causes Bowman to turn and look at Willie.

                                BOWMAN
                   You got money in this tub?

                                WILLIE
                   I signed-up for the stock option.

     Bowman shakes her head and goes back to the computer and
     types in TransOcean Corp.

     DORMITORY

     ON COBB  He lies on his bunk under a sunlamp, but wears a
     T-shirt and long pants.  DeJesus does a jigsaw puzzle of a
     snow covered Swiss mountain scene.

                                DEJESUS
                   Hey, man, you know that in
                   Switzerland--and this country's
                   the size of East L.A., okay?--they
                   speak 54 different dialects?
                   Fifty-four!

                                COBB
                   Who cares?

                                DEJESUS
                   I do, man.  That's a beautiful
                   place.  When I get out of here
                   I'm going there.  Find a nice
                   little snow covered chalet, warm
                   little woman, crackling fire--

     He looks up and sees Cobb's sunbathing attire and laughs.

                                DEJESUS
                   Hey, Cobb...Man, why don't you
                   take off your shirt and pants,
                   man?  You should do that wearing
                   what you're going to wear at the
                   beach.

                                COBB
                                (sharply)
                   This is what I wear at the
                   beach, goddamnit.

     MESS - SAME

     COMPUTER SCREEN  The report appears on screen with a
     capsulized history of the TransOcean company, its philosophy
     and growth plans and most current financial report.  A final
     column called "insider tips" says:

                                BOWMAN
                                (reading)
                   "Major development in
                   South Indian Ocean set for
                   fall of 2010..."
                                (to Willie)
                   That sounds interesting, but they're
                   too tied to their holdings.  Remember
                   a year ago when they lost that tanker?...
                   The bottom fell out of their stock and
                   I lost a bloody fortune.  That's
                   when I decided to diversify.

     Willie looks at Bowman a moment, then keeps exercising.

                                WILLIE
                   You take your money, too
                   seriously, Bo.

                                BOWMAN
                                (sharply)
                   You're damn right I do.  Five
                   years down here and I'll pull
                   in more than 15 topside.  I'm not
                   down here for the fun, I'll tell
                   you that.

                                SIXPACK'S VOICE(O.S.)
                   "Fun?"  Somebody talking fun?

     They look up to see Sixpack at the door to the Mess wearing
     only a robe.  With a leer he stares at Willie exercising.

                                SIXPACK(cont'd)
                                (saccharine sweet)
                   Hey, Willie, honey...Sorry about that
                   little incident tonight...Everyone's
                   been so tight lately, I thought
                   a little humor'd loosen us all up,
                   you know?

     Willie doesn't bite, she looks hard at Sixpack.

                                WILLIE
                   Get out of here, Sixpack.

     Sixpack smirks.  He waves a copy of Penthouse opened to the
     Pet of the Month and sings cheerfully.

                                SIXPACK
                                (leaving)
                   I got a date with an angel...

     CLANK, BANK, CLUNK.  A coke can tumbles noisily from the
     Coke machine.  Jones retrieves two cans of Coke and comes
     out of the Galley with a snack.  He stops in front of
     Bowman and the computer.

                                JONES
                   Hey, Bo...when're you going to
                   be off that thing?  I want to
                   find out tonight's NBA scores
                   and check the weather.

                                BOWMAN
                                (not taking her eyes off
                                 the screen, answers him)
                   The weather's good, I already
                   checked, but I'll be off in a minute.

                                WILLIE
                                (to Jones)
                   Hey, Jonesy, who's the best power
                   forward in the NBA...Jameson?

                                JONES
                   Jameson?  Who're you trying to
                   con?

     They grin at each other--a standing joke and Jones leaves.

     DORMITORY

     Jones enters the Dorm with his snack and tosses a can of
     Coke across the room to DeJesus.

                                JONES
                   Hey, Hazy!  We got a day off
                   tomorrow, Kemosabi!  Let's get
                   shit-faced!

     DEJESUS catches the can and pops the top sending a shower of
     carbonation all over Cobb under the sunlamp.

                                JONES(cont'd)
                   How about you, brother Cobb?
                   Little Wild Turkey?

     Cobb wipes the Coke from his sunglasses and shakes his head.

                                DEJESUS
                   No, man, Cobb is a Chivas drinker,
                   from way back.  Ain't that right
                   Cobbie?

     Jones and DeJesus laugh and take long pulls on their Cokes.
     Cobb turns and watches them.  This is obviously a nightly
     ritual.

                                COBB
                   You guys are crazy.  What
                   the hell you play that stupid
                   game for?

                                DEJESUS
                                (acting drunk)
                   What game, Cobb?...I'm on
                   my way to Nirvana...

                                COBB
                   You're on your way somewhere
                   all right...the looney bin.

                                DEJESUS
                                (laughing)
                   I'm on the way to the looney
                   bin?  Hey, man, I'm not the dude
                   sun bathing in his clothes.

     INT. SIXPACK'S BUNK - SAME

     CLOSE ON  The Pet of the Month as she smirks coyly from the
     centerfold, her body twisted into an awkward position
     representing mad desire.

     Sixpack closes his privacy door then smirks back at the
     photo.

                                SIXPACK
                   Oh, Darlin'...come sit on
                   my face...

     He stirs in the bed and adjusts his pillow and SCREAMS!  The
     SEA SPIDER is suddenly right there on his shoulder, dead.

     Sixpack sits bolt upright in his bunk and slams his head
     against the roof of the bunk, then stumbles out screaming.
     He hits the floor and rams his foot into a table and screams
     in more pain.

     The whole dorm looks up amazed, Cobb takes off his
     sunglasses, even Jones and DeJesus temporarily "sober up" to
     stare.

                                SIXPACK
                   That bitch!

     MESS

     Sixpack storms into the Mess with the dead Sea Spider.  He
     points angrily at his bleeding foot.  Jones and DeJesus move
     up to watch.

                                SIXPACK
                                (moving into room)
                   Bitch!  Look what you did!

                                WILLIE
                                (imitating Sixpack)
                   Sorry, darling...Just thought a
                   little humor would loosen us all
                   up...you know?...

     Everyone laughs, but Sixpack.  He has revenge in his eyes.
     He holds out the ugly, limp creature and advances toward
     Willie.

                                SIXPACK
                   You think you're so funny?
                   Wait till you taste this!

     As he pushes the dead creature into her face BECK'S VOICE
     behind him makes him freeze.

                                BECK'S VOICE(O.S.)
                   That's enough!

     Everybody turns to see Beck standing in the doorway.

                                SIXPACK
                   Look at my foot, sir!  This
                   bitch put a goddamn sea
                   monster in my bunk!

                                BECK
                                (cold as ice)
                   How do you know it was Williams?

                                SIXPACK
                                (trapped)
                   Huh?  I...uh...uh...

                                BECK
                   All right, Sixpack, you and
                   Williams are gonna pull water
                   duty tomorrow--

                                SIXPACK AND WILLIE
                                (protesting)
                   Bullshit!  What?!  She...He...

                                BECK
                                (cutting them off)
                   At ease!  You both have a half
                   day...Anymore shit and its a full
                   one.

     CLOSE ON BLACKBOARD/ MESS - MORNING

     SCREECH!  Chalk on the blackboard as Bowman writes "2" in
     place of yesterday's "3" over the neatly lettered words
     "Days Till Pickup."

     Jones, sitting next to Cobb, looks up from his tray of
     cereal and holds his head in mock misery.

                                JONES
                   Oooooh.  Damn!  Not so loud.
                   Turn down the music.

                                COBB
                   What music?  There ain't no
                   music.

     DeJesus enters holding his head and sits on the other side
     of Cobb.

                                DEJESUS
                   Oooooh.

     Cobb looks from one man to the other, realizing what they're
     doing.

                                COBB
                   You know it's really crazy to
                   pretend to be drunk, but it's
                   fucking insane to pretend
                   to have a hangover.

                                BOWMAN
                                (to Jones and DeJesus)
                   Your "hangovers" made you miss
                   the Sixpack Good Morning Show.
                                (imitating Sixpack)
                   "No goddamn boy is going to make
                   me go out on a down day."

                                JONES
                                (grinning)
                   Yeah?  How'd the kid hold up?

                                COBB
                                (pleased)
                   Pretty good.  He sent them
                   out videotaping outcrop.

     UNDERWATER - SAME

     CLOSE ON  A whirling cylinder tool we see is attached to the
     end of Willie's mechanical suit arm.  Like a drill its
     diamond bits cut into the rock outcrop to take a core
     sample.  It's a sinister hand-attachment, something Captain
     Hook would have loved.

     Above her the ROV maneuvers into position for a better view.

     INSIDE THE SHACK CONTROL - SAME

     Beck is in the control station, staring at the video
     monitors--the image from the ROV.  Willie removes a slender
     instrument, like a bicycle pump and with a quick pump
     motion, CHUNK, CHUNK...activates an explosive charge.  She
     puts it into the hole she made with the drill and backs off.

                                BECK
                   Charge set?

                                WILLIE'S VOICE(RADIO)
                   Charge set.  Backing off.
                                (to the ROV)
                   C'mon Rover let's get out
                   of here.

     Like a good dog, the ROV follows her to a safe position.

     ON MONITOR  THE CAMERA HOLDS ON THE SPOT.  SUDDENLY THE
     GROUND SHAKES VIOLENTLY ON THE MONITOR SCREEN--A MINI
     EARTHQUAKE CHARGE.

     WILLIE RETURNS TO THE SITE OF THE CHARGE AND REINSERTS HER
     DRILL, EASILY REMOVING A TEST SAMPLE.

     Willie holds out the sample to the ROV so Beck can see
     inside.

     INT. CONTROL ROOM/ CLOSE ON BECK'S ROV MONITOR

     He stares at the image on the screen.

                                BECK
                   I need more light on that, Four.

     OUTSIDE

                                WILLIE
                                (to Beck)
                   Roger...
                                (to Sixpack)
                   More light, Sixpack...

     There is no answer.  Willie turns around.  Her helmet lamp
     eerily illuminating the darkness around her.  Sixpack is
     nowhere to be seen.

                                WILLIE(cont'd)
                   Sixpack?

     She turns in the other direction and suddenly blinding
     lights are turned on.

                                SIXPACK
                   Boo!

     Sixpack laughs.  His lights now on, he stands right behind
     her.

                                WILLIE
                   You shit....

                                BECK'S VOICE
                   What's going on, Four?  What's
                   happening?

                                WILLIE
                   We're fine, Shack.  His lights
                   malfunctioned for a minute.  How's
                   this?

     She again holds out her hand to the ROV.

     INSIDE SHACK

     Beck looks at the monitor and presses a red button to start
     the tape, then after five seconds releases the button.

                                BECK
                   That's great.  Now let's move
                   35 degrees southwest.

     WILLIE AND SIXPACK MOVING

                                WILLIE
                                (to Sixpack)
                   You screw around like that again and--

                                SIXPACK
                   What's wrong, did you miss me?

                                WILLIE
                   Hardly.

                                SIXPACK
                   Don't worry, darlin, I'm...

     Suddenly Sixpack's foot hits some loose rock and slides.

     Willie turns in his direction and sees his headlight
     turning, becoming smaller, then disappearing as his radio
     goes dead.

     INSIDE ON BECK

                                BECK
                   What's wrong?!  What happened?

     UNDERWATER

     ON WILLIE  She has stopped in her tracks.  All around her is
     blackness.  Her helmet light hardly penetrates the darkness.

                                WILLIE
                   Sixpack?!  Sixpack...

     Then she looks down--a cliff right in front of her feet.
     The drop is thirty feet into a waving sea of tubers.

     BECK'S VOICE brings Willie back.

                                BECK'S VOICE(RADIO)
                   Willie?  What's going on?

                                WILLIE
                   He's gone.  I think he's
                   fallen.  I'm going down after him.

     MESS

     Jones is bench pressing 200 pounds on a fold-down compact
     gym, while DeJesus huffs and puffs on an exercise bike.

                                DEJESUS
                   That's it Jonesy...Sweat it
                   out, man...Got to get the poison
                   out of our blood.

     Jones grits his teeth and struggles against the weight,
     suddenly Bowman throws open the door and sticks her head in.

                                BOWMAN
                   Sixpack is lost.

     CORRIDOR - MOMENTS LATER

     Bowman, Jones and DeJesus are heading for the control room
     where they are joined by Cobb.

                                COBB
                   Weren't they tied?  They're
                   supposed to be tied.

     They all enter the

     CONTROL ROOM

     Beck is at the console with Doc in his chair.

                                JONES
                   How far away is she?

                                DOC
                   Two hundred meters.

     WILLIE'S VOICE silences them.

                                WILLIE'S VOICE(RADIO)
                   Four to Shack...nearing the
                   bottom.  Look at this...

     They all stare at the monitor.  The screen is filled with
     huge waving tubers.

                                DOC
                   My God, look at the size of
                   those tubers....

                                DEJESUS
                   Nine, ten feet high...

                                BOWMAN
                   If he had his blinkers on--

                                JONES
                   It wouldn't make any difference in
                   there...He could be two feet away and
                   on fire and she'd still not see him!

     UNDERWATER

     ON WILLIE  She moves through the dense waving forest of
     giant tubers, parting them with her hands as she moves
     slowly.

                                WILLIE
                   Sixpack?

     CONTROL ROOM

                                BECK
                   Why can't we pick up his signal?

                                DEJESUS
                                (a joke)
                   Maybe he got eaten?

                                BOWMAN
                                (dryly)
                   What would be dumb enough to
                   eat Sixpack?

     ON WILLIE

     She moves aside the last of the tubers and freezes at the
     sight in front of her.

                                WILLIE'S VOICE(RADIO)
                   Four to Shack...you picking
                   this up?

     INSIDE

     All eyes suddenly go to the monitor.  A huge dark maw fills
     the screen.

                                BECK
                   Affirmative...Widening picture.

     The image on the screen widens and we see the opening is a
     huge gash in the side of a sunken ship.

                                BECK(cont'd)
                                (to DOC)
                   Tighten the picture on the
                   upper righthand corner.

     CLOSE ON THE MONITOR:  The picture zooms in on the corner
     and Willie's added light suddenly brings the letter "M" into
     focus.

     Beck presses the red record button and pans the ROV slowly
     across the bulkhead of the ship.  The next letter is an "A".
     Then suddenly a Cyrillic letter appears, then others.

                                COBB
                   What the?...

                                DOC
                   Russian.

                                WILLIE'S VOICE(RADIO)
                   I'm going inside.

                                BECK
                   What's your air reading?

                                WILLIE'S VOICE
                   Twenty minutes...

                                BECK
                   Twenty minutes!...Who had
                   tank duty?

                                BOWMAN
                   Who else...Sixpack.

                                JONES
                   The man is unbelievable...
                   I say, leave him in there.

                                BOWMAN
                                (dryly)
                   What about his suit?  That's
                   a million five the company's
                   got to replace.  They'll make
                   somebody go get it.

                                BECK
                                (to Willie)
                   Willie, we're giving you five
                   minutes...after that we're coming in.

     WILLIE'S POV

     Her life-support gauges move eerily around the perimeter of
     her mask.  She moves along steadily down darkened corridors.
     She opens a door and it drops from its corroded hinges--a
     cloud of sludge rises off the bottom.  The room looks empty.

                                WILLIE
                   Sixpack?...Answer me.

     She throws open another door.  It also looks empty, then
     WHAM! a grotesque ECHONODERM slams into her helmet.  Willie
     bats it aside and as soon as she recovers shines her light
     into the room.

     WHAT SHE SEES:  The ship's infirmary.  Broken glass,
     stainless steel...the light does strange things, reflecting,
     sparkling...

                                WILLIE(ON RADIO)
                   The infirmary...

                                BECK'S VOICE(RADIO)
                   Three minutes...

     Her helmet-mounted camera pans the room one more time, then
     as she turns to leave it captures a strange gleam of white
     in the corner--A LARGE HUMAN-LIKE SKELETON.  Willie doesn't
     see it.

     INT. THE CONTROL ROOM

     CLOSE ON DOC  He stares at the monitor screen.  Did he see
     something or were his eyes playing tricks?  He looks across
     the console and sees the videotape is recording.

     UNDERWATER

     ON WILLIE  She moves to the end of the hall.  It ends with
     two doors.

                                BECK'S VOICE(RADIO)
                   One minute.

     Willie hesitates at the junction and PUSHES OPEN the door on
     her left, SOMETHING HUGE BEHIND IT MOVES--IT'S SIXPACK.  His
     mechanical arms suddenly rise and in their grasp we see the
     ship's huge safe.

                                SIXPACK
                                (laughing)
                   I'm rich, honey.  Rich!

     THE SWAMP - LATER

     The door to the Russian ship's safe stands open.  BANG!
     BANG!  Jones and DeJesus hammer safety deposit boxes with a
     chisel.  While the others watch, Sixpack pleads his case
     with Beck.

                                SIXPACK
                   It's all mine if I'm on report.
                   Otherwise you gotta take me off
                   report before you look at any more...
                   Ain't that right, Cobbie?

                                COBB
                   You're on your own, Sixpack, you
                   fucked up everybody's day off...

     DeJesus pries off the top from the first safety deposit box
     and dumps the contents on the workbench...several wallets,
     wristwatches, a pocket watch, a wedding ring...Bowman who
     stands with a clipboard begins taking inventory.

                                BOWMAN
                   Personal effects...

                                WILLIE
                                (considering
                                a watch)
                   Timex...

     She picks up something else, a pack of soggy chewing gum and
     tosses it to Cobb.

                                WILLIE(cont'd)
                   Here's something for you, Cobbie.

                                JONES
                                (checking a wallet)
                   Russian money...Don't look like much.

     Jones opens the next box and dumps it out onto the
     table...Life Savers candy, a postcard of a fat Russian woman
     in a bathing suit.  Bowman looks at it.

                                BOWMAN
                                (grinning to
                                Sixpack)
                   Yeah, I'd say you can retire
                   with all this loot.

                                SIXPACK
                   Shut up.

     Everyone chuckles.  More papers and a small, book-shaped
     object wrapped in plastic.  Jones unwraps it.  It's a video
     tape.  He looks at the label.

                                WILLIE
                   What is it?

                                JONES
                                (reading)
                   "Debbie Does Dallas"...
                                (looks up and
                                grins)
                   Hell, it's in Russian.  I can't
                   read it...

                                DOC
                   May I see it?

     Jones hands it to Doc who looks at it.

                                DOC (cont'd)
                   It's a log of some sort.

     Jones pries the lid off another box and dumps it
     out--Papers, more cheap watches.

     ON SIXPACK  He notices something silver, the size of a
     paperback book, under a stack of papers.  Discreetly he
     covers the object with a piece of paper and slides it off
     the table out of sight.

     Jones opens the last box, and something rolls across the
     table toward the edge and starts to drop when it is caught
     by DeJesus.  He holds it up and we see--a clear liquor
     bottle.

                                WILLIE
                   Vodka.

                                COBB
                   What assholes, they lock booze
                   in the safe.

                                DEJESUS
                   Probably confiscated.  No
                   booze on board, same as us.

     Doc turns the bottle around in DeJesus' hand so he can read
     the label.

                                DOC
                                (eyeing the bottle)
                   Stolichnaya.

     Everyone looks at Doc.

                                COBB
                   You read Russian?

                   Serbo Croat and a smattering of
                   Swahili...standard pre-med background...

     Cobb stares at him a second then:

                                COBB
                   Bullshit.

                   ...and a Russian grandmother...

     Beck ignores them and addresses Bowman.

                                BECK
                   I want all this stuff impounded
                   in the supply safe.

     He lifts the bottle of Stolie out of DeJesus' hands.

                                BECK(cont'd)
                   ...except this...it goes in my
                   safe.

     A disappointed crew watches Beck leave with the bottle.  Doc
     stops him.

                                DOC

                   this?

                                BECK
                                (leaving)
                   Be my guest.

     RING CORRIDOR - LATER

     The gloomy corridor outside the Infirmary.  It is empty,
     silent.  Suddenly the door to the Infirmary opens slightly
     and Bowman peeks out.  Seeing the corridor is empty she
     slips out with a a manila folder.

     DORMITORY - SAME

     Bowman hands the envelope to DeJesus, who's grinning
     delightedly.

                                DEJESUS
                   You got 'em!

     Sixpack and Jones are there too.  Sixpack scowls.

                                SIXPACK
                   What good's the kid's med
                   records anyway!

                                DEJESUS
                   Watch and learn, amigo...

     CONTROL ROOM - LATER

     CLOSE ON MONITOR SCREEN

     We see a thin, bearded man in his late fifties, a RUSSIAN
     SHIP'S CAPTAIN talking to the camera in Russian.  The tape
     is of poor quality and water spotted.

                                DOC'S VOICE(O.S.)
                                (translating)
                   Another party last night.  More
                   Vodka.  The infirmary is filled
                   as it is.  I confiscate what
                   I can, but I know the Government
                   Observers have more...

     Suddenly, the captain hears a noise off-screen and goes to
     the camera and turns it off.  The tape goes blank.

     ON DOC

     He stops the tape and presses another button on the console.
     WILLIE'S VIDEO of the huge hole in the hull of the ship
     appears on another screen.

                                DOC(cont'd)
                   See that gash?  The way the
                   edges protrude inward is like
                   from a torpedo explosion.  It
                   couldn't have come from within.
                   Like an accident.

     He looks back at Beck who we see is sitting behind him, and
     has also been watching the tape.  Beck looks at Doc and
     shrugs.

                                BECK
                   What do you want me to say?
                   That it all sounds mysterious?

                                DOC
                   These observers were doing something.
                   A test...I think they sank that ship
                   on purpose to cover up their mistakes.

                                BECK
                   What mistakes?
                                (he shakes his
                                head wearily)
                   Look, I think it's no big deal but
                   if you want to find out why this
                   ship sank have Maritime run a check.

     He gets up and goes to the door.  Doc watches him.

                                DOC
                   I did.  They have no record of
                   the wreck.
                                (beat)
                   The Marshal Goloviev is now on
                   a tour in the Baltic Sea.

     Beck stops.  This is a mystery.

     CLOSE ON COMBINATION LOCK/ BECK'S QUARTERS - SAME

     Fingers fiddle with the combination.  He pulls on the
     handle.  The safe doesn't budge.

                                DEJESUS
                                (whisper)
                   It's not the phone number...

     We pull back to see that DeJesus is alone in Beck's darkened
     quarters, he talks to the P.A.  Suddenly we hear BOWMAN'S
     VOICE over the intercom.

                                BOWMAN'S VOICE
                                (on intercom)
                   Okay, try the social security
                   number...

     DeJesus puts his fingers back, on the safe dial.

                                DEJESUS
                   Okay, give it to me...

     INTERCUT WITH BOWMAN IN DORM.

     CONTROL ROOM - SAME

     ON Beck at the door and Doc.

                                DOC
                   I want your permission to
                   check that vodka.

     Beck looks at him.  It is obvious that he doesn't trust Doc,
     with the vodka, but he's diplomatic.

                                BECK
                   This is a mining shack, not
                   a lab, Doc.  If there's something
                   strange with the vodka it's safe
                   till we get back.

     UPPER RING CORRIDOR

     ON COBB  Standing watch for DeJesus.  Suddenly the door to
     the Control room opens and Beck walks out.  Cobb grabs a
     walkie-talkie.

                                COBB
                   Beck's coming.

     BECK'S QUARTERS/ ON DEJESUS

     He hears Cobb and freezes.  He looks around--the cramped
     quarters don't offer much in the way of hiding places.

     INTERCUT WITH BOWMAN AND OTHERS IN DORMATORY

     They react similarly to the sound of Cobb on the P.A.

     ON COBB AND BECK/ CORRIDOR

     Beck stops outside his door and sees Cobb.

                                BECK
                   Something wrong, Cobb?

                                COBB
                                (struggling)
                   Uh..Excuse me sir, it's the air
                   recirculating system, sir...

                                BECK
                   What's wrong with it?

                                COBB
                                (thinking fast)
                   ...I'd really have to show it to
                   you.

                                BECK
                                (beat)
                   All right...

     Cobb smiles, he can't believe his luck, then Beck holds up
     the videotape.

                                BECK(cont'd)
                   ...Just let me put this in
                   my safe...

     Before Cobb can react Beck opens the door to his quarters
     and steps inside.

     BECK'S QUARTERS  WE SEE no sign of DeJesus.  Cobb follows
     into the room, looking carefully around for sign of DeJesus.

     In the mirror to Beck's bathroom, Cobb spots DeJesus
     pressing against the wall.  Cobb suddenly starts to sweat
     bullets.  Beck quickly unlocks the safe, opens it, and puts
     the videotape right next to the bottle of Vodka.

     We see Cobb's reaction.  Beck turns.

                                BECK
                   Something wrong?

     Cobb shakes his head weakly and starts to follow Beck out,
     he sneaks a look back at DeJesus in the shadows who gives
     him a thumbs up.

     MESS - LATER

     Five specimen cups filled with vodka.  Bowman takes hers and
     looks at it questioningly.  Cobb watches the door for signs
     of the officers.

                                BOWMAN
                   Cute, DeJesus...Specimen cups?

                                JONES
                   Aw, loosen up, Bowman...
                                (he looks over and
                                notices Willie)
                   Hey, Willie, I got one served
                   up for you.

     Willie shakes her head.

                                WILLIE
                   No, thanks.  I've got my
                   blood tests in three days.

                                DEJESUS
                   That's all you do is exercise.
                   You got to learn to live a little.

                                WILLIE
                   After my astronaut training physical,
                   then I'll tie one on.

                                SIXPACK
                   Forget space cadet, I'll drink hers.

                                COBB
                   Hey what happens it he goes
                   back and finds the bottle missing?

                                DEJESUS
                   He won't...

     He holds up a plastic IV bag filled with clear liquid.

                                DEJESUS(cont'd)
                   I poured the vodka in here.

     Cobb, Jones, DeJesus, Bowman, and Sixpack grin and clink
     glasses, then knock back their vodka.  Afterwards we get
     their reactions.

     JONES:  Looks concerned.
     BOWMAN:  Shakes her head, something's wrong.
     DEJESUS:  Can't get the taste off his tongue.
     COBB:  Seems totally satisfied.
     SIXPACK:  who has held the liquid in his mouth savoring it,
     suddenly spits the vodka out.

                                SIXPACK
                   Shit!  It's water!

                                JONES
                   Beck switched it!

                                DEJESUS
                   Can you beat that?  The sonof-
                   abitch doesn't trust us!

     Willie grins at her co-workers and Beck's move and jogs out
     into the corridor.  Sixpack disgustedly tosses his shot
     glass away and leaves.

                                SIXPACK
                   That little turd.  If I
                   ever get the chance I'll
                   fix his ass.

     The others put down their glasses disappointedly except
     Bowman.  She watches Sixpack.

     DORMITORY

     SIXPACK'S BUNK  He closes his privacy door and hesitates as
     if listening for the others, then he removes a silver flask
     with Cyrillic lettering--the silver object he palmed in the
     Swamp--and smiles as he takes a long pull.  Suddenly WHAM!

     The Privacy door to Sixpack's bunk is slammed open.
     Startled he turns startled to see--BOWMAN.

                                BOWMAN
                   Didn't I ever tell you vodka
                   was my favorite drink?

     She holds out her glass.  Sixpack looks around the Dorm,
     it's empty, then grins sheepishly and pours her a shot.

     CORRIDOR "B"

     ON WILLIE  She is jogging through the corridors.  Suddenly
     there is a GREAT GROANING NOISE.  Willie stops and looks
     through the steel mesh wall into the machine floor.  The
     dark shapes of the machines move monstrously in the dim
     light.  The GROANING ends and she jogs on to the Swamp.

     As she passes the door she notices the light and stops.  Beck
     stands with a clipboard by an equipment cabinet filled with
     the parachute-like Container Transporters we saw outside.
     He sees her.

                                BECK
                   That was a loud one wasn't it?

                                WILLIE
                   After a month of it you'd think
                   I'd be used to it.

     She moves into the Swamp and goes to the Lift Lock, stopping
     under one of the ladders she leaps up and grabs a metal rung
     above her and begins doing her chin-ups as Beck watches her
     lean body easily doing the exercises.

                                BECK
                                (watching her)
                   How's astronaut training?

                                WILLIE
                   Why?  You going to give me hard
                   time like the others?

                                BECK
                   No.  I'm just being friendly.

                                WILLIE
                                (beat)
                   Good...It's going good.

     Beck tries to concentrate on his inventory, but continues to
     watch Willie's sexy, athletic body.

                                BECK
                   Whatever made you want to
                   do a tour down here?

                                WILLIE
                   I need electrical field
                   experience on my resume.
                   Everything helps...
                                (she watches him)
                   Why are you here?

                                BECK
                   Everybody in corporate training
                   serves a tour on the line.  Sup-
                   posed to hone leadership skills
                   or something.

                                WILLIE
                   Has it helped?

     Beck shrugs.

                                WILLIE
                   I guess there's not a lot of
                   adventure in the Control Room.

     Beck looks up and they lock eyes.

                                BECK
                   You think I should hang around
                   more with the crew?

                                WILLIE
                   Well, I always heard you don't
                   "learn" leadership, you earn it.
                                (beat)
                   How did you know they'd get
                   into the vodka?

     Beck looks up from his clipboard and smiles.

                                BECK
                   I guess I figured if I was in
                   their shoes that's what I would've
                   done.

                                WILLIE
                                (smiles)
                   Maybe you're more one of us
                   than you think...sir.

     INT. MESS/ BLACKBOARD - MORNING

     SCREECH!  The chalk shrieks across the blackboard, making a
     "1" over the words "Days Till Pickup."

     Jones looks up from his cereal at Bowman, the culprit with
     the chalk.

                                JONES
                   Puuleeeeze...

     INT. DORMITORY - SAME

     DeJesus puts on his wet suit which goes under his large
     mechanical suit and gets ready to join the others in the
     mess.  He notices Sixpack's privacy door is still closed and
     bangs on it.

                                DEJESUS
                   Hey, Sixpack...Rise and shine
                   amigo...

     There is no answer.  Carefully he opens the door and is
     surprised to find it empty.

     INT. INFIRMARY - SAME

     CLOSE ON Sixpack's eye.  We pull back to see it is being
     examined by Doc who frowns.

                                DOC
                   Let's see your tongue.

     Sixpack obliges as Beck enters.

                                BECK
                   What's wrong?

                                DOC
                   Pretty good imitation of
                   a hangover and I ought to know.

                                SIXPACK
                   Well, it ain't!  It feels a
                   thousand times worse.

                                DOC
                   Where?

                                SIXPACK
                   I...I dunno.  I just feel...
                   wrong.

                                DOC
                   Take off your shirt.

     Sixpack pulls off his shirt.  Doc frowns in surprise.

     WHAT HE SEES:  SIXPACK'S TORSO  There are strange black
     areas, each of them an inch in diameter.

                                DOC (cont'd)
                                (concerned)
                   How long...how long have you
                   had these?

                                SIXPACK
                                (surprised, scared)
                   Shit, Doc...I didn't know I
                   had them.

     Doc peers closely at the skin where it's discolored.  It's a
     different texture.  Beck watches as Doc touches a spot and
     Sixpack screams in agony.  Doc and Beck lock eyes.

     BECK'S QUARTERS - SAME

     CLOSE ON MARTIN on Beck's video monitor.  He is drinking a
     cup of coffee.

                                MARTIN
                   ...as long as you know it's
                   not in your contract.

                                BECK
                   I know that.

                                MARTIN
                   Well, suit yourself, then...its
                   your decision...
                                (he chuckles)
                   Ha ha...a little joke...suit
                   yourself...

     Beck interrupts impatiently.

                                BECK
                   How's the weather for pickup
                   tomorrow?

                                MARTIN
                                (looking at a report,
                                then up at Beck)
                   Beautiful.

     THE SWAMP - MORNING

     The crew members climb into their suits.

                                COBB
                   Bad as he is there's no way
                   we can make our quota with-
                   out his sad self out there.
                   You just can't do it.

                                DEJESUS
                                (angrily)
                   He's tanking on us...

                                WILLIE
                   No...he's really sick.  I heard him
                   last night.  The company will take
                   that into consideration...

                                JONES
                   Honey, the company don't give
                   a flying fuck about "whys," they
                   just look at the numbers and
                   the contract says if we miss our
                   quota they only got to pay us
                   half-pay for the entire month.

                                DEJESUS
                                (convinced)
                   'Cocksucker's tanking on us...

     Suddenly all eyes go to the door, Beck enters.

                                BECK
                                (to DeJesus)
                   No, he's really sick...He won't
                   be going out today.

     The crew increases its bitching...

                                COBB
                   There goes our quota...

                                BOWMAN
                   Thirty days, right down the toilet...

     Beck ignores them and goes to the control rack which sends
     the suits around the room and pushes number 8--his suit.
     DeJesus and Jones share a look.  Bowman and Willie watch him
     carefully.  As Beck's suit stops in front of him the room is
     quiet, they can't believe their eyes.  Awkwardly, Beck
     tries to get into his suit.  Cobb breaks the silence.

                                COBB
                   Excuse me, sir...

                                BECK
                   Is this a contract violation,
                   Mr. Cobb?

                                COBB
                   No sir...I just wanted to know
                   if you needed a hand?

     Beck sees he's sincere, then looks at the others and Willie.
     She nods slightly.  Beck turns back to Cobb.

                                BECK
                                (beat)
                   Thanks...

     INT. THE INFIRMARY - SAME

     Doc and Sixpack.  Doc takes a blood sample, seals it and
     opens a cabinet under the sink where a supply of blood is
     stored in a refrigerated unit.  The plastic bags of blood
     are labeled with the various crew members' names.

     Sixpack watches him from the examination table.  He is
     shivering violently and scared.

                                SIXPACK
                                (he's losing it)
                   Please, Doc...I'm cold...I hurt...

     We see a change in Doc's demeanor.  He is suddenly needed
     and it has touched something in him and we see him rising to
     the challenge.

                                DOC
                   I'm just going to take a tiny
                   piece of skin to look at under
                   the microscope...Afterwards I'll
                   give you a sedative.

     Skillfully Doc takes a skin sample.  Sixpack screams.

     VIEW THROUGH THE MICROSCOPE

     An enlarged view of the cells in alarmingly hyperactivity.
     We see it literally spreading before our eyes.

     ON DOC

     He leans back from the microscope.  There is awe on his face
     for the first time since first year medical studies--and
     there is fear of the unknown.  He looks over his shoulder at
     Sixpack, his shivering has stopped, he lies still on the
     table.

     UNDERWATER

     Lights move in the blackness, but there is an order to the
     actions and a crispness to the voices.  People doing work
     that is moving sharply.  Pride in what they're doing.

                                DEJESUS
                   Okay, number 23's full.

                                BECK
                   Let's get it out of here and
                   bring in a new one.

                                JONES
                   Yes sir...

                                BOWMAN
                   Hook's on 24...

                                BECK
                   Let's have her...

     The Container transporters fill with compressed air and lift
     the container as the miners guide it to the track...

     INT. INFIRMARY/ SHACK - SAME

     Doc is at the console of his computer.  As words appear on
     the screen, obviously in response to his query...

     "...would appear to indicate a virus of unknown origin..."

     Doc shakes his head disgustedly.

                                DOC
                                (to himself)
                   No kidding?  "A virus of
                   unknown origin."  Come on and
                   tell me something I don't know...
                   like what's going on...

     ON SCREEN

     More words come up.  "...no idea..."

                                DOC(cont'd)
                                (typing, angrily)
                   Then take a guess, goddamnit!

     He finishes typing and waits for an answer.  The cursor
     flashes the word "PROCESSING".  Then an answer comes up.
     "Genetic Alteration?"  The words send a chill down Doc's
     spine.

     SWAMP ROOM - LATER

     The mood is happy.  Like a high school football locker room
     after a winning game.  DeJesus climbs out of his suit and
     slaps Beck on the shoulder.

                                DEJESUS
                   Good work out there, Mr. Becky.

     Beck, obviously pleased, looks at the others.  Jones sums up
     the feelings of the entire group.

                                JONES
                   Thank you, sir.

     Beck's grin suddenly disappears at the sight of a flashing
     red light over the intercom.

     INFIRMARY - LATER

     Beck is standing in the doorway of the Infirmary, glaring at
     Doc, who sits with his bottle of Old Granddad.

                                BECK
                   Dead?  This morning you said
                   he had some skin disorder.

                                DOC
                   He did.

                                BECK
                   Well, how the hell does a
                   skin rash kill you in eight
                   hours?!

     Doc looks at Beck wearily and hands him a mask.

                                DOC
                   Here.  Put this on.  You examine
                   him.

                                BECK
                   I'm not a doctor.

                                DOC
                   For this...you don't need to be.

     Beck hesitates, then puts on the mask.

     SICK ROOM

     As Beck enters, masked, Sixpack's back is to him under the
     sheets.  Slowly he pulls back the sheet and recoils from the
     sight.  The black splotches have nearly all grown together.
     His fingers have lengthened and become more webbed.  Most
     dramatically the sores on the sides of his neck have become
     flared and elongated.  Though not bleeding, the open veins
     are visible.

     INFIRMARY

     Doc pours some bourbon in a glass, and takes a sip.  Beck
     enters dazed from the sick room and their eyes meet.

                                BECK
                   The mask is because you think
                   it might be...catching?

                                DOC
                   I don't know.  I've been back
                   and forth with Narragansett Naval
                   all day, consulting with the best
                   people in maritime medicine, the
                   best people in viruses...

                                BECK
                                (impatiently)
                   And?

                                DOC
                   And they didn't believe the
                   symptoms I described...

                                BECK
                                (beat)
                   Why Sixpack?

                                DOC
                   It could be a million things,
                   something in the air, food....
                                (he looks up and
                                locks eyes with Beck)
                   But he went on that ship and so
                   did Williams...
                                (beat)
                   I want to examine the crew.

                                BECK
                                (still in shock)
                   Yeah...right...

     He starts to the door and Doc watches him.

                                DOC
                   I've reported the death to
                   the company.

     INT. THE MESS - SAME

     The mess is quiet.  All eyes are down.  Sixpack's absence is
     noticeable.

                                JONES
                   "Routine," my ass!  Ain't nothin'
                   "routine" about no physical check-
                   up 10,000 feet down...especially
                   when we're getting picked up the
                   next day!

                                COBB
                   He didn't say it was a "routine
                   check-up," he said it was a "routine
                   precaution."

                                WILLIE
                   Must be bad.  Even sick
                   Sixpack never missed a meal.

                                DEJESUS
                   It's this fucking air system....

                                COBB
                   Ain't the food or the
                   air system, he's just sick...
                   Everybody gets sick every
                   now and then.  It's all
                   part of being human!

     Bowman suddenly becomes pale.

                                BOWMAN
                   Well, I must be human because
                   I'm sure as hell sick.

     She gets up from the table and dashes for the toilet.

     INT. SHOWER ROOM - LATER

     EXAMINATION SEQUENCE

     CLOSE ON WHITE SKIN/(COBB)

     Pale skin, fishbelly white with white hairs, seen closely...

                                COBB'S VOICE(O.S.)
                   I guess I'm kinda...outta shape...
                                (a pause, no answer)
                   This skin condition...what is it?
                   Like herpes, or measles, or what?

                                DOC'S VOICE(O.S.)
                   It's difficult to describe.

     Doc is scrutinizing Cobb's flabby body closely.  They're
     alone in the shower room.  Stainless steel, and mirrors.  Doc
     stops and checks a place on Cobb more closely.

                                COBB
                                (watching, nervous)
                   Christ, it'd be a hell of a thing
                   if I went back to the roof with
                   some kind of herpes thing.  My
                   wife wouldn't understand that at all...

     Doc peers closely, satisfies himself that it's nothing.

                                DOC
                   You seem all right.

                                COBS
                                (relieved)
                   She wouldn't understand.  She'd
                   think I was down here fucking
                   my head off.

     DARK SKIN/ PORES  Black skin, seen very close, the pores
     appearing like craters.

     We're looking at Jones' naked body...rippling muscles.

                                JONES
                                (grumbling)
                   This whole thing's unnecessary, Doc.
                   Only "skin problem" I got is
                   white people...
                                (beat, suspiciously)
                   How come you're wearing those
                   gloves?

     INT. SHOWER ROOM/ SMOOTH SKIN - LATER

     Firm, lovely breasts, smooth skin...

                                WILLIE'S VOICE(O.S.)
                   This disease...do you know
                   what causes it?

     Doc turns Willie around and examines her firm naked
     buttocks.

                                DOC
                   Not yet.  You got any ideas?

                                WILLIE
                                (suddenly)
                   You don't think it was from going
                   on that ship do you?

                                DOC
                   That's a possibility.  But if
                   it was that simple why haven't
                   the symptoms begun on you?

     Doc turns away to let her dress.

                                WILLIE
                   You mean I'm okay?

                                DOC
                   You're fine.

     SHOWER ROOM/ TAN SKIN

     DeJesus' body is being examined...tan skin, wiry muscles
     seen very close.  As we move along the skin, it seems every
     moment as if the next instant will reveal a dread blemish...

                                DEJESUS' VOICE(O.S.)
                   What do you mean, "a skin problem"...
                   your skin changes?

     DeJesus, naked, with his back to us.  Doc examines him.

                                DOC
                   It blackens...becomes scaly.

                                DEJESUS
                                (joking)
                   You mean like a fish?

     DeJesus chuckles, but something about the thought stops Doc.

                                DOC
                                (almost to himself)
                   Yes...like a fish...

                                DEJESUS
                                (smiles)
                   I was just joking, Doc.

     CONTROL ROOM - SAME

     Beck sits in his chair reading the TRANSOCEAN OFFICERS
     INSTRUCTIONAL MANUAL.

     INSERT:  The chapter he's on says:  BODY DISPOSAL AT SEA.

     The face of Martin stares back at us.

                                MARTIN
                   Well, according to Maritime law,
                   you, as commander of the Shack
                   have the authority to dispose of
                   the body.  However, the company
                   doesn't want you to do that.

                                BECK
                   What you don't understand is that
                   my crew is in jeopardy.

                                MARTIN
                   But you don't have any proof
                   at this point to assume that
                   this disease is contagious, do
                   you?

                                BECK
                   I'm not anxious to find out, either.

                                MARTIN
                   Beck, trust me.  If the company
                   felt that you or your crew were
                   in any danger we would authorize
                   an immediate emergency pickup.
                   We could be there in a few hours.

                                BECK
                   Do it.

                                MARTIN
                                (beat)
                   Unfortunately.  We can't.

     He picks up a sheet of computer paper.

                                MARTIN(cont'd)
                   There is a typhoon about 600
                   miles off the coast of Baja.
                   It's not coming your way but the
                   Company doesn't want to lose
                   you folks or an emergency ship
                   should it veer your way.

                                BECK
                   What're you saying?  That we're
                   not even going to be picked up
                   tomorrow?

                                MARTIN
                   It shouldn't be a long delay.

                                BECK
                   But it's a delay!  How long?
                   A day?  Two days?!

                                MARTIN
                   Twelve hours, no big deal.  We
                   should know something first
                   thing in the morning.  Don't
                   worry.

     WASHROOM - SAME

     Willie enters the room with several sinks and a couple of
     toilet stalls.  She approaches one of the sinks and pulls a
     toothbrush from the pocket of her robe.

                                WILLIE
                   Bo?  Doc says you're next.

     Just then she hears a retching sound from one of the stalls.

                                WILLIE(cont'd)
                   Bo?...You okay?

     INFIRMARY - SAME

     Willie and Jones help Bowman into the Infirmary.  She is
     weak from nausea.  They help her onto the examination table
     and look around for Doc.  Jones sees a light on in the Sick
     Room.

     SICK ROOK - SAME

     Sixpack's body lies under a sheet in the Sick room.  The
     door opens and Jones looks in, sees Sixpack but in the dim
     light, doesn't realize the sheet covering him, covers the
     body totally.  Jones smiles.

                                JONES
                                (whispers)
                   Hey, Sixpack...Hey, my man...
                   How you feeling?

     There is no answer and Jones slowly approaches the body.

                                JONES
                   Hey, man, we made quota to-
                   day.  No thanks to you, you
                   dog, but we made it...Beck
                   helped us...We just dropped
                   Bowman off.  I hope what you've
                   got ain't catching...

     He is almost to the table and reaches out to touch Sixpack
     when suddenly the body stirs.  Sixpack's foot moves slightly
     under the sheet as if shifting in his sleep.  Jones stops.

                                JONES(cont'd)
                   Oh, man, sorry...you go back
                   to sleep.

     INFIRMARY - SAME

     Jones returns to the examination room.  Bowman is now
     undressed and under the blankets on the examination table.

                                WILLIE
                   Who were you talking to?

                                JONES
                   Sixpack...

                                WILLIE
                   How is he?

                                JONES
                   Sleeping.  No sign of Doc,
                   though.  I'll check the
                   control room.  You look
                   in the shower room...

     They leave Bowman GROANING on the examination table and head
     back to the main corridor.  As they leave WE HOLD ON the
     door to the sick room behind Bowman.

     Bowman writhes on the examination table in pain.  Carefully
     she climbs off the table and goes behind a partition to
     throw up.

     CLOSE ON BOWMAN

     At the sink in the infirmary.  She rinses her face in the
     sink and pulls back her hair, suddenly she stops and brings
     her hands in front of her face.

     INSERT HER HANDS.  Huge clumps of hair have come out in her
     hands.  And then she sees her hands themselves.  Scaly.

                                BOWMAN
                   Oh, God...what's going on?

     She turns and looks at the light on in the Sick Room.  Slowly
     she goes to the door and enters.

     SICK ROOM

     Bowman approaches the body of Sixpack.

                                BOWMAN
                                (panicked)
                   Sixpack...what's going on?

     No answer.  She pulls back the sheet and gasps.

     CONTROL ROOM - SAME

     ON BECK AND DOC.

                                DOC
                                (panicky)
                   You have to call them back.
                   Explain that this is an emergency.

     Jones enters.

                                JONES
                   Excuse me, sir...Bowman's
                   sick.  She's downstairs in
                   the infirmary.

                                DOC
                                (concerned)
                   The infirmary?...

                                JONES
                   Yes sir, ain't that where we
                   usually go when we're sick?

                                DOC
                   We're simply concerned about
                   her...proximity to...

                                BECK
                                (to Jones)
                   Sixpack's dead.

     Jones looks from one officer to the other then grins.

                                JONES
                   Bullshit...I was just talking
                   to him.  I saw him move.

                                BECK
                   What?...

     LOWER RING CORRIDOR - SAME

     Beck hits the floor off the ladder and rushes to the
     Infirmary with Jones.  He opens the door and freezes.

     WHAT HE SEES:  The examination table where Jones left her is
     empty.  The room deserted.

                                JONES
                                (pointing to
                                examination table)
                   I left her here.

     DOC comes up behind them, then turns.  He hears to a HISSING
     SOUND down the ring corridor.  He turns from the others and
     moves slowly toward the noise.

     SHOWER ROOM

     Doc enters the shower room, full of steam and the SOUND OF
     WATER.

                                DOC
                   Bowman?

     There is no answer and he moves toward the shower.

                                DOC
                   Bowman.  It's Doc.  I'm here
                   to help you.

     The water continues to run.  No answer.  Carefully, Doc
     opens the shower door.

     WHAT HE SEES:  Bowman.  Dead.  Her wrists have been cut and
     blood swirls down the drain.

     Doc sadly squats down beside her.  The death effects him
     greatly.  He feels helpless, then suddenly his eyes widen
     and he carefully reaches out and takes Bowman's limp arm,
     turning it supine.  There, running the length of the arm, WE
     SEE the black scales.

     INFIRMARY

     Jones and Beck lay Bowman's body carefully onto the
     examination table in the infirmary.  Through the Sick Room
     door we see the sheet shrouded body of Sixpack.  Doc covers
     Bowman with a sheet as

                                                      WE CUT TO

     THE MESS - LATER

     The remaining crew, Doc, and Beck assembled in the Mess.
     Doc sits quietly, almost in a daze.

                                BECK
                   I can't tell you much about
                   it, except that none of you
                   show any symptoms.

                                DEJESUS
                   And it killed Bo?

                                BECK
                   No...she killed herself.

     ON WILLIE  the news hits her hard.

                                JONES
                   We're getting out of here just
                   in time.

                                BECK
                   There's now a problem with the
                   weather for pickup.  There's a
                   typhoon in our sector...
                   ...We're going to be delayed
                   twelve hours...

                                DEJESUS
                   Typhoon?!

                                JONES
                   Twelve hours!

                                COBB
                   At least we get time and
                   a half.  That's in the contract.

                                JONES
                   Fuck double pay, man!  I
                   want out of here!

     Their argument is suddenly cut short by a NOISE from the
     corridor.  A THUMP!  The crew stops their grumbling and
     listens.  A moment later we hear another THUMP!  Beck looks
     at Jones.

                                BECK
                                (motions for Jones
                                to come with him)
                   Jones...
                                (to the others)
                   Stay here.

     RING CORRIDOR

     Beck leads the way slowly toward the Infirmary where the
     sound is coming from.  Outside the door they hear it once
     more.  THUMP!

     Carefully he enters the Infirmary and WE SEE the
     examination table is empty!  Beck goes to the Sick room and
     stops in the doorway.  Jones moves behind him and his eyes
     suddenly widen.

     WHAT THEY SEE:  Both bodies now are in a motionless, hideous
     conglomeration on the the table.

                                                  SLAM CUT TO

     CLOSE ON HEAVY ZIPPER

     ZZZZZZZZZZZZZZ.  It is quickly pulled shut, running the
     length of a heavy plastic bag, closing both bodies inside.

     INT. CORRIDOR "B" - LATER

     Dressed in their rubber latex suits Cobb, Jones, DeJesus,
     Beck, and Willie carry the body of Sixpack and Bowman in the
     zippered bodybag.  Now, well over three hundred pounds, the
     bodies strange shape and dead weight make it difficult to
     transport.

                                DEJESUS
                   C'mon, Cobb...you're slacking...

                                COBB
                                (angrily)
                   I ain't, goddamnit...It's
                   Jones!..

     Before Jones can argue, Beck cuts them off.

                                BECK
                   Shut up, all of you.

                                COBB
                   Mr. Beck, the contract states that
                   no body can be disposed of without
                   authorization of---

                                JONES
                   Fuck the contract, man!

     The group turns into the Swamp where Doc waits for them by
     the Lift Lock.  Rounding the corner Cobb bangs into the side
     of a bulkhead and drops his corner of the "package."  Like
     dominoes, Willie also looses her grip, then DeJesus.  The
     bodybag splashes into the grimy bilge water making it even
     harder for everyone to get a handhold.

                                BECK(cont'd)
                   C'mon...Lift!

     The group struggles to raise the bodybag and just get it to
     their shoulder when suddenly we go tight on DeJesus's face.

                                DEJESUS
                   Hey!...I feel something.
                   It's moving!  He's alive!

                                COBB
                   I feel it, too...Someone's trying
                   to get out.

     Cobb drops his end intentionally and he kneels looking for
     the zipper.

                                JONES
                   Cobb, what're you doing!

                                COBS
                   But he ain't dead!  He ain't
                   dead.

                                BECK
                   Cobb!  Stop!

     But Cobb grabs the zipper and starts to unzip the heavy bag.
     Beck tries to stop him when suddenly, WHAM!  a DARK
     APPENDAGE RIPS through the zipper and flails like a
     pressurized firehose.  It beats wildly for several second,
     then lashes out at Cobb--ripping a gash on his forearm.

     While Cobb screams in pain, Beck yanks the appendage off
     Cobb's arm revealing a mouth full of needlesharp teeth and a
     sharp tongue-like proboscis which has stabbed Cobb like a
     dagger.

                                COBB
                   It bit me!  It bit me!

     While Beck and Willie wrestle the strong flopping appendage,
     Doc rushes to the Lift Lock.

     DeJesus and Jones struggle to force the lurching bodybag
     into the Lift Lock.

                                JONES
                   Push Hazy!

     The bodybag shudders like a huge cocoon about to lose its
     occupant.  Jones digs his shoulder down into the task just
     as the bag suddenly RIPS in several places.  A tear RIPS
     OPEN next to Jones' head revealing the head of BOWMAN, her
     vacant eyes only inches from Jones' face.

                                JONES
                   Oh, Jesus Christ!  I ain't
                   never gonna sleep again!

     Suddenly a WHINING NOISE sounds behind them.  Beck looks
     back to see Cobb approaching with a battery operated
     underwater chain saw.  He's clearly intending to cut the
     Creature with the whirring blade.

                                BECK
                   No!

                                COBB
                   It bit me!

                                DEJESUS
                   It's Sixpack!

                                COBB
                   I'm going to kill it!

     DeJesus turns to block Cobb while the others continue to
     wrestle the bodybag into the Lift Lock.  The bag suddenly
     splits and a scaly arm protrudes.  It reaches out grabbing
     DeJesus.  Beck pulls him free and yells.

                                BECK
                   Close the Lock!  Now!

     Doc hits the lever.  The elevator doesn't move!

     RRRRRRIIIIIPPP!  A scaly leg rips out of the body bag!

                                BECK(cont'd)
                   Hit it again!

     Doc hits the elevator switch again, harder.

     NNNNNNN!  The Lift Lock door whines closed and a horrifying
     SCREAM rises from the Lock.

     CLOSE ON THE LIFT LOCK

     The end of the appendage is severed in the closing door,
     disappearing unseen into the greasy bilge water.

                                BECK(cont'd)
                   Flush it!

     Doc flips a switch and the SCREAM OF THE VACUUM PUMPS drown
     out the SCREAM in the Lift Lock, the wails of Cobb, and the
     splashing sounds of the severed three-foot section of gory
     muscle which slip silently and undetected under the
     workbench.

     A second later the elevator returns empty, silent,
     bloodstained.

     Beck turns on the video monitor of the exterior Lock.  The
     exterior worklights illuminate millions of bubbles from the
     flush and the struggling movements of the bodybag before it
     grows still once again and disappears beyond the range of
     the Shack lights...into the darkness.

     Beck turns and looks at his savaged crew.  Willie, Jones,
     DeJesus, Doc look like wet-suited butchers.  Splattered in
     blood, numbed by the experience, they are brought together
     by having simply survived.  Jones holds up Willie.  DeJesus
     leans against the bulkhead.  In the far corner Cobb sobs
     quietly.

     SHOWERS - LATER

     Clouds of steam.  Vaguely seen through the steam, Willie is
     scrubbing herself almost desperately, as though the
     spattered blood of the creature had penetrated into her
     skin.  Finally she gives up almost in tears and rests her
     head against the wall of the shower stall.

     DORMITORY - SAME

     Beck and Jones open the privacy door to Sixpack's bunk.
     After some digging which produces five month's supply of
     pornography, the empty flask clatters to the floor.  Beck
     picks it up.

                                BECK
                   I think we just found our
                   problem.

     MESS - LATER

     Cobb pours himself a cup of coffee with a shaky hand.  Jones,
     and DeJesus sit at a table and Willie laces up her shoes for
     a run.  There is a feeling of anger among them.

                                DEJESUS
                   Serves his ass right to get
                   it.  Motherfucker brings that
                   shit onboard.  I hope his
                   fucking ass rots in the sea and
                   is shit upon by the fish.

                                JONES
                   'Fucker could have gotten us
                   all killed.

                                COBB
                   He knew better than that.

     Willie finishes tying up her shoes and looks at them all
     coldly.

                                WILLIE
                   You guys sure weren't so holy
                   when you were shooting that
                   vodka...It could have been you.

     She gets up and walks out into the Ring corridor.

     THE RUSSIAN SHIP

     WE ARE MOVING along the ship's corridor that Willie walked
     looking for Sixpack.

     WE PULL BACK TO REVEAL WE ARE WATCHING A VIDEO SCREEN IN THE
     CONTROL ROOM

     Doc and Beck replay the tape of Willie's search for Sixpack
     on the Russian ship.  On the monitor screen we see Willie's
     POV of the infirmary.  The light dances off the broken glass
     as she turns, then the flash of white we saw before as the
     light moves out into the corridor.

                                DOC
                   Hold it!  Rewind it.

     Beck rewinds it.

     ON SCREEN  we see the scene again.  Light dancing off the
     cabinets.  As the light starts to turn--

                                DOC
                   Stop it.

     Beck pauses the tape.  We see nothing. Doc is confused.

                                DOC
                   Back it up slowly.

     Beck does and we watch Doc's face as he stares intently at
     the screen.  Suddenly he sees it.

                                DOC
                   There.

     ON SCREEN  We see it.  Caught in the turn of the camera, now
     frozen on the screen is the clear gleaming skeletal remains
     of a man.  Only it is clear that this is no ordinary man.
     Fingers and appendages are lengthened and broader than
     normal.  But it is the large head and long sharp teeth that
     especially catches our attention.

     MESS - SAME

     ON A BEAUTIFUL BAVARIAN SETTING

     as a hand suddenly moves into frame and we see the scene is
     actually one of DeJesus' jigsaw puzzles.  He takes a piece
     of blue sky from the hundreds of pieces on the table and
     places it perfectly into position on the puzzle.  Jones
     watches him amazed.

                                DEJESUS
                   You know that Innsbruck
                   has 64 square miles of ski
                   slopes, man?  Think about that.
                   Sixty-four square miles.

     He picks up another piece of blue sky and effortlessly fits
     it into place as Jones watches.  It's blowing Jones' mind.

                                JONES
                   How'd you do that?

                                DEJESUS
                   What?  That?...I've done this
                   one before.  You hungry?  I'm
                   hungry.

     He gets up to go into the mess and Jones looks at him in
     amazement.

                                JONES
                   Hungry?  After what we just
                   went through I may never
                   eat again.

     ON WILLIE

     She jogs down the corridors toward the Swamp.  The Shack
     CREAKS and Willie looks down through the grating passing
     below her feet.  It is dark down there.  Her feet pound off
     the metal grating.

     LOW ANGLE  We watch Willie from below as she jogs past.  THEN
     WE TILT DOWN to the dark, still water of the bilge.  Suddenly
     something stirs in the water--a ripple like a trout in a
     stream.

     CONTROL ROOM - SAME

     Using a computer plotting program to measure the dimensions
     of the skull on the videotape, Doc enters these measurements
     as they are read off to him by Beck.  As each of the
     measurements go into the computer an image of a skull begins
     to appear on the computer screen, followed by a name:
     DANAKIL MAN.

                                BECK
                   They found this?

                                DOC
                   No.  I think they isolated
                   him in genetic engineering.
                   Homo aquaticus...

                                BECK
                   Was there such a thing?

                                DOC
                   Danakil man?...one of our
                   ancestors.  Named for the
                   Danakil Alps in Ethiopia.

                                BECK
                   Not exactly a big ocean
                   country.

                                DOC
                   It was when it counted a couple
                   of million years ago when the
                   seas came in and drove us into
                   the water.  Most homo sapiens
                   didn't make it...Danakil man...
                   adapted.

     ON WILLIE

     running.  She jogs past the machine room.  Looking in, the
     machines seem alive, pulsing, the beating heart of the
     Shack.  There is something else though.  We feel something
     in there watching her.

     CONTROL ROOM

     On Doc.

                                DOC
                   Some say that's why we're
                   basically hairless, for less
                   water resistance, faster swimming
                   speeds...

                                BECK
                   But what about those scales...
                   or that leech-like thing that
                   bit Cobb?

                                DOC
                   Why stop with just one aspect
                   of marine life?  Why not incorporate
                   the best genetic components the
                   ocean has to offer?...

                                BECK
                                (pointing to screen)
                   Well, if they were perfecting an
                   aquaman, then why's there a dead
                   one onboard that Russian ship?  Why
                   isn't he out swimming around?

     Doc looks up at the image on the screen.  The huge skull
     stares back hauntingly.

                                DOC
                                (beat)
                   He obviously lacked something
                   in his environment.

     DORMITORY - SAME

     ON COBB  He sits on his bunk and peers under his bandage.
     He turns on an overhead reading light and looks again.
     Suddenly a voice startles him.

                                JONES' VOICE
                   Turned black yet?

     At first startled, Cobb recovers and answers sharply.

                                COBS
                   That ain't funny.

                                JONES
                   Relax, Cobb.  If it was
                   going to turn, it would have
                   done its trick by now.

                                COBB
                   That's easy for you to say.
                   You ain't the one that got bit.

     Jones starts to leave when he suddenly notices something on
     Cobb's bunk.  He picks it up and we see a photo of Cobb's
     family.

                                JONES
                   Don't tell me you're getting
                   soft on us, Cobbie?  You're
                   the fellow who always said--

     Cobb snatches the photo back from Jones and glares at him
     with the same old, hard "Cobb look."

                                COBB
                   Nothing's changed, goddamnit!

     Jones leaves, and Cobb waits till he is gone then looks back
     at his photo.  His look changes, softening.  Absently he
     scratches his bandage.

     SWAMP

     Willie enters and checks her running time on her watch.  She
     bends over to catch her breath then straightens suddenly.

     OVERHEAD SHOT

     WE are watching her from above.  For a moment she is quiet
     as if listening for a noise somewhere in the Swamp.  She
     looks around slowly and her eyes come to rest on the
     Workbench.

     MESS - SAME

     DeJesus looking for food.  In the gloom of fluorescent
     lighting he opens and closes various cabinets looking for a
     snack.

     He notices that the floor's wet near the sink.  He frowns
     and hears a SMALL NOISE, like something shifting slightly.
     He moves to investigate, crouching low, peeking into the
     shadows under the sink, into a litter of cleanser bottles,
     pails, rags...All he can see are shadows.  He looks more
     closely, actually sticking his head under the sink when

     SUDDENLY SOMETHING TOUCHES HIS SHOULDER FROM BEHIND!  DEJESUS
     JUMPS, BUMPING HIS HEAD ON THE SINK AS HE WHIRLS TO SEE.

     JONES, looming over his shoulder, looking down at him.

                                JONES
                   Man, everybody is jumpy...
                   What are you doing?

     Not fully recovered from the start, DeJesus rubs his bruised
     head.

                                DEJESUS
                   Getting some food.

                                JONES
                   Under there?

     DeJesus gets to his feet, points at the water under the
     sink.

                                DEJESUS
                   Look.  Water.

                                JONES
                   Probably the plumbing.  You
                   gonna make me finish that puzzle
                   by myself, or what?

     DeJesus continues to scrutinize the water then looks back at
     Jones.

                                DEJESUS
                   No, I'll be right there.

     He looks down at his sandwich as Jones starts out of the
     galley.  Something is missing.

                                DEJESUS
                                (to himself)
                   Mustard.  Need mustard...

     He opens the refrigerator and finds the mustard jar empty.

                                DEJESUS
                                (muttering to himself)
                   Sixpack...

     He throws the jar in the trash then opens the cabinet next
     to the refrigerator for a new jar, and reaches inside.

     SUDDENLY, LIKE A SNAKE, A TWO FOOT CHUNK OF MUSCLE ATTACHES
     TO DEJESUS'S WRIST!  WITH HIS FREE HAND DEJESUS TRIES TO RIP
     THE TWISTING, WRITHING THING OFF.  PULLING AT IT HE REVEALS
     PART OF SIXPACK'S FACE--ONE EYE AND PART OF HIS
     MOUTH--UNDERNEATH THE SURFACE.

     DeJesus falls against the side cabinets screaming and
     causing an avalanche of pots and pans.

                                DEJESUS
                                (in pain)
                   Ahhh!

     INSIDE THE MESS

     Jones is now putting a piece of the puzzle into place when
     he hears THE CLATTER OF POTS AND PANS.

                                JONES
                   Hey, Hazy...what're you doing
                   now...cooking?

     There is no answer and Jones looks up.

                                JONES(cont'd)
                                (concerned)
                   Hazy?...

     He goes to the door and looks in.  His eyes widen at the
     sight of DeJesus staggering toward him with the squeezing
     hunk of muscle.

                                JONES(cont'd)
                   Holy shit!

                                DEJESUS
                   Help me, Jonesy.  Oh, God,
                   help me!  It's getting inside
                   me, I can feel it!

     He keeps coming at Jones who backs away slowly from his
     friend.

                                JONES
                   Hazy, please...I'm going to
                   get you some help, man...just
                   don't touch me...

     Jones finds himself backing away until he is by the door to
     the Galley.  He closes it, rushing through into the Mess to
     the Ring corridor where he runs into Cobb.

                                COBB
                   What's going on?

                                JONES
                   It's Hazy...It's got him!
                   Stay here and don't let him
                   out.  I'm going to get the Doc.

     Jones runs out and leaves Cobb by the door.  Cobb watches
     him go.  As the noise in the Mess intensifies, we hear
     banging on the door, then DeJesus' anguished cries.

                                DEJESUS
                   Help me!  Help me!

     Cobb backs slowly down the corridor toward the dorm.

     UPPER RING CORRIDOR - SAME

     Jones meets Beck and Doc leaving the control room.

                                JONES
                   It's got Hazy!

                                BECK
                   What has?

                                JONES
                   One of those chunks of
                   Sixpack!  Like a big leech,
                   with those teeth!...

                                DOC
                   We've got to get him to the
                   infirmary.

                                JONES
                   What are you going to do to
                   him?

                                DOC
                   I'm going to try to remove it.

                                JONES
                   I've got Cobbie downstairs
                   watching the door.

     INT. LOWER RING CORRIDOR - SAME

     Deserted.  There is no sign of Cobb and the door to the mess
     stands open.  The mess is empty.  Beck is the first one down
     the ladder followed by Jones.

                                JONES
                   Cobb?  Hazy?  Oh, shit...He's
                   gone...

     Cobb returns with a mining tool.

                                JONES
                   You let him get away!

                                COBB
                   I ain't doing nothing for that
                   thing without something to
                   defend myself.

                                JONES
                   That thing happens to be
                   my friend.

                                BECK
                   Shut up, both of you!  We've
                   got to find it.

     Beck suddenly looks around noticing something.

                                BECK(cont'd)
                   Where's Willie?

                                COBB
                   Oh, God, she's out there...

                                BECK
                   Jones...come with me.  Cobb,
                   you and Doc check the rooms.

     INT. THE LOWER "B" CORRIDOR - SAME

     Jones and Beck move down the spooky corridor toward the
     Swamp.  Overhead, water moves through the desalinization
     conduit.  Jones eyes it warily.

     SWAMP

     They enter the quiet Swamp.  The suits hang silently like
     sleeping monsters.  Beck steps into the equipment room.

     Jones walks along the suits which hang in front of him.
     Their empty masks stare at him hauntingly.  He reaches the
     end and stands in front of the ladder where we earlier saw
     Willie doing chin-ups.  He looks down and sees her headband
     floating in the bilgewater.

                                JONES
                   Willie...

     Suddenly Willie lowers herself from the bar behind him.

                                WILLIE
                   Yeah?

     The sudden sight of her nearly gives Jones heart failure, he
     stumbles backwards into the ankle deep water and Willie
     drops from the bar laughing.

                                WILLIE
                                (grinning)
                   What on earth's the matter
                   with you?

                                JONES
                   I ought to smack your face!

     Willie picks up the strain in Jones' voice, her smile fades.

                                WILLIE
                   What's wrong?

                                JONES
                   DeJesus...It's got him.

     THE EQUIPMENT ROOM - SAME

     Jones, Willie and Beck move quickly.  Beck pulls a portable
     laser drill which fits into the arm of the mechanical suits
     and attaches a portable power unit to the back.  Turning it
     on it becomes a sinister close-range weapon.

     Willie opens an equipment cabinet and reveals deflated
     container transporters.  Beck notices and then looks up at
     Jones who opens a locked cabinet and takes out the bicycle
     pump/earthquake device we saw Willie use earlier.

                                BECK
                   I thought they were your friends?

                                JONES
                   Were, Doss were.

     Beck reaches out and takes the powerful weapon away from
     him.

                                BECK
                   You fire that in here and
                   you'll bring the whole place
                   down.

     Jones thinks about it for a moment, then reaches for one of
     the Acetylene tanks.  He lights the end of it and a long
     blue tongue of flame whips out the door into the Swamp.
     Jones grins.

     INFIRMARY - SAME

     Doc and Cobb move into the Infirmary.  Doc goes into his
     office.  He takes three scalpels out of an equipment drawer
     and then looks up, through the levolor blinds into the
     infirmary.  What he sees upsets him.

     INT. SWAMP - SAME

     Jones working the intercom.

                                JONES
                                (to intercom)
                   Jones to Doc.  Doc?...Cobb?

     He looks back to Beck, concerned.

                                JONES(cont'd)
                                (to Beck)
                   Think it got 'em?

                                BECK
                   No, it's not going through.
                   The intercom's busted.  I thought
                   DeJesus fixed that?

                                JONES
                                (beat, realizing)
                   He did.

     INFIRMARY - SAME

     Doc leaves his office and slowly goes into the Infirmary to
     the storage counter across the room--where the blood is
     stored.  WE SEE what disturbed him...the door to the
     refrigeration unit is ajar.  Doc opens the door to the
     cabinet.  The plastic bags are now empty.  Each one has been
     drained.

     LOWER RING CORRIDOR - SAME

     Cobb moves out of the Infirmary, carefully down the eerie
     corridor, his mining tool in front of him for security.
     There is a sinister feel to the place.  Each step only
     reveals a little bit of space ahead of him.  Suddenly he
     stops.  In front of him across the hall a cabinet which
     says:  ONBOARD COMMUNICATIONS, is torn open.  It is where
     DeJesus fixed the intercom the day before.

     CLOSE ON THE CABINET

     The door is shattered.  Carefully, Cobb opens the door and
     WE SEE the guts of the wiring have been torn out--the entire
     system has been disabled.

     Cobb carefully examines the damage WHEN SUDDENLY A SCALY
     HAND-LIKE APPENDAGE slams into the cabinet door trapping
     COBB and sending his weapon to the floor.  Cobb turns
     directly into

     THE LEECH-LIKE MOUTH!  It's sharp teeth shine in the light,
     poised to strike.

     Cobb's eyes closed, screams like a maniac, waiting for the
     tentacle to attack.  Then suddenly an UNGODLY SCREAM echoes
     in the corridor.

     COBB opens his eyes to see the tentacle gone.  Doc is
     holding the smoking mining drill, his eyes glazed, as if he
     has seen the devil itself.

                                COBB
                   What happened?

                                DOC
                                (absently)
                   It...almost got you.

                                COBB
                   What was it?

     Doc shakes his head dumbly.  He is in total shock.

     THE MESS

     The remaining group is assembled around the table.  Jones
     watches the door with one of the homemade flamethrowers.  He
     listens.

                                COBS
                                (excitedly)
                   I saw it!  It's big!

                                BECK
                   Big?

                                JONES
                   Bigger than DeJesus?  How?

                                DOC
                   It's had a meal.

     He holds out the empty blood bags.  A change has come over
     Doc since Bowman's death.  The experience has slightly
     deadened him.

                                WILLIE
                   It needs blood?

                                JONES
                   Fucking great...You telling
                   me we got a fucking dracula
                   in here with us?

                                DOC
                   It would explain the suction-
                   like appendages.

                                JONES
                   Like a leech.

                                BECK
                   That's why there's a dead one
                   on the ship.  It ran out of blood.

                                JONES
                   What dead one on the ship?

     He looks from Doc to Beck.

                                JONES(cont'd)
                                (sharply)
                   Someone want to let the rank
                   and file in on your little
                   secret?

     Doc looks at Beck, then Jones.

                                DOC
                   The monster appears to be
                   a genetic aberration...

                                JONES
                   No fuckin' lie...

                                DOC
                   ...It has many traits of deep
                   sea marine life...regeneration,
                   scales, gills, even a period
                   of dormancy...
                                (more to Beck)
                   but the fact that it remembered
                   where the plasma was stored, or
                   where the communication wiring was,
                   may imply that it has some other
                   quality...

                                COBB
                                (panicky)
                   What?...What?

     Beck locks eyes with Doc.

                                BECK
                                (to Doc)
                   That it acquires intelligence
                   from its victims?

                                DOC
                   Intelligence may not be the right
                   word...

                                JONES
                   Fuck semantics, Doc!
                   You saying its like part
                   DeJesus, part Sixpack, part
                   Bowman?!

                                DOC
                                (tiredly)
                   I don't know.  I'm guessing.

                                COBB
                                (losing it)
                   I say we should go get in the
                   escape bubbles and get the hell
                   out of here!

                                JONES
                   And hit the surface in the
                   middle of a typhoon?...No, thank you.
                   I'll take my chance down here.

     Willie looks at Beck.

                                WILLIE
                   What can we do?

                                BECK
                   Our only chance is to lure
                   it to the Swamp and flush it
                   like we did the other.

                                COBB
                   And how're we going to do that?

     Beck checks his flamethrower and looks at Jones.

                                                     TIME CUT TO

     THE MESS - LATER

     ON BECK  He flexes his arm as a needle is taken from it.  WE
     SEE a half-pint of blood in a bag, held by Doc.  He secures
     it and hands it back to Beck.

                                DOC
                   Be careful with it.

                                BECK
                   Don't worry, I don't want to
                   give up any more.

     He looks over at Jones who watches the door.  Jones looks
     back and nods.  The coast is clear.

     LOWER RING CORRIDOR - SAME

     The door to the Mess opens and Beck slips into the shadows
     of the hall.  A second later Jones follows.  In the dim
     light they begin moving toward the Lower "B" corridor to the
     Swamp.

     MESS - SAME

     Cobb, Doc and Willie alone in the Mess.  Cobb scratches his
     bandage.  Doc notices.

                                DOC
                   Still bothering you?

                                COBB
                   Itches like hell.

                                DOC
                   Take it off and let me have
                   a look.

     Cobb pulls back the bandage and looks at the gash.

     INSERT COBB'S WOUND  Pink and healing.

                                DOC
                   Looks good to me.  I'll re-bandage
                   it, though.

     He looks at Willie.

                                DOC(cont'd)
                   Willie, would you clean it
                   for me.  I'm going to the
                   infirmary for supplies.

     He turns and Willie stops him with a firm grip.

                                WILLIE
                   You can't go out there alone.

                                DOC
                   I'm the Doctor.  I have to
                   do what's best for this crew.
                                (he pulls away)
                   I need my bag.

     THE LOWER RING CORRIDOR - SAME

     The door opens and carefully Doc steps out into the
     corridor.  He looks toward the Infirmary then starts up the
     ladder to the Upper Level instead.

     CLOSE ON DROPS OF BLOOD INTO A SMALL POOL

     a grisly sight.

     WE PULL BACK TO REVEAL the drops coming from the plasma bag
     of Beck's blood.  Beck stops the drip and moves on into the
     darkness of the corridor.

     CONTROL ROOM

     Doc moves behind the computer keyboard in the dim light of
     the Control room.  His face lit by the computer monitor.  He
     types furiously.

     COMPUTER SCREEN

     "Emergency Escape Bubbles...ready for activation..."

     DOC pauses looking at the message, then moves his hand to
     the SEND command and presses it.

     THE MESS - LATER

     Willie prepares a clean bandage as Doc examines the cut.  He
     smiles at Cobb like a friendly country doctor.  The tired look
     now gone from his eyes.  He seems revitalized.

                                DOC
                   There, good as new.  Just
                   keep your paws off of it.
                                (to Willie)
                   Do you have the new bandage ready?

     She nods.  Doc turns back to the sink and Cobb holds out his
     arm to let Willie put the new bandage on.  As Cobb's arm
     comes up we suddenly notice a slight movement under his
     shirt.  Willie stops just before applying the bandage.  The
     movement intensifies--like snakes moving wildly beneath the
     cloth.  Cobb whitens...breaks out in a sweat.  Willie backs
     off.

                                WILLIE
                   Doc?...Doc!

     She steps back and Doc moves into her place as suddenly a
     leech-mouthed tentacle erupts from Cobb's waist.  It's razor
     sharp proboscis punctures Doc's chest right at the heart and
     the leach mouth with it's hundreds of teeth attaches with
     vacuum-like suction.

                                DOC
                   No!

     But it is too late.  Willie falls back screaming as Cobb's
     gash RRRRRRRIPS OPEN!  THE FLESH OPENING GROTESQUELY FROM
     THE INSIDE AND INVERTS SCALY--SPREADING OVER COBB'S BODY
     LIKE A BUSHFIRE!

     CORRIDOR "B"

     CLOSE ON THE POOL OF BLOOD

     A huge shadow falls over the pool left by Beck.  A scaly
     tentacle suddenly whips across the floor.  The DEJESUS
     CREATURE!  WE SEE THE FLASH OF ITS APPENDAGES.  IT'S HEAD.
     AN EYE OPENS AND LOOKS UP.

     WHAT IT SEES  The outline of Beck lying "hurt" fifty feet
     away.

     It starts down the corridor toward it's prey--Beck.

     ON BECK

     A little behind him with the homemade flamethrower, Jones
     waits in the shadows.  Suddenly Beck hears something.

                                BECK
                                (whispers)
                   I hear something. Don't fire
                   until we're both in the Swamp.

     Jones moves a little farther back.

                                BECK(cont'd)
                   Don't let him see you.

                                JONES
                   Don't worry...

     As the Creature approaches WE SEE Beck stand up like a
     wounded animal.  He begins dragging his "injured" leg behind
     him as he retreats toward the Swamp.  THE FOOTSTEPS MOVE
     FASTER.  IT'S CLOSING!

     INT. RING CORRIDOR - SAME

     ON WILLIE  She bursts out the door to the MESS and heads
     toward Corridor "B."

     DOOR TO THE SWAMP

     Beck moves through the door to the Swamp and positions
     himself by the door.  He looks back and WE SEE Jones for the
     first time, flamethrower poised, ready to fire.

                                JONES
                   C'mon baby c'mon...

     ON THE SHADOW OF THE CREATURE

     It moves steadily toward the door, moving right to the
     doorway.  Carefully it moves a dark, horrible hand-like
     appendage inside the doorframe.

     ON BECK AND JONES

     poised to kill when suddenly both men hear the same thing.

                                WILLIE'S VOICE(O.S.)
                   Beck?  Jones!?

     ON WILLIE

     She turns the corner and freezes.  There, less than ten feet
     away is the Creature.  A tentacle whips excitedly like a
     tail!

                                WILLIE
                   Oh God...

     AS THE CREATURE starts to turn for Willie, Beck suddenly
     closes the vault-like door to the swamp on Creature's hand,
     trapping it vise-like in the door.

                                BECK
                   Run Willie!  Run!

     The Creature throws back its head and SCREAMS in pain as the
     heavy door severs its appendage.

     ON BECK AND JONES

     As the writhing hand-like appendage squirms in front of them
     Jones blasts it with his flamethrower until the hand curls
     like a piece of bacon and it ceases to move.

                                JONES
                   Well done.  Just like
                   momma makes 'em.

     Beck opens the door--the corridor is empty.  Willie and the
     creature are gone.

     ON WILLIE RUNNING

     She heads back toward the Ring corridor around the inner
     path toward Corridor "A".  In a full run now, every panel
     and instrument looks even more sinister--where is Cobb/Doc
     CREATURE?---

     ON THE DEJESUS CREATURE'S SEVERED APPENDAGE

     As the Creature moves after Willie we see its bloody stump
     suddenly sprout a new appendage!  Like a starfish it grows
     another leech like tentacle to replace the one it lost.

     ON WILLIE

     She turns down Corridor "A".  A NOISE overhead in the water
     conduit causes her to look up WHEN SUDDENLY A BLACK ARM
     REACHES OUT FROM THE SHADOWS, AND PULLS HER INTO THE DARK
     DOORWAY TO THE MACHINE FLOOR----IT IS JONES!  He pulls her
     between him and Beck in the shadows.

                                BECK
                                (whispered)
                   Where's Cobb and Doc?

                                WILLIE
                                (recovering)
                   Cobb's cut...It was in him!
                   It got Doc...

                                JONES
                   Oh man, that's just great...

                                BECK
                   C'mon.

     CONTROL ROOM

     Beck is followed inside by Jones and Willie.  It is empty.

                                BECK
                   Lock the door.

     Jones rolls the large vault-like door closed and locks them.
     Beck goes to the console and checks the instruments.
     Suddenly he sees something that causes him to freeze in his
     tracks.  A red light blinks ominously on the console.

                                BECK
                   Shit!  He sent them all.

                                WILLIE
                   The escape bubbles?

     She and Jones stop in front of Doc's console.

                                JONES
                                (gravely)
                   Look at this.

     Beck looks at Doc's computer screen.

     ON SCREEN WE SEE DOC'S MESSAGE:  "...hope that our sacrifice
     will mean that the human race will never know this awful
     mutation..."

                                WILLIE
                   What is it?

                                JONES
                   The good doctor signed our
                   death warrant.

     SUDDENLY THERE IS A TREMENDOUS BANGING ON THE DOOR!  LIKE A
     HUNDRED SLEDGEHAMMERS POUNDING THE HEAVY STEEL DOOR TRYING
     TO BREAK IT DOWN.  Jones readies his weapon but just as
     suddenly, the BANGING STOPS.  Beck, Willie and Jones all
     nervously exchange looks.

                                WILLIE
                   Well, at least we're safe inside
                   here.

                                JONES
                   For how long?

     Beck slides behind the Console and quickly types in a
     message.  WE SEE IT ON THE SCREEN.  "SHACK SIX REPORTING.
     PLEASE DISREGARD PREVIOUS MESSAGE---"

     SUDDENLY MARTIN'S FACE APPEARS ON THE VIDEO SCREEN.

                                MARTIN
                   Thank goodness, you're still
                   alive!

                                JONES
                                (yells nervously
                                at the screen)
                   Hey, man, you better get
                   your ass out here right now
                   and get us.  You hear me,
                   motherfucker?  Right now!

     Martin smiles calmly back at the three of them.

                                MARTIN
                   Please relax, Mr. Jones.  Every-
                   thing is under control.  Naturally,
                   when we received Dr. Warren's
                   message we were concerned but
                   would never have deserted you.

     Jones lets out a breath.  Willie stares straight at the
     screen.

                                WILLIE
                   When are you coming for us?

                                MARTIN
                                (smiles nervously)
                   Well, that's the bad news.
                   The typhoon did turn your way.
                                (he looks at weather
                                printout)
                   Right now it is on a course--

                                JONES
                   Just answer the question, man!
                   When are you coming?!

                                MARTIN
                                (beat)
                   Hopefully in the next 48 hours.

                                BECK
                   Forty-eight hours!

                                MARTIN
                   I realize you must have gone
                   through hell--

                                JONES
                   Gone?  Man, we're still here!

                                MARTIN
                                (firmly)
                   I can't change the weather.
                   Try to get some rest.  I'll
                   keep you posted.

     He turns off his screen and the picture in front of Beck,
     Jones and Willie goes blank.

                                BECK
                   He's right.  Why don't you get some
                   rest.  I'll stand the first watch.

                                             TIME CUT TO

     CONTROL ROOM - LATER

     Jones sits near the vent sound asleep, his weapon across
     his stomach.  Near him Willie lies still, eyes open.  She
     watches Beck across the room, standing at the window.

     He stares outside into the darkness for a moment, then
     as if a thought suddenly occurs to him he looks at the
     blank computer screen.

     CLOSE ON COMPUTER SCREEN

     "Request weather summaries January 14-21."  The cursor
     blinks back ominously then races across the screen.  "FILE
     CLOSED."

                                BECK
                                (to himself)
                   Martin, you asshole...

     Suddenly he hears a voice behind him.

                                WILLIE
                   They know, don't they?

                                BECK
                                (quietly)
                   Yeah...I think they're just
                   deciding what to do with us.

                                WILLIE
                   Maybe they already have.

     She moves into Doc's seat in front of the console and calls
     up the stock market program that Bowman was monitoring
     earlier.

     ON SCREEN  WE SEE:  Stock prices.

     Willie types in a series of commands.

                                BECK
                   What are you doing?

                                WILLIE
                   Seeing how my stock's doing...

     ON SCREEN:  The words TransOcean Corp.  The capsulized report
     comes up on screen:  "TransOcean Corp. took a bath on world
     markets today when news of a tragic mining accident was
     revealed to investors.  The Board of Directors...."

                                WILLIE
                                (impatiently)
                   Where?....

     She scrolls forward in the report and suddenly freezes the
     words.

     THE SCREEN:  "...accident took place in Shack Six, Southeast
     Sector of Pacific Zone 10...Seven dead.  All bodies
     missing."  Their names follow.

     ON WILLIE  as her name comes up she shivers.

                                BECK
                   I can't believe they'd
                   just leave us.

     A voice behind them causes them to turn.

                                JONES
                   Welcome to the union, boss.
                   We're all expendable.

     He is now awake.  He sits up against the air vent.  Suddenly,
     Beck listens, the room is deathly silent.  He looks over to
     the air vent.  Jones is listening also.

                                WILLIE
                   What is it?

                                JONES
                   The air's stopped.

     WHOOP!  WHOOP!  Suddenly a KLAXON HORN sounds hysterically.
     A blue light on the console blinks on and off.  It says
     "AIR."  Beck turns to the instruments.

                                BECK
                   We're on backup air.

                                WILLIE
                   How much time does that give
                   us?

                                BECK
                   Less than an hour.  It's ruptured
                   an air duct.

                                WILLIE
                   Can't we fix it?

                                JONES
                   There're twenty miles of
                   pipe in the bilge, they
                   could have tapped-in anywhere.

     SUDDENLY WE HEAR A SOUND WE HAVEN'T HEARD IN A LONG TIME.
     The RATTLE THAT JONES AND COBB FIXED.  Jones and Beck home
     in on the tell-tale noise.

                                JONES
                                (almost to himself)
                   Cobb...Job security...

     He locks eyes with Beck.

                                BECK
                   They're drawing us out.

     He leaves his seat and Jones checks his weapon as Willie
     watches.

                                WILLIE
                   You can't go out there, that's
                   what they want.

     Beck checks his make-shift flamethrower.

                                BECK
                   We don't have much choice...
                   without air, the internal
                   pressure will fall and--

                                JONES
                   Crunch...Implosion.

     Willie watches them a moment then picks up one of the mining
     tools, the laser-drill, she powers-it up to check it.  Her
     action stops both men and she catches their looks.

                                WILLIE
                   You don't think I'm sitting
                   in here, do you?

     INT. CORRIDOR "A" - SAME

     Carefully the three move into the Lower Ring Corridor.  As
     they move we suddenly hear a new sound, DEEP, LIKE DISTANT
     THUNDER.  The sides of the shack tremble slightly.

                                WILLIE
                                (low)
                   The shack...

                                JONES
                   She's wondering what's
                   happening.  We're losing
                   air faster than I thought.

                                BECK
                                (to Jones)
                   Which way?

     Jones moves to the lead and turns down Corridor "A."

     INT. CORRIDOR "A"

     The SOUND of the power-wrench removing the bolts from the
     flooring.  The cover is removed and Beck and Jones peer down
     into the darkness.  Willie stands guard with the flame-
     thrower.

     ON JONES  He peers into the darkness below.  He wasn't a big
     fan of the bilge even before the Creature, now he's scared
     shitless.

                                BECK
                   I'll go first.

     Before Jones can protest Beck drops the ladder and climbs
     down into the dark bilge.  Jones waits till he's at the
     bottom, then starts down behind him.  Willie looks back.

                                WILLIE
                   Don't spend all day down
                   there.

                                JONES
                   Don't fuckin' worry, I
                   ain't.

     BILGE

     From somewhere in the darkness we hear the HISSING SOUND OF
     ESCAPING OXYGEN and the FAMILIAR RATTLE OF THE AIR SYSTEM.
     As soon as Jones reaches the bottom rung Beck shines a light
     into the eerie underground area.

     Pipes run overhead and on the walls.  A broken electrical
     conduit sparks over their heads.  The floor is ankle deep in
     greasy water.  They start toward the noise.

     ON WILLIE

     Her back is to the solid wall(outside wall).  Her eyes move
     from one end of the corridor to the other, not lingering
     long enough to distract her.  Sweat runs down her face and
     we hear another tremor in the Shack.

                                WILLIE
                                (to herself,
                                calming herself)
                   Okay, Williams...let's hear a
                   tune.
                                (beat, quietly
                                at first)
                   "Off we go...into the wild
                   blue yonder..."

     ANOTHER RUMBLE FROM THE SHACK causes her to pause.  She
     catches her breath and starts again.

                                WILLIE(cont'd)
                   "...flying high into the sky..."

     She suddenly looks into the Main machine area (behind the
     wire mesh of the other wall).  Was it something moving?

     BILGE

     ON BECK  He moves around a corner we recognize from before
     with Jones' and Cobb's repair.  Beck floods the area with
     light and the break in the line is visible.  The pipe has
     been torn from the wall, it is totally unreparable.  What's
     worse, electrical wires hang down, showering sparks into the
     water.

                                JONES
                   Jesus Christ...

                                BECK
                   Can you fix it?

                                JONES
                   No way...

                                BECK
                   Think!  Can we stop it?!
                   Block it up?!  Shut down
                   the line somewhere?!  Think!

                                JONES
                   I am thinking, man!  You
                   think I want to die!  I am
                   thinking!  I--

     Suddenly his eyes widen.  Beck sees this and turns.  In his
     light WE SEE THE GLINT OF LONG TEETH AND THE HUGE BLACK
     FRAME OF THE COBB/DOC CREATURE!  It's leech-like appendage
     whipping in front of it like an excited cat's tail.  Before
     it can strike, Jones pushes Beck out of the way and fires a
     blast of flame from his flamethrower.  The CREATURE SCREAMS
     and disappears.

     As Beck falls his light lands in the bilge water and goes
     out sending the bilge into greater darkness.

                                JONES
                   I hit it.  But I can't see
                   it!  Can you see it?!

                                BECK
                                (standing)
                   No.

     Jones looks back at the ruptured pipe and suddenly has a
     thought.

                                JONES
                   The Swamp.  There's an over-
                   ride switch in the Swamp.

     They start for the ladder when WWWWHHHHHHHHIP! out of the
     darkness the appendage wraps like a bullwhip around Jones'
     arm.  The deadly proboscis, which stabbed Cobb, is poised
     like a dagger about to be plunged into the black man's
     thigh.

                                JONES
                                (screams)
                   Ahhh!

     Instinctively Beck whips out the mining saw and severs the
     tentacle.  The unseen Creature's SCREAM echoes through the
     Bilge.  Beck grabs Jones by the arm and pulls him toward the
     ladder.

                                BECK
                   Hurry...Get out!

     Quickly they slosh toward the ladder and hole in the floor
     fifteen feet away, moving closer...ten...eight....then
     suddenly ANOTHER APPENDAGE thrusts between the rungs of the
     ladder at them.  Beck ducks and leaps to the side.  He is
     less than six feet from the Creature.  In the dim light WE
     SEE it wickedly bare its teeth.

     Beck's eyes go to the walls from one side to the other and
     spot the exposed power cable.  The Creature steps forward
     directly under the hole in the floor.  It is about to lunge
     when a voice from above distracts it.

                                WILLIE'S VOICE(O.C.)
                   Hey, you?

     The Creature looks up and sees:

     ON WILLIE STANDING OVER THE OPENING, HER FLAMETHROWER
     POINTED STRAIGHT DOWN.  SHE FIRES, SENDING A SEARING BLUE
     FLAME INTO THE BILGE.

     BECK watches the flame roar down on the monster and it gives
     him the moment of distraction he needs.  He leaps out of the
     bilge water and onto a pipe on the wall then rips the broken
     power cable from the wall.

                                BECK
                   Jones!  Get your feet out
                   of the water!

     Jones jumps up and grabs a pipe running overhead as Beck
     thrusts the sparking cable into the water at the Creature's
     feet.

     IN A BLINDING FLASH OF ELECTRICITY

     The current surges through the Cobb/Doc Creature sending it
     instantly rigid.  A second later it crashes forward into the
     water.

     Moving hand over hand toward the ladder Jones quickly climbs
     out, followed by Beck.

     THE SHACK CONTINUES TO SHAKE, EACH JOLT STRONGER THAN THE
     LAST.  As they emerge Willie helps them.

                                BECK
                   C'mon, the Swamp!

     They start for the Swamp down Corridor "A" when an enormous
     shudder goes through the Shack, causing the lights to blink
     and the floor to open beneath Beck.  The jolt knocks him
     back into the bilge.  Only grabbing onto the pipes just
     above the water stops him from falling back in.

     JONES stops and looks back over the missing grating.

                                JONES
                   Beck!

     Jones moves instinctively back for him, but another jolt
     only widens the gap.  Beck yells to be heard over the din of
     the collapsing Shack.

                                BECK
                   Go on!

                                JONES
                   No!

                                BECK
                   That's an order!

                                JONES
                   Fuck your orders!

     He leaps across the gap onto a remaining grating and thrusts
     his hand down into the darkness.  Beck lets go of one hand,
     then the other, to grab Jones' extended arm.  In one
     Herculean effort Jones pulls him out of the bilge.  Together
     they leap across the chasm as the Desalinization Conduit
     collapses over their heads and water floods into Corridor "A"
     behind them.  They have to go around the other way!

     AS THEY RUN

     KLAXON HORNS SOUND and a RECORDED FEMALE VOICE warns:  "Five
     minutes until implosion..."

     FLASH CUTS OF:

     THE LIGHTS FLICKER AND FAIL, CAUSING THE EMERGENCY LIGHTING
     TO GO ON, AND CASTING AN EERIE STROBE EFFECT ON THE ESCAPING
     THREE CREW MEMBERS

     FALLING CEILING BEAMS CRASH DOWN IN FRONT AND BEHIND...

     SEAMS BEND UNDER THE STRAIN, RIVETS POP...

     STRAINING MACHINES SEND SCALDING GEYSERS OF STEAM INTO THE
     CORRIDORS...AND SUDDENLY THE FLOOR GIVES WAY BENEATH WILLIE!
     She leaps up and grabs an overhanging pipe and swings to the
     firm ground.

     JONES LEADS THE WAY TOWARD THE SWAMP, WITH WILLIE BEHIND
     HIM, AND BECK COVERING THE REAR.

     THEY reach the end of the corridor and Willie and Jones turn
     into the Swamp Annex.  Willie hits the door opener.  RRRRRR
     IT DOESN'T BUDGE.  The pressure has bent the door frame.

     BECK ARRIVES

                                WILLIE
                   It's jammed!

     Immediately Beck backtracks to the corridor and pulls a hand
     held spreader--like a "Jaws of Life"--from the wall.  He
     turns back to the Swamp when a BLACK SCALY ARM SUDDENLY
     BURSTS THROUGH THE WIRE MESH OF THE MACHINE FLOOR AND PULLS
     BECK AGAINST THE WIRE!  IT IS THE DEJESUS CREATURE.

     His head held in place by the powerful arm, Beck looks
     almost directly into the dark eyes of the Creature.  Its
     gill-like slits flare.  Its mouth opens and we see a flash
     of its razor sharp teeth.

     Before Beck can move the leech-like appendage ruptures the
     steel mesh and its razor-sharp proboscis plunges like a
     knife for Beck's face.  At the last instant Beck move his
     head and the proboscis slams into the steel mesh.  The mesh
     loosens the creature's grip and Beck manages to reach a
     mining drill from the tools on the wall.  As the appendage
     starts to strike again Beck buries the whining tool into the
     Creature's tentacle and breaks free.

     Scooping up the spreader Beck rushes to the Swamp door where
     Jones and Willie are trying vainly to hand crank the door
     open.

                                JONES
                   Where the hell've you been?

                                BECK
                   I got hung up!  Try this!

     Willie stands back and Beck thrusts the Spreader into the
     tiny crack in the door the hand crank had made.  With Jones'
     help the two men force open the door and all three rush
     inside the SWAMP.  Beck closes the door behind them.

     THE RECORDED FEMALE VOICE INTONES:  "Five minutes to
     implosion."  And we feel it happening:

     THE BILGE WATER ON THE FLOOR OF THE SWAMP RIPPLES WITH THE
     VIBRATIONS

     THE WALLS SHAKE

     THE HUGE METAL SUITS ROCK LIKE CLOTHES ON A CLOTHES LINE.
     ONE FALLS AND CRASHES INTO THE WATER

     JONES throws open the control panel and grabs the red
     handled emergency air switch, but he can only move it half
     way!  It is jammed by the pressure.

                                JONES
                   It won't go!

     Willie grabs it with him, but even together it is not
     enough.  THE HANDLE BREAKS OFF IN THEIR HANDS!

     STEAM JETS WHIP DOWN ON THEM FROM ABOVE!

     THE WATER AT THEIR FEET NOW BOILS FROM VIBRATION!

     THE FEMALE VOICE INTONES:  "Four minutes..."

     BECK TURNS AND SEES THE SUITS IN THE LOCK

     He grabs Willie and pushes her toward the Lock where her
     suit hangs.

                                BECK
                   The suits!  Get in them!

     Willie moves quickly but Jones doesn't.

                                JONES
                   The suits!  Are you crazy!
                   How're we going to get to
                   the surface?

     Beck yanks open the equipment locker revealing TANKS OF
     COMPRESSED AIR AND DEFLATED CONTAINER TRANSPORTERS.

                                BECK
                   Like this.

     He looks up at Jones who grins with renewed hope and they
     begin pulling the equipment out.

                                BECK(cont'd)
                   Get them in the Lock!

     Jones and Beck drag the tanks and the parachute-like
     Container transporters to the lock.

     ON WILLIE  She climbs into her suit and activates her
     generator.  Instantly her Vital Signs spring to life around
     the perimeter of her helmet.

     THE FEMALE VOICE TREMBLES FROM THE VIBRATIONS..."Three
     minutes...to...implosion..."

     Beck and Jones throw the last of the supplies onto the
     elevator and Beck holds out the SEISMIC TOOL Jones tried to
     arm himself with earlier.  He takes the tool from Beck and
     sticks it in the vest of his wet suit.

     Then suddenly he sees that there are only two suits in the
     Lock.  Beck will have to wait on his to move along the track
     to the Lock.

                                JONES
                   Your suit, Becky!

                                BECK
                   Just get in yours!

     Jones climbs onto the Lock platform and slides into his
     suit.

     Beck hits the Suit track button and his suit begins moving
     along the track toward the Lock.  A suit turns the corner
     from the storage room followed by one labeled BECK.

     Beck looks at the walls, they're shaking harder.  He moves
     along the suit rack when suddenly THE CREATURE BURSTS FROM
     BEHIND THE SUITS SHATTERING THEM LIKE AN EXPLOSION!  A HUGE
     TENTACLE HURLS TOWARD BECK LIKE A SPEAR.

     BECK ducks just in time, grabbing a fire ax and chopping off
     the appendage.  Another tentacle jabs for Beck.

                                WILLIE
                                (screams)
                   Look out!

     But it is too late.  It knocks the ax from Beck's hand and
     sends him to the floor.  Beck looks up at the Lock in time to
     see Jones seal himself into his suit.

                                JONES/RADIO
                   I'm in.

                                BECK
                                (to the others)
                   Go!

                                WILLIE/RADIO
                   No!

     THE CREATURE APPROACHES BECK

     Beck looks at the others one last time.

                                BECK
                   Go, now!  That's an order!

     Jones hits the elevator button and the Lock closes as the
     elevator sends them down without Beck.

     BECK stands and arms himself with a mining drill, which he
     swings at the Creature driving it back.  As Beck gets the
     upper hand, the Creature turns its hideous face and Beck
     freezes.  There attached to the back of the Creature's head
     is the grotesque face of DeJesus!

     DeJesus' eyes suddenly blink.  He's still alive!  His lips
     tremble in agony.

                                DEJESUS
                   Kill me...Kill me!

     Beck, momentarily stopped by the face, lunges forward with
     the drill and embeds it in the side of the Creature.

     As the Creature falls back hurt, Beck looks up at the lock
     elevator as it returns--IT IS EMPTY--The others have made it
     out!  His suit continues down the track and stops in the
     Lock.  He still has to make it, if he can just get there!

     THE RECORDED FEMALE VOICE SOUNDS:  "One minute to
     implosion..."

     Beck races to the Lock and starts to climb into the suit.
     His arms slide into place, his legs drop into the heavy
     metal shell and as he seals up the back he activates the
     generator.

     BECK'S POV.  His vital signs light up around the perimeter
     of his helmet, but he sees something else--the Creature
     charges toward the Lock--its arm reaches out to yank Beck
     out of the elevator!  Instinctively, Beck swings his
     motorized leg into the Creature's snarling mouth, knocking
     it backwards and stunning it long enough for Beck to hit the
     elevator button.  BUT IT DOESN'T WORK!

                                BECK
                   No!

     He hits again, still nothing!

     THE RECORDED FEMALE VOICE..."Nineteen, eighteen..."  Her
     voice begins to quiver.

     BECK POUNDS ON THE BUTTON AND LOOKS UP JUST AS THE CREATURE
     DIVES FOR HIM, ITS HUGE SCALY HAND GRABBING HIM AROUND
     BECK'S LEG!

     CLOSE ON THE ELVATOR BUTTON  Beck pounds it one last time
     and NNNNNNNNNNNN!

     THE LOCK CLOSES, CRUSHING THE CREATURE AS IT FLUSHES BECK
     OUTSIDE SECONDS BEFORE THE ENTIRE STRUCTURE COLLAPSES WITH
     IMPLOSION AND SUDDENLY EXPLODES IN A HUGE SHUDDER OF ENERGY!

     UNDERWATER - LATER

     WHOOSH!  A parachute-like Container Transporter zoom toward
     the surface.  A heavy-suited crew member flashes past us.
     Its helmet light pierces the darkness, then disappears.  A
     moment later another Transporter follows, racing out of the
     darkness after the first.

     BECK'S POV  We see the vital signs lit in a ring around his
     helmet.  The depth gauge races past with blinding speed as
     he moves closer to the surface.

     WILLIE'S POV  She tilts her head upwards.  She snaps off her
     light and sees instead of black, a lighter gray, then
     suddenly faint traces of light in the water above her.  At
     first it seems like her eyes are playing tricks on her, then
     we see it again--a glimmer of light.

                                WILLIE(RADIO)
                   Light.  Beck, I see light!

     ON BECK

     He follows her look.  Light is coming fast, brightening as
     they rise.  The LED numbers inside their helmets click
     off..."125, 100, 75..."

                                BECK(RADIO)
                   Wait till you reach thirty-
                   five before you blow your suit...

                                WILLIE'S VOICE(RADIO)
                   Roger.

     WILLIE'S POV  Her numbers count down "....70, 60, 50, 40..."

                                WILLIE(RADIO)
                   Ejecting.

     She yanks at the handle on the chest plate and WHOOSH!  The
     plate bursts open and reveals a second interior handle.  Her
     hand gropes for it.

     SUNLIGHT IS STREAMING DOWN THROUGH THE WATER AS SHE RUSHES
     UPWARD.

     WHOOSH!  The helmet and torso of the suit are blown open as
     she pulls the second lever detaching her from the balloons.

     No longer oxygen supported or being pulled upward, Willie
     frees herself from the heavy suit and swims to the surface.

     SUDDENLY SHE BREAKS THE SURFACE AND CATCHES A GLIMPSE OF THE
     SUN, DAZZLING THROUGH A MILLION DROPLETS OF WATER AS A HUGE
     SWELL CARRIES HER UP EVEN HIGHER.

     Then she's underwater again, struggling desperately to pull
     the tab on the life jacket around her neck.  Suddenly a MALE
     HAND GRABS THE TAB FOR HER AND PULLS.  She looks up at Beck.

                                WILLIE
                   We made it!

                                BECK
                   Where's Jones?

     Holding onto each other Willie and Beck ride a swell.  At
     the crest WE SEE JONES in the trough below, face down.  Beck
     breaks away from Willie and swims through the waves to reach
     Jones.  Reaching him Beck pulls his face out of the water
     and inflates his life jacket.

                                WILLIE
                   Is he okay?

     Beck lays Jones head back against the life jacket.  For a
     moment.  Jones seems lifeless, then his eyes blink and squint
     against the sunlight.  Beck turns back to Willie and as he
     and Jones ride the next crest he gives her the "thumbs-up."

                                WILLIE(cont'd)
                                (jubilant)
                   The sun!  The sun!

     Jones looks at Beck and grins.

                                JONES
                   What happened to that typhoon?

     CALM SEA - LATER

     BECK, WILLIE AND JONES cling to each other as they search
     the horizon.

                                WILLIE
                   Are you sure you saw something?

                                JONES
                   How many times I got to tell
                   you.  I saw a ship.

                                WILLIE
                   Well, why haven't they answered
                   our flares?

                                BECK
                   We'll fire one more, that
                   leaves us one last one.

     BECK pulls the flare off his latex wet suit and fires it
     into the sky casting a comforting yellow glow over the dark
     water.  The light fades, Willie looks at Jones.

                                WILLIE
                   Are you okay, Jonesy?

                                JONES
                                (weakly)
                   Tip top, Willie...tip top.

                                WILLIE
                                (testing him)
                   Who's the best power forward
                   in the NBA...Jameson?

                                JONES
                                (tired, but
                                with fight)
                   Jameson?  Who are you trying
                   to con...?

     They both manage a weak laugh, then Beck sees something.

                                BECK
                   I'll be damned.  Look!...A flare!

     As a small swell lifts them up we can see a tiny flare just
     fading against the sky.

                                WILLIE
                   It saw us!

                                JONES
                   Answer them and quit kicking me!

                                WILLIE
                   I'm not touching you!

     WHOOOOOOOOSH!  Beck fires another flare into the sky.  As the
     flare arcs downward, Willie feels another bump and for the
     first time sees the SHARKS CIRCLING THEM.

                                WILLIE
                   No...no, no, no.

     The SHARKS tighten the circle as the flare fades.

     EXT. U.S. COASTGUARD SHIP'S BRIDGE - SAME

     A CAPTAIN watches the flare fade through his binoculars and
     speaks to someone O.S.

                                CAPTAIN
                   I thought you said you'd
                   combed this area?

     He lowers his binoculars AS WE WIDEN TO REVEAL MARTIN
     standing on the bridge.  He also lowers his binoculars and
     smiles coolly as he lies.

                                MARTIN
                   We did....Many times.

                                CAPTAIN
                                (looks at Martin
                                then to a Lieutenant)
                   Initiate rescue.

     We hold on Martin's face as from

     THE FORE DECK OF THE SHIP

     A rescue chopper with pontoons lifts off the deck and banks
     off toward the fading flare.

     OCEAN - SAME

     Jones, Willie and Beck stay bunched close together.
     Suddenly Willie feels another bump.

                                WILLIE
                                (panicky)
                   It hit me!  Where are they?!

                                BECK
                   I can't see them!

     Suddenly he is bumped by a shark.  Willie sees one only two
     feet away.  They are surrounded.  Suddenly Jones stare to
     taunt the sharks aggressively.

                                JONES
                   All right!  I've had enough
                   of this shit!  You want meat,
                   motherfucker?  Come on, eat
                   me, sucker, try some dark meat!

     He pushes away from the group despite Beck's attempt to stop
     him.

                                JONES(cont'd)
                                (taunting sharks)
                   What's wrong you snout-nosed
                   bastards?  My meat too tough
                   for you?!

     Amazingly the sharks begin to disappear.  Willie and Beck
     watch stunned.  Even Jones is surprised.

                                JONES(cont'd)
                                (to Willie and Beck)
                   Whoa!  Did you see those fools
                   run?  They know whose boss.

     He jabs his arm upward in triumph and for the first time WE
     SEE a gash across his forearm.

     UNDERWATER POV

     As Jones crows triumphantly, WE SUDDENLY SEE HIS WET SUIT
     RIPPING ALONG HIS THIGHS!

     SURFACE/OCEAN

     Jones is chortling, suddenly his smile vanishes, something
     is happening...

     WE hear the DRONE OF THE APPROACHING HELICOPTER...THUMP,
     THUMP, THUMP...The blades of the helicopter sound out over
     the waves.  It's lights are visible.  Willie and Beck wave
     frantically as Jones drifts closer to them!

     UNDERWATER

     JONES' LEGS  His wet suit is now completely split open and
     WE SEE THE BLACK SCALES SPREADING!

     THE HELICOPTER

     hovers over the group below and lands on the water.  Its
     blades beat the surface into waves.  The WINCH OPERATOR
     hurls out a rescue harness and Beck helps Willie into the
     ring.  He CLICKS the fastener and suddenly they both lock
     eyes.  Before Willie can say anything Beck falls back and
     signals the Winch operator who begins hauling her to safety.
     Immediately Beck locks back at Jones and extends his arm.

                                BECK
                   Jonesy...Give me your hand!

     WILLIE reaches the helicopter and quickly climbs out of the
     harness.  The Winch operator throws it back across the water
     where

     BECK grabs the harness.

                                BECK
                   C'mon, Jones!

     Jones reaches out his hand.  He is almost there WHEN
     SUDDENLY RISING OUT OF THE WATER BEHIND THEM IS THE
     SIXPACK/BOWMAN CREATURE IN ALL ITS HIDEOUS GLORY!  HUGE AND
     GRUESOME, ITS LONG TEETH GLIMMER IN THE LIGHT.  IT GOES FOR
     BECK BUT JONES MOVES BETWEEN THEM.

                                BECK
                   Jonesy, No!

                                JONES
                   Get out of here, Becky!

     The Creature grabs Jones and pulls him violently under.
     Beck watches horrified as his friend disappears.  Numbed he
     clips the rescue harness around him when suddenly, WE SEE a
     boiling of water where Jones disappeared...bubbles
     rising...and then Jones' bloody and tattered life vest bobs
     to the surface several feet away from Beck.

     Beck reaches out for it just as the Creature appears again!
     It turns and focuses on Beck.  Beck keeps going for the life
     vest as the Creature starts for him.

     ON HELICOPTER

     The Winch operator and Willie watch in horror as the
     Creature bears down on Beck.

                                WINCH OPERATOR
                   Is he in the harness!

     CLOSE ON JONES' TATTERED VEST  Beck reaches it.  His fingers
     wrap around the bicycle pump-like, seismic tool in Jones'
     vest pocket.  The Creature is right on top of him!

     CHUNK, CHUNK, Beck cocks it like a pump shotgun as tentacles
     rise wickedly out of the water and wrap around Beck's body
     in a death grip.  It's horrible mouth starts to open.

                                BECK
                   C'mon, motherfucker open up!

     The Creature's mouth widens and as it starts to strike Beck
     thrusts the seismic tool into its gaping maw and is suddenly
     pulled from behind--out of the creature's grasp!  The rescue
     cable is taut!  The helicopter is taking off!

     BECK'S POV/ RISING SHOT.  Beck rises suddenly out of the
     water, the Creature growing instantly smaller below him
     until BOOM! the Seismic device explodes in the
     Sixpack/Bowman Creature, blowing it to bits across the ocean
     surface!  The shock wave sends the helicopter banking off
     toward the ship with Beck safely attached by cable below it.
     The winch operator pulls him in.

     EXT. COAST GUARD SHIP - LATER

     Beck, dressed now in crisp white clothes, stands on deck of
     the ship.  He glances occasionally at a door nearby marked
     INFIRMARY, then looks up as the Captain approaches and
     shakes his hand.

                                CAPTAIN
                   Mr. Beck, I understand
                   you passed your physical with
                   flying colors.  And Ms. Williams?

                                BECK
                                (worried)
                   I don't know yet, she's still
                   in there.

                                CAPTAIN
                   Well, you'll be glad to know
                   you have a friend onboard.

     Beck looks up surprised as suddenly Martin joins them.

                                MARTIN
                                (excitedly)
                   Beck!  I told them you'd
                   make it.  No one back at
                   TransOcean believed me, but
                   I never gave up on you once.
                                (smiling)
                   So, how are you feeling?

     Beck looks at Martin for an instant then hauls off and in
     one incredibly smooth punch knocks Martin on his can across
     the deck.

                                BECK
                   Better...A lot better.

     Just then the door to the infirmary opens and Willie appears
     with a new outfit on.  Smiles at Beck.

                                WILLIE
                   I'm fine!

     Beck lets out a slight sigh of relief as a STEWARD
     approaches with a tray of WHOLE COOKED FISH, HIDEOUS LOOKING
     THINGS LIKE ANGLERS, LOBSTERS, CRABS...MINIATURE LEVIATHAN.
     The sight is almost too intense for Beck and Willie.  The
     Captain notices.

                                CAPTAIN
                   I thought we might have some
                   wonderful seafood.  But, if there's
                   something else you'd rather have...

     Willie stares at the tray of seafood uneasily then looks at
     the Captain and smiles.

                                WILLIE
                   How about a burger and fries?

     She and Beck laugh as they sit at a finely set table on the
     deck with the Captain.

     AS WE PULL BACK the ship becomes smaller and smaller in the
     distance and WE ARE AT THE

     SURFACE OF THE OCEAN

     riding the swells, rising and falling before slipping
     beneath the waves and descending again into the cold
     depths.

     FACE IN ON

     THE SURFACE OF THE OCEAN

     sunny and placid then slowly WE BEGIN DESCENDING UNDERWATER

     Moving down from the bright surface waters, through layers
     of fish and marine life...

     A school of vibrantly colored fish move with the current,
     their numbers are enormous, their movements in unison.
     Suddenly out of the darkness a barracuda cuts through the
     school, taking out four or five before disappearing into the
     shadows.  The school moves on as if nothing happened,
     quickly closing ranks where the missing ones swam only
     seconds before.

     WE MOVE DEEPER AND DEEPER

     Fish disappear, darkness envelopes us.  Cold and lifeless
     where light has never penetrated...Five thousand feet, ten
     thousand.  Deeper, where only strange, self-illuminating
     echoniderms move eerily through the currents.  Then suddenly
     WE HEAR STATIC from RADIO TRANSMISSION.  THEN VOICES...

                                JONES
                   Burritos...Enchiladas...

                                DEJESUS
                                (hispanic voice)
                   Oh, gag, man, how can you eat that
                   stuff?...

                                BOWMAN
                                (female)
                   I can't wait for fresh vegetables...

     Several voices suddenly break into argument..."vegetables?"
     "shit," "burgers"...Suddenly another voice rises above the
     others.

                                BECK'S VOICE/ RADIO
                   Okay, cut the chatter.  You're
                   not out of here, yet.  Who's the
                   hook?  Seven?...You got a hook on
                   container 22?

     A pause, then more voices.

                                SIXPACK'S VOICE/ RADIO
                                (redneck drawl)
                   The man's asking if you're hooked
                   on 22, you dumb shit.

                                JONES' VOICE/ RADIO
                   Watch your mouth, Sixpack.  Hello,
                   Shack, Seven, here.  I ain't the hook,
                   over.

     A light flares out of the darkness, suddenly illuminating an
     IMMENSE SHAPE--fifteen hundred pounds of hardened metal
     nearly seven feet tall.  It is a motorized diving suit and
     we see the stenciled name, WILLIE across the front
     breastplate.  As it pivots we see the stationary worklights
     around the base of a large underwater mining operation, THE
     SHACK.  Then a woman's voice.

                                WILLIE'S VOICE
                                (woman's voice)
                   Six to Shack.  I'm the hook.

     INSIDE THE SHACK/ CONTROL ROOM

     littered with papers, half-full coffee cups, and a confusion
     of wires and very low-tech, high-tech equipment BECK sits at
     the monitor controls.  He is younger than we expected,
     twenties, clean cut good looks.  He'll be a hell of a good-
     looking man at thirty-five, he just needs to be hardened.
     From the looks of the coffee cups around him he's on his
     way.

                                BECK'S VOICE/ RADIO
                   Okay, Six, let's wrap this container
                   and call it a day.

     Above him a bank of monitor screens.  Each one labeled with
     a crew member's name and providing a video picture from a
     camera mounted on their helmet.  Beck reaches above him and
     throws a console switch which activates another monitor
     labeled ROV.  With a joystick he manipulates an outside
     camera(the ROV), its picture we see on the monitor.  It is
     moving.

     UNDERWATER

     WILLIE'S POV  The inside of her helmet is a grid of LED
     gauges monitoring air reserve, body temperature,
     atmospheres, heart rate, blood pressure.

     She stops next to a pair of railroad-like tracks and removes
     the tool attached to the end of her arm.  The move is
     practiced and professional, like a cook changing the tool on
     a set of egg beaters.  First, she inserts the existing tool
     into a lock on her opposite arm which holds it while she
     disengages the tool.  Next, she selects the next tool from
     the storage compartment at her waist and punches it into
     position.  Sixpack's voice comes over the radio.

                                SIXPACK'S VOICE
                   Hey, Willie, you trip on a
                   tit or something?  We're all
                   waiting on you, honey.

                                WILLIE
                                (under control)
                   Keep your pants on Sixpack.
                   I promise you'll be inside before
                   "Mr. Rogers' Neighborhood" comes on.

     OVER THE RADIO WE HEAR other men's voices laughing.  They
     like Willie and cheer her on.  "Tell him, Willie," "Atta
     girl," etc...

     Willie CLICKS in her last tool and turns.  Expertly she
     hooks a large dumpster-like container, the container to what
     looks like an underwater parachute--A CONTAINER
     TRANSPORTER--which when filled with oxygen it lifts the
     massive container onto the tracks where it can be hauled-in
     by a winch.

                                WILLIE'S VOICE
                   Six to Shack...Hook's on.  Ready
                   to winch.

     UNDERWATER MACHINERY

     Halogen lights illuminate bits and pieces of dredges and
     dumpsters squatting in the gloom.  A winch begins grinding
     and the big, newly hooked container lurches down the tracks.
     It comes to the end where a winch fits it into place with
     several others to complete a set.  We hear BECK'S VOICE.

                                BECK/ RADIO
                   Ok, that's it.  Come on in.

     More motor suited DIVERS appear, their helmet lights
     glaring.  Their breastplate names catch in the dim lights:
     COBS, BOWMAN, WILLIE.

     As they approach the UNDERWATER LOCK, where an elevator will
     transport them up into the Shack, we see signs of human
     life:  a basketball goal attached to the side of the
     building; stickers and signs:  "No Bozos," etc.  A formal sign
     towers over the entrance.  It says: TRANSOCEAN CORP. SHACK 6.

     ON ONE OF THE CREW

     He moves behind the others.  Suddenly he freezes in his
     tracks and slowly rotates his helmet--on his shoulder in the
     glare of his helmet beam WE SEE the a hideous looking SEA
     SPIDER.  It's thick legs moving eerily down his arm.

     Carefully, so as not to disturb the creature, a mechanical
     motor hand moves into position below it, and in one quick
     movement, snares it.

     CLOSE ON METAL WAIST POCKET.  The latch opens and the
     writhing sea spider is shoved inside.  From the pocket WE
     MOVE UP the diver's suit until we see the name SIXPACK on
     the breastplate.  He looks around to see if anyone has
     noticed then continues on toward the shack.

     ON TWO DIVERS(JONES AND DEJESUS)

     They walk together to the Shack.  A Latino VOICE, DEJESUS,
     comes over the radio singing an old Miller Beer jingle in an
     exaggerated accent.

                                DEJESUS
                   When it's time to relax....
                   One thing stands clear...

     INSIDE ON BECK

     As he listens to the singing over the tinny speaker, we see
     he aches to be a part of their comaraderie, but is alienated
     by age and rank.  He is the shack boss, management.  He
     listens as a BOOMING BLACK VOICE joins in off-key.

                                JONES' VOICE(O.C.)
                   Mil-ler's tastes too good to
                   hurry through...

     As the singing continues, Beck looks over at an empty chair
     in front of a bank of equipment monitors.  The vital signs
     of each miner and his equipment are registered on this
     console.  The chair in front of them sits conspicuously
     empty.  This doesn't please Beck, neither does a hand
     written sign under the console which states:  THE DOCTOR IS
     OUT.

     DEJESUS' POV

     Inside his helmet we see the grid of LED gauges monitoring
     vital signs.

                                DEJESUS
                   ...beer after beer...

     Suddenly a red warning light begins blinking in the bottom
     corner inside DeJesus' helmet.  The words to the song freeze
     in his mouth.  His voice becomes edged with panic.

                                DEJESUS(cont'd)
                   Oh, shit...

                                JONES/ RADIO
                                (to DeJesus)
                   Hey, Hazy, I'm not that bad, man.

                                DEJESUS
                                (rising terror)
                   Jonesy!  I'm losing compression...
                   I'm going to blow my suit, man!
                   Beck!  Doc!  Help me!...

     INSIDE

     Beck grabs his microphone.  He tries to remain calm but
     there is a definite tremble in his voice.

                                BECK
                   Give me a readout, DeJesus.

                                DEJESUS(ON RADIO)
                                (gripped with panic)
                   Ahhhh!

     OUTSIDE

     The other divers move quickly to DeJesus.

                                BECK (ON RADIO)
                   DeJesus!  A readout!

                                JONES
                   He don't need a readout,
                   man, he needs help!

                                BECK(RADIO)
                                (anything but calm)
                   Stay calm!

                                BOWMAN
                   Calm!?  Where's Doc?

     INSIDE

     Beck stands in front of the equipment monitors, lost.

                                BECK
                                (trying to
                                keep control)
                   The internal monitors read
                   normal.

     ON THE MINERS, PANICKED

                                COBB
                   Where's Doc?!

                                BECK(RADIO)
                   He's not at his station.

                                DEJESUS
                                (panicked)
                   Oh, mother of Jesus, forgive
                   me of my--

                                BECK'S VOICE
                                (making a decision)
                   Get him into the Shack.

     DeJesus' gauges begins a countdown to implosion.  "15, 14,
     13..."  DeJesus is grabbed by his co-workers and hurried the
     last few yards to the SHACK.

     INSIDE/SHACK - SAME

     ON BECK  sweating bullets, turns a dial on the instruments
     and suddenly, DeJesus' gauges jump to life.  We see the same
     countdown in progress on the Shack's gauges!..10, 9, 8...

     OUTSIDE

     ON DEJESUS  He is forced into the LOCK, the underwater
     elevator room is eerily lit.  His readout continues inside
     his helmet...5, 4, 3...DeJesus screams.

     ON BECK

     DeJesus' scream comes over his radio in the control room.
     Beck hits the elevator switch--nothing happens.  He hits it
     again harder and suddenly DeJesus voice is drowned out by
     the SCREAMING VACUUM PUMPS of the elevator.  It's moving!
     Beck looks up at the monitor of the interior Lift Lock.

     INSIDE/LIFT LOCK

     WE SEE DeJESUS'S SUIT dripping wet.  It stands inside the
     Lift Lock, ankle deep in greasy bilge water.

     CLOSE ON HIS EYES, for a moment they remain closed, then
     suddenly they flutter.  He's alive!

     THE MESS - LATER

     The blackboard prominently displayed on the wall of the Mess
     features neatly stenciled letters that say:  "DAYS TILL
     PICKUP".  The number scrawled on the chalk-smudged board
     obviously changes daily.  Right now, it's a "3"...

     A CLUNK, CLUNK and a Coke can rolls out of a compact COKE
     MACHINE.  A big, sandy-haired man, SIXPACK, takes the soft
     drink, pops the top and downs it in one long pull while he
     looks over an arguing group of deep sea miners:  JONES,
     Black, athletic, 30's;  COBB, 50's, a career miner with a
     mouthful of gum;  BOWMAN, 35, attractive, hardened woman, she
     has seen more of the world than any of them;  WILLIE,
     twenties, fresh good looks, master electrician, optimist.
     DEJESUS, Latino, wiry muscles, he keeps his head down, still
     shaken from his experience.

     The strain of a month of working two miles beneath the
     ocean's surface has drawn nerves tight.

                                BOWMAN
                   I'm telling you, it's the suits!

                                JONES
                   Fuck the suits, it's the people
                   monitoring them.  It Doc had been
                   there like he's supposed to it never
                   would've happened!

                                SIXPACK
                   And just what the fuck would he
                   have done to stop it, huh?

     Sixpack looks over the group, then suddenly crushes the
     empty Coke can in his hand, punctuating the action with a
     huge belch.

                                SIXPACK(cont'd)
                   That would have been you, DeJesus...

     DeJesus keeps his head down.

                                SIXPACK(cont'd)
                   Yeah...I was standing next to a guy
                   who blew a suit once in the
                   Indian Ocean...little tiny hole
                   in the fucking toe of his suit
                   ...ocean came in and the
                   pressure crammed his whole
                   fucking body up into his helmet.
                   They just buried his helmet.

                                DEJESUS
                                (coldly)
                   I know all about implosion, man.

                                SIXPACK
                   Yeah, I bet you do.
                                (laughs)
                   I bet you were imploding in
                   your pants.
                                (laughs then imitates
                                a hysterical DeJesus)
                   Jonesy!  Doc!...Help me!  Help me!

     DeJesus springs for Sixpack's throat AS WE CUT TO

     BECK - SAME

     Beck's eyes are blazing with cold authority as he speaks.

                                BECK
                   Knock it off, Sixpack!  I know
                   it's been a long month for every-
                   one, but we can't let something
                   like this tear us apart...

     Beck glares, ready for an argument, but as WE PULL BACK we
     see he's talking to the mirror, in his tiny quarters.

     Apparently he fails to convince himself because his hard
     look fades and he mutters unhappily as he turns away.

                                BECK
                   Shit...

     He turns around to face a smiling picture of himself at
     college graduation with his Eastern establishment looking
     father.  Leadership "how-to" books like The One Minute
     Manager, etc. line his bookshelf with technical manuals on
     underwater mining.

     He opens his door to leave when SUDDENLY A LOUD METALLIC
     GROANING NOISE stops him cold.  The entire Shack seems
     shifting, like a giant waking from a nap.

     MESS

     The NOISE stops the fight between DeJesus and Sixpack cold.
     All eyes go to the ceiling and walls.

                                JONES
                   Fuck the suits man...this
                   place is going to kill us first.

     Just as suddenly as it began the GROANING NOISE STOPS and in
     its place WE HEAR an intermittent RATTLE in the air system.
     Only Cobb seems undisturbed by this sound.

                                DEJESUS
                                (listening)
                   There it is again...
                                (sitting down again)
                   Two more days.  I tell myself
                   'you can make it two more days--'

                                BOWMAN
                   What's the weather like up top?

                                WILLIE
                   Clear for pickup.

                                JONES
                   Let's hope it holds.

     Cobb looks up disgustingly.

                                COBB
                   Then what?  Huh?
                                (to everyone)
                   Then what?  You folks think
                   going up top's the answer to
                   all your problems.  Well, it ain't.

                                BOWMAN
                   Give us a break, Cobb...

                                COBB
                   A break?  You folks don't need a break,
                   you need psychiatrists.  'Know what
                   you'd be doing if you were up there,
                   right now?

                                SIXPACK
                                (a boorish leer)
                   Eating pussy and drinking brew...

                                COBB
                   Eating pussy my ass.  What about
                   lines at the bank:  What about
                   getting stuck in traffic?

                                SIXPACK
                                (grinning)
                   Wherever I can find it.

     Everyone laughs but Cobb, WE SEE he's serious.

                                COBB
                   Bullshit!  I'll tell you
                   what you'd be doing!  You'd
                   be watching news on TV
                   that's so fucking bad it
                   makes you nauseous.  So you
                   go out and get in your car
                   to get some fresh air and
                   after you've been driving for
                   five minutes you realize the
                   air's so damn dirty you don't dare
                   breath it!  That's what you've
                   got to look forward to...

     LOWER RING CORRIDOR

     Beck approaches the Mess and as he nears it we hear Cobb
     ranting inside.

                                COBB'S VOICE(O.S.)
                   ...And if you're lucky
                   enough to make it back home
                   to your house that looks the
                   fucking same as everyone else's,
                   you'll find your wife's just as
                   fat as she was when you left and
                   the only reason your kids ain't
                   strung out on the drugs they were
                   using when you left is that
                   they've found some new drugs
                   which fuck 'em up even more!...
                   You people just don't appreciate
                   how good you've got down here...

     BECK hesitates at the door to the Mess, as though screwing
     up his courage, then takes a deep breath and enters as we

                                                        CUT TO

     INSIDE THE MESS

     Everyone looks up as Beck enters and the room goes quiet.
     Beck notices Doc's empty chair.

                                BECK
                   Doc eat already?

                                JONES
                   The good doctor hasn't showed yet.

     Looks are exchanged.  Sixpack smirks knowingly.

                                BECK
                                (to DeJesus)
                   How do you feel, DeJesus?

                                DEJESUS
                                (obviously embarrassed
                                to be singled out)
                   Okay.

                                BECK
                   Better let the Doc take a
                   look at you, after dinner.

                                SIXPACK
                   Yeah, since he was busy earlier
                   when you needed him.

     He cracks up and Beck turns on him.

                                BECK
                   Cut it, Sixpack.

     Sixpack shuts up, but Beck notices the others feel the
     seriousness of Doc's absence during the emergency.

                                BECK(cont'd)
                   Leave the Doc to me.  I'm
                   going to talk to him.

                                SIXPACK
                                (sarcastically, under his
                                breath to Bowman)
                   'Makes me feel better already...

     Beck gets his tray but it is clear he is thinking about
     something else.  He clears his throat.

                                 BECK
                   I've been looking at the duty
                   roster...at the shack hours
                   outstanding...

                                 JONES
                   Uh, oh...I see where this
                   is going...

                                 BECK
                                 (ignoring Jones)
                   ...all of you owe time and I
                   thought tonight would be a good
                   time to---

                                 COBB
                                 (erupting)
                   No way, Mister Beck!  No
                   fucking way!  We just did a
                   full shift, you can't call
                   Shack duty on top of a full
                   shift.  It's a contract violation!

                                 JONES
                   Whooo!  Right on, Cobb!  Let's
                   hear it for our shop Steward!

                                 SIXPACK
                   Hear that Becky, er, Mr. Beck?
                   Company got to abide by the rules.

     FIVE FACES STARE AT BECK.  THEY'RE LOOKING FOR WEAKNESS.
     THIS IS A CHALLENGE TO HIS AUTHORITY.

                                BECK
                   I know all about the contract.
                   The point is you can follow the
                   goddamn contract to the letter and pull
                   your shack duty tomorrow...or you
                   can get it done tonight and call
                   tomorrow a down day.  It's up to you.

     This leaves the group momentarily speechless.  Even DeJesus
     comes out of his stupor.

                                DEJESUS
                   You giving us a day off?

     Beck nods.  Cobb eyes him suspiciously.

                                COBB
                   What about our quota?

                                BECK
                   You're only twenty-five
                   tons off quota.  Barring an
                   unforeseen problem you should
                   reach it easily on the last day.
                                (he looks at the group)
                   It's just a day off.  You don't
                   have to take it, I just thought it
                   might help.

     The others look around for agreement but Jones doesn't need
     anyone else's approval, he's already made up his mind.

                                JONES
                   Count me in.

     Bowman nods her head also and the others unanimously agree.
     Buoyed, Beck moves ahead, businesslike...

                                BECK
                   Cobb, Jones, I want you to do
                   something about that damn rattle
                   in the air system...
                                (to Bowman and Sixpack)
                   Bowman and Sixpack...living quarters...

                                SIXPACK
                                (disgustedly)
                   Shit...

                                BECK
                   Williams...get DeJesus' suit on
                   the "sick rack" and do a diagnostics.
                                (to group)
                   Any other suit problems she should
                   know about?

     Sixpack suddenly looks up as the group disperses.

                                SIXPACK
                                (to Willie)
                   My pocket.  Check my pocket,
                   will ya, honey?

                                WILLIE
                                (annoyed)
                   Your pocket?

                                SIXPACK
                   The latch is screwed up.  Or
                   the hinge.

                                WILLIE
                                (disgusted)
                   Right.

     LOWER RING CORRIDOR - SAME

     ON BECK  He starts out of the Mess and by chance finds
     himself walking with Willie.  Beck is obviously
     uncomfortable with the crew, even after 28 days together.
     She smiles, friendly, at ease.

                                WILLIE
                   You did good...

                                BECK
                                (a little surprised)
                   What?

                                WILLIE
                   Today...with DeJesus.  That
                   was smart thinking to get him
                   inside...

                                BECK
                   There probably wasn't anything
                   wrong with his suit...

                                WILLIE
                   Still...you did the right thing.

     She turns off toward the Swamp, leaving Beck with the tiny,
     but honest compliment.  He savors it.

     THE SWAMP - LATER

     The "Swamp" (where DeJesus came up), is ankle deep in greasy
     bilgewater.  The door slides open, Willie enters, and
     switches on a bank of fluorescent lights.  The room is
     spooky even with the lights.  The giant machine suits, we
     saw earlier outside, hang from racks like sleeping monsters.

     Willie straps on a utility belt and checks her tools--a
     motorized screwdriver, a power wrench, a long-necked,
     laser-tipped soldering iron(looks like a long-necked
     screwdriver)--then splashes through the bilge water to the
     control switch and hits the START button.

     NNNNNNNNNN.  A motor moves one of the suits along the track
     toward Willie.  As it turns the corner toward us we see it
     says:  DEJESUS.

     DOC'S OFFICE - SAME

     Beck opens the door to Doc's quarters and we see Doc putting
     on a fresh shirt.  A man in his 50's, he must have once been
     quite handsome and intelligent, but has now gone to seed.

                                DOC
                   I must have dozed off.

     Beck looks on the cabinet and sees a bottle of Old Granddad
     Whiskey.  He picks it up.

                                DOC(cont'd)
                   Snakebite medicine...Never
                   pack my bag without it.

     Beck doesn't smile.  He puts the bottle back down and Doc
     watches him in the mirror.

                                BECK
                   Are you planning on working tomorrow?

                                DOC
                   Well, I'll be on the golf course
                   in the morning.  Then, if I don't
                   have any babies to deliver--

                                BECK
                                (cutting him off)
                   We almost had an accident today.
                   DeJesus' suit...

     The Doc stops buttoning his shirt and locks eyes with Beck.

                                DOC
                   You got something to say to me, son?...

     Beck definitely has something to say, but confronted, he
     falters.

                                BECK
                   I...I think it's important to
                   have the second officer on deck.

     Doc smiles, and goes back to buttoning his shirt.

                                DOC
                   I'll keep it to nine holes
                   in the morning.

     THE DORMITORY - SAME

     Small but functional.  The bunks can be closed-off with a
     privacy door.  Photographs and bumper stickers on the walls
     of the bunks provide the only personal touches in an
     otherwise sterile environment.

     Willie's bunk is wallpapered in detailed interplanetary
     maps;  Sixpack's privacy door has a bumper sticker which
     proclaims:  "I MAY BE FAT, BUT YOU'RE UGLY AND I CAN DIET."
     DeJesus' has posters of the Alps, and the Rockies;  Bowman's
     has clipped pages from "Gourmet" of meals she dreams for;
     Cobb's has nothing, as if perfectly content to be where he
     is instead of somewhere else.  Inside Jones' bunk is an
     indoor basketball goal.

     Bowman and Sixpack scrub down the walls of the dorm with a
     sponge and pail.  Sixpack pauses and smirks, his eyes on
     Bowman's chest.

                                SIXPACK
                   Christ...what a pair...

                                BOWMAN
                                (sharply)
                   What was that?  What'd you say?

                                SIXPACK
                   I said, "What a pair" the
                   boy wonder Shack Boss and his
                   drunken doctor buddy make...
                                (innocently)
                   Why?  What did ya think I said?

     CORRIDOR "A" - SAME

     Jones and Cobb are kneeling in a corridor, unfastening a big
     plate on the floor with a power wrench.  Overhead a huge
     plexiglass conduit flows with water from the desalinization
     system.  The interior wall of the corridor is meshed wire
     exposing the throbbing machine floor of the Shack.

     Cobb removes the last bolt and Jones lifts off the
     floorplate exposing the guts of the shack--the BILGE--dark
     and wet.  Without the plate the RATTLE in the air system is
     much louder and sinister.

                                JONES
                   Listen to it for Christsake.

                                COBB
                   Ah, it's just old, like me.
                   You don't see the Doc opening
                   me up every time I get a new creak
                   in my joints...I say, as long as
                   it's recycling the air let
                   the next shift deal with it.
                   But, 'long as we're here...

     He pulls a retractable ladder from inside the hole and drops
     it down into the wet darkness, without hesitating he climbs
     down, stopping at the bottom to look up at Jones.  Jones
     seems in no hurry to accompany him.

                                COBB(cont'd)
                   You gonna sit there on your
                   butt or give me a hand?

     Jones reluctantly starts down after him.

     BECK'S QUARTERS - SAME

     Beck in his quarters.  He seems to be talking to himself but
     as we move around him we see he is talking to a video
     monitor.  On screen we see MARTIN, 30's, a slick
     bureaucratic executive with TransOcean Corp. whose face is
     all we see on the video monitor.

                                BECK
                   Two hundred and fifty-two
                   tons of Magnesium and 15 tons
                   of Sodium.

                                MARTIN
                                (taking notes)
                   Sounds like a good week, Beck.
                   In fact...I put your folder
                   in front of the Vice President
                   of District Operations last night...

     Beck stops.  Martin notices his concern.

                                MARTIN(cont'd)
                   You're good executive timber,
                   Beck.  A lot of management trainees
                   wash out when they have to go under
                   for their first tour.  But you've done well.

                                BECK
                                (smiles, relieved)
                   Thank you, Martin.

                                MARTIN
                   Don't thank me, yet, but it is
                   important to know where you're
                   going and who your friends are...
                   'Know what I mean?

     He stares hard at Beck, but doesn't wait for an answer.

                                MARTIN(cont'd)
                   The one thing I've learned in
                   this company is you can't have
                   enough friends.  It's the only
                   way to survive.

     CLOSE ON A BOOM BOX/ LOWER RING CORRIDOR - SAME

     The boom box sitting on a wall pipe is blaring John Denver's
     Rocky Mountain High.

     DeJesus is singing along loudly in his thick accent as he
     works on the intercom system.  He finishes, closing a metal
     box which says:  ONBOARD COMMUNICATIONS.

     SWAMP - SAME

     ON WILLIE  She has connected DeJesus' suit to the diagnostic
     computer and is going through the computerized
     checkpoints--an electronic list of literally hundreds of
     possible problems.

                                WILLIE
                                (to herself)
                   Probably a short.

     Suddenly, the computer pauses on one:  It says:  Electrical
     Short.

                                WILLIE(cont'd)
                   Good guess, Williams.

     She types in a "help" command and the computer screen
     displays an electrical circuit pattern that would leave most
     Electrical Engineers baffled.  Willie hardly bats an eye.

                                WILLIE(cont'd)
                   Piece of cake.

     She immediately opens the circuit panel on DeJesus' suit and
     pulls the laser soldering iron out of her tool belt.  With
     two quick spot welds she repairs the short, then replaces
     the panel.  Finished, Willie presses the control switch and
     the suits begin to move along the track.  A new suit rounds
     the corner toward us.  It says SIXPACK.

     THE BILGE - SAME

     The walls are dark and moist.  Water drips from the pipes.
     The rattle in the air system continues loudly as Jones leans
     over and hands Cobb another tool.  Crouched in the humming
     machinery, Cobb spits his wad of chewing gum into a greasy
     hand, kneads it a couple of times, then grins at Jones.

                                COBB
                   Okay, watch this..

     THE SWAMP - SAME

     The monotonous clatter of the air system is the only sound
     in the gloomy SWAMP as the huge suit labeled SIXPACK stops
     directly in front of Willie.  She reaches up to open the
     pocket latch when she stops...listening.  THE NOISE IN THE
     AIR SYSTEM HAS STOPPED.

     THE BILGE - SAME

     Jones looks incredulously at Cobb.  He can't believe that's
     all it took.  Cobb starts gathering up the tools.

                                JONES
                   So that's all you do?...

                                COBB
                   Shhhh...don't tell no one.
                                (winks)
                   Job security.

     THE SWAMP - SAME

     In the gloomy silence, Willie reaches for the hinged pocket
     in the waist of Sixpack's suit.  Some water drips out.  She
     pushes the spring a second time.  The pocket opens.
     Nothing.

                                WILLIE
                                (miffed)
                   Nothing wrong with this...

     SUDDENLY THE HIDEOUS SEA SPIDER SPRINGS OUT onto the
     workbench where it wriggles grotesquely toward Willie.  She
     backs away and it drops into the water at her feet.

     THE DORMITORY

     Bowman looks at DeJesus who comes to the door, then to
     Sixpack who convulses with laughter against the bulkhead.

                                WILLIE'S VOICE(O.C.)
                                (over intercom)
                   Fuck you, Sixpack!  You think
                   you're funny?  You're not funny!

     ON BECK

     He hesitates then presses the TALK button on the intercom.

                                BECK
                   This is Beck.  Is there a
                   problem, Williams?

     SWAMP

     Willie watches the Sea Spider move in the water toward her
     as Beck's words come over the P.A.  Ignoring Beck she
     watches the spider right as it moves to her feet then brings
     the soldering iron down into the water with a LOUD HISS
     skewering it.  She presses the intercom button and lifts the
     skewered sea spider out of the water.

                                WILLIE
                                (to Beck)
                   A little problem, sir...but I've
                   got a handle on it now.

                                           TIME CUT TO:

     THE MESS - LATER

     BOWMAN sits at a portable computer terminal and watches
     stock prices scroll across the screen.  Every so often she
     freezes a stock and types the command:  INFO.  The screen
     immediately changes to a financial report of the company in
     question as if prepared by a broker.  In a matter of seconds
     Bowman can learn all the major aspects of the company.

     Across the room from her, Willie exercises with dumbbells
     while she studies an astronaut training manual.  She looks up
     at Bowman.

                                WILLIE
                   Made your million, yet?

                                BOWMAN
                                (studying the screen)
                   Not yet.

                                WILLIE
                   How's TransOcean doing?

     This causes Bowman to turn and look at Willie.

                                BOWMAN
                   You got money in this tub?

                                WILLIE
                   I signed-up for the stock option.

     Bowman shakes her head and goes back to the computer and
     types in TransOcean Corp.

     DORMITORY

     ON COBB  He lies on his bunk under a sunlamp, but wears a
     T-shirt and long pants.  DeJesus does a jigsaw puzzle of a
     snow covered Swiss mountain scene.

                                DEJESUS
                   Hey, man, you know that in
                   Switzerland--and this country's
                   the size of East L.A., okay?--they
                   speak 54 different dialects?
                   Fifty-four!

                                COBB
                   Who cares?

                                DEJESUS
                   I do, man.  That's a beautiful
                   place.  When I get out of here
                   I'm going there.  Find a nice
                   little snow covered chalet, warm
                   little woman, crackling fire--

     He looks up and sees Cobb's sunbathing attire and laughs.

                                DEJESUS
                   Hey, Cobb...Man, why don't you
                   take off your shirt and pants,
                   man?  You should do that wearing
                   what you're going to wear at the
                   beach.

                                COBB
                                (sharply)
                   This is what I wear at the
                   beach, goddamnit.

     MESS - SAME

     COMPUTER SCREEN  The report appears on screen with a
     capsulized history of the TransOcean company, its philosophy
     and growth plans and most current financial report.  A final
     column called "insider tips" says:

                                BOWMAN
                                (reading)
                   "Major development in
                   South Indian Ocean set for
                   fall of 2010..."
                                (to Willie)
                   That sounds interesting, but they're
                   too tied to their holdings.  Remember
                   a year ago when they lost that tanker?...
                   The bottom fell out of their stock and
                   I lost a bloody fortune.  That's
                   when I decided to diversify.

     Willie looks at Bowman a moment, then keeps exercising.

                                WILLIE
                   You take your money, too
                   seriously, Bo.

                                BOWMAN
                                (sharply)
                   You're damn right I do.  Five
                   years down here and I'll pull
                   in more than 15 topside.  I'm not
                   down here for the fun, I'll tell
                   you that.

                                SIXPACK'S VOICE(O.S.)
                   "Fun?"  Somebody talking fun?

     They look up to see Sixpack at the door to the Mess wearing
     only a robe.  With a leer he stares at Willie exercising.

                                SIXPACK(cont'd)
                                (saccharine sweet)
                   Hey, Willie, honey...Sorry about that
                   little incident tonight...Everyone's
                   been so tight lately, I thought
                   a little humor'd loosen us all up,
                   you know?

     Willie doesn't bite, she looks hard at Sixpack.

                                WILLIE
                   Get out of here, Sixpack.

     Sixpack smirks.  He waves a copy of Penthouse opened to the
     Pet of the Month and sings cheerfully.

                                SIXPACK
                                (leaving)
                   I got a date with an angel...

     CLANK, BANK, CLUNK.  A coke can tumbles noisily from the
     Coke machine.  Jones retrieves two cans of Coke and comes
     out of the Galley with a snack.  He stops in front of
     Bowman and the computer.

                                JONES
                   Hey, Bo...when're you going to
                   be off that thing?  I want to
                   find out tonight's NBA scores
                   and check the weather.

                                BOWMAN
                                (not taking her eyes off
                                 the screen, answers him)
                   The weather's good, I already
                   checked, but I'll be off in a minute.

                                WILLIE
                                (to Jones)
                   Hey, Jonesy, who's the best power
                   forward in the NBA...Jameson?

                                JONES
                   Jameson?  Who're you trying to
                   con?

     They grin at each other--a standing joke and Jones leaves.

     DORMITORY

     Jones enters the Dorm with his snack and tosses a can of
     Coke across the room to DeJesus.

                                JONES
                   Hey, Hazy!  We got a day off
                   tomorrow, Kemosabi!  Let's get
                   shit-faced!

     DEJESUS catches the can and pops the top sending a shower of
     carbonation all over Cobb under the sunlamp.

                                JONES(cont'd)
                   How about you, brother Cobb?
                   Little Wild Turkey?

     Cobb wipes the Coke from his sunglasses and shakes his head.

                                DEJESUS
                   No, man, Cobb is a Chivas drinker,
                   from way back.  Ain't that right
                   Cobbie?

     Jones and DeJesus laugh and take long pulls on their Cokes.
     Cobb turns and watches them.  This is obviously a nightly
     ritual.

                                COBB
                   You guys are crazy.  What
                   the hell you play that stupid
                   game for?

                                DEJESUS
                                (acting drunk)
                   What game, Cobb?...I'm on
                   my way to Nirvana...

                                COBB
                   You're on your way somewhere
                   all right...the looney bin.

                                DEJESUS
                                (laughing)
                   I'm on the way to the looney
                   bin?  Hey, man, I'm not the dude
                   sun bathing in his clothes.

     INT. SIXPACK'S BUNK - SAME

     CLOSE ON  The Pet of the Month as she smirks coyly from the
     centerfold, her body twisted into an awkward position
     representing mad desire.

     Sixpack closes his privacy door then smirks back at the
     photo.

                                SIXPACK
                   Oh, Darlin'...come sit on
                   my face...

     He stirs in the bed and adjusts his pillow and SCREAMS!  The
     SEA SPIDER is suddenly right there on his shoulder, dead.

     Sixpack sits bolt upright in his bunk and slams his head
     against the roof of the bunk, then stumbles out screaming.
     He hits the floor and rams his foot into a table and screams
     in more pain.

     The whole dorm looks up amazed, Cobb takes off his
     sunglasses, even Jones and DeJesus temporarily "sober up" to
     stare.

                                SIXPACK
                   That bitch!

     MESS

     Sixpack storms into the Mess with the dead Sea Spider.  He
     points angrily at his bleeding foot.  Jones and DeJesus move
     up to watch.

                                SIXPACK
                                (moving into room)
                   Bitch!  Look what you did!

                                WILLIE
                                (imitating Sixpack)
                   Sorry, darling...Just thought a
                   little humor would loosen us all
                   up...you know?...

     Everyone laughs, but Sixpack.  He has revenge in his eyes.
     He holds out the ugly, limp creature and advances toward
     Willie.

                                SIXPACK
                   You think you're so funny?
                   Wait till you taste this!

     As he pushes the dead creature into her face BECK'S VOICE
     behind him makes him freeze.

                                BECK'S VOICE(O.S.)
                   That's enough!

     Everybody turns to see Beck standing in the doorway.

                                SIXPACK
                   Look at my foot, sir!  This
                   bitch put a goddamn sea
                   monster in my bunk!

                                BECK
                                (cold as ice)
                   How do you know it was Williams?

                                SIXPACK
                                (trapped)
                   Huh?  I...uh...uh...

                                BECK
                   All right, Sixpack, you and
                   Williams are gonna pull water
                   duty tomorrow--

                                SIXPACK AND WILLIE
                                (protesting)
                   Bullshit!  What?!  She...He...

                                BECK
                                (cutting them off)
                   At ease!  You both have a half
                   day...Anymore shit and its a full
                   one.

     CLOSE ON BLACKBOARD/ MESS - MORNING

     SCREECH!  Chalk on the blackboard as Bowman writes "2" in
     place of yesterday's "3" over the neatly lettered words
     "Days Till Pickup."

     Jones, sitting next to Cobb, looks up from his tray of
     cereal and holds his head in mock misery.

                                JONES
                   Oooooh.  Damn!  Not so loud.
                   Turn down the music.

                                COBB
                   What music?  There ain't no
                   music.

     DeJesus enters holding his head and sits on the other side
     of Cobb.

                                DEJESUS
                   Oooooh.

     Cobb looks from one man to the other, realizing what they're
     doing.

                                COBB
                   You know it's really crazy to
                   pretend to be drunk, but it's
                   fucking insane to pretend
                   to have a hangover.

                                BOWMAN
                                (to Jones and DeJesus)
                   Your "hangovers" made you miss
                   the Sixpack Good Morning Show.
                                (imitating Sixpack)
                   "No goddamn boy is going to make
                   me go out on a down day."

                                JONES
                                (grinning)
                   Yeah?  How'd the kid hold up?

                                COBB
                                (pleased)
                   Pretty good.  He sent them
                   out videotaping outcrop.

     UNDERWATER - SAME

     CLOSE ON  A whirling cylinder tool we see is attached to the
     end of Willie's mechanical suit arm.  Like a drill its
     diamond bits cut into the rock outcrop to take a core
     sample.  It's a sinister hand-attachment, something Captain
     Hook would have loved.

     Above her the ROV maneuvers into position for a better view.

     INSIDE THE SHACK CONTROL - SAME

     Beck is in the control station, staring at the video
     monitors--the image from the ROV.  Willie removes a slender
     instrument, like a bicycle pump and with a quick pump
     motion, CHUNK, CHUNK...activates an explosive charge.  She
     puts it into the hole she made with the drill and backs off.

                                BECK
                   Charge set?

                                WILLIE'S VOICE(RADIO)
                   Charge set.  Backing off.
                                (to the ROV)
                   C'mon Rover let's get out
                   of here.

     Like a good dog, the ROV follows her to a safe position.

     ON MONITOR  THE CAMERA HOLDS ON THE SPOT.  SUDDENLY THE
     GROUND SHAKES VIOLENTLY ON THE MONITOR SCREEN--A MINI
     EARTHQUAKE CHARGE.

     WILLIE RETURNS TO THE SITE OF THE CHARGE AND REINSERTS HER
     DRILL, EASILY REMOVING A TEST SAMPLE.

     Willie holds out the sample to the ROV so Beck can see
     inside.

     INT. CONTROL ROOM/ CLOSE ON BECK'S ROV MONITOR

     He stares at the image on the screen.

                                BECK
                   I need more light on that, Four.

     OUTSIDE

                                WILLIE
                                (to Beck)
                   Roger...
                                (to Sixpack)
                   More light, Sixpack...

     There is no answer.  Willie turns around.  Her helmet lamp
     eerily illuminating the darkness around her.  Sixpack is
     nowhere to be seen.

                                WILLIE(cont'd)
                   Sixpack?

     She turns in the other direction and suddenly blinding
     lights are turned on.

                                SIXPACK
                   Boo!

     Sixpack laughs.  His lights now on, he stands right behind
     her.

                                WILLIE
                   You shit....

                                BECK'S VOICE
                   What's going on, Four?  What's
                   happening?

                                WILLIE
                   We're fine, Shack.  His lights
                   malfunctioned for a minute.  How's
                   this?

     She again holds out her hand to the ROV.

     INSIDE SHACK

     Beck looks at the monitor and presses a red button to start
     the tape, then after five seconds releases the button.

                                BECK
                   That's great.  Now let's move
                   35 degrees southwest.

     WILLIE AND SIXPACK MOVING

                                WILLIE
                                (to Sixpack)
                   You screw around like that again and--

                                SIXPACK
                   What's wrong, did you miss me?

                                WILLIE
                   Hardly.

                                SIXPACK
                   Don't worry, darlin, I'm...

     Suddenly Sixpack's foot hits some loose rock and slides.

     Willie turns in his direction and sees his headlight
     turning, becoming smaller, then disappearing as his radio
     goes dead.

     INSIDE ON BECK

                                BECK
                   What's wrong?!  What happened?

     UNDERWATER

     ON WILLIE  She has stopped in her tracks.  All around her is
     blackness.  Her helmet light hardly penetrates the darkness.

                                WILLIE
                   Sixpack?!  Sixpack...

     Then she looks down--a cliff right in front of her feet.
     The drop is thirty feet into a waving sea of tubers.

     BECK'S VOICE brings Willie back.

                                BECK'S VOICE(RADIO)
                   Willie?  What's going on?

                                WILLIE
                   He's gone.  I think he's
                   fallen.  I'm going down after him.

     MESS

     Jones is bench pressing 200 pounds on a fold-down compact
     gym, while DeJesus huffs and puffs on an exercise bike.

                                DEJESUS
                   That's it Jonesy...Sweat it
                   out, man...Got to get the poison
                   out of our blood.

     Jones grits his teeth and struggles against the weight,
     suddenly Bowman throws open the door and sticks her head in.

                                BOWMAN
                   Sixpack is lost.

     CORRIDOR - MOMENTS LATER

     Bowman, Jones and DeJesus are heading for the control room
     where they are joined by Cobb.

                                COBB
                   Weren't they tied?  They're
                   supposed to be tied.

     They all enter the

     CONTROL ROOM

     Beck is at the console with Doc in his chair.

                                JONES
                   How far away is she?

                                DOC
                   Two hundred meters.

     WILLIE'S VOICE silences them.

                                WILLIE'S VOICE(RADIO)
                   Four to Shack...nearing the
                   bottom.  Look at this...

     They all stare at the monitor.  The screen is filled with
     huge waving tubers.

                                DOC
                   My God, look at the size of
                   those tubers....

                                DEJESUS
                   Nine, ten feet high...

                                BOWMAN
                   If he had his blinkers on--

                                JONES
                   It wouldn't make any difference in
                   there...He could be two feet away and
                   on fire and she'd still not see him!

     UNDERWATER

     ON WILLIE  She moves through the dense waving forest of
     giant tubers, parting them with her hands as she moves
     slowly.

                                WILLIE
                   Sixpack?

     CONTROL ROOM

                                BECK
                   Why can't we pick up his signal?

                                DEJESUS
                                (a joke)
                   Maybe he got eaten?

                                BOWMAN
                                (dryly)
                   What would be dumb enough to
                   eat Sixpack?

     ON WILLIE

     She moves aside the last of the tubers and freezes at the
     sight in front of her.

                                WILLIE'S VOICE(RADIO)
                   Four to Shack...you picking
                   this up?

     INSIDE

     All eyes suddenly go to the monitor.  A huge dark maw fills
     the screen.

                                BECK
                   Affirmative...Widening picture.

     The image on the screen widens and we see the opening is a
     huge gash in the side of a sunken ship.

                                BECK(cont'd)
                                (to DOC)
                   Tighten the picture on the
                   upper righthand corner.

     CLOSE ON THE MONITOR:  The picture zooms in on the corner
     and Willie's added light suddenly brings the letter "M" into
     focus.

     Beck presses the red record button and pans the ROV slowly
     across the bulkhead of the ship.  The next letter is an "A".
     Then suddenly a Cyrillic letter appears, then others.

                                COBB
                   What the?...

                                DOC
                   Russian.

                   I'm going inside.

                                BECK
                   What's your air reading?

                                WILLIE'S VOICE
                   Twenty minutes...

                                BECK
                   Twenty minutes!...Who had
                   tank duty?

                                BOWMAN
                   Who else...Sixpack.

                                JONES
                   The man is unbelievable...
                   I say, leave him in there.

                                BOWMAN
                                (dryly)
                   What about his suit?  That's
                   a million five the company's
                   got to replace.  They'll make
                   somebody go get it.

                                BECK
                                (to Willie)
                   Willie, we're giving you five
                   minutes...after that we're coming in.

     WILLIE'S POV

     Her life-support gauges move eerily around the perimeter of
     her mask.  She moves along steadily down darkened corridors.
     She opens a door and it drops from its corroded hinges--a
     cloud of sludge rises off the bottom.  The room looks empty.

                                WILLIE
                   Sixpack?...Answer me.

     She throws open another door.  It also looks empty, then
     WHAM! a grotesque ECHONODERM slams into her helmet.  Willie
     bats it aside and as soon as she recovers shines her light
     into the room.

     WHAT SHE SEES:  The ship's infirmary.  Broken glass,
     stainless steel...the light does strange things, reflecting,
     sparkling...

                                WILLIE(ON RADIO)
                   The infirmary...

                                BECK'S VOICE(RADIO)
                   Three minutes...

     Her helmet-mounted camera pans the room one more time, then
     as she turns to leave it captures a strange gleam of white
     in the corner--A LARGE HUMAN-LIKE SKELETON.  Willie doesn't
     see it.

     INT. THE CONTROL ROOM

     CLOSE ON DOC  He stares at the monitor screen.  Did he see
     something or were his eyes playing tricks?  He looks across
     the console and sees the videotape is recording.

     UNDERWATER

     ON WILLIE  She moves to the end of the hall.  It ends with
     two doors.

                                BECK'S VOICE(RADIO)
                   One minute.

     Willie hesitates at the junction and PUSHES OPEN the door on
     her left, SOMETHING HUGE BEHIND IT MOVES--IT'S SIXPACK.  His
     mechanical arms suddenly rise and in their grasp we see the
     ship's huge safe.

                                SIXPACK
                                (laughing)
                   I'm rich, honey.  Rich!

     THE SWAMP - LATER

     The door to the Russian ship's safe stands open.  BANG!
     BANG!  Jones and DeJesus hammer safety deposit boxes with a
     chisel.  While the others watch, Sixpack pleads his case
     with Beck.

                                SIXPACK
                   It's all mine if I'm on report.
                   Otherwise you gotta take me off
                   report before you look at any more...
                   Ain't that right, Cobbie?

                                COBB
                   You're on your own, Sixpack, you
                   fucked up everybody's day off...

     DeJesus pries off the top from the first safety deposit box
     and dumps the contents on the workbench...several wallets,
     wristwatches, a pocket watch, a wedding ring...Bowman who
     stands with a clipboard begins taking inventory.

                                BOWMAN
                   Personal effects...

                                WILLIE
                                (considering
                                a watch)
                   Timex...

     She picks up something else, a pack of soggy chewing gum and
     tosses it to Cobb.

                                WILLIE(cont'd)
                   Here's something for you, Cobbie.

                                JONES
                                (checking a wallet)
                   Russian money...Don't look like much.

     Jones opens the next box and dumps it out onto the
     table...Life Savers candy, a postcard of a fat Russian woman
     in a bathing suit.  Bowman looks at it.

                                BOWMAN
                                (grinning to
                                Sixpack)
                   Yeah, I'd say you can retire
                   with all this loot.

                                SIXPACK
                   Shut up.

     Everyone chuckles.  More papers and a small, book-shaped
     object wrapped in plastic.  Jones unwraps it.  It's a video
     tape.  He looks at the label.

                                WILLIE
                   What is it?

                                JONES
                                (reading)
                   "Debbie Does Dallas"...
                                (looks up and
                                grins)
                   Hell, it's in Russian.  I can't
                   read it...

                                DOC
                   May I see it?

     Jones hands it to Doc who looks at it.

                                DOC (cont'd)
                   It's a log of some sort.

     Jones pries the lid off another box and dumps it
     out--Papers, more cheap watches.

     ON SIXPACK  He notices something silver, the size of a
     paperback book, under a stack of papers.  Discreetly he
     covers the object with a piece of paper and slides it off
     the table out of sight.

     Jones opens the last box, and something rolls across the
     table toward the edge and starts to drop when it is caught
     by DeJesus.  He holds it up and we see--a clear liquor
     bottle.

                                WILLIE
                   Vodka.

                                COBB
                   What assholes, they lock booze
                   in the safe.

                                DEJESUS
                   Probably confiscated.  No
                   booze on board, same as us.

     Doc turns the bottle around in DeJesus' hand so he can read
     the label.

                                DOC
                                (eyeing the bottle)

     Everyone looks at Doc.

     Cobb stares at him a second then:

     Beck ignores them and addresses Bowman.

                                BECK
                   I want all this stuff impounded
                   in the supply safe.

     He lifts the bottle of Stolie out of DeJesus' hands.

                                BECK(cont'd)
                   ...except this...it goes in my
                   safe.

     A disappointed crew watches Beck leave with the bottle.  Doc
     stops him.

                   Be my guest.

     RING CORRIDOR - LATER

     The gloomy corridor outside the Infirmary.  It is empty,
     silent.  Suddenly the door to the Infirmary opens slightly
     and Bowman peeks out.  Seeing the corridor is empty she
     slips out with a a manila folder.

     DORMITORY - SAME

     Bowman hands the envelope to DeJesus, who's grinning
     delightedly.

                                DEJESUS
                   You got 'em!

     Sixpack and Jones are there too.  Sixpack scowls.

                                SIXPACK
                   What good's the kid's med
                   records anyway!

                                DEJESUS
                   Watch and learn, amigo...

     CONTROL ROOM - LATER

     CLOSE ON MONITOR SCREEN

     We see a thin, bearded man in his late fifties, a RUSSIAN
     SHIP'S CAPTAIN talking to the camera in Russian.  The tape
     is of poor quality and water spotted.

                                DOC'S VOICE(O.S.)
                                (translating)
                   Another party last night.  More
                   Vodka.  The infirmary is filled
                   as it is.  I confiscate what
                   I can, but I know the Government
                   Observers have more...

     Suddenly, the captain hears a noise off-screen and goes to
     the camera and turns it off.  The tape goes blank.

     ON DOC

     He stops the tape and presses another button on the console.
     WILLIE'S VIDEO of the huge hole in the hull of the ship
     appears on another screen.

                                DOC(cont'd)
                   See that gash?  The way the
                   edges protrude inward is like
                   from a torpedo explosion.  It
                   couldn't have come from within.
                   Like an accident.

     He looks back at Beck who we see is sitting behind him, and
     has also been watching the tape.  Beck looks at Doc and
     shrugs.

                                BECK
                   What do you want me to say?
                   That it all sounds mysterious?

                                DOC
                   These observers were doing something.
                   A test...I think they sank that ship
                   on purpose to cover up their mistakes.

                                BECK
                   What mistakes?
                                (he shakes his
                                head wearily)
                   Look, I think it's no big deal but
                   if you want to find out why this
                   ship sank have Maritime run a check.

     He gets up and goes to the door.  Doc watches him.

                                DOC
                   I did.  They have no record of

                   The Marshal Goloviev is now on
                   a tour in the Baltic Sea.

     Beck stops.  This is a mystery.

     CLOSE ON COMBINATION LOCK/ BECK'S QUARTERS - SAME

     Fingers fiddle with the combination.  He pulls on the
     handle.  The safe doesn't budge.

                                DEJESUS
                                (whisper)
                   It's not the phone number...

     We pull back to see that DeJesus is alone in Beck's darkened
     quarters, he talks to the P.A.  Suddenly we hear BOWMAN'S
     VOICE over the intercom.

                                BOWMAN'S VOICE
                                (on intercom)
                   Okay, try the social security
                   number...

     DeJesus puts his fingers back, on the safe dial.

                                DEJESUS
                   Okay, give it to me...

                   I want your permission to
                   check that vodka.

     Beck looks at him.  It is obvious that he doesn't trust Doc,
     with the vodka, but he's diplomatic.

                                BECK
                   This is a mining shack, not
                   a lab, Doc.  If there's something
                   strange with the vodka it's safe
                   till we get back.

     UPPER RING CORRIDOR

     ON COBB  Standing watch for DeJesus.  Suddenly the door to
     the Control room opens and Beck walks out.  Cobb grabs a
     walkie-talkie.

                                COBB
                   Beck's coming.

     BECK'S QUARTERS/ ON DEJESUS

     He hears Cobb and freezes.  He looks around--the cramped
     quarters don't offer much in the way of hiding places.

     INTERCUT WITH BOWMAN AND OTHERS IN DORMATORY

     They react similarly to the sound of Cobb on the P.A.

     ON COBB AND BECK/ CORRIDOR

     Beck stops outside his door and sees Cobb.

                                BECK
                   Something wrong, Cobb?

                                COBB
                                (struggling)
                   Uh..Excuse me sir, it's the air
                   recirculating system, sir...

                                BECK
                   What's wrong with it?

                                COBB
                                (thinking fast)
                   ...I'd really have to show it to
                   you.

                                BECK
                                (beat)
                   All right...

     Cobb smiles, he can't believe his luck, then Beck holds up
     the videotape.

                                BECK(cont'd)
                   ...Just let me put this in
                   my safe...

     Before Cobb can react Beck opens the door to his quarters
     and steps inside.

     BECK'S QUARTERS  WE SEE no sign of DeJesus.  Cobb follows
     into the room, looking carefully around for sign of DeJesus.

     In the mirror to Beck's bathroom, Cobb spots DeJesus
     pressing against the wall.  Cobb suddenly starts to sweat
     bullets.  Beck quickly unlocks the safe, opens it, and puts
     the videotape right next to the bottle of Vodka.

     We see Cobb's reaction.  Beck turns.

                                BECK
                   Something wrong?

     Cobb shakes his head weakly and starts to follow Beck out,
     he sneaks a look back at DeJesus in the shadows who gives
     him a thumbs up.

     MESS - LATER

     Five specimen cups filled with vodka.  Bowman takes hers and
     looks at it questioningly.  Cobb watches the door for signs
     of the officers.

                                BOWMAN
                   Cute, DeJesus...Specimen cups?

                                JONES
                   Aw, loosen up, Bowman...
                                (he looks over and
                                notices Willie)
                   Hey, Willie, I got one served
                   up for you.

     Willie shakes her head.

                                WILLIE
                   No, thanks.  I've got my
                   blood tests in three days.

                                DEJESUS
                   That's all you do is exercise.
                   You got to learn to live a little.

                                WILLIE
                   After my astronaut training physical,
                   then I'll tie one on.

                                SIXPACK
                   Forget space cadet, I'll drink hers.

                                COBB
                   Hey what happens it he goes
                   back and finds the bottle missing?

                                DEJESUS
                   He won't...

     He holds up a plastic IV bag filled with clear liquid.

                                DEJESUS(cont'd)
                   I poured the vodka in here.

     Cobb, Jones, DeJesus, Bowman, and Sixpack grin and clink
     glasses, then knock back their vodka.  Afterwards we get
     their reactions.

     JONES:  Looks concerned.
     BOWMAN:  Shakes her head, something's wrong.
     DEJESUS:  Can't get the taste off his tongue.
     COBB:  Seems totally satisfied.
     SIXPACK:  who has held the liquid in his mouth savoring it,
     suddenly spits the vodka out.

                                SIXPACK
                   Shit!  It's water!

                                JONES
                   Beck switched it!

                                DEJESUS
                   Can you beat that?  The sonof-
                   abitch doesn't trust us!

     Willie grins at her co-workers and Beck's move and jogs out
     into the corridor.  Sixpack disgustedly tosses his shot
     glass away and leaves.

                                SIXPACK
                   That little turd.  If I
                   ever get the chance I'll
                   fix his ass.

     The others put down their glasses disappointedly except
     Bowman.  She watches Sixpack.

     DORMITORY

     SIXPACK'S BUNK  He closes his privacy door and hesitates as
     if listening for the others, then he removes a silver flask
     with Cyrillic lettering--the silver object he palmed in the
     Swamp--and smiles as he takes a long pull.  Suddenly WHAM!

     The Privacy door to Sixpack's bunk is slammed open.
     Startled he turns startled to see--BOWMAN.

                                BOWMAN
                   Didn't I ever tell you vodka
                   was my favorite drink?

     She holds out her glass.  Sixpack looks around the Dorm,
     it's empty, then grins sheepishly and pours her a shot.

     CORRIDOR "B"

     ON WILLIE  She is jogging through the corridors.  Suddenly
     there is a GREAT GROANING NOISE.  Willie stops and looks
     through the steel mesh wall into the machine floor.  The
     dark shapes of the machines move monstrously in the dim
     light.  The GROANING ends and she jogs on to the Swamp.

     As she passes the door she notices the light and stops.  Beck
     stands with a clipboard by an equipment cabinet filled with
     the parachute-like Container Transporters we saw outside.
     He sees her.

                                BECK
                   That was a loud one wasn't it?

                                WILLIE
                   After a month of it you'd think
                   I'd be used to it.

     She moves into the Swamp and goes to the Lift Lock, stopping
     under one of the ladders she leaps up and grabs a metal rung
     above her and begins doing her chin-ups as Beck watches her
     lean body easily doing the exercises.

                                BECK
                                (watching her)
                   How's astronaut training?

                                WILLIE
                   Why?  You going to give me hard
                   time like the others?

                                BECK
                   No.  I'm just being friendly.

                                WILLIE
                                (beat)
                   Good...It's going good.

     Beck tries to concentrate on his inventory, but continues to
     watch Willie's sexy, athletic body.

                                BECK
                   Whatever made you want to
                   do a tour down here?

                                WILLIE
                   I need electrical field
                   experience on my resume.
                   Everything helps...
                                (she watches him)
                   Why are you here?

                                BECK
                   Everybody in corporate training
                   serves a tour on the line.  Sup-
                   posed to hone leadership skills
                   or something.

                                WILLIE
                   Has it helped?

     Beck shrugs.

                                WILLIE
                   I guess there's not a lot of
                   adventure in the Control Room.

     Beck looks up and they lock eyes.

                                BECK
                   You think I should hang around
                   more with the crew?

                                WILLIE
                   Well, I always heard you don't
                   "learn" leadership, you earn it.
                                (beat)
                   How did you know they'd get
                   into the vodka?

     Beck looks up from his clipboard and smiles.

                                BECK
                   I guess I figured if I was in
                   their shoes that's what I would've
                   done.

                                WILLIE
                                (smiles)
                   Maybe you're more one of us
                   than you think...sir.

     INT. MESS/ BLACKBOARD - MORNING

     SCREECH!  The chalk shrieks across the blackboard, making a
     "1" over the words "Days Till Pickup."

     Jones looks up from his cereal at Bowman, the culprit with
     the chalk.

                                JONES
                   Puuleeeeze...

     INT. DORMITORY - SAME

     DeJesus puts on his wet suit which goes under his large
     mechanical suit and gets ready to join the others in the
     mess.  He notices Sixpack's privacy door is still closed and
     bangs on it.

                                DEJESUS
                   Hey, Sixpack...Rise and shine
                   amigo...

     There is no answer.  Carefully he opens the door and is
     surprised to find it empty.

     INT. INFIRMARY - SAME

     CLOSE ON Sixpack's eye.  We pull back to see it is being
     examined by Doc who frowns.

                                DOC
                   Let's see your tongue.

     Sixpack obliges as Beck enters.

                                BECK
                   What's wrong?

                                DOC
                   Pretty good imitation of
                   a hangover and I ought to know.

                                SIXPACK
                   Well, it ain't!  It feels a
                   thousand times worse.

                                DOC
                   Where?

                                SIXPACK
                   I...I dunno.  I just feel...
                   wrong.

                                DOC
                   Take off your shirt.

     Sixpack pulls off his shirt.  Doc frowns in surprise.

     WHAT HE SEES:  SIXPACK'S TORSO  There are strange black
     areas, each of them an inch in diameter.

                                DOC (cont'd)
                                (concerned)
                   How long...how long have you
                   had these?

                                SIXPACK
                                (surprised, scared)
                   Shit, Doc...I didn't know I
                   had them.

     Doc peers closely at the skin where it's discolored.  It's a
     different texture.  Beck watches as Doc touches a spot and
     Sixpack screams in agony.  Doc and Beck lock eyes.

     BECK'S QUARTERS - SAME

     CLOSE ON MARTIN on Beck's video monitor.  He is drinking a
     cup of coffee.

                                MARTIN
                   ...as long as you know it's
                   not in your contract.

                                BECK
                   I know that.

                                MARTIN
                   Well, suit yourself, then...its
                   your decision...
                                (he chuckles)
                   Ha ha...a little joke...suit
                   yourself...

     Beck interrupts impatiently.

                                BECK
                   How's the weather for pickup
                   tomorrow?

                                MARTIN
                                (looking at a report,
                                then up at Beck)
                   Beautiful.

     THE SWAMP - MORNING

     The crew members climb into their suits.

                                COBB
                   Bad as he is there's no way
                   we can make our quota with-
                   out his sad self out there.
                   You just can't do it.

                                DEJESUS
                                (angrily)
                   He's tanking on us...

                                WILLIE
                   No...he's really sick.  I heard him
                   last night.  The company will take
                   that into consideration...

                                JONES
                   Honey, the company don't give
                   a flying fuck about "whys," they
                   just look at the numbers and
                   the contract says if we miss our
                   quota they only got to pay us
                   half-pay for the entire month.

                                DEJESUS
                                (convinced)
                   'Cocksucker's tanking on us...

     Suddenly all eyes go to the door, Beck enters.

                                BECK
                                (to DeJesus)
                   No, he's really sick...He won't
                   be going out today.

     The crew increases its bitching...

                                COBB
                   There goes our quota...

                                BOWMAN
                   Thirty days, right down the toilet...

     Beck ignores them and goes to the control rack which sends
     the suits around the room and pushes number 8--his suit.
     DeJesus and Jones share a look.  Bowman and Willie watch him
     carefully.  As Beck's suit stops in front of him the room is
     quiet, they can't believe their eyes.  Awkwardly, Beck
     tries to get into his suit.  Cobb breaks the silence.

                                COBB
                   Excuse me, sir...

                                BECK
                   Is this a contract violation,
                   Mr. Cobb?

                                COBB
                   No sir...I just wanted to know
                   if you needed a hand?

     Beck sees he's sincere, then looks at the others and Willie.
     She nods slightly.  Beck turns back to Cobb.

                                BECK
                                (beat)
                   Thanks...

     INT. THE INFIRMARY - SAME

     Doc and Sixpack.  Doc takes a blood sample, seals it and
     opens a cabinet under the sink where a supply of blood is
     stored in a refrigerated unit.  The plastic bags of blood
     are labeled with the various crew members' names.

     Sixpack watches him from the examination table.  He is
     shivering violently and scared.

                                SIXPACK
                                (he's losing it)
                   Please, Doc...I'm cold...I hurt...

     We see a change in Doc's demeanor.  He is suddenly needed
     and it has touched something in him and we see him rising to
     the challenge.

                                DOC
                   I'm just going to take a tiny
                   piece of skin to look at under
                   the microscope...Afterwards I'll
                   give you a sedative.

     Skillfully Doc takes a skin sample.  Sixpack screams.

     VIEW THROUGH THE MICROSCOPE

     An enlarged view of the cells in alarmingly hyperactivity.
     We see it literally spreading before our eyes.

     ON DOC

     He leans back from the microscope.  There is awe on his face
     for the first time since first year medical studies--and
     there is fear of the unknown.  He looks over his shoulder at
     Sixpack, his shivering has stopped, he lies still on the
     table.

     UNDERWATER

     Lights move in the blackness, but there is an order to the
     actions and a crispness to the voices.  People doing work
     that is moving sharply.  Pride in what they're doing.

                                DEJESUS
                   Okay, number 23's full.

                                BECK
                   Let's get it out of here and
                   bring in a new one.

                                JONES
                   Yes sir...

                                BOWMAN
                   Hook's on 24...

                                BECK
                   Let's have her...

     The Container transporters fill with compressed air and lift
     the container as the miners guide it to the track...

     INT. INFIRMARY/ SHACK - SAME

     Doc is at the console of his computer.  As words appear on
     the screen, obviously in response to his query...

     "...would appear to indicate a virus of unknown origin..."

     Doc shakes his head disgustedly.

                                DOC
                                (to himself)
                   No kidding?  "A virus of
                   unknown origin."  Come on and
                   tell me something I don't know...
                   like what's going on...

     ON SCREEN

     More words come up.  "...no idea..."

                                DOC(cont'd)
                                (typing, angrily)
                   Then take a guess, goddamnit!

     He finishes typing and waits for an answer.  The cursor
     flashes the word "PROCESSING".  Then an answer comes up.
     "Genetic Alteration?"  The words send a chill down Doc's
     spine.

     SWAMP ROOM - LATER

     The mood is happy.  Like a high school football locker room
     after a winning game.  DeJesus climbs out of his suit and
     slaps Beck on the shoulder.

                                DEJESUS
                   Good work out there, Mr. Becky.

     Beck, obviously pleased, looks at the others.  Jones sums up
     the feelings of the entire group.

                                JONES
                   Thank you, sir.

     Beck's grin suddenly disappears at the sight of a flashing
     red light over the intercom.

     INFIRMARY - LATER

     Beck is standing in the doorway of the Infirmary, glaring at
     Doc, who sits with his bottle of Old Granddad.

                                BECK
                   Dead?  This morning you said
                   he had some skin disorder.

                                DOC
                   He did.

                                BECK
                   Well, how the hell does a
                   skin rash kill you in eight
                   hours?!

     Doc looks at Beck wearily and hands him a mask.

                                DOC
                   Here.  Put this on.  You examine
                   him.

                                BECK
                   I'm not a doctor.

                                DOC
                   For this...you don't need to be.

     Beck hesitates, then puts on the mask.

     SICK ROOM

     As Beck enters, masked, Sixpack's back is to him under the
     sheets.  Slowly he pulls back the sheet and recoils from the
     sight.  The black splotches have nearly all grown together.
     His fingers have lengthened and become more webbed.  Most
     dramatically the sores on the sides of his neck have become
     flared and elongated.  Though not bleeding, the open veins
     are visible.

     INFIRMARY

     Doc pours some bourbon in a glass, and takes a sip.  Beck
     enters dazed from the sick room and their eyes meet.

                                BECK
                   The mask is because you think
                   it might be...catching?

                                DOC
                   I don't know.  I've been back
                   and forth with Narragansett Naval
                   all day, consulting with the best
                   people in maritime medicine, the
                   best people in viruses...

                                BECK
                                (impatiently)
                   And?

                                DOC
                   And they didn't believe the
                   symptoms I described...

                   something in the air, food....

                                locks eyes with Beck)
                   But he went on that ship and so
                   did Williams...
                                (beat)
                   I want to examine the crew.

                                (still in shock)
                   Yeah...right...

     He starts to the door and Doc watches him.

                                DOC
                   I've reported the death to
                   the company.

     INT. THE MESS - SAME

     The mess is quiet.  All eyes are down.  Sixpack's absence is
     noticeable.

                                JONES
                   "Routine," my ass!  Ain't nothin'
                   "routine" about no physical check-
                   up 10,000 feet down...especially
                   when we're getting picked up the
                   next day!

                                COBB
                   He didn't say it was a "routine
                   check-up," he said it was a "routine
                   precaution."

                                WILLIE
                   Must be bad.  Even sick
                   Sixpack never missed a meal.

                                DEJESUS
                   It's this fucking air system....

                                COBB
                   Ain't the food or the
                   air system, he's just sick...
                   Everybody gets sick every
                   now and then.  It's all
                   part of being human!

     Bowman suddenly becomes pale.

                                BOWMAN
                   Well, I must be human because
                   I'm sure as hell sick.

     She gets up from the table and dashes for the toilet.

     INT. SHOWER ROOM - LATER

     EXAMINATION SEQUENCE

     CLOSE ON WHITE SKIN/(COBB)

     Pale skin, fishbelly white with white hairs, seen closely...

                   I guess I'm kinda...outta shape...

                   This skin condition...what is it?
                   Like herpes, or measles, or what?

                                DOC'S VOICE(O.S.)
                   It's difficult to describe.

     Doc is scrutinizing Cobb's flabby body closely.  They're
     alone in the shower room.  Stainless steel, and mirrors.  Doc
     stops and checks a place on Cobb more closely.

                                COBB
                                (watching, nervous)

                   if I went back to the roof with
                   some kind of herpes thing.  My
                   wife wouldn't understand that at all...

     Doc peers closely, satisfies himself that it's nothing.

                                DOC
                   You seem all right.

                                COBS
                                (relieved)
                   She wouldn't understand.  She'd
                   think I was down here fucking
                   my head off.

     DARK SKIN/ PORES  Black skin, seen very close, the pores
     appearing like craters.

     We're looking at Jones' naked body...rippling muscles.

                                JONES
                                (grumbling)
                   This whole thing's unnecessary, Doc.
                   Only "skin problem" I got is
                   white people...
                                (beat, suspiciously)
                   How come you're wearing those
                   gloves?

     INT. SHOWER ROOM/ SMOOTH SKIN - LATER

     Firm, lovely breasts, smooth skin...

                                WILLIE'S VOICE(O.S.)
                   This disease...do you know
                   what causes it?

     Doc turns Willie around and examines her firm naked
     buttocks.

                                DOC
                   Not yet.  You got any ideas?

                                WILLIE
                                (suddenly)
                   You don't think it was from going
                   on that ship do you?

                                DOC
                   That's a possibility.  But if
                   it was that simple why haven't
                   the symptoms begun on you?

     Doc turns away to let her dress.

                                WILLIE
                   You mean I'm okay?

                                DOC
                   You're fine.

     SHOWER ROOM/ TAN SKIN

     DeJesus' body is being examined...tan skin, wiry muscles
     seen very close.  As we move along the skin, it seems every
     moment as if the next instant will reveal a dread blemish...

                                DEJESUS' VOICE(O.S.)
                   What do you mean, "a skin problem"...
                   your skin changes?

     DeJesus, naked, with his back to us.  Doc examines him.

                                DOC
                   It blackens...becomes scaly.

                                DEJESUS
                                (joking)
                   You mean like a fish?

     DeJesus chuckles, but something about the thought stops Doc.

                                DOC
                                (almost to himself)
                   Yes...like a fish...

                                DEJESUS
                                (smiles)
                   I was just joking, Doc.

     CONTROL ROOM - SAME

     Beck sits in his chair reading the TRANSOCEAN OFFICERS
     INSTRUCTIONAL MANUAL.

     INSERT:  The chapter he's on says:  BODY DISPOSAL AT SEA.

     The face of Martin stares back at us.

                                MARTIN
                   Well, according to Maritime law,
                   you, as commander of the Shack
                   have the authority to dispose of
                   the body.  However, the company
                   doesn't want you to do that.

                                BECK
                   What you don't understand is that
                   my crew is in jeopardy.

                                MARTIN
                   But you don't have any proof
                   at this point to assume that
                   this disease is contagious, do
                   you?

                                BECK
                   I'm not anxious to find out, either.

                                MARTIN
                   Beck, trust me.  If the company
                   felt that you or your crew were
                   in any danger we would authorize
                   an immediate emergency pickup.
                   We could be there in a few hours.

                                BECK
                   Do it.

                                MARTIN
                                (beat)
                   Unfortunately.  We can't.

     He picks up a sheet of computer paper.

                                MARTIN(cont'd)
                   There is a typhoon about 600
                   miles off the coast of Baja.
                   It's not coming your way but the
                   Company doesn't want to lose
                   you folks or an emergency ship
                   should it veer your way.

                                BECK
                   What're you saying?  That we're
                   not even going to be picked up
                   tomorrow?

                                MARTIN
                   It shouldn't be a long delay.

                                BECK
                   But it's a delay!  How long?
                   A day?  Two days?!

                                MARTIN
                   Twelve hours, no big deal.  We
                   should know something first
                   thing in the morning.  Don't
                   worry.

     WASHROOM - SAME

     Willie enters the room with several sinks and a couple of
     toilet stalls.  She approaches one of the sinks and pulls a
     toothbrush from the pocket of her robe.

                                WILLIE
                   Bo?  Doc says you're next.

     Just then she hears a retching sound from one of the stalls.

                                WILLIE(cont'd)
                   Bo?...You okay?

     INFIRMARY - SAME

     Willie and Jones help Bowman into the Infirmary.  She is
     weak from nausea.  They help her onto the examination table
     and look around for Doc.  Jones sees a light on in the Sick
     Room.

     SICK ROOK - SAME

     Sixpack's body lies under a sheet in the Sick room.  The
     door opens and Jones looks in, sees Sixpack but in the dim
     light, doesn't realize the sheet covering him, covers the
     body totally.  Jones smiles.

                                JONES
                                (whispers)
                   Hey, Sixpack...Hey, my man...
                   How you feeling?

     There is no answer and Jones slowly approaches the body.

                                JONES
                   Hey, man, we made quota to-
                   day.  No thanks to you, you
                   dog, but we made it...Beck
                   helped us...We just dropped
                   Bowman off.  I hope what you've
                   got ain't catching...

     He is almost to the table and reaches out to touch Sixpack
     when suddenly the body stirs.  Sixpack's foot moves slightly
     under the sheet as if shifting in his sleep.  Jones stops.

                                JONES(cont'd)
                   Oh, man, sorry...you go back
                   to sleep.

     INFIRMARY - SAME

     Jones returns to the examination room.  Bowman is now
     undressed and under the blankets on the examination table.

                                WILLIE
                   Who were you talking to?

                                JONES
                   Sixpack...

                                WILLIE
                   How is he?

                                JONES
                   Sleeping.  No sign of Doc,
                   though.  I'll check the
                   control room.  You look
                   in the shower room...

     They leave Bowman GROANING on the examination table and head
     back to the main corridor.  As they leave WE HOLD ON the
     door to the sick room behind Bowman.

     Bowman writhes on the examination table in pain.  Carefully
     she climbs off the table and goes behind a partition to
     throw up.

     CLOSE ON BOWMAN

     At the sink in the infirmary.  She rinses her face in the
     sink and pulls back her hair, suddenly she stops and brings
     her hands in front of her face.

     INSERT HER HANDS.  Huge clumps of hair have come out in her
     hands.  And then she sees her hands themselves.  Scaly.

                                BOWMAN
                   Oh, God...what's going on?

     She turns and looks at the light on in the Sick Room.  Slowly
     she goes to the door and enters.

     SICK ROOM

     Bowman approaches the body of Sixpack.

                                BOWMAN
                                (panicked)
                   Sixpack...what's going on?

     No answer.  She pulls back the sheet and gasps.

     CONTROL ROOM - SAME

     ON BECK AND DOC.

                                DOC
                                (panicky)
                   You have to call them back.
                   Explain that this is an emergency.

     Jones enters.

                                JONES
                   Excuse me, sir...Bowman's
                   sick.  She's downstairs in
                   the infirmary.

                                DOC
                                (concerned)
                   The infirmary?...

                                JONES
                   Yes sir, ain't that where we
                   usually go when we're sick?

                                DOC
                   We're simply concerned about
                   her...proximity to...

                                BECK
                                (to Jones)
                   Sixpack's dead.

     Jones looks from one officer to the other then grins.

                                JONES
                   Bullshit...I was just talking
                   to him.  I saw him move.

                                BECK
                   What?...

     LOWER RING CORRIDOR - SAME

     Beck hits the floor off the ladder and rushes to the
     Infirmary with Jones.  He opens the door and freezes.

     WHAT HE SEES:  The examination table where Jones left her is
     empty.  The room deserted.

                                JONES
                                (pointing to
                                examination table)
                   I left her here.

     DOC comes up behind them, then turns.  He hears to a HISSING
     SOUND down the ring corridor.  He turns from the others and
     moves slowly toward the noise.

     SHOWER ROOM

     Doc enters the shower room, full of steam and the SOUND OF
     WATER.

                                DOC
                   Bowman?

     There is no answer and he moves toward the shower.

                                DOC
                   Bowman.  It's Doc.  I'm here
                   to help you.

     The water continues to run.  No answer.  Carefully, Doc
     opens the shower door.

     WHAT HE SEES:  Bowman.  Dead.  Her wrists have been cut and
     blood swirls down the drain.

     Doc sadly squats down beside her.  The death effects him
     greatly.  He feels helpless, then suddenly his eyes widen
     and he carefully reaches out and takes Bowman's limp arm,
     turning it supine.  There, running the length of the arm, WE
     SEE the black scales.

     INFIRMARY

     Jones and Beck lay Bowman's body carefully onto the
     examination table in the infirmary.  Through the Sick Room
     door we see the sheet shrouded body of Sixpack.  Doc covers
     Bowman with a sheet as

                                                      WE CUT TO

     THE MESS - LATER

     The remaining crew, Doc, and Beck assembled in the Mess.
     Doc sits quietly, almost in a daze.

                                BECK
                   I can't tell you much about
                   it, except that none of you
                   show any symptoms.

                                DEJESUS
                   And it killed Bo?

                                BECK
                   No...she killed herself.

     ON WILLIE  the news hits her hard.

                                JONES
                   We're getting out of here just
                   in time.

                                BECK
                   There's now a problem with the
                   weather for pickup.  There's a
                   typhoon in our sector...
                   ...We're going to be delayed
                   twelve hours...

                                DEJESUS
                   Typhoon?!

                                JONES
                   Twelve hours!

                                COBB
                   At least we get time and
                   a half.  That's in the contract.

                                JONES
                   Fuck double pay, man!  I
                   want out of here!

     Their argument is suddenly cut short by a NOISE from the
     corridor.  A THUMP!  The crew stops their grumbling and
     listens.  A moment later we hear another THUMP!  Beck looks
     at Jones.

                                BECK
                                (motions for Jones
                                to come with him)
                   Jones...
                                (to the others)
                   Stay here.

     RING CORRIDOR

     Beck leads the way slowly toward the Infirmary where the
     sound is coming from.  Outside the door they hear it once
     more.  THUMP!

     Carefully he enters the Infirmary and WE SEE the
     examination table is empty!  Beck goes to the Sick room and
     stops in the doorway.  Jones moves behind him and his eyes
     suddenly widen.

     WHAT THEY SEE:  Both bodies now are in a motionless, hideous
     conglomeration on the the table.

                                                  SLAM CUT TO

     CLOSE ON HEAVY ZIPPER

     ZZZZZZZZZZZZZZ.  It is quickly pulled shut, running the
     length of a heavy plastic bag, closing both bodies inside.

     INT. CORRIDOR "B" - LATER

     Dressed in their rubber latex suits Cobb, Jones, DeJesus,
     Beck, and Willie carry the body of Sixpack and Bowman in the
     zippered bodybag.  Now, well over three hundred pounds, the
     bodies strange shape and dead weight make it difficult to
     transport.

                                DEJESUS
                   C'mon, Cobb...you're slacking...

                                COBB
                                (angrily)
                   I ain't, goddamnit...It's
                   Jones!..

     Before Jones can argue, Beck cuts them off.

                                BECK
                   Shut up, all of you.

                                COBB
                   Mr. Beck, the contract states that
                   no body can be disposed of without
                   authorization of---

                                JONES
                   Fuck the contract, man!

     The group turns into the Swamp where Doc waits for them by
     the Lift Lock.  Rounding the corner Cobb bangs into the side
     of a bulkhead and drops his corner of the "package."  Like
     dominoes, Willie also looses her grip, then DeJesus.  The
     bodybag splashes into the grimy bilge water making it even
     harder for everyone to get a handhold.

                                BECK(cont'd)
                   C'mon...Lift!

     The group struggles to raise the bodybag and just get it to
     their shoulder when suddenly we go tight on DeJesus's face.

                                DEJESUS
                   Hey!...I feel something.
                   It's moving!  He's alive!

                                COBB
                   I feel it, too...Someone's trying
                   to get out.

     Cobb drops his end intentionally and he kneels looking for
     the zipper.

                                JONES
                   Cobb, what're you doing!

                                COBS
                   But he ain't dead!  He ain't
                   dead.

                                BECK
                   Cobb!  Stop!

     But Cobb grabs the zipper and starts to unzip the heavy bag.
     Beck tries to stop him when suddenly, WHAM!  a DARK
     APPENDAGE RIPS through the zipper and flails like a
     pressurized firehose.  It beats wildly for several second,
     then lashes out at Cobb--ripping a gash on his forearm.

     While Cobb screams in pain, Beck yanks the appendage off
     Cobb's arm revealing a mouth full of needlesharp teeth and a
     sharp tongue-like proboscis which has stabbed Cobb like a
     dagger.

                                COBB
                   It bit me!  It bit me!

     While Beck and Willie wrestle the strong flopping appendage,
     Doc rushes to the Lift Lock.

     DeJesus and Jones struggle to force the lurching bodybag
     into the Lift Lock.

                                JONES
                   Push Hazy!

     The bodybag shudders like a huge cocoon about to lose its
     occupant.  Jones digs his shoulder down into the task just
     as the bag suddenly RIPS in several places.  A tear RIPS
     OPEN next to Jones' head revealing the head of BOWMAN, her
     vacant eyes only inches from Jones' face.

                                JONES
                   Oh, Jesus Christ!  I ain't
                   never gonna sleep again!

     Suddenly a WHINING NOISE sounds behind them.  Beck looks
     back to see Cobb approaching with a battery operated
     underwater chain saw.  He's clearly intending to cut the
     Creature with the whirring blade.

                                BECK
                   No!

                                COBB
                   It bit me!

                                DEJESUS
                   It's Sixpack!

                                COBB
                   I'm going to kill it!

     DeJesus turns to block Cobb while the others continue to
     wrestle the bodybag into the Lift Lock.  The bag suddenly
     splits and a scaly arm protrudes.  It reaches out grabbing
     DeJesus.  Beck pulls him free and yells.

                                BECK
                   Close the Lock!  Now!

     Doc hits the lever.  The elevator doesn't move!

     RRRRRRIIIIIPPP!  A scaly leg rips out of the body bag!

                                BECK(cont'd)
                   Hit it again!

     Doc hits the elevator switch again, harder.

     NNNNNNN!  The Lift Lock door whines closed and a horrifying
     SCREAM rises from the Lock.

     CLOSE ON THE LIFT LOCK

     The end of the appendage is severed in the closing door,
     disappearing unseen into the greasy bilge water.

                                BECK(cont'd)
                   Flush it!

     Doc flips a switch and the SCREAM OF THE VACUUM PUMPS drown
     out the SCREAM in the Lift Lock, the wails of Cobb, and the
     splashing sounds of the severed three-foot section of gory
     muscle which slip silently and undetected under the
     workbench.

     A second later the elevator returns empty, silent,
     bloodstained.

     Beck turns on the video monitor of the exterior Lock.  The
     exterior worklights illuminate millions of bubbles from the
     flush and the struggling movements of the bodybag before it
     grows still once again and disappears beyond the range of
     the Shack lights...into the darkness.

     Beck turns and looks at his savaged crew.  Willie, Jones,
     DeJesus, Doc look like wet-suited butchers.  Splattered in
     blood, numbed by the experience, they are brought together
     by having simply survived.  Jones holds up Willie.  DeJesus
     leans against the bulkhead.  In the far corner Cobb sobs
     quietly.

     SHOWERS - LATER

     Clouds of steam.  Vaguely seen through the steam, Willie is
     scrubbing herself almost desperately, as though the
     spattered blood of the creature had penetrated into her
     skin.  Finally she gives up almost in tears and rests her
     head against the wall of the shower stall.

     DORMITORY - SAME

     Beck and Jones open the privacy door to Sixpack's bunk.
     After some digging which produces five month's supply of
     pornography, the empty flask clatters to the floor.  Beck
     picks it up.

                                BECK
                   I think we just found our
                   problem.

     MESS - LATER

     Cobb pours himself a cup of coffee with a shaky hand.  Jones,
     and DeJesus sit at a table and Willie laces up her shoes for
     a run.  There is a feeling of anger among them.

                                DEJESUS
                   Serves his ass right to get
                   it.  Motherfucker brings that
                   shit onboard.  I hope his
                   fucking ass rots in the sea and
                   is shit upon by the fish.

                                JONES
                   'Fucker could have gotten us
                   all killed.

                                COBB
                   He knew better than that.

     Willie finishes tying up her shoes and looks at them all
     coldly.

                                WILLIE
                   You guys sure weren't so holy
                   when you were shooting that
                   vodka...It could have been you.

     She gets up and walks out into the Ring corridor.

     THE RUSSIAN SHIP

     WE ARE MOVING along the ship's corridor that Willie walked
     looking for Sixpack.

     WE PULL BACK TO REVEAL WE ARE WATCHING A VIDEO SCREEN IN THE
     CONTROL ROOM

     Doc and Beck replay the tape of Willie's search for Sixpack
     on the Russian ship.  On the monitor screen we see Willie's
     POV of the infirmary.  The light dances off the broken glass
     as she turns, then the flash of white we saw before as the
     light moves out into the corridor.

                                DOC
                   Hold it!  Rewind it.

     Beck rewinds it.

     ON SCREEN  we see the scene again.  Light dancing off the
     cabinets.  As the light starts to turn--

                                DOC
                   Stop it.

     Beck pauses the tape.  We see nothing. Doc is confused.

                                DOC
                   Back it up slowly.

     Beck does and we watch Doc's face as he stares intently at
     the screen.  Suddenly he sees it.

                                DOC
                   There.

     ON SCREEN  We see it.  Caught in the turn of the camera, now
     frozen on the screen is the clear gleaming skeletal remains
     of a man.  Only it is clear that this is no ordinary man.
     Fingers and appendages are lengthened and broader than
     normal.  But it is the large head and long sharp teeth that
     especially catches our attention.

     MESS - SAME

     ON A BEAUTIFUL BAVARIAN SETTING

     as a hand suddenly moves into frame and we see the scene is
     actually one of DeJesus' jigsaw puzzles.  He takes a piece
     of blue sky from the hundreds of pieces on the table and
     places it perfectly into position on the puzzle.  Jones
     watches him amazed.

                                DEJESUS
                   You know that Innsbruck
                   has 64 square miles of ski
                   slopes, man?  Think about that.
                   Sixty-four square miles.

     He picks up another piece of blue sky and effortlessly fits
     it into place as Jones watches.  It's blowing Jones' mind.

                                JONES
                   How'd you do that?

                                DEJESUS
                   What?  That?...I've done this
                   one before.  You hungry?  I'm
                   hungry.

     He gets up to go into the mess and Jones looks at him in
     amazement.

                                JONES
                   Hungry?  After what we just
                   went through I may never
                   eat again.

     ON WILLIE

     She jogs down the corridors toward the Swamp.  The Shack
     CREAKS and Willie looks down through the grating passing
     below her feet.  It is dark down there.  Her feet pound off
     the metal grating.

     LOW ANGLE  We watch Willie from below as she jogs past.  THEN
     WE TILT DOWN to the dark, still water of the bilge.  Suddenly
     something stirs in the water--a ripple like a trout in a
     stream.

     CONTROL ROOM - SAME

     Using a computer plotting program to measure the dimensions
     of the skull on the videotape, Doc enters these measurements
     as they are read off to him by Beck.  As each of the
     measurements go into the computer an image of a skull begins
     to appear on the computer screen, followed by a name:
     DANAKIL MAN.

                                BECK
                   They found this?

                                DOC
                   No.  I think they isolated
                   him in genetic engineering.
                   Homo aquaticus...

                                BECK
                   Was there such a thing?

                                DOC
                   Danakil man?...one of our
                   ancestors.  Named for the
                   Danakil Alps in Ethiopia.

                                BECK
                   Not exactly a big ocean
                   country.

                                DOC
                   It was when it counted a couple
                   of million years ago when the
                   seas came in and drove us into
                   the water.  Most homo sapiens
                   didn't make it...Danakil man...
                   adapted.

     ON WILLIE

     running.  She jogs past the machine room.  Looking in, the
     machines seem alive, pulsing, the beating heart of the
     Shack.  There is something else though.  We feel something
     in there watching her.

     CONTROL ROOM

     On Doc.

                                DOC
                   Some say that's why we're
                   basically hairless, for less
                   water resistance, faster swimming
                   speeds...

                                BECK
                   But what about those scales...
                   or that leech-like thing that
                   bit Cobb?

                                DOC
                   Why stop with just one aspect
                   of marine life?  Why not incorporate
                   the best genetic components the
                   ocean has to offer?...

                                BECK
                                (pointing to screen)
                   Well, if they were perfecting an
                   aquaman, then why's there a dead
                   one onboard that Russian ship?  Why
                   isn't he out swimming around?

     Doc looks up at the image on the screen.  The huge skull
     stares back hauntingly.

                                DOC
                                (beat)
                   He obviously lacked something
                   in his environment.

     DORMITORY - SAME

     ON COBB  He sits on his bunk and peers under his bandage.
     He turns on an overhead reading light and looks again.
     Suddenly a voice startles him.

                                JONES' VOICE
                   Turned black yet?

     At first startled, Cobb recovers and answers sharply.

                                COBS
                   That ain't funny.

                                JONES
                   Relax, Cobb.  If it was
                   going to turn, it would have
                   done its trick by now.

                                COBB
                   That's easy for you to say.
                   You ain't the one that got bit.

     Jones starts to leave when he suddenly notices something on
     Cobb's bunk.  He picks it up and we see a photo of Cobb's
     family.

                                JONES
                   Don't tell me you're getting
                   soft on us, Cobbie?  You're
                   the fellow who always said--

     Cobb snatches the photo back from Jones and glares at him
     with the same old, hard "Cobb look."

                                COBB
                   Nothing's changed, goddamnit!

     Jones leaves, and Cobb waits till he is gone then looks back
     at his photo.  His look changes, softening.  Absently he
     scratches his bandage.

     SWAMP

     Willie enters and checks her running time on her watch.  She
     bends over to catch her breath then straightens suddenly.

     OVERHEAD SHOT

     WE are watching her from above.  For a moment she is quiet
     as if listening for a noise somewhere in the Swamp.  She
     looks around slowly and her eyes come to rest on the
     Workbench.

     MESS - SAME

     DeJesus looking for food.  In the gloom of fluorescent
     lighting he opens and closes various cabinets looking for a
     snack.

     He notices that the floor's wet near the sink.  He frowns
     and hears a SMALL NOISE, like something shifting slightly.
     He moves to investigate, crouching low, peeking into the
     shadows under the sink, into a litter of cleanser bottles,
     pails, rags...All he can see are shadows.  He looks more
     closely, actually sticking his head under the sink when

     SUDDENLY SOMETHING TOUCHES HIS SHOULDER FROM BEHIND!  DEJESUS
     JUMPS, BUMPING HIS HEAD ON THE SINK AS HE WHIRLS TO SEE.

     JONES, looming over his shoulder, looking down at him.

                                JONES
                   Man, everybody is jumpy...
                   What are you doing?

     Not fully recovered from the start, DeJesus rubs his bruised
     head.

                                DEJESUS
                   Getting some food.

                                JONES
                   Under there?

     DeJesus gets to his feet, points at the water under the
     sink.

                                DEJESUS
                   Look.  Water.

                                JONES
                   Probably the plumbing.  You
                   gonna make me finish that puzzle
                   by myself, or what?

     DeJesus continues to scrutinize the water then looks back at
     Jones.

                                DEJESUS
                   No, I'll be right there.

     He looks down at his sandwich as Jones starts out of the
     galley.  Something is missing.

                                DEJESUS
                                (to himself)
                   Mustard.  Need mustard...

     He opens the refrigerator and finds the mustard jar empty.

                                DEJESUS
                                (muttering to himself)
                   Sixpack...

     He throws the jar in the trash then opens the cabinet next
     to the refrigerator for a new jar, and reaches inside.

     SUDDENLY, LIKE A SNAKE, A TWO FOOT CHUNK OF MUSCLE ATTACHES
     TO DEJESUS'S WRIST!  WITH HIS FREE HAND DEJESUS TRIES TO RIP
     THE TWISTING, WRITHING THING OFF.  PULLING AT IT HE REVEALS
     PART OF SIXPACK'S FACE--ONE EYE AND PART OF HIS
     MOUTH--UNDERNEATH THE SURFACE.

     DeJesus falls against the side cabinets screaming and
     causing an avalanche of pots and pans.

                                DEJESUS
                                (in pain)
                   Ahhh!

     INSIDE THE MESS

     Jones is now putting a piece of the puzzle into place when
     he hears THE CLATTER OF POTS AND PANS.

                                JONES
                   Hey, Hazy...what're you doing
                   now...cooking?

     There is no answer and Jones looks up.

                                JONES(cont'd)
                                (concerned)
                   Hazy?...

     He goes to the door and looks in.  His eyes widen at the
     sight of DeJesus staggering toward him with the squeezing
     hunk of muscle.

                                JONES(cont'd)
                   Holy shit!

                                DEJESUS
                   Help me, Jonesy.  Oh, God,
                   help me!  It's getting inside
                   me, I can feel it!

     He keeps coming at Jones who backs away slowly from his
     friend.

                                JONES
                   Hazy, please...I'm going to
                   get you some help, man...just
                   don't touch me...

     Jones finds himself backing away until he is by the door to
     the Galley.  He closes it, rushing through into the Mess to
     the Ring corridor where he runs into Cobb.

                                COBB
                   What's going on?

                                JONES
                   It's Hazy...It's got him!
                   Stay here and don't let him
                   out.  I'm going to get the Doc.

     Jones runs out and leaves Cobb by the door.  Cobb watches
     him go.  As the noise in the Mess intensifies, we hear
     banging on the door, then DeJesus' anguished cries.

                                DEJESUS
                   Help me!  Help me!

     Cobb backs slowly down the corridor toward the dorm.

     UPPER RING CORRIDOR - SAME

     Jones meets Beck and Doc leaving the control room.

                                JONES
                   It's got Hazy!

                                BECK
                   What has?

                                JONES
                   One of those chunks of
                   Sixpack!  Like a big leech,
                   with those teeth!...

                                DOC
                   We've got to get him to the
                   infirmary.

                                JONES
                   What are you going to do to
                   him?

                                DOC
                   I'm going to try to remove it.

                                JONES
                   I've got Cobbie downstairs
                   watching the door.

     INT. LOWER RING CORRIDOR - SAME

     Deserted.  There is no sign of Cobb and the door to the mess
     stands open.  The mess is empty.  Beck is the first one down
     the ladder followed by Jones.

                                JONES
                   Cobb?  Hazy?  Oh, shit...He's
                   gone...

     Cobb returns with a mining tool.

                                JONES
                   You let him get away!

                                COBB
                   I ain't doing nothing for that
                   thing without something to
                   defend myself.

                                JONES
                   That thing happens to be
                   my friend.

                                BECK
                   Shut up, both of you!  We've
                   got to find it.

     Beck suddenly looks around noticing something.

                                BECK(cont'd)
                   Where's Willie?

                                COBB
                   Oh, God, she's out there...

                                BECK
                   Jones...come with me.  Cobb,
                   you and Doc check the rooms.

     INT. THE LOWER "B" CORRIDOR - SAME

     Jones and Beck move down the spooky corridor toward the
     Swamp.  Overhead, water moves through the desalinization
     conduit.  Jones eyes it warily.

     SWAMP

     They enter the quiet Swamp.  The suits hang silently like
     sleeping monsters.  Beck steps into the equipment room.

     Jones walks along the suits which hang in front of him.
     Their empty masks stare at him hauntingly.  He reaches the
     end and stands in front of the ladder where we earlier saw
     Willie doing chin-ups.  He looks down and sees her headband
     floating in the bilgewater.

                                JONES
                   Willie...

     Suddenly Willie lowers herself from the bar behind him.

                                WILLIE
                   Yeah?

     The sudden sight of her nearly gives Jones heart failure, he
     stumbles backwards into the ankle deep water and Willie
     drops from the bar laughing.

                                WILLIE
                                (grinning)
                   What on earth's the matter
                   with you?

                                JONES
                   I ought to smack your face!

     Willie picks up the strain in Jones' voice, her smile fades.

                                WILLIE
                   What's wrong?

                                JONES
                   DeJesus...It's got him.

     THE EQUIPMENT ROOM - SAME

     Jones, Willie and Beck move quickly.  Beck pulls a portable
     laser drill which fits into the arm of the mechanical suits
     and attaches a portable power unit to the back.  Turning it
     on it becomes a sinister close-range weapon.

     Willie opens an equipment cabinet and reveals deflated
     container transporters.  Beck notices and then looks up at
     Jones who opens a locked cabinet and takes out the bicycle
     pump/earthquake device we saw Willie use earlier.

                                BECK
                   I thought they were your friends?

                                JONES
                   Were, Doss were.

     Beck reaches out and takes the powerful weapon away from
     him.

                                BECK
                   You fire that in here and
                   you'll bring the whole place
                   down.

     Jones thinks about it for a moment, then reaches for one of
     the Acetylene tanks.  He lights the end of it and a long
     blue tongue of flame whips out the door into the Swamp.
     Jones grins.

     INFIRMARY - SAME

     Doc and Cobb move into the Infirmary.  Doc goes into his
     office.  He takes three scalpels out of an equipment drawer
     and then looks up, through the levolor blinds into the
     infirmary.  What he sees upsets him.

     INT. SWAMP - SAME

     Jones working the intercom.

                                JONES
                                (to intercom)
                   Jones to Doc.  Doc?...Cobb?

     He looks back to Beck, concerned.

                                JONES(cont'd)
                                (to Beck)
                   Think it got 'em?

                                BECK
                   No, it's not going through.
                   The intercom's busted.  I thought
                   DeJesus fixed that?

                                JONES
                                (beat, realizing)
                   He did.

     INFIRMARY - SAME

     Doc leaves his office and slowly goes into the Infirmary to
     the storage counter across the room--where the blood is
     stored.  WE SEE what disturbed him...the door to the
     refrigeration unit is ajar.  Doc opens the door to the
     cabinet.  The plastic bags are now empty.  Each one has been
     drained.

     LOWER RING CORRIDOR - SAME

     Cobb moves out of the Infirmary, carefully down the eerie
     corridor, his mining tool in front of him for security.
     There is a sinister feel to the place.  Each step only
     reveals a little bit of space ahead of him.  Suddenly he
     stops.  In front of him across the hall a cabinet which
     says:  ONBOARD COMMUNICATIONS, is torn open.  It is where
     DeJesus fixed the intercom the day before.

     CLOSE ON THE CABINET

     The door is shattered.  Carefully, Cobb opens the door and
     WE SEE the guts of the wiring have been torn out--the entire
     system has been disabled.

     Cobb carefully examines the damage WHEN SUDDENLY A SCALY
     HAND-LIKE APPENDAGE slams into the cabinet door trapping
     COBB and sending his weapon to the floor.  Cobb turns
     directly into

     THE LEECH-LIKE MOUTH!  It's sharp teeth shine in the light,
     poised to strike.

     Cobb's eyes closed, screams like a maniac, waiting for the
     tentacle to attack.  Then suddenly an UNGODLY SCREAM echoes
     in the corridor.

     COBB opens his eyes to see the tentacle gone.  Doc is
     holding the smoking mining drill, his eyes glazed, as if he
     has seen the devil itself.

                                COBB
                   What happened?

                                DOC
                                (absently)
                   It...almost got you.

                                COBB
                   What was it?

     Doc shakes his head dumbly.  He is in total shock.

     THE MESS

     The remaining group is assembled around the table.  Jones
     watches the door with one of the homemade flamethrowers.  He
     listens.

                                COBS
                                (excitedly)
                   I saw it!  It's big!

                                BECK
                   Big?

                                JONES
                   Bigger than DeJesus?  How?

                                DOC
                   It's had a meal.

     He holds out the empty blood bags.  A change has come over
     Doc since Bowman's death.  The experience has slightly
     deadened him.

                                WILLIE
                   It needs blood?

                                JONES
                   Fucking great...You telling
                   me we got a fucking dracula
                   in here with us?

                                DOC
                   It would explain the suction-
                   like appendages.

                                JONES
                   Like a leech.

                                BECK
                   That's why there's a dead one
                   on the ship.  It ran out of blood.

                                JONES
                   What dead one on the ship?

     He looks from Doc to Beck.

                                JONES(cont'd)
                                (sharply)
                   Someone want to let the rank
                   and file in on your little
                   secret?

     Doc looks at Beck, then Jones.

                                DOC
                   The monster appears to be
                   a genetic aberration...

                                JONES
                   No fuckin' lie...

                                DOC
                   ...It has many traits of deep
                   sea marine life...regeneration,
                   scales, gills, even a period
                   of dormancy...
                                (more to Beck)
                   but the fact that it remembered
                   where the plasma was stored, or
                   where the communication wiring was,
                   may imply that it has some other
                   quality...

                                COBB
                                (panicky)
                   What?...What?

     Beck locks eyes with Doc.

                                BECK
                                (to Doc)
                   That it acquires intelligence
                   from its victims?

                                DOC
                   Intelligence may not be the right
                   word...

                                JONES
                   Fuck semantics, Doc!
                   You saying its like part
                   DeJesus, part Sixpack, part
                   Bowman?!

                                DOC
                                (tiredly)
                   I don't know.  I'm guessing.

                                COBB
                                (losing it)
                   I say we should go get in the
                   escape bubbles and get the hell
                   out of here!

                                JONES
                   And hit the surface in the
                   middle of a typhoon?...No, thank you.
                   I'll take my chance down here.

     Willie looks at Beck.

                                WILLIE
                   What can we do?

                                BECK
                   Our only chance is to lure
                   it to the Swamp and flush it
                   like we did the other.

                                COBB
                   And how're we going to do that?

     Beck checks his flamethrower and looks at Jones.

                                                     TIME CUT TO

     THE MESS - LATER

     ON BECK  He flexes his arm as a needle is taken from it.  WE
     SEE a half-pint of blood in a bag, held by Doc.  He secures
     it and hands it back to Beck.

                                DOC
                   Be careful with it.

                                BECK
                   Don't worry, I don't want to
                   give up any more.

     He looks over at Jones who watches the door.  Jones looks
     back and nods.  The coast is clear.

     LOWER RING CORRIDOR - SAME

     The door to the Mess opens and Beck slips into the shadows
     of the hall.  A second later Jones follows.  In the dim
     light they begin moving toward the Lower "B" corridor to the
     Swamp.

     MESS - SAME

     Cobb, Doc and Willie alone in the Mess.  Cobb scratches his
     bandage.  Doc notices.

                                DOC
                   Still bothering you?

                                COBB
                   Itches like hell.

                                DOC
                   Take it off and let me have
                   a look.

     Cobb pulls back the bandage and looks at the gash.

     INSERT COBB'S WOUND  Pink and healing.

                   Looks good to me.  I'll re-bandage
                   it, though.

     He looks at Willie.

                                DOC(cont'd)
                   Willie, would you clean it
                   for me.  I'm going to the
                   infirmary for supplies.

     He turns and Willie stops him with a firm grip.

                                WILLIE
                   You can't go out there alone.

                                DOC
                   I'm the Doctor.  I have to
                   do what's best for this crew.
                                (he pulls away)
                   I need my bag.

     THE LOWER RING CORRIDOR - SAME

     The door opens and carefully Doc steps out into the
     corridor.  He looks toward the Infirmary then starts up the
     ladder to the Upper Level instead.

     CLOSE ON DROPS OF BLOOD INTO A SMALL POOL

     a grisly sight.

     WE PULL BACK TO REVEAL the drops coming from the plasma bag
     of Beck's blood.  Beck stops the drip and moves on into the
     darkness of the corridor.

     CONTROL ROOM

     Doc moves behind the computer keyboard in the dim light of
     the Control room.  His face lit by the computer monitor.  He
     types furiously.

     COMPUTER SCREEN

     "Emergency Escape Bubbles...ready for activation..."

     DOC pauses looking at the message, then moves his hand to
     the SEND command and presses it.

     THE MESS - LATER

     Willie prepares a clean bandage as Doc examines the cut.  He
     smiles at Cobb like a friendly country doctor.  The tired look
     now gone from his eyes.  He seems revitalized.

                                DOC
                   There, good as new.  Just
                   keep your paws off of it.
                                (to Willie)
                   Do you have the new bandage ready?

     She nods.  Doc turns back to the sink and Cobb holds out his
     arm to let Willie put the new bandage on.  As Cobb's arm
     comes up we suddenly notice a slight movement under his
     shirt.  Willie stops just before applying the bandage.  The
     movement intensifies--like snakes moving wildly beneath the
     cloth.  Cobb whitens...breaks out in a sweat.  Willie backs
     off.

                                WILLIE
                   Doc?...Doc!

     She steps back and Doc moves into her place as suddenly a
     leech-mouthed tentacle erupts from Cobb's waist.  It's razor
     sharp proboscis punctures Doc's chest right at the heart and
     the leach mouth with it's hundreds of teeth attaches with
     vacuum-like suction.

                                DOC
                   No!

     But it is too late.  Willie falls back screaming as Cobb's
     gash RRRRRRRIPS OPEN!  THE FLESH OPENING GROTESQUELY FROM
     THE INSIDE AND INVERTS SCALY--SPREADING OVER COBB'S BODY
     LIKE A BUSHFIRE!

     CORRIDOR "B"

     CLOSE ON THE POOL OF BLOOD

     A huge shadow falls over the pool left by Beck.  A scaly
     tentacle suddenly whips across the floor.  The DEJESUS
     CREATURE!  WE SEE THE FLASH OF ITS APPENDAGES.  IT'S HEAD.
     AN EYE OPENS AND LOOKS UP.

     WHAT IT SEES  The outline of Beck lying "hurt" fifty feet
     away.

     It starts down the corridor toward it's prey--Beck.

     ON BECK

     A little behind him with the homemade flamethrower, Jones
     waits in the shadows.  Suddenly Beck hears something.

                                BECK
                                (whispers)
                   I hear something. Don't fire
                   until we're both in the Swamp.

     Jones moves a little farther back.

                                BECK(cont'd)
                   Don't let him see you.

                                JONES
                   Don't worry...

     As the Creature approaches WE SEE Beck stand up like a
     wounded animal.  He begins dragging his "injured" leg behind
     him as he retreats toward the Swamp.  THE FOOTSTEPS MOVE
     FASTER.  IT'S CLOSING!

     INT. RING CORRIDOR - SAME

     ON WILLIE  She bursts out the door to the MESS and heads
     toward Corridor "B."

     DOOR TO THE SWAMP

     Beck moves through the door to the Swamp and positions
     himself by the door.  He looks back and WE SEE Jones for the
     first time, flamethrower poised, ready to fire.

                                JONES
                   C'mon baby c'mon...

     ON THE SHADOW OF THE CREATURE

     It moves steadily toward the door, moving right to the
     doorway.  Carefully it moves a dark, horrible hand-like
     appendage inside the doorframe.

     ON BECK AND JONES

     poised to kill when suddenly both men hear the same thing.

                                WILLIE'S VOICE(O.S.)
                   Beck?  Jones!?

     ON WILLIE

     She turns the corner and freezes.  There, less than ten feet
     away is the Creature.  A tentacle whips excitedly like a
     tail!

                                WILLIE
                   Oh God...

     AS THE CREATURE starts to turn for Willie, Beck suddenly
     closes the vault-like door to the swamp on Creature's hand,
     trapping it vise-like in the door.

                                BECK
                   Run Willie!  Run!

     The Creature throws back its head and SCREAMS in pain as the
     heavy door severs its appendage.

     ON BECK AND JONES

     As the writhing hand-like appendage squirms in front of them
     Jones blasts it with his flamethrower until the hand curls
     like a piece of bacon and it ceases to move.

                                JONES
                   Well done.  Just like
                   momma makes 'em.

     Beck opens the door--the corridor is empty.  Willie and the
     creature are gone.

     ON WILLIE RUNNING

     She heads back toward the Ring corridor around the inner
     path toward Corridor "A".  In a full run now, every panel
     and instrument looks even more sinister--where is Cobb/Doc
     CREATURE?---

     ON THE DEJESUS CREATURE'S SEVERED APPENDAGE

     As the Creature moves after Willie we see its bloody stump
     suddenly sprout a new appendage!  Like a starfish it grows
     another leech like tentacle to replace the one it lost.

     ON WILLIE

     She turns down Corridor "A".  A NOISE overhead in the water
     conduit causes her to look up WHEN SUDDENLY A BLACK ARM
     REACHES OUT FROM THE SHADOWS, AND PULLS HER INTO THE DARK
     DOORWAY TO THE MACHINE FLOOR----IT IS JONES!  He pulls her
     between him and Beck in the shadows.

                                BECK
                                (whispered)
                   Where's Cobb and Doc?

                                WILLIE
                                (recovering)
                   Cobb's cut...It was in him!
                   It got Doc...

                                JONES
                   Oh man, that's just great...

                                BECK
                   C'mon.

     CONTROL ROOM

     Beck is followed inside by Jones and Willie.  It is empty.

                                BECK
                   Lock the door.

     Jones rolls the large vault-like door closed and locks them.
     Beck goes to the console and checks the instruments.
     Suddenly he sees something that causes him to freeze in his
     tracks.  A red light blinks ominously on the console.

                                BECK
                   Shit!  He sent them all.

                                WILLIE
                   The escape bubbles?

     She and Jones stop in front of Doc's console.

                                JONES
                                (gravely)
                   Look at this.

     Beck looks at Doc's computer screen.

     ON SCREEN WE SEE DOC'S MESSAGE:  "...hope that our sacrifice
     will mean that the human race will never know this awful
     mutation..."

                                WILLIE
                   What is it?

                                JONES
                   The good doctor signed our
                   death warrant.

     SUDDENLY THERE IS A TREMENDOUS BANGING ON THE DOOR!  LIKE A
     HUNDRED SLEDGEHAMMERS POUNDING THE HEAVY STEEL DOOR TRYING
     TO BREAK IT DOWN.  Jones readies his weapon but just as
     suddenly, the BANGING STOPS.  Beck, Willie and Jones all
     nervously exchange looks.

                                WILLIE
                   Well, at least we're safe inside
                   here.

                                JONES
                   For how long?

     Beck slides behind the Console and quickly types in a
     message.  WE SEE IT ON THE SCREEN.  "SHACK SIX REPORTING.
     PLEASE DISREGARD PREVIOUS MESSAGE---"

     SUDDENLY MARTIN'S FACE APPEARS ON THE VIDEO SCREEN.

                                MARTIN
                   Thank goodness, you're still
                   alive!

                                JONES
                                (yells nervously
                                at the screen)
                   Hey, man, you better get
                   your ass out here right now
                   and get us.  You hear me,
                   motherfucker?  Right now!

     Martin smiles calmly back at the three of them.

                                MARTIN
                   Please relax, Mr. Jones.  Every-
                   thing is under control.  Naturally,
                   when we received Dr. Warren's
                   message we were concerned but
                   would never have deserted you.

     Jones lets out a breath.  Willie stares straight at the
     screen.

                                WILLIE
                   When are you coming for us?

                                MARTIN
                                (smiles nervously)
                   Well, that's the bad news.
                   The typhoon did turn your way.
                                (he looks at weather
                                printout)
                   Right now it is on a course--

                                JONES
                   Just answer the question, man!
                   When are you coming?!

                                MARTIN
                                (beat)
                   Hopefully in the next 48 hours.

                                BECK
                   Forty-eight hours!

                                MARTIN
                   I realize you must have gone
                   through hell--

                                JONES
                   Gone?  Man, we're still here!

                                MARTIN
                                (firmly)
                   I can't change the weather.
                   Try to get some rest.  I'll
                   keep you posted.

     He turns off his screen and the picture in front of Beck,
     Jones and Willie goes blank.

                                BECK
                   He's right.  Why don't you get some
                   rest.  I'll stand the first watch.

                                             TIME CUT TO

     CONTROL ROOM - LATER

     Jones sits near the vent sound asleep, his weapon across
     his stomach.  Near him Willie lies still, eyes open.  She
     watches Beck across the room, standing at the window.

     He stares outside into the darkness for a moment, then
     as if a thought suddenly occurs to him he looks at the
     blank computer screen.

     CLOSE ON COMPUTER SCREEN

     "Request weather summaries January 14-21."  The cursor
     blinks back ominously then races across the screen.  "FILE
     CLOSED."

                                BECK
                                (to himself)
                   Martin, you asshole...

     Suddenly he hears a voice behind him.

                                WILLIE
                   They know, don't they?

                                BECK
                                (quietly)
                   Yeah...I think they're just
                   deciding what to do with us.

                                WILLIE
                   Maybe they already have.

     She moves into Doc's seat in front of the console and calls
     up the stock market program that Bowman was monitoring
     earlier.

     ON SCREEN  WE SEE:  Stock prices.

     Willie types in a series of commands.

                                BECK
                   What are you doing?

                                WILLIE
                   Seeing how my stock's doing...

     ON SCREEN:  The words TransOcean Corp.  The capsulized report
     comes up on screen:  "TransOcean Corp. took a bath on world
     markets today when news of a tragic mining accident was
     revealed to investors.  The Board of Directors...."

                                WILLIE
                                (impatiently)
                   Where?....

     She scrolls forward in the report and suddenly freezes the
     words.

     THE SCREEN:  "...accident took place in Shack Six, Southeast
     Sector of Pacific Zone 10...Seven dead.  All bodies
     missing."  Their names follow.

     ON WILLIE  as her name comes up she shivers.

                                BECK
                   I can't believe they'd
                   just leave us.

     A voice behind them causes them to turn.

                                JONES
                   Welcome to the union, boss.
                   We're all expendable.

     He is now awake.  He sits up against the air vent.  Suddenly,
     Beck listens, the room is deathly silent.  He looks over to
     the air vent.  Jones is listening also.

                                WILLIE
                   What is it?

                                JONES
                   The air's stopped.

     WHOOP!  WHOOP!  Suddenly a KLAXON HORN sounds hysterically.
     A blue light on the console blinks on and off.  It says
     "AIR."  Beck turns to the instruments.

                                BECK
                   We're on backup air.

                                WILLIE
                   How much time does that give
                   us?

                                BECK
                   Less than an hour.  It's ruptured
                   an air duct.

                                WILLIE
                   Can't we fix it?

                                JONES
                   There're twenty miles of
                   pipe in the bilge, they
                   could have tapped-in anywhere.

     SUDDENLY WE HEAR A SOUND WE HAVEN'T HEARD IN A LONG TIME.
     The RATTLE THAT JONES AND COBB FIXED.  Jones and Beck home
     in on the tell-tale noise.

                                JONES
                                (almost to himself)
                   Cobb...Job security...

     He locks eyes with Beck.

                                BECK
                   They're drawing us out.

     He leaves his seat and Jones checks his weapon as Willie
     watches.

                                WILLIE
                   You can't go out there, that's
                   what they want.

     Beck checks his make-shift flamethrower.

                                BECK
                   We don't have much choice...
                   without air, the internal
                   pressure will fall and--

                                JONES
                   Crunch...Implosion.

     Willie watches them a moment then picks up one of the mining
     tools, the laser-drill, she powers-it up to check it.  Her
     action stops both men and she catches their looks.

                                WILLIE
                   You don't think I'm sitting
                   in here, do you?

     INT. CORRIDOR "A" - SAME

     Carefully the three move into the Lower Ring Corridor.  As
     they move we suddenly hear a new sound, DEEP, LIKE DISTANT
     THUNDER.  The sides of the shack tremble slightly.

                                WILLIE
                                (low)
                   The shack...

                                JONES
                   She's wondering what's
                   happening.  We're losing
                   air faster than I thought.

                                BECK
                                (to Jones)
                   Which way?

     Jones moves to the lead and turns down Corridor "A."

     INT. CORRIDOR "A"

     The SOUND of the power-wrench removing the bolts from the
     flooring.  The cover is removed and Beck and Jones peer down
     into the darkness.  Willie stands guard with the flame-
     thrower.

     ON JONES  He peers into the darkness below.  He wasn't a big
     fan of the bilge even before the Creature, now he's scared
     shitless.

                                BECK
                   I'll go first.

     Before Jones can protest Beck drops the ladder and climbs
     down into the dark bilge.  Jones waits till he's at the
     bottom, then starts down behind him.  Willie looks back.

                                WILLIE
                   Don't spend all day down
                   there.

                                JONES
                   Don't fuckin' worry, I
                   ain't.

     BILGE

     From somewhere in the darkness we hear the HISSING SOUND OF
     ESCAPING OXYGEN and the FAMILIAR RATTLE OF THE AIR SYSTEM.
     As soon as Jones reaches the bottom rung Beck shines a light
     into the eerie underground area.

     Pipes run overhead and on the walls.  A broken electrical
     conduit sparks over their heads.  The floor is ankle deep in
     greasy water.  They start toward the noise.

     ON WILLIE

     Her back is to the solid wall(outside wall).  Her eyes move
     from one end of the corridor to the other, not lingering
     long enough to distract her.  Sweat runs down her face and
     we hear another tremor in the Shack.

                                WILLIE
                                (to herself,
                                calming herself)
                   Okay, Williams...let's hear a
                   tune.
                                (beat, quietly
                                at first)
                   "Off we go...into the wild
                   blue yonder..."

     ANOTHER RUMBLE FROM THE SHACK causes her to pause.  She
     catches her breath and starts again.

                                WILLIE(cont'd)
                   "...flying high into the sky..."

     She suddenly looks into the Main machine area (behind the
     wire mesh of the other wall).  Was it something moving?

     BILGE

     ON BECK  He moves around a corner we recognize from before
     with Jones' and Cobb's repair.  Beck floods the area with
     light and the break in the line is visible.  The pipe has
     been torn from the wall, it is totally unreparable.  What's
     worse, electrical wires hang down, showering sparks into the
     water.

                                JONES
                   Jesus Christ...

                                BECK
                   Can you fix it?

                                JONES
                   No way...

                                BECK
                   Think!  Can we stop it?!
                   Block it up?!  Shut down
                   the line somewhere?!  Think!

                                JONES
                   I am thinking, man!  You
                   think I want to die!  I am
                   thinking!  I--

     Suddenly his eyes widen.  Beck sees this and turns.  In his
     light WE SEE THE GLINT OF LONG TEETH AND THE HUGE BLACK
     FRAME OF THE COBB/DOC CREATURE!  It's leech-like appendage
     whipping in front of it like an excited cat's tail.  Before
     it can strike, Jones pushes Beck out of the way and fires a
     blast of flame from his flamethrower.  The CREATURE SCREAMS
     and disappears.

     As Beck falls his light lands in the bilge water and goes
     out sending the bilge into greater darkness.

                                JONES
                   I hit it.  But I can't see
                   it!  Can you see it?!

                                BECK
                                (standing)
                   No.

     Jones looks back at the ruptured pipe and suddenly has a
     thought.

                                JONES
                   The Swamp.  There's an over-
                   ride switch in the Swamp.

     They start for the ladder when WWWWHHHHHHHHIP! out of the
     darkness the appendage wraps like a bullwhip around Jones'
     arm.  The deadly proboscis, which stabbed Cobb, is poised
     like a dagger about to be plunged into the black man's
     thigh.

                                JONES
                                (screams)
                   Ahhh!

     Instinctively Beck whips out the mining saw and severs the
     tentacle.  The unseen Creature's SCREAM echoes through the
     Bilge.  Beck grabs Jones by the arm and pulls him toward the
     ladder.

                                BECK
                   Hurry...Get out!

     Quickly they slosh toward the ladder and hole in the floor
     fifteen feet away, moving closer...ten...eight....then
     suddenly ANOTHER APPENDAGE thrusts between the rungs of the
     ladder at them.  Beck ducks and leaps to the side.  He is
     less than six feet from the Creature.  In the dim light WE
     SEE it wickedly bare its teeth.

     Beck's eyes go to the walls from one side to the other and
     spot the exposed power cable.  The Creature steps forward
     directly under the hole in the floor.  It is about to lunge
     when a voice from above distracts it.

                                WILLIE'S VOICE(O.C.)
                   Hey, you?

     The Creature looks up and sees:

     ON WILLIE STANDING OVER THE OPENING, HER FLAMETHROWER
     POINTED STRAIGHT DOWN.  SHE FIRES, SENDING A SEARING BLUE
     FLAME INTO THE BILGE.

     BECK watches the flame roar down on the monster and it gives
     him the moment of distraction he needs.  He leaps out of the
     bilge water and onto a pipe on the wall then rips the broken
     power cable from the wall.

                                BECK
                   Jones!  Get your feet out
                   of the water!

     Jones jumps up and grabs a pipe running overhead as Beck
     thrusts the sparking cable into the water at the Creature's
     feet.

     IN A BLINDING FLASH OF ELECTRICITY

     The current surges through the Cobb/Doc Creature sending it
     instantly rigid.  A second later it crashes forward into the
     water.

     Moving hand over hand toward the ladder Jones quickly climbs
     out, followed by Beck.

     THE SHACK CONTINUES TO SHAKE, EACH JOLT STRONGER THAN THE
     LAST.  As they emerge Willie helps them.

                                BECK
                   C'mon, the Swamp!

     They start for the Swamp down Corridor "A" when an enormous
     shudder goes through the Shack, causing the lights to blink
     and the floor to open beneath Beck.  The jolt knocks him
     back into the bilge.  Only grabbing onto the pipes just
     above the water stops him from falling back in.

     JONES stops and looks back over the missing grating.

                                JONES
                   Beck!

     Jones moves instinctively back for him, but another jolt
     only widens the gap.  Beck yells to be heard over the din of
     the collapsing Shack.

                                BECK
                   Go on!

                                JONES
                   No!

                                BECK
                   That's an order!

                                JONES
                   Fuck your orders!

     He leaps across the gap onto a remaining grating and thrusts
     his hand down into the darkness.  Beck lets go of one hand,
     then the other, to grab Jones' extended arm.  In one
     Herculean effort Jones pulls him out of the bilge.  Together
     they leap across the chasm as the Desalinization Conduit
     collapses over their heads and water floods into Corridor "A"
     behind them.  They have to go around the other way!

     AS THEY RUN

     KLAXON HORNS SOUND and a RECORDED FEMALE VOICE warns:  "Five
     minutes until implosion..."

     FLASH CUTS OF:

     THE LIGHTS FLICKER AND FAIL, CAUSING THE EMERGENCY LIGHTING
     TO GO ON, AND CASTING AN EERIE STROBE EFFECT ON THE ESCAPING
     THREE CREW MEMBERS

     FALLING CEILING BEAMS CRASH DOWN IN FRONT AND BEHIND...

     SEAMS BEND UNDER THE STRAIN, RIVETS POP...

     STRAINING MACHINES SEND SCALDING GEYSERS OF STEAM INTO THE
     CORRIDORS...AND SUDDENLY THE FLOOR GIVES WAY BENEATH WILLIE!
     She leaps up and grabs an overhanging pipe and swings to the
     firm ground.

     JONES LEADS THE WAY TOWARD THE SWAMP, WITH WILLIE BEHIND
     HIM, AND BECK COVERING THE REAR.

     THEY reach the end of the corridor and Willie and Jones turn
     into the Swamp Annex.  Willie hits the door opener.  RRRRRR
     IT DOESN'T BUDGE.  The pressure has bent the door frame.

     BECK ARRIVES

                                WILLIE
                   It's jammed!

     Immediately Beck backtracks to the corridor and pulls a hand
     held spreader--like a "Jaws of Life"--from the wall.  He
     turns back to the Swamp when a BLACK SCALY ARM SUDDENLY
     BURSTS THROUGH THE WIRE MESH OF THE MACHINE FLOOR AND PULLS
     BECK AGAINST THE WIRE!  IT IS THE DEJESUS CREATURE.

     His head held in place by the powerful arm, Beck looks
     almost directly into the dark eyes of the Creature.  Its
     gill-like slits flare.  Its mouth opens and we see a flash
     of its razor sharp teeth.

     Before Beck can move the leech-like appendage ruptures the
     steel mesh and its razor-sharp proboscis plunges like a
     knife for Beck's face.  At the last instant Beck move his
     head and the proboscis slams into the steel mesh.  The mesh
     loosens the creature's grip and Beck manages to reach a
     mining drill from the tools on the wall.  As the appendage
     starts to strike again Beck buries the whining tool into the
     Creature's tentacle and breaks free.

     Scooping up the spreader Beck rushes to the Swamp door where
     Jones and Willie are trying vainly to hand crank the door
     open.

                                JONES
                   Where the hell've you been?

                                BECK
                   I got hung up!  Try this!

     Willie stands back and Beck thrusts the Spreader into the
     tiny crack in the door the hand crank had made.  With Jones'
     help the two men force open the door and all three rush
     inside the SWAMP.  Beck closes the door behind them.

     THE RECORDED FEMALE VOICE INTONES:  "Five minutes to
     implosion."  And we feel it happening:

     THE BILGE WATER ON THE FLOOR OF THE SWAMP RIPPLES WITH THE
     VIBRATIONS

     THE WALLS SHAKE

     THE HUGE METAL SUITS ROCK LIKE CLOTHES ON A CLOTHES LINE.
     ONE FALLS AND CRASHES INTO THE WATER

     JONES throws open the control panel and grabs the red
     handled emergency air switch, but he can only move it half
     way!  It is jammed by the pressure.

                                JONES
                   It won't go!

     Willie grabs it with him, but even together it is not
     enough.  THE HANDLE BREAKS OFF IN THEIR HANDS!

     STEAM JETS WHIP DOWN ON THEM FROM ABOVE!

     THE WATER AT THEIR FEET NOW BOILS FROM VIBRATION!

     THE FEMALE VOICE INTONES:  "Four minutes..."

     BECK TURNS AND SEES THE SUITS IN THE LOCK

     He grabs Willie and pushes her toward the Lock where her
     suit hangs.

                                BECK
                   The suits!  Get in them!

     Willie moves quickly but Jones doesn't.

                                JONES
                   The suits!  Are you crazy!
                   How're we going to get to
                   the surface?

     Beck yanks open the equipment locker revealing TANKS OF
     COMPRESSED AIR AND DEFLATED CONTAINER TRANSPORTERS.

                                BECK
                   Like this.

     He looks up at Jones who grins with renewed hope and they
     begin pulling the equipment out.

                                BECK(cont'd)
                   Get them in the Lock!

     Jones and Beck drag the tanks and the parachute-like
     Container transporters to the lock.

     ON WILLIE  She climbs into her suit and activates her
     generator.  Instantly her Vital Signs spring to life around
     the perimeter of her helmet.

     THE FEMALE VOICE TREMBLES FROM THE VIBRATIONS..."Three
     minutes...to...implosion..."

     Beck and Jones throw the last of the supplies onto the
     elevator and Beck holds out the SEISMIC TOOL Jones tried to
     arm himself with earlier.  He takes the tool from Beck and
     sticks it in the vest of his wet suit.

     Then suddenly he sees that there are only two suits in the
     Lock.  Beck will have to wait on his to move along the track
     to the Lock.

                                JONES
                   Your suit, Becky!

                                BECK
                   Just get in yours!

     Jones climbs onto the Lock platform and slides into his
     suit.

     Beck hits the Suit track button and his suit begins moving
     along the track toward the Lock.  A suit turns the corner
     from the storage room followed by one labeled BECK.

     Beck looks at the walls, they're shaking harder.  He moves
     along the suit rack when suddenly THE CREATURE BURSTS FROM
     BEHIND THE SUITS SHATTERING THEM LIKE AN EXPLOSION!  A HUGE
     TENTACLE HURLS TOWARD BECK LIKE A SPEAR.

     BECK ducks just in time, grabbing a fire ax and chopping off
     the appendage.  Another tentacle jabs for Beck.

                                WILLIE
                                (screams)
                   Look out!

     But it is too late.  It knocks the ax from Beck's hand and
     sends him to the floor.  Beck looks up at the Lock in time to
     see Jones seal himself into his suit.

                                JONES/RADIO
                   I'm in.

                                BECK
                                (to the others)
                   Go!

                                WILLIE/RADIO
                   No!

     THE CREATURE APPROACHES BECK

     Beck looks at the others one last time.

                                BECK
                   Go, now!  That's an order!

     Jones hits the elevator button and the Lock closes as the
     elevator sends them down without Beck.

     BECK stands and arms himself with a mining drill, which he
     swings at the Creature driving it back.  As Beck gets the
     upper hand, the Creature turns its hideous face and Beck
     freezes.  There attached to the back of the Creature's head
     is the grotesque face of DeJesus!

     DeJesus' eyes suddenly blink.  He's still alive!  His lips
     tremble in agony.

                                DEJESUS
                   Kill me...Kill me!

     Beck, momentarily stopped by the face, lunges forward with
     the drill and embeds it in the side of the Creature.

     As the Creature falls back hurt, Beck looks up at the lock
     elevator as it returns--IT IS EMPTY--The others have made it
     out!  His suit continues down the track and stops in the
     Lock.  He still has to make it, if he can just get there!

     THE RECORDED FEMALE VOICE SOUNDS:  "One minute to
     implosion..."

     Beck races to the Lock and starts to climb into the suit.
     His arms slide into place, his legs drop into the heavy
     metal shell and as he seals up the back he activates the
     generator.

     BECK'S POV.  His vital signs light up around the perimeter
     of his helmet, but he sees something else--the Creature
     charges toward the Lock--its arm reaches out to yank Beck
     out of the elevator!  Instinctively, Beck swings his
     motorized leg into the Creature's snarling mouth, knocking
     it backwards and stunning it long enough for Beck to hit the
     elevator button.  BUT IT DOESN'T WORK!

                                BECK
                   No!

     He hits again, still nothing!

     THE RECORDED FEMALE VOICE..."Nineteen, eighteen..."  Her
     voice begins to quiver.

     BECK POUNDS ON THE BUTTON AND LOOKS UP JUST AS THE CREATURE
     DIVES FOR HIM, ITS HUGE SCALY HAND GRABBING HIM AROUND
     BECK'S LEG!

     CLOSE ON THE ELVATOR BUTTON  Beck pounds it one last time
     and NNNNNNNNNNNN!

     THE LOCK CLOSES, CRUSHING THE CREATURE AS IT FLUSHES BECK
     OUTSIDE SECONDS BEFORE THE ENTIRE STRUCTURE COLLAPSES WITH
     IMPLOSION AND SUDDENLY EXPLODES IN A HUGE SHUDDER OF ENERGY!

     UNDERWATER - LATER

     WHOOSH!  A parachute-like Container Transporter zoom toward
     the surface.  A heavy-suited crew member flashes past us.
     Its helmet light pierces the darkness, then disappears.  A
     moment later another Transporter follows, racing out of the
     darkness after the first.

     BECK'S POV  We see the vital signs lit in a ring around his
     helmet.  The depth gauge races past with blinding speed as
     he moves closer to the surface.

     WILLIE'S POV  She tilts her head upwards.  She snaps off her
     light and sees instead of black, a lighter gray, then
     suddenly faint traces of light in the water above her.  At
     first it seems like her eyes are playing tricks on her, then
     we see it again--a glimmer of light.

                                WILLIE(RADIO)
                   Light.  Beck, I see light!

     ON BECK

     He follows her look.  Light is coming fast, brightening as
     they rise.  The LED numbers inside their helmets click
     off..."125, 100, 75..."

                                BECK(RADIO)
                   Wait till you reach thirty-
                   five before you blow your suit...

                                WILLIE'S VOICE(RADIO)
                   Roger.

     WILLIE'S POV  Her numbers count down "....70, 60, 50, 40..."

                                WILLIE(RADIO)
                   Ejecting.

     She yanks at the handle on the chest plate and WHOOSH!  The
     plate bursts open and reveals a second interior handle.  Her
     hand gropes for it.

     SUNLIGHT IS STREAMING DOWN THROUGH THE WATER AS SHE RUSHES
     UPWARD.

     WHOOSH!  The helmet and torso of the suit are blown open as
     she pulls the second lever detaching her from the balloons.

     No longer oxygen supported or being pulled upward, Willie
     frees herself from the heavy suit and swims to the surface.

     SUDDENLY SHE BREAKS THE SURFACE AND CATCHES A GLIMPSE OF THE
     SUN, DAZZLING THROUGH A MILLION DROPLETS OF WATER AS A HUGE
     SWELL CARRIES HER UP EVEN HIGHER.

     Then she's underwater again, struggling desperately to pull
     the tab on the life jacket around her neck.  Suddenly a MALE
     HAND GRABS THE TAB FOR HER AND PULLS.  She looks up at Beck.

                                WILLIE
                   We made it!

                                BECK
                   Where's Jones?

     Holding onto each other Willie and Beck ride a swell.  At
     the crest WE SEE JONES in the trough below, face down.  Beck
     breaks away from Willie and swims through the waves to reach
     Jones.  Reaching him Beck pulls his face out of the water
     and inflates his life jacket.

                                WILLIE
                   Is he okay?

     Beck lays Jones head back against the life jacket.  For a
     moment.  Jones seems lifeless, then his eyes blink and squint
     against the sunlight.  Beck turns back to Willie and as he
     and Jones ride the next crest he gives her the "thumbs-up."

                                WILLIE(cont'd)
                                (jubilant)
                   The sun!  The sun!

     Jones looks at Beck and grins.

                                JONES
                   What happened to that typhoon?

     CALM SEA - LATER

     BECK, WILLIE AND JONES cling to each other as they search
     the horizon.

                                WILLIE
                   Are you sure you saw something?

                                JONES
                   How many times I got to tell
                   you.  I saw a ship.

                                WILLIE
                   Well, why haven't they answered
                   our flares?

                                BECK
                   We'll fire one more, that
                   leaves us one last one.

     BECK pulls the flare off his latex wet suit and fires it
     into the sky casting a comforting yellow glow over the dark
     water.  The light fades, Willie looks at Jones.

                                WILLIE
                   Are you okay, Jonesy?

                                JONES
                                (weakly)
                   Tip top, Willie...tip top.

                                WILLIE
                                (testing him)
                   Who's the best power forward
                   in the NBA...Jameson?

                                JONES
                                (tired, but
                                with fight)
                   Jameson?  Who are you trying
                   to con...?

     They both manage a weak laugh, then Beck sees something.

                                BECK
                   I'll be damned.  Look!...A flare!

     As a small swell lifts them up we can see a tiny flare just
     fading against the sky.

                                WILLIE
                   It saw us!

                                JONES
                   Answer them and quit kicking me!

                                WILLIE
                   I'm not touching you!

     WHOOOOOOOOSH!  Beck fires another flare into the sky.  As the
     flare arcs downward, Willie feels another bump and for the
     first time sees the SHARKS CIRCLING THEM.

                                WILLIE
                   No...no, no, no.

     The SHARKS tighten the circle as the flare fades.

     EXT. U.S. COASTGUARD SHIP'S BRIDGE - SAME

     A CAPTAIN watches the flare fade through his binoculars and
     speaks to someone O.S.

                                CAPTAIN
                   I thought you said you'd
                   combed this area?

     He lowers his binoculars AS WE WIDEN TO REVEAL MARTIN
     standing on the bridge.  He also lowers his binoculars and
     smiles coolly as he lies.

                                MARTIN
                   We did....Many times.

                                CAPTAIN
                                (looks at Martin
                                then to a Lieutenant)
                   Initiate rescue.

     We hold on Martin's face as from

     THE FORE DECK OF THE SHIP

     A rescue chopper with pontoons lifts off the deck and banks
     off toward the fading flare.

     OCEAN - SAME

     Jones, Willie and Beck stay bunched close together.
     Suddenly Willie feels another bump.

                                WILLIE
                                (panicky)
                   It hit me!  Where are they?!

                                BECK
                   I can't see them!

     Suddenly he is bumped by a shark.  Willie sees one only two
     feet away.  They are surrounded.  Suddenly Jones stare to
     taunt the sharks aggressively.

                                JONES
                   All right!  I've had enough
                   of this shit!  You want meat,
                   motherfucker?  Come on, eat
                   me, sucker, try some dark meat!

     He pushes away from the group despite Beck's attempt to stop
     him.

                                JONES(cont'd)
                                (taunting sharks)
                   What's wrong you snout-nosed
                   bastards?  My meat too tough
                   for you?!

     Amazingly the sharks begin to disappear.  Willie and Beck
     watch stunned.  Even Jones is surprised.

                                JONES(cont'd)
                                (to Willie and Beck)
                   Whoa!  Did you see those fools
                   run?  They know whose boss.

     He jabs his arm upward in triumph and for the first time WE
     SEE a gash across his forearm.

     UNDERWATER POV

     As Jones crows triumphantly, WE SUDDENLY SEE HIS WET SUIT
     RIPPING ALONG HIS THIGHS!

     SURFACE/OCEAN

     Jones is chortling, suddenly his smile vanishes, something
     is happening...

     WE hear the DRONE OF THE APPROACHING HELICOPTER...THUMP,
     THUMP, THUMP...The blades of the helicopter sound out over
     the waves.  It's lights are visible.  Willie and Beck wave
     frantically as Jones drifts closer to them!

     UNDERWATER

     JONES' LEGS  His wet suit is now completely split open and
     WE SEE THE BLACK SCALES SPREADING!

     THE HELICOPTER

     hovers over the group below and lands on the water.  Its
     blades beat the surface into waves.  The WINCH OPERATOR
     hurls out a rescue harness and Beck helps Willie into the
     ring.  He CLICKS the fastener and suddenly they both lock
     eyes.  Before Willie can say anything Beck falls back and
     signals the Winch operator who begins hauling her to safety.
     Immediately Beck locks back at Jones and extends his arm.

                                BECK
                   Jonesy...Give me your hand!

     WILLIE reaches the helicopter and quickly climbs out of the
     harness.  The Winch operator throws it back across the water
     where

     BECK grabs the harness.

                                BECK
                   C'mon, Jones!

     Jones reaches out his hand.  He is almost there WHEN
     SUDDENLY RISING OUT OF THE WATER BEHIND THEM IS THE
     SIXPACK/BOWMAN CREATURE IN ALL ITS HIDEOUS GLORY!  HUGE AND
     GRUESOME, ITS LONG TEETH GLIMMER IN THE LIGHT.  IT GOES FOR
     BECK BUT JONES MOVES BETWEEN THEM.

                                BECK
                   Jonesy, No!

                                JONES
                   Get out of here, Becky!

     The Creature grabs Jones and pulls him violently under.
     Beck watches horrified as his friend disappears.  Numbed he
     clips the rescue harness around him when suddenly, WE SEE a
     boiling of water where Jones disappeared...bubbles
     rising...and then Jones' bloody and tattered life vest bobs
     to the surface several feet away from Beck.

     Beck reaches out for it just as the Creature appears again!
     It turns and focuses on Beck.  Beck keeps going for the life
     vest as the Creature starts for him.

     ON HELICOPTER

     The Winch operator and Willie watch in horror as the
     Creature bears down on Beck.

                                WINCH OPERATOR
                   Is he in the harness!

     CLOSE ON JONES' TATTERED VEST  Beck reaches it.  His fingers
     wrap around the bicycle pump-like, seismic tool in Jones'
     vest pocket.  The Creature is right on top of him!

     CHUNK, CHUNK, Beck cocks it like a pump shotgun as tentacles
     rise wickedly out of the water and wrap around Beck's body
     in a death grip.  It's horrible mouth starts to open.

                                BECK
                   C'mon, motherfucker open up!

     The Creature's mouth widens and as it starts to strike Beck
     thrusts the seismic tool into its gaping maw and is suddenly
     pulled from behind--out of the creature's grasp!  The rescue
     cable is taut!  The helicopter is taking off!

     BECK'S POV/ RISING SHOT.  Beck rises suddenly out of the
     water, the Creature growing instantly smaller below him
     until BOOM! the Seismic device explodes in the
     Sixpack/Bowman Creature, blowing it to bits across the ocean
     surface!  The shock wave sends the helicopter banking off
     toward the ship with Beck safely attached by cable below it.
     The winch operator pulls him in.

     EXT. COAST GUARD SHIP - LATER

     Beck, dressed now in crisp white clothes, stands on deck of
     the ship.  He glances occasionally at a door nearby marked
     INFIRMARY, then looks up as the Captain approaches and
     shakes his hand.

                                CAPTAIN
                   Mr. Beck, I understand
                   you passed your physical with
                   flying colors.  And Ms. Williams?

                                BECK
                                (worried)
                   I don't know yet, she's still
                   in there.

                                CAPTAIN
                   Well, you'll be glad to know
                   you have a friend onboard.

     Beck looks up surprised as suddenly Martin joins them.

                                MARTIN
                                (excitedly)
                   Beck!  I told them you'd
                   make it.  No one back at
                   TransOcean believed me, but
                   I never gave up on you once.
                                (smiling)
                   So, how are you feeling?

     Beck looks at Martin for an instant then hauls off and in
     one incredibly smooth punch knocks Martin on his can across
     the deck.

                                BECK
                   Better...A lot better.

     Just then the door to the infirmary opens and Willie appears
     with a new outfit on.  Smiles at Beck.

                                WILLIE
                   I'm fine!

     Beck lets out a slight sigh of relief as a STEWARD
     approaches with a tray of WHOLE COOKED FISH, HIDEOUS LOOKING
     THINGS LIKE ANGLERS, LOBSTERS, CRABS...MINIATURE LEVIATHAN.
     The sight is almost too intense for Beck and Willie.  The
     Captain notices.

                                CAPTAIN
                   I thought we might have some
                   wonderful seafood.  But, if there's
                   something else you'd rather have...

     Willie stares at the tray of seafood uneasily then looks at
     the Captain and smiles.

                                WILLIE
                   How about a burger and fries?

     She and Beck laugh as they sit at a finely set table on the
     deck with the Captain.

     AS WE PULL BACK the ship becomes smaller and smaller in the
     distance and WE ARE AT THE

     SURFACE OF THE OCEAN

     riding the swells, rising and falling before slipping
     beneath the waves and descending again into the cold
     depths.





                                THE END
LIMITLESS

           EDDIE (V.0.)
           They found me.
                         
          INT. CLOSE 0N - A HIGH-TECH RESIDENTIAL STEEL DOOR
                         
          being POUNDED in. WHAM! WHAM! Whoever's trying to get in is
          serious. The door shudders but doesn't give. It's state-of-
          the-art residential protection.
                         
           EDDIE (V.0.)
           I might have five minutes.
                         
          We hear the WHRRRRR of POWER TOOLS going to work on his door.
          These people are determined. Professional. And prepared.
                         
           EDDIE (V.0.) ( (CONT'D)
           I'll never know how they got past
           security in a half-billion dollar
           building.
                         
          EXT. THE CELESTIAL - LOOKING INTO THE LOBBY - NIGHT
                         
          The sleek lobby is deserted. We SEE, through the GLASS, lying
          on the floor, the barest glimpse of the FEET of what are
          presumably TWO DEAD SECURITY GUARDS -- although their bodies
          are largely hidden behind their massive curly walnut desk.
          All the security monitors are BLACK -- the feeds clearly cut.
                         
           EDDIE (V.O.)
           They've become sophisticated.
           Before they couldn't have done
           this. But now...?
                         
          The CAMERA RISES, breathlessly, in a blur, up all 80 floors
          of this stunning new building, coming to rest on...
                         
          EDDIE MORGAN,
                         
          30's, lean and stylish, standing on the exterior ledge of his
          multimillion-dollar terrace. New York City looms around him,
          beneath him. His hands are outstretched. Balancing. He is
          calm, but fatalistic. He's clearly going to jump.
                         
           EDDIE (V.O.) (CONT'D)
           I will never let them touch me.
                         
          His attention is CAUGHT by the SOUNDS of a commotion in the
          next apartment. He looks over, at-
           2.
                         
                         
          THE ADJOINING TERRACE
                         
          Through the gauzy curtains of the window, TWO MEN force A
          MIDDLE-AGED MAN towards the windows... there is arguing.
                         
           EDDIE (V.0.)
           My neighbor must've heard the
           noise. Opened his door to complain.
                         
          Two MUFFLED SHOTS - the neighbor drops. The door is pounded
          again. It doesn't give.
                         
           EDDIE (V.0.) (CONT'D)
           He bought me half a minute. I wish
           he hadn't. Last thoughts are self-
           pitying and mine are no exception:
           the waste. The waste of it all. I
           mean, how many of us ever know what
           it is to become... the perfect
           version of ourselves. I'd come

           the world.
                         
          The pounding intensifies.

           And now, the only thing I'd have an

           ... was the sidewalk.

           Not so long ago, this was me.
                         
          Eddie is walking down the street, messily eating a street
          falafel. His hair is longer, his clothes schlumpier, his face
          rounder --he's out of shape. A belly bulges against his belt.
          He wears jeans and that worn-out corduroy "writer's" sport
          coat --the one that your girlfriend fights to give to the
          Salvation Army.

           I was a writer. Two years after my
           copywriting job at Dexter & Kerr
           came to a non-mutual end, I had, in
           an extraordinary burst of desperate
           energy, bullshitted my way into my
           first book contract. This was it:
                         
          INT. EDDIE'S RATTY RENT-CONTROLLED APARTMENT ON AVENUE A- DAY
                         
          Eddie, slumped in his desk chair, is playing COMPUTER
          SCRABBLE.
                         
           EDDIE (V.0.)
           Now, at last, I was ready to write.
                         
          QUICK CUTS: --Eddie sprawled on the couch, eating takeout and
          watching TV, the sink in the foreground full of dishes. --
          Eddie shooting baskets into a toy hoop.
                         
           EDDIE (V.0.) (CONT'D)
           Gearing up, that's all.
                         
          --Eddie sleeping in his bed, sacked out, the clock beside him

          --Eddie at his desk. He glances at his LAND LINE. The
          message light is unblinkingly green. No one's called.

           happened to me....

          A FEMALE HAND slides a KEY across the counter to EDDIE. Eddie
          stares in disbelief at his (now ex) girlfriend, LINDY, an
          attractive, real-looking girl, late 20's. She's dressed in a
          professional suit. She looks very sad.
                         
                          LINDY
           I don't think I can keep this.
                         
          Eddie is broadsided. Hurt.
                         
                          EDDIE
           Just like that.
                         
          She shoots him a look of almost intolerable sympathy.
                         
                          EDDIE (CONT'D)
           I was kind of under the impression
           you cared a little more than just--
                         
                          LINDY
           If I didn't care, maybe I'd be able
           to stand to watch you do this.
                         
                          EDDIE
           Look, I'm going to give 90 pages to
           Mark on Friday. If you could just
           wait, see what he says-
                         
                          LINDY
           Stop. You think I don't know what
           you do all day? I've loved you. I
           know the good stuff, and I know the
           shit.
                         
                          EDDIE
           And it's all shit to you now?
                         
                          LINDY
           You're the one living it.
                          (SYMPATHETICALLY)
           Don't think I don't know it's worse
           for you.
                         
                          EDDIE
           Then you know I could use a friend.
                         
          He tries to push the key back. He cares about her, but he's
          also "working" her sympathy, which she instantly smells.
                         
                          LINDY
           Don't you dare try that shit on me!

          She pierces Eddie with a look. Doesn't take the key.
                         
                          EDDIE
           Well -- what'll work, then?
                         
          They both almost laugh. They know each other so well. But
          she looks away, steeling herself.
                         
                          LINDY
           I see where it's going. You'll
           lose your apartment. And then
           what? You'll move in with me--
                         
                          EDDIE
           Not with that enthusiastic invite--
                         
                          LINDY
           --And then it'll go on this way,
           and I'll rag on you, and finally
           boot you out -- and then what? I
           mean, have you run the film?
                         
           EDDIE (V.0.)
           She knew what was beckoning: the
           lower bunk in my childhood bedroom
           in Newark. We'd even had sex on it
           once. And it was a thing to be
           pitied and avoided.
                         
          Eddie sighs. Drops the glib tone. Looks at her, finally
          mustering the honesty she deserves.
                         
                          EDDIE (CONT'D)
           Lindy. I really thought I had it
           in me to do something. --I wasn't
           getting around it, but it was
           fucking there. And now, I, ah...
           don't think it is. There.
           --Anything. At all.
                         
          Lindy looks at him, clear-eyed, seeing him as he is, and
          loving him anyway.
                         
                          LINDY
           You know what...? I'd have had you
           move in anyway... if...
                         
                          EDDIE
           If, what?
                         
          She looks away. Its hard for her to admit this:

          INT. BEDROOM - NIGHT
                         
          We are in Eddie's mind, in his POV, and we are seeing a
          LOVELY, WILLOWY BRUNETTE, wearing an undershirt, bending
          seductively over him...
                         
          INT. MIDTOWN COFFEE SHOP - DAY
                         
          From Eddie's eyes we can tell the memory is still fresh. She
          shakes her head, looks away. It's clearly over. She gets up.
          He follows.
                         
                          LINDY
           I have to get back.
                         
                          EDDIE
           --Hey, well -- wait -- you didn't
           tell me what happened yesterday.
                         
          We can see on Lindy's face that she's still vulnerably
          pleased that Eddie remembered to ask.
                         
                          LINDY
           I got it.
                         
                          EDDIE

                          LINDY
           Yeah. I'll have my own assistant.
           You believe that?

                          LINDY
           Yeah, thanks. I do.
                         
          She smiles weakly, breaks eye contact. No good to keep
          looking. It's over. Eddie makes an attempt to reach for the
          check, which Lindy grabs.

          Eddie is walking home, eying the homeless on the street,
          feeling his dismal future breathing down his neck.
                         
           EDDIE (V.0.)
           She was right. I was almost 35.
           No one talks about "potential" at
           35. I had missed the on-ramp.
           Soon I'd be sleeping in the lower
           bunk of my childhood bedroom... my
           father happy to welcome me into the
           challenging field of dental supply
           inventory...

           Of all the useless relationships
           better forgotten and put away in
           mothballs, is there any more
           useless than... the ex-brother-in-

          Eddie sizes him up: the suit, shoes, watch, haircut.
                         
                          EDDIE
           No.
                         
                          VERNON
           Come on, let's get a drink. I wanna
           hear about this book.
                         
                          EDDIE
           Nah, I should go--
                         
                          VERN
           You can't tell me you're a health
           nut, now. Not with that tire-
                         
                          EDDIE
                          (ANNOYED)
           Enticing invitation. Thanks.
                         
          Vern plucks the pack of cigarettes from Eddie's upper jacket
          pocket.
                         
                          VERN
           C'mon, c'mon, one beer. Or I won't
           give `em back.
                         
          He holds the cigarettes just out of Eddie's reach.

          INT. BAR - DAY
                         
          A BARTENDER brings beers to Eddie and Vernon who sit at the
          bar. Eddie clearly wishes he were elsewhere.
                         
                          EDDIE
           So... how's Melissa?
                         
                          VERNON
           Ah-hah. That's why you agreed to
           the beer.
                         
                          EDDIE
           I'm making conversation, Vern.
                         
                          VERNON
           Well, I don't know how Melissa is.

                          VERNON
           I don't see her. She lives upstate
           now, she's got some kinda internet
           home sales kinda job... a couple of
           kids...
                         
          This is unfathomable to Eddie. He tries to keep his voice
          casual.

                          VERNON
           What are you, jealous?
                         
                          EDDIE
           It's just a question, Vern.
                         
          Vernon can sense his emotion.
                         
                          VERNON
           Walked out on her, if you really
           want to know. But what do you care?
           You guys weren't even married six
           months, were you--? I mean, it was
           just a coke thing, right?
                         
                          EDDIE
           Is that what she said--?! "A coke
           thing."
                         
          It unexpectedly hurts Eddie. Maybe it's just a bummer day. Or
          there's a deeper wound than he knew.
                         
                          VERNON
           But I wanna know about this book.
           How's it going?
                         
                          EDDIE
           (considering the question)
           How's it going... Well... I'm
           behind. I'm behind on my book, and
           it's pretty well polluting my days
           and nights if you really want to
           know.
                         
                          VERNON
           How much have you written of it?
                         
          A beat.
                         
                          EDDIE

          Vern appraises him.
                         
                          VERNON (CONT'D)
           I think I have something that can
           help you.
                         
          He reaches into his pocket. Eddie thinks he knows what's
          coming.
                         
                          EDDIE

                          EDDIE
           You're still dealing.
                         
                          VERNON
           No -- yeah --will you listen?! This
           isn't recreational. I've been doing
           some consulting for a
                          PHARMACEUTICAL COMPANY--
                         
                          EDDIE
           You mean a lab in some little

                          VERNON
           No, this is an exclusive product
           coming on-stream next year, they've
           had clinical trials, and it's FDA
           approved.
                         
          A long beat. Eddie bites.
                         
                          EDDIE
           Okay, what is it?
                         
          Vern reaches into his jacket, produces a tiny plastic sachet
          with his right hand, tapping something out into the palm of
          his left. He holds this up for Eddie to see... a TINY WHITE
          UNMARKED TABLET.
                         
                          EDDIE (CONT'D)

           I'm too old for this, Vernon.
                         
                          VERNON
           Look, they've identified these
           receptors in the brain that
           activate specific circuits, and--
           you know how they say you can only
           access like 20 percent of your
           brain? Well, what this does--

           Vernon. Look at me. Do I look good?
           I smoke too much: my chest is sore.
           A fucking corpse has more energy
           than I do, I've got weird aches,
           possible lumps, rashes, maybe
           they're a condition, or a network
           of conditions. One of these days
           they're all going to hold hands,
           light up, and I'll keel over dead.
           My life's in the crapper, and I
           DON'T think it's going to take a
           sudden upswing into the
           stratosphere if I do some brand
           new, shiny designer DRUG!
                         
          Vern's phone rings. He holds up his index finger --shh! -and
          takes the call.

           (beat, getting agitated)
           When. --I know, but when?
           (looking at his watch)
           Tell him we can't do that. He knows
           that's out of the question. We
           absolutely can't do that.
                         
          Vern is edgy. Very tense. He continues:
                         
                          VERN (CONT'D)
           No, I'm not going to tell him! You
           tell him -- no, now!
                         
          He turns off his phone, gets up.

           have another beer.
                         
          He takes out his business card, and places it carefully next
          to the little white tablet on the bench.
                         
                          VERN (CONT'D)

           Eight hundred bucks a pop.
                         
          He pats Eddie on the shoulder and goes. Eddie is still
          looking at the pill.
                         
          Which seems to be looking back at him.

           EDDIE (V.O.)
           She'd been so smart. Smarter than

           EDDIE (V.0.) (CONT'D)
           What had happened? Her life made no
           sense. I mean, I could see a
           direct, plausible link between this
           Eddie, broke and buzzed at three
           o'clock in the afternoon, and an
           earlier Eddie...

          INT. A BEDROOM - NIGHT
                         
          A YOUNGER, THINNER EDDIE rifles through a bureau, an old lady
          in bed, sleeping, behind him --an oxygen mask on her. She's
          clearly terminal.

          Eddie walks, pensive.
                         
           EDDIE (V.0.)
           But there was no link between my
           Melissa and this upstate Melissa
           dumped, cold-calling people from
           her living room.
                         
          EXT. EDDIE'S BUILDING - DUSK
                         
          An edgy neighborhood on the furthest edge of lower Manhattan.
          This block may never be gentrified.
                         
           EDDIE (V.O.)
           40 long blocks later I was "home."
                         
          He digs in his pocket for the keys and comes up with...
                         
          THE LITTLE WHITE PILL
                         
          INT. EDDIE'S BUILDING - STAIRWELL - DUSK
                         
          It's a former tenement, fourth-floor walk-up. Eddie trudges
          up the old stairs, the tiny tiles worn away in spots, the
          Victorian moldings disfigured from a hundred and twenty years
          of paint.
                         
          Eddie is suddenly seized by a racking cough -- a horrible
          smoker's cough that makes him double over. He sounds like
          he's 80 years old. He finally gets it under control, gets a
          glimpse of himself in the storefront window. He looks bad,
          and he knows he looks bad.
                         
          He reaches into his pocket. THE PILL sits teasingly in the
          palm of his hand, looking up at him.
                         
           EDDIE (V.0.)
           Well. There was less than nothing
           to lose.
                         
          Quickly, impulsively, he swallows it.

          INT. THE LANDING - DUSK
                         
          As Eddie passes, a neighbor's door swings open. Eddie tries
          walking faster.
                         
           EDDIE (V.0.)
           I didn't want to see anybody.
                         
          VALERIE, 26 and attractive, emerges, dressed to go out.
                         
           EDDIE (V.0.) (CONT'D)
           Especially not my landlord's nasty
           young wife.
                         
          She is immediately soured at the sight of Eddie. Eddie knows
          what she's thinking.
                         
                          EDDIE (CONT'D)
           Tuesday.

           Look, enough, okay--?

           Steve handles the rents. So feed
           your fucking bullshit to him.
                         
           EDDIE (V.0.)
           I suddenly had extra reason to get
           away from her. I had thoughtlessly
           ingested a substance.
                         
          Valerie's tirade FADES up or down, depending on when we're
          hearing Eddie.
                         
                          VALERIE

           EDDIE (V.0.)
           I had gotten remarkably little
           information from Vernon about what
           this drug would do.
                         
                          VALERIE
           You could be a bike messenger and
           come up with that!
                         
          Eddie continues up the stairs. But she follows, getting in
          front of him.

           ...What if it was a hallucinogen...
           oh my God... listening to her rag,
           if I were tripping...? I'd jump out
           a fucking window.
                         
          VALERIE'S voice fades up.
                         
                          VALERIE
           --Look, I'm just telling you, he's
           been talking about calling these
           people he knows from the club to
           muscle you out -- I've told him not
           to do that, but he's really pissed.
                         
          We PUSH IN on Eddie's face, into his eyes... where we see his
          pupils contract just slightly. A flicker.
                         
           EDDIE (V.0.)
           And then... I felt it.
                         
          EDDIE'S POV - THE APARTMENT UPPER HALL...
                         
          The room is changing... springing into sharper focus.
                         
           EDDIE (V.0.)
           Levels more, layers more, 3-D
           more... galactically more. But the
           same. Just the depth and beauty...
           of clarity.
                         
          There seems to be more definition, more dimension, a little
          more light -- he can see more clearly. The SOUND drops out
          for a moment; he can see VALERIE'S FACE, mouth contorted,
          continuing to heap the abuse, but there's something in her
          eyes that's not mean... something anxious.He looks at her
          with a sudden keen intelligence. And sympathy.
                         
                          EDDIE (CONT'D)
           What's wrong?
                         
          She's taken aback.
                         
                          VALERIE
           W-What?
                         
          His eyes go to THE BOOK BAG in her arms.

          On a gut instinct, Eddie takes a shot, pushing his words
          forward with a new, sharp, penetrating intimacy,
          articulateness.

           You don't like me, and I don't
           blame you -- you see a schlumpy
           energy- sucking defeated sack of
           shit sponging off your husband.
           You're hoping I'll blow my brains

           You can only see a corner of it.
           How did you know?
                         
          He looks down. She's right --only a corner of the book is
          visible. Eddie realizes:
                         
                          EDDIE
           I've seen it before.

           ...sitting on the couch of a T.A. I

           EDDIE (V.0.)
           Vern was right. This was no

          Eddie's eyes flick to the laptop in her bag, his manner

           If you're writing a paper, that's

                          EDDIE
           Cal Berkeley has her oral history.
           I'd start there. Her son is still
           alive. You could Google him. Sons
           of famous people always want to
           dish dirt about their parents.
           You'd get something no one else
           has, and you'd've gone the extra
           mile, a nice little apple for the
           professor.

           Information from the odd museum

           my frontal lobes, mixing itself
           together into a sparkling cocktail
           of useful information.
                         
          Valerie's whole posture is relaxing, the look in her eyes

           EDDIE (V.0.)
           We'd really worked on her paper,
           too. In 45 minutes it was a
           polished gem. She was pleased.
                         
          We see the laptop set up, books scattered -- then, obviously
          abandoned for a more pleasurable pursuit.

          It's the first wide shot we've seen of it, and it hammers
          home: what a mess. Books scattered across the floor, dirty
          dishes, broken Venetian blind sashes. The nest of a slob.

           EDDIE (V.0.)
           ... But it couldn't be my home,
           could it? Who would live like this?
                         
          MONTAGE: Speeded-up shots of Eddie sifting through his books
          and tapes. Cleaning up the kitchen. The bathroom. Picks up
          books. He starts moving the sofa.
                         
          QUICK CUTS: the living room, rapidly whipped into shape. If
          not stylish, habitable. Final shot: he's sitting on the
          (repositioned) couch. Thinking.
                         
           EDDIE (V.0.) (CONT'D)
           What was this drug? I couldn't stay
           messy on it, I hadn't had a
           cigarette in six hours...
                         
          He stares at the pack in his hands. It looks alien.
                         
           EDDIE (V.0.) (CONT'D)
           ...hadn't eaten... So. Abstemious
           and tidy. What was this -- a drug
           for people who want to get anal?
                         
          He gets up. Paces.
                         
           EDDIE (V.0.) (CONT'D)
           I wasn't high, wasn't wired --just
           clear. What I needed to do. And how
           to do it.
                         
          His eye falls on his COMPUTER.
                         
          The MONTAGE CONTINUES: Eddie flipping through research books,
          typing onto his keyboard, the printer printing, doing
          Internet searches... pages and pages spit out of the printer.
                         
          INT. EDDIE'S BEDROOM - MORNING
                         
          Eddie, in his underwear, is sleeping soundly. He stirs, rolls
          over, cracks open an eye.
                         
          He gets up, schlumps to the mirror, looks at his unshaven
          face. The penetrating gleam is no longer in his eyes.
                         
           EDDIE (V.0.)
           The next morning, I sent a little
           probe down into my brain. No surge
           of brilliance came up to greet me.
           I felt thick and stupid -- a
           shuffling zombie without my coffee
           and cigarette. In short...

          CLOSE UP -- EDDIE'S UNDERWEAR is tossed at the hamper -
          missing it by about a foot. The underwear remain on the
          floor.
                         
           EDDIE (V.0.) (CONT'D)
           I was back.
                         
          INT. EDDIE'S LIVING ROOM - MORNING
                         
          Eddie lies on the couch. (Already the room shows signs of
          being messed up again.) His eye suddenly falls on his desk.
                         
           EDDIE (V.0.)
           But something remained.
                         
          INT. EDITOR'S OFFICE - DAY
                         
          Eddie drops A STACK OF FRESH PAGES on the desk of MARK
          SUTTON. Mark looks skeptically at Eddie, then the pages.
                         
                          MARK
           You're kidding.
                         
                          EDDIE
           No.
                         
                          MARK
                          (SARCASTIC)
           Words have appeared on paper.
                         
                          EDDIE
           Yes.
                         
                          MARK SUTTON
           Written by you.
                         
          Eddie knows he's on thin ice.
                         
                          EDDIE
           Three pages. That's all you have to
           read. If you read them in the next
           hour, and you don't want to keep
           reading I'll give back the advance.
                         
          EXT. FLATIRON DISTRICT - DAY
                         
          Eddie standing on the street, the crowd flowing around him.
          He turns this way and that, clearly anxious, impatient. Where
          to go? What to do to kill the time?
           23.
                         
                         
          EXT. STREET - DAY - THREE SHOTS:
                         
          1. Eddie orders a PRETZEL from a food cart. He is having to
          dig into his pockets to come up with the change. The VENDOR
          becomes so impatient he won't give him the pretzel, and
          serves another customer first. Eddie looks at HIS CELL
          PHONE. Makes sure it's on. No call.
                         
          2. Eddie sits on a stoop, slowly nibbling on his pretzel, his
          eye glued to his phone. No call.
                         
          3. Eddie tosses the finished pretzel's wrapper and SHAKES HIS
          PHONE in frustration. A RING! Eddie jumps up, fumbles with
          his phone just as a passing male WALL STREET SHARK pulls out
          his phone and answers. The ring wasn't for Eddie.
                         
          INT. EDDIE'S APARTMENT - NIGHT
                         
          Eddie comes in, then notices something's different. His
          ANSWERING MACHINE has a blinking red light. Eddie clicks the
          button, breathless.
                         
           MARK SUTTON'S VOICE
           Eddie... give me a call when you
           get in... (BEEP)
                         
          The second message is from Mark too.
                         
           MARK SUTTON'S VOICE (CONT'D)
           Eddie, I'm 40 pages further in...
           call me... it's a little grandiose,
           but I'm still reading...
                         
          A third message - BEEP!
                         
           MARK SUTTON'S VOICE (CONT'D)
           Okay, how did you do this? I'd, uh,
           I'd really like to -- shit, just
           call me the minute you get in,
           call. Okay? Okay. (BEEP!)
                         
          Eddie jumps up, gleeful-- he knew it! Then his smile fades.
          Reality hits.
                         
           EDDIE (V.O.)
           But how would I finish? It was
           "enhanced" Eddie who displayed all
           that brilliance. Not me.

          Eddie, holding Vern's card, buzzes the buzzer. There's no
          answer. Eddie buzzes again and again. Finally:

                          EDDIE
           Vern -- last night 90 pages just
           wrote themselves! I totally chucked
           the novel I pitched them --I
           suddenly SAW, Vern, how this whole
           societal economic class struggle --
           and its solution -- didn't have to
           be futuristic or fictional -- it
           was actually ACHIEVABLE here, in
           our lifetime -- and I could just
           lay it out, like, like a manifesto,
           or something, like Mein Kampf
           except not by a crazy racist fuck!
           (no response, realizing)
           Okay, I won't talk any more about
           this if you let me in.
                         
          The buzzer buzzes.
                         
          INT. VERN'S APARTMENT DOOR - DAY
                         
          The door opens. And Eddie is taken aback. Vern has been
          beaten up. Really worked over. His lip is split, his face
          puffy and bruised. His right hand is bandaged.
                         
                          VERN
           Well, that was fast.
                         
                          EDDIE
                          WHAT HAP-
                         
                          VERN
           Don't ask.
                         
          Leaving the door open, Vern turns around and motions at Eddie
          with his left hand to come in. The place is all mismatched
          antique furniture -- the possessions of someone who collected
          once, with enthusiasm, but who's letting it all go to hell.
          Vern sits, keeping his injured arm elevated.
                         
                          VERN (CONT'D)
           So, Eddie. I guess you're
           interested after all.

           It works better if you're already
           smart.
                         
          Eddie can't get over how bad Vernon looks.

                          VERN
           You don't want to know.
                         
          And Eddie wants the drug more than he wants to know what
          happened.
                         
                          EDDIE

                          VERN
           It doesn't have a street name yet,
           because it doesn't have a street
           profile. And that's the way we want
           it to stay. The boys in the kitchen
           are calling it MDT-48.
                         
                          EDDIE
           "The boys in the kitchen...?" Vern,
           that doesn't sound FDA approved.
                         
                          VERN
           "FDA-approved," that's a laugh. Did
           you really believe that shit?
                         
          Eddie stares at Vern as he pours himself a coffee.
                         
           EDDIE (V.0.)
           Okay, so what did we have here?
           Some unknown, untested, possibly
           dangerous drug scammed out of some
           unidentified lab somewhere, given
           to me by a highly unreliable guy I
           hadn't seen in years.
                         
                          VERN
           So you want some more of it?
                         
                          EDDIE
           Yes. Definitely.
                         
          Vern chuckles. He knew it.

           Uh... sure.
                         
          Eddie wants to get on with it and get out of there, but Vern
          clearly has him by the balls.
                         
                          VERN
           You can see, I'm in no shape to go
           out right now. Will you hop down to
           the dry cleaners and get my suit?
           And maybe pick me up a little
           breakfast...?
                         
          Eddie sighs. Vern tosses him a set of KEYS.

          He arrives at Vernon's door. He takes out the keys Vern gave
          him, but he doesn't need them. The DOOR is AJAR.
           27.
                         
                         
          INT. VERN'S APARTMENT - DAY - EDDIE'S POV
                         
          As Eddie pushes the door open, he can see Vernon sitting,
          quite normally, on the couch. As he enters the room, though,
          he sees that the place has been RANSACKED. Destroyed.
                         
          Eddie wheels back to ask Vern what the fuck. And then sees
          it.
                         
          VERN'S FACE -CLOSE
                         
          In the center of his forehead is a neat little BULLET HOLE.
                         
                         EDDIE
                         
          is no tough guy, and sweat springs to his brow. He starts
          shaking... then, seized with horror that they might still be
          in here, he edges to the bedroom. We hear THE POUNDING OF HIS
          HEART as he peeks in...
                         
          INT. EDDIE'S POV - VERN'S BEDROOM
                         
          It's been ransacked, too. Torn to shreds, bureau drawers
          opened and dumped, pillows ripped open with knives. But no
          one is there.
                         
          INT. VERNON'S DESK - DAY
                         
          Eddie's shaking hand can barely hold the phone.
                         
                          EDDIE
           Yes... I... I need to report a
           murder. Eddie. Morgan. --Edward J.
           I won't.
                         
          He puts down the phone, puts his head in his hands.
                         
          VARIOUS CUTS OF: Eddie sitting. Shifting his butt in various
          positions. Holding a BASEBALL BAT he's found --just in case
          "they" come back.
                         
           EDDIE (V.0.) (CONT'D)
           It took them forever. And the
           longer I sat there, the clearer I
           saw... Vern had known whoever had
           done this. He'd opened the door.
                         
          CLOSE ON - EDDIE'S FACE

           And one guess what they'd been
           looking for.

          INT. VERN'S BEDROOM - DAY
                         
          Eddie, cleverly wearing kitchen gloves, is now furiously
          tearing through the rubble the thieves have left behind, the
          scattered clothes, under the bed...
                         
          INT. BATHROOM -. DAY
                         
          Eddie pokes quickly through the medicine cabinet -- nothing
          but Tylenol.
                         
          INT. VERN'S LIVING ROOM - DAY
                         
          Eddie sits on the couch with (dead) Vern, staring at him, as
          if a corpse could give up a secret. He looks down at VERN'S
          BREAKFAST CONTAINER.
                         
                          EDDIE
           At least you got your last meal.
                         
          There are lots of takeout containers around.
                         
                          EDDIE (CONT'D)
           You never did like to cook...
                         
          Eddie's eye falls on VERN'S STOVE. Unlike the rest of the
          kitchen area, it's pristine. Unspattered. Eddie jumps up.
                         
          VERN'S STOVE - CLOSE
                         
          Eddie opens it. The inside is as clean as the outside. We
          HEAR SIRENS now -- the cops are finally coming, and Eddie
          must rush. Eddie pulls out
                         
          THE BROILER - CLOSE
                         
          Taped to the inside is A LARGE BROWN PADDED ENVELOPE.
          Slowly, Eddie pulls out the package, reaches into it.
                         
          EDDIE'S HANDS - CLOSE
                         
          He is holding about TWENTY THOUSAND DOLLARS in cash. But
          that's not all. He reaches in again... there's something else
          inside... Eddie's hand pulls out a LITTLE BLACK ADDRESS BOOK.
          But there's still something else.. he reaches in again. And
          now Eddie's hand pulls out A PLASTIC CONTAINER WITH AN AIR-
          LOCK SEAL... he pries the seal off... Inside are FIVE HUNDRED
          OF THE LITTLE WHITE PILLS.
                         
          Eddie HEARS THE THUD OF APPROACHING FEET, voices. Making a
          decision, he quickly tucks the envelope into his jacket,
          jumps down from the chair... JUST AS A COP pushes through the
          door.

           Let me see your hands.
                         
          Eddie throws his arms in the air.
                         
                          EDDIE

          Eddie sits, making his statement to an overweight DETECTIVE.
                         
                          EDDIE
           ... No, ex-wife's brother. I just
           ran into him on the street and he
           invited me up to, you know...
                         
          The Detective looks at him suspiciously.
                         
                          DETECTIVE
           Buy some drugs?

           Wha-- No! Talk! What're you --
                         
                          DETECTIVE
           Okay, fine, what did this guy do?
                         
                          EDDIE
           He was -- I don't know, I heard he
           was sort of an antiques dealer.
                         
                          DETECTIVE
           A dealer?
                         
          CLOSE ON THE ENVELOPE hidden in his jacket, burning a hole in
          his side. Eddie tries to stay calm.
                         
                          EDDIE
           Yeah... of, uh... Viennese kind
           of... chairs... sort of curlicue
           leg kind of things--
                         
          The phone is ringing. The detective picks it up.
                         
                          DETECTIVE
                          (INTO PHONE)

           Morgan. He's here.

          Eddie can't believe it. He stares at the phone, then finally
          speaks into it.
                         
                          EDDIE

           EDDIE (V.O.)
           I hadn't heard her voice in 10
           years.
                         
                          EDDIE (CONT'D)
           Right before. I'd just run into him
           on the street.
                         
                          MELISSA'S VOICE
           God.

           No, no, no, Eddie, I know that. I
           wish I was more surprised. He
           was... involved in some stuff... I
           better not say any more.
                         
                          EDDIE
           Not on this line, no.
                         
          A beat. Eddie still can't believe he's talking to her.

           Okay.
                         
          She's hung up. Gone. Eddie turns back to the detective who's
          staring intently at him.
                         
                          DETECTIVE
           Something doesn't jell here.
                         
          Eddie tries not to look panicked. The cop looks up, taking in
          the entrance of THREE newly arrested HIGH CLASS HOOKERS.
                         
          They are young. They are blond. They are wearing very short
          skirts and fuck-me heels. The cop eyes them appreciatively.
                         
           EDDIE (V.O.)
           But I knew, when his attention

          He sits at his computer, a salad beside him. His printer
          spits out page after page of manuscript.
                         
                          EDDIE

          Mark is astonished.

          It contains ten tablets of MDT. Eddie's fingers reach in,
          take one.
                         
           EDDIE (V.0.)
           A tablet a day... kept the torpor
           away. And what I could do with my
           day... was limitless.

          Eddie runs, earphones on his head. We HEAR, dimly, French
          phrases.
                         
           EDDIE V.0.
           Even half-listening to any
           language, I became fluent...
                         
          Eddie becomes aware that there's ANOTHER RUNNER --a powerful-
          looking man, gaining on him, closer behind than makes him
          comfortable. Eddie flicks a glance over his shoulder.
                         
           EDDIE (V.0.)
           The only cloud was the nagging
           feeling I was being followed.
                         
          With a surge of effort, Eddie speeds up, sprinting across the
          street just after the light changes. WHIZZING TRAFFIC cuts
          the mysterious runner off, stops him from following. He
          remains, panting, at the light.

           The focal point of my existence

          CLOSE ON: the plastic baggie of pills being DUCT TAPED inside
          the top of EDDIE'S BROILER. He SLAMS the broiler closed.

           I had a new, improved game.

           So you're saying that any author
           who's commandeered adjective
           status, "Orwellian, Dickensian--"?
                         
                          BEAUTIFUL WOMAN
           --is prosaic. Yes.
                         
                          EDDIE
           Which means a prosaic author's work

                          EDDIE
           So you're saying praise and fame
           are unrelated to achievement, that
           the greatest hits CD cannot
           possibly contain good songs? That
           Shakespeare's catchiness belies
           mediocrity?

                          EDDIE
           Well, then I'd guess you'd rather

           think could launch a thousand
           ships?
                         
          He puts a finger under her chin. He means her face, of

           Portugal? With its big, butch navy?
           All that's left is salt cod and
           cheap condos -- the Brits? Now they
           just sit on their dank little
           island, fussing over their suits.

           We think this could be an important

           have to say, you came out of

           Eddie, we take you very seriously
           as a writer.
                         
          Eddie sounds almost regretful.
                         
                          EDDIE
           Yes, but I now see that writing, as
           a profession, is for marginalized
           whiners not fit for anything else.
                         
          Sutton thinks Eddie's kidding. He laughs nervously.
                         
                          EDDIE (CONT'D)
           No, I mean it, look at the life.
           Incarceration, loneliness,
           burrowing down into your own
           psyche, increasingly insulated from
           any truth, because you're not in
           the currents of the world any more,
           you're rattling around inside the

          a large paper bag. Eddie reaches for it; Gennady holds it
          aloft for one last second.
                         
                          GENNADY

           EDDIE (V.0.)
           And finally, Kevin Doyle, trying to
           sound casual.
                         
           KEVIN DOYLE'S VOICE
           Eddie, I was having drinks with a
           friend of mine, and... ah, you
           won't believe this...
                         
          INT. A FANCY ITALIAN RESTAURANT - NIGHT
                         
          Lindy, Eddie's ex-girlfriend, is sitting across the table
          from Eddie. She peers at him, confused. Is this dapper
          stranger really her shlumpy ex?
                         
                          LINDY
           Carl Van Loon wants to meet you?
                         
                          EDDIE
           Apparently he does.
                         
          She is pleased for him, but flabbergasted.
                         
                          LINDY
           But you're not in the finance game.
           What can you do for Carl Van Loon?
           (shaking her head,
                          MYSTIFIED)
           Eddie-- I --
                         
          THE BEAUTIFUL HOSTESS appears at Eddie's side. They have a
          brief conversation in Italian. Lindy stares, confused, as the
          hostess leaves.
                         
                          LINDY (CONT'D)
           Since when do you speak... what
           happened to you?
                         
                          EDDIE
           Self-improvement month. Someone
           gave me a wake-up call.

           God, Eddie -- I felt so bad about
           that.
                         
                          EDDIE
           Why? It stuck, didn't it?
                         
          Lindy eyes him, half pleased, half apprehensive. He seems so
          different.
                         
                          LINDY
           You didn't do all this for me.
                         
                          EDDIE
           Who says I didn't? So what -- it's
           not getting over? Is that it?
                         
          Lindy looks away, blushes. Sighs.
                         
                          LINDY
           All right, all right -- boy, you
           are really begging for it.
                         
                          EDDIE
           Begging for what.
                         
                          LINDY
           "I'm proud of you."
                         
                          EDDIE
           Gosh. This is so unexpected.
                         
                          LINDY
           I'm actually... more than proud.
           I'm a little...
                         
          Eddie waits for her words, happily expectant.
                         
                          LINDY (CONT'D)
           ... intimidated.
                         
          They smile at each other. A lot of affection flooding back.
                         
           EDDIE (V.0.)
           Of course, we started up again.
                         
          INT. LINDY'S APARTMENT - NIGHT
                         
          Eddie is making out with her on her couch.
                         
           EDDIE (V.0.)
           Her place...

           My place...
                         
          His apartment has been seriously transformed. Of course, it's
          nothing but a renovated tenement, but there are some new
          furnishings, rugs, lighting-- the total effect is now one of
          stylish prosperity. She and Eddie sit on the rug in front of
          the coffee table, drinking expensive wine.
                         
          INT. THE BACK SEAT OF A CAB - NIGHT
                         
          Eddie and Lindy, dressed to the nines, are clearly returning
          from a fancy party... and passionately entwined, at the point
          of having hot sex, driver or no driver!
                         
           EDDIE (V.0.)
           Every place.
                         
          INT. EDDIE'S BEDROOM - NIGHT
                         
          Eddie stands, naked, at the window, looking out.
                         
                          LINDY
           What are you doing, hon?
                         
                          EDDIE
           Nothing.
                         
          He walks back over to her, looks down. She is snuggled up in
          Eddie's pillow, looking very pretty and vulnerable.
                         
                          LINDY
           What, you think somebody's
           watching?
                         
                          EDDIE
           No.
                         
          He's lying. He's not sure.
                         
                          LINDY
           Is there anything you want to tell
           me, Eddie? Now's the time.
                         
          He looks back at her, eyes unreadable. He shrugs.
                         
                          EDDIE
           With success comes enemies.
                         
                          LINDY

                          LINDY
           You should sleep. Isn't your Van
           Loon meeting tomorrow?
                         
          Eddie nods, sighs, turns away from the window. Then stops. He
          turns pale. Is sweating.
                         
                          LINDY (CONT'D)
           What. What.
                         
          Eddie takes a step. And suddenly... He's across the room.
          Boom. A skip in time.
                         
           EDDIE (V.0.)
           Then... I found myself at the door.
           With no consciousness that I had
           moved.
                         
          He puts his hand on a table, steadies himself. He catches a
          look, in the mirror, of this lean, handsome, dapper shark he
          has become.
                         
                          LINDY
           Are you all right?
                         
          He doesn't look all right.
                         
                          LINDA
           When was the last time you ate
           something?
                         
          Dully the realization penetrates Eddie's fog:
                         
           EDDIE (V.O.)

          Eddie sits at a table, discreetly wolfing a few appetizers.
          Kevin Doyle arrives, looking a little nervous.
                         
                          KEVIN
           Hey.

           I'm eating, Kevin.
                         
          There is so much quiet authority in Eddie's tone that Kevin
          just shuts up. But a moment later, looking at the sweat on
          Eddie's brow, Kevin is pecking at him again.
                         
                          KEVIN
           You up for this? You sure? Because

           Have a toast point.
                         
          Brazening it out again. Because Eddie isn't sure he can pull
          this off either.
                         
          ACROSS THE ROOM - LATER
                         
          There is that little stir from the hostess and staff that can
          only mean the entrance of a very rich and powerful man.
                         
          EDDIE'S TABLE -LATER
                         
          The martini is put down on the table. We tilt up to CARL VAN
          LOON, a young 50, no less vital and intense than the
          hungriest 27-year-old shark on the make. But he affects
          geniality. He sits; the middle-aged man with him, PIERCE,
          does the same.
                         
                          VAN LOON
           So. Eddie Morgan.
                         
          He looks Eddie directly in the eyes.
                         
           VAN LOON (CONT'D)
           What's your secret?
                         
          A beat. Eddie looks at him back, directly in the eyes.
                         
                          EDDIE
           Medication. I'm on special
           medication.
                         
          Another beat. And Van Loon laughs. Pierce doesn't.

          Kevin sucks in his breath. Pierce is annoyed. Van Loon is
          mildly amused, but not necessarily impressed. Eddie
          continues with his unstoppable, MDT-fueled insights:

           Look, there's no time for human
           judgement anymore. You see a
           chance, you blink, and it's gone.
           We entered the age of
           decentralized, online decision-
           making, with the decisions being
           made by hundreds of millions of
           individual investors around the

                          EDDIE
           I don't have delusions of grandeur.
                         
          A beat, as we PUSH IN on Eddie's face.
                         
                          EDDIE (CONT'D)
           I have an actual recipe for
           grandeur.
                         
          Kevin stares in horror. Van Loon still says nothing.
                         
          EXT. THE ORPHEUS ROOM - NIGHT
                         
          Eddie simply stands there coolly; Kevin is nervously saying
          goodbye to Van Loon and Pierce, making small talk.
                         
                          KEVIN
           ..and, oh, you know, she's on the
           wait list... Rosemary's pretty
           devastated...
                         
                          VAN LOON
           My daughter went there. I'll call
           the school for you.
                         
          Kevin blubbers with gratitude. Van Loon's car pulls up. Kevin
          pumps his hand. Van Loon looks past Kevin -- to Eddie.
                         
           VAN LOON (CONT'D)
           Eddie. Ride?
                         
          It's the first real acknowledgement that he's taken Eddie
          seriously.

          Eddie and Van Loon regard each other. Finally, Van Loon
          speaks.

           I don't know who you are, Eddie, or
           what your game is, but I'm sure of
           one thing: you don't work in this
           business. I'm up to my ass in
           investment guys, and you don't have
           their half-cocky, half-terrified
           line of bullshit. Which is not to
           say I like yours any better.
                         
          He picks up a file, hands it to Eddie.
                         
           VAN LOON (CONT'D)
           But you obviously pick your stocks
           in a way I haven't seen. So tell
           me. We're thinking of acquiring
           these companies. Take a few
           minutes. What's your take on them?

          Van Loon's limo pulls up.
                         
          INT. VAN LOON'S LIMO - NIGHT
                         
          Eddie snaps the file shut, hands Van Loon back his pen
          flashlight.
                         
                          EDDIE
           But these companies aren't the
           question, are they?
                         
                          VAN LOON
           What do you mean?
                         
                          EDDIE
           Well -- you're upmarket energy --
           what do you want with these little
           solar/windmill/hippie outfits?
                         
          Van Loon's gaze is expressionless.

          He eyes Van Loon, who is sitting up straighter. Eddie's hit
          a nerve. He smiels, whistles.

          A flicker in Van Loon's eyes. Bullseye.
                         
                          EDDIE (CONT'D)
           And there's really only one company

           Carl, it's just rationalization.
                         
          He says it like it's the simplest thing in the world. Which,
          to a person on MDT, it is.
                         
          Van Loon grinds his teeth. Wanting to talk about it, but too
          skittish.
                         
                          EDDIE (CONT'D)
           Is Hank Atwood going to go for it?

           You are either an amazing con
           artist or a very smart young man.
                         
                          EDDIE
           Come on -- the two of you together?
           The world would have to come to you
           begging for energy like Oliver
           Twist with his little bowl of
           gruel.
                         
          A beat as the two men stare at each other.
                         
                          VAN LOON

          Now Van Loon chuckles, amused by Eddie's audacity.

           I don't think you'd want to hear

           All right. You get your shot. Come

           tell me just exactly how the

           And again...
                         
          Eddie sits on a plush sofa with several MIDDLE-AGED
          INTERNATIONAL TYPES, some chattering in Italian.
                         
          He has a drink in his hand. There are paintbrushes, paints
          and canvasses strewn around... a live/work space.
                         
           EDDIE (V.0.) (CONT'D)
           And again...
                         
          A SHARP, JARRING CUT TO:

          INT. A HOTEL CORRIDOR - NIGHT
                         
          Eddie is walking down the plush corridor with an ATTRACTIVE
          MIDDLE-AGED LATIN WOMAN we saw at the artist's loft... Now
          it's just FLASHES --skimming stones of consciousness-A WINE
          CORK being popped. A PLATE OF MUSSELS swimming in wine sauce.
          Rumpled SHEETS. And then...A BLUR OF MOTION -- bodies, a
          swirl of riotous color --
                         
          A FRENZY OF SHOTS: A CAB STOPPING. A GARGOYLE ON A BUILDING.
          A DOG LEASH ABANDONED IN A PUDDLE. No rhyme, no reason, just
          image, image, image...
                         
          And then blackness.
                         
          EXT. THE BROOKLYN BRIDGE - DAWN
                         
          Eddie is walking, now with a limp. He stops. Looks back. The
          familiar postcard view of Manhattan is ahead of him, looking
          like it always looks.
                         
           EDDIE (V.0.)
           When it finally stopped, I couldn't
           account for the last eight hours of
           my life.

          He notices his foot hurts when he puts it down. He has a
          limp.
                         
           EDDIE (V.0.) (CONT'D)
           There was nothing to do but walk
           home.
                         
          He turns around and limps back towards the island.
                         
          INT. EDDIE'S BEDROOM - MORNING
                         
          Eddie is sleeping in all his clothes.
                         
           EDDIE (V.0.)
           It was my first sleep in two days.
                         
          INT. EDDIE'S LIVING ROOM - DAY
                         
          Eddie, looking very groggy, is holding a THICK PACKET marked
          "Van Loon Associates, -BY COURIER." The files Carl Van Loon
          sent. Sitting on the dining table is an MDT tablets. He
          stares at them.
                         
           EDDIE (V.0.)
           Should I? Would I start "skipping
           time" again?
                         
          He pushes the tablets away. Doesn't take them.
                         
          ANOTHER ANGLE - TIME CUT
                         
          Eddie is sitting in his reading chair, exhausted, going
          through the paperwork.
                         
           EDDIE (V.0.)
           Even off MDT, I decided to give Van
           Loon's files a shot.
                         
          VAN LOON'S FILES - CLOSE
                         
          Eddie leafs through them... pieces of paper charting
          corporate growth, covered with charts, graphs, and mind-
          numbing statistics. PUSH IN ON Eddie's face, as he
          realizes...
                         
           EDDIE (V.0.)
           They were fucking hieroglyphs.
                         
          INT. A WALL STREET OFFICE - DAY
                         
          The phone rings. Kevin Doyle picks it up.

           Hello--? Eddie--? What are you
           talking about?
                         
          And we CROSS-CUT between them:
                         
                          EDDIE
           I can't make the meeting, I'm,
           uh... I'm sick.
                         
          It's a lame excuse, it sounds lame as he says it, but then,
          he's off MDT.
                         
                          KEVIN
           Yeah, well, you can't have the
           fucking flu right now -- he'll
           never give you this chance again!
                         
                          EDDIE
           I need to, ah, analyze this data-
                         
          We see the two men continue to talk, Kevin growing more
          agitated, Eddie growing more sheepish as we HEAR:
                         
           EDDIE (O.S.) (CONT'D)
           Already I recognized it... the
           thick tongue, the leaden synapses.
           It was regular Eddie - the Eddie
           that, now, was unbearable to be.
                         
          We FADE UP THE SOUND on the two men:
                         
                          KEVIN
           ... Don't you get it?! This is your
           test--!
                         
                          EDDIE
           Well, I can't pass a fucking test
           right now!
                         
                          KEVIN
           And how am I going to look if you
           don't?
                         
          Eddie looks pretty bad. He massages his temples.
                         
                          EDDIE
           Okay, Kevin. Okay.
                         
          He hands up on a still-yammering Doyle. He picks up the MDT
          pill, looks at it.

           It was my first morning off MDT in
           a month. The beginnings of a
           headache was curling around my head
           like a big fat, greasy python.
                         
          Again, he looks at the MDT tablet, weighing his options.
                         
           EDDIE (V.0.) (CONT'D)
           But the time-skips had me scared.
                         
          He puts the tablet back down on the table.
                         
          INT. THE REGENCY HOTEL RESTAURANT - DAY
                         
          Eddie walks in, much more tentative in his stride, fear in
          his eyes. This is the real Eddie, the non-MDT Eddie and he
          feels suddenly out of place with the curly maple paneling
          antique Persian carpets.
                         
           EDDIE (V.O.)
           My thought -- such as I had one --
           was to tap dance with Van Loon
           until I could find out more about
           MDT.
                         
          INT. BAR AREA - DAY
                         
          Eddie sits on a couch, Pierce on another chair, Van Loon
          opposite, watching him.
                         
                          VAN LOON
           What do you know about Hank Atwood?
                         
                          EDDIE
           Uh... iconoclast... owns, um, a lot
           of Colorado...
                         
          He's struggling.
                         
                          VAN LOON
           Uh-huh. So this is "prepared,"
           Eddie?
                         
          He shoots Eddie a look of withering contempt. Eddie holds the
          stare and shoots a look back.
                         
                          EDDIE
           What is this, Atwood 101? Everyone

           Nowhere.
                         
          An agonizing pause. Then Van Loon nods.
                         
                          VAN LOON
           Two years ago Forbes didn't even

                          EDDIE
           Yeah, his Great Leap Forward.
                         
          Eddie is faking it. Pierce is looking at him intently. But
          Eddie's staying afloat.
                         
                          VAN LOON
           The guy comes on, out of nowhere,
           so fucking strong he has me on the
           run. Beat me out of two properties,
           invests in bumfuck countries with
           no oil, places I wouldn't go near,
           sextuples his money.
                         
          Eddie's glance flicks to the TV behind the bar. A WOMAN'S
          PICTURE flashes on the TV screen -- and he recognizes it.
          It's the ITALIAN WOMAN he met last night!

          Eddie strains to hear the ANCHORWOMAN'S VOICE...

          Eddie tries to keep his face immobile. Van Loon's voice
          drones on, distorted now, as we HEAR Eddie's heart pounding.

           I couldn't have.

           If I could walk, talk, conduct

          Immediately the PHONE RINGS. He nearly jumps out of his skin.
          He can't answer. He sits on the couch, head in his hands,
          rocking, as it rings. Finally, the machine picks up.

           Please. Meet me somewhere...

           Please. Melissa -- it's important,
           please come -- you have to tell me
           what you're talking about!

          INT. EDDIE'S BEDROOM - DAY
                         
          Eddie sits on the bed, the black book open on his knees.
          Eddie looks at the page, then reaches for the telephone.
          Picks it up. Hears STRANGE CLICKS over the dial tone.
                         
          He puts down the phone, fear on his face.

          Eddie walks, slipping through the crowd, trying to suppress
          his limp... he looks nervously behind him... is that MAN in
          the TAN RAINCOAT following him? He tries to walk faster, but
          it makes his limp more pronounced. He turns the corner. He
          seems to have lost the guy.
                         
          EXT. WASHINGTON SQUARE PARK - DAY

           We don't know. He just started
           getting these headaches a couple of
           weeks ago...? Then, uh, last
           Wednesday he collapsed at work...

          Eddie turns to the last page of Vernon's book.
                         
           EDDIE (V.O.)
           Of all the people I called, three
           were dead, and the rest were sick.
                         
                         
          Eddie dials the last number. Instantly, there is a RING. We
          RACK FOCUS TO-The MAN in the TAN COAT, sitting a discreet
          distance from Eddie. His phone is ringing. Eddie turns white.
                         
          The man takes out his cell phone and answers.
                         
                          MAN'S VOICE
           Hello...? Hello...?
                         
          The man suddenly looks up. Locks eyes with Eddie. Knows that
          he knows. Eddie leaps up, begins to run. The man leaps up and
          follows.
                         
          EXT. DOWNTOWN STREET - DAY
                         
          Eddie runs desperately, as fast as a person off MDT possibly
          can.
                         
          He still has the limp from his blackout escapade, too. He
          can't run fast.
                         
          Tan Coat is gaining. Eddie collides with pedestrians, steps
          on street sunglass displays, sends a saxophonist sprawling.
                         
           EDDIE (V.0.)
           In the end, my stupidity saved me.
                         
          Eddie, panicked, not looking, runs for the crosswalk.
                         
          EDDIE'S POV - A HUGE TRUCK
                         
          is barrelling, unstoppably, right towards him--!

          EDDIE is frozen. The TRUCK SWERVES, up on the curb. Tan Coat
          must dive out of the way, knocking down pedestrians like
          bowling pins, as the TRUCK hits a STREETLIGHT, mangling it --
          then is WHACKED -- twice -- by TWO CABS piling up behind it.
          When Tan Coat extracts himself from the pile of prone
          pedestrians, his last glimpse is of-
                         
          EDDIE - DOWN THE BLOCK
                         
          disappearing down into a Subway entrance. Swallowed by a
          crowd.
                         
                         TAN COAT
                         
          hesitates, but knows that he can't catch up. Eddie's given
          him the slip. This time.
                         
          INT. CHARLIE'S COFFEE SHOP - DAY
                         
          Eddie, limping, enters, looking around anxiously.
                         
           EDDIE (V.0.)
           What was I dealing with? Who could
           tell me? I hoped against hope...
           that Melissa would show.
                         
          EDDIE'S POV - SCANNING THE PLACE
                         
          Not one person in it could possibly be Melissa. Eddie sighs.
          Turns to go.
                         
           FEMALE VOICE (O.S.)
           Eddie...?
                         
          Eddie turns back. There, sitting at a booth, is a thick-
          waisted, short-haired brunette middle-aged woman, wearing a
          large, shapeless sweater. Eddie had looked right at her...
          and not recognized her. She bears no relationship to the
          siren Melissa of his memories. Eddie tries to hide the shock
          on his face.
                         
                          EDDIE
           Melissa...?
                         
          He goes to her, sits. Yes, it's the same person, but
          dramatically, tragically changed. Her face is puffy, her
          pallor blotchy. There are lines under her eyes and around her
          mouth, lines brought on by more than the passage of a few
          years.
                         
          Eddie tries to conceal his shock.

                          MELISSA
           Don't tell me I look good, because
           I know I don't. I didn't want you
           to see me this way...

          They regard each other for minute, unsure of where to start.

           I was like, down the hatch. And it
           was amazing. I read Brian Greene's
           The Elegant Universe in 45 minutes
           and understood it. My work rate
           increased... just, insanely,
           overnight. My boss started to hate
           me -- they offered me his job. And
           then I got scared.

           I'm not stupid. I mean, nobody can
           keep up that level of mental
           activity and not crash. I stopped
           taking it.

                          MELISSA
           I got sick. Headaches, throwing
           up... I went back to Vernon to see
           if I maybe shouldn't take another
           hit, or half a hit, and then he
           told me about... about the people
           who were dying. One guy didn't die,
           but he's a vegetable, his mother
           has to sponge him down every day...

           anything for longer than ten
           minutes. I missed deadlines. I got
           lazy... and slow... put on
           weight... the magazine let me go.
           My husband checked out. Sex? Get
           out of here.
                         
          She leans back, looks him in the eyes.
                         
                          MELISSA (CONT'D)
           That was two years ago, and I
           haven't been the same since. I
           can't read any more -- I mean, the
           fucking New York Post?
                         
          Eddie feels ill, physically ill, hearing this.
                         
                          MELISSA (CONT'D)
           After this, I'm going to have a
           migraine for three days. And I've
           got to pee. Which is another thing.
                         
          She gets up... goes to the Ladies room. And now Eddie sees --
          she wears a LEG BRACE. Like a kid, from the old days, with
          Polio.
                         
           EDDIE (V.0.)
           How many times had I thought of
           her, my first real love...
                         
          We see FLASHES OF YOUNG MELISSA...
                         
           EDDIE (V.0.) (CONT'D)
           But that Melissa had unraveled in
           time and space -- she was a ghost
           now. I was never going to see her
           again, never bump into her in the
           street...
                         
          The tears gather behind Eddie's eyes. He can't help it. He
          puts his hand to his face to hide his emotions.
           70.
                         
                         
          EXT. COFFEE SHOP - DAY
                         
          Eddie leaves with Melissa. He is controlling his tears --
          barely.
                         
                          MELISSA
           You have some left? Good. Go home
           and take it. Take the dose down,
           but don't just stop -- you'll die
           if you just stop. Try to taper off.
           Otherwise, the headache's just the
           beginning... I have to go--
                         
          Eddie, indeed, is rubbing his temples.
                         
                          EDDIE
           But when I run out--
                         
                          MELISSA
           I don't know. I have to go--
                         
          Eddie catches her arm.
                         
                          EDDIE
           Who invented MDT?
                         
                          MELISSA
           I don't know--
                          (BEAT)
           Goodbye, Eddie.
                         
          He lets go of her arm. A puffy, crippled woman about to cry.
          She turns her back and moves away from him, stiffly, limping,
          without looking back.
                         
          EXT. EDDIE'S POV - HIS APARTMENT BUILDING - DAY
                         
           EDDIE (V.O.)
           No one seemed to be watching my
           apartment, maybe I could chance it.
                         
                         ON EDDIE
                         
          He glances around - the coast is clear - and sets off across
          the street. He looks weak, ill - his breathing labored. He
          stumbles - catches himself
                         
           EDDIE (V.O.) (CONT'D)
           I was getting sicker by the moment.
           Luckily I had one pill on me...
                         
          He pulls it from his pocket.

          WHAM! He's pushed up against the wall of his building. Not
          by Tan Coat.
                         
          By GENNADY THE RUSSIAN.
                         
                          GENNADY
           You fucking forget about me? Huh?
                         
          Eddie is stunned -- Gennady whacked his head against the
          building pretty hard. He still clutches the MDT tablet tight
          in his fist.
                         
                          EDDIE
           I... I... ahh...
                         
                          GENNADY
           One o'clock? And you not here?!
           Eddie tries to catch his breath.
                         
                          EDDIE
           I'm here now!
                         
          INT. EDDIE'S LIVING ROOM - ON THE DOOR
                         
          They come into his apartment, Eddie using all his energy to
          stay upright.
                         
                          EDDIE
           I'll get you a check.
                         
          Gennady turns to ice.
                         
                          GENNADY
           A check? A check?! You out of your
           fucking mind?! What you think we
           are, some financial institution?
                         
          Eddie realizes his brain isn't working --of course Gennady
          can't take a check.
                         
                          EDDIE
           Gennady, look-
                         
                          GENNADY
           I cut your balls off!
                         
                          EDDIE
           I wasn't thinking. Look, we just
           need to go to my bank- OOF!
                         
          Gennady has punched him in the stomach. Harder than he's ever
          been punched. Eddie gasps for breath... holds his fist to his
          body, protecting the pill. Gennady notices.

                          EDDIE
                          NOTHING--
                         
          Gennady grabs Eddie's wrist and wrenches his hand open.
                         
                          EDDIE (CONT'D)
           It's aspirin.
                         
          Gennady snatches the pill away from him. Examines it.
                         
                          GENNADY
           Don't look like no aspirin I ever
           see!
                         
          His voice drips with crude contempt.
                         
                          GENNADY (CONT'D)
           What is it? Something good, eh?
                         
          In one swift motion, Gennady pops it in his mouth and
          swallows it!
                         
          Eddie is mute with shock.
                         
          INT. A BANK - CLOSE ON
                         
          Eddie's shaking hands are handing Gennady a thick envelope.
                         
                          EDDIE
           That's the whole thing, plus
           twenty.
                         
          He looks desperately ill. He can barely stand. Gennady,
          meanwhile, is coming on to MDT.
                         
                          GENNADY
           I feel good. What in that shit?
                         
                          EDDIE
           Aspirin and vitamins.
                         
                          GENNADY
           You fucking full of shit, Morgan. I
           know you lie about the movie script
           too.
                         
          He wants to hit Eddie again, but thinks the better of it with
          all the bank cameras.

          EXT. THE STREET - DAY
                         
          Eddie lurches along the street, staggering like a drunk,
          barely able to walk. People avoid him, veering away.
                         
           EDDIE (V.O.)
           I had to get my stash.

          Lindy clearly has a mid-level executive job; her office is
          better than a cubicle and she has a bit of a view. There is a
          KNOCK. A FEMALE ASSISTANT appears in the door.
                         
                          FEMALE ASSISTANT
           Lindy...? I wouldn't have let him
           in, but I know you know him...
                         
          EDDIE appears in the door, looking deathly ill.
                         
                          LINDY
           It's all right, Lisa.
                         
          The girl goes. Lindy, sensing something dire, leaps up and
          closes the door.
                         
          Eddie immediately collapses on the floor. Lindy kneels down
          to help him - competent, trying to stay calm.

          TABLE, takes the lamp off it. The table is actually a box --
          she lifts the lid. She reaches in... and pulls out the PACKET
          OF MDT.

          lot of effort just to answer it.

          Lindy bolts from the cab just as TAN COAT puts his hand on
          the opposite door. She takes off into Central Park. And he's
          after her like a shot.
                         
          EXT. CENTRAL PARK - DAY
                         
          Lindy veers off the path, through the trees, zig-zagging,
          trying to find a place not to be seen.
                         
                         TAN COAT

           Help! Help!!
                         
          Up ahead, miraculously, A COP ON HORSEBACK. He steps the
          horse toward her. She races over and presses her body against
          the side of the horse.

          The cop seems to be paying attention, then suddenly GRUNTS

          HIS HORSE to the ground... ...revealing TAN COAT, on the
          other side of the horse. The BLADE in his hand is bloody.
          LINDY runs.... tries to lose herself in a WEDDING PARTY...
          comes to a section of huge, decorative BOULDERS and ROCKS.
          Dives behind one of them.
                         
          Ahead, she can see the outdoor ICE SKATERS, couples,
          families, enjoying the ice. It seems surreal. Several yards
          behind her is TAN COAT, looking behind every tree, every
          trash bin. Lindy picks up the phone, keeping her voice low,
          although she's hyperventilating.

          doesn't give a shit who sees him chasing her.
                         
          In a flash, he's on the ice after Lindy, running and sliding.
          People collide with him, he pushes skaters aside, sending
          them sprawling... Just as he's closing in on Lindy...
                         
          Lindy wheels around, grabs a SIX YEAR OLD GIRL under the
          arms, and HOISTS HER INTO THE AIR, swinging her legs at Tan
          Coat as hard she can! The little girl's skates arc through
          the air --whoosh! -and connect, CUTTING Tan Coat's FACE.
          Badly.
                         
          He sinks to his knees, hand to his cheek, welling blood.
          People scream and scatter. Lindy keeps her wits about her.
          She runs, sliding across the ice, and leaping the fence, with
          surprising grace. She's gone.

          completely restored to his sharp, snappy self. The desk clerk
          gives him a key. He puts his arm around her, leads her to the
          elevators.
                         
          INT. W HOTEL - ROOM - NIGHT
                         
          Eddie takes Lindy's hands, sits her on the bed.
                         
                          EDDIE
           We'll stay here for a couple of
           days. We'll be powered up, we'll be
           able to think our way out of
           this...
                         
          He kisses her hands. Looks into her eyes.
                         
                          EDDIE (CONT'D)
           I'm back. All right?
                         
          Lindy looks at him for a long moment.
                         
                          LINDY
           Who's back, Eddie?
                         
                          EDDIE
           I can take care of you now.
                         
                          LINDY
           That was never what I wanted.
                         
                          EDDIE
           A lot's going to happen for us. And
           everything that I will have... I
           will share with you. I will love
           you.
                         
          Lindy's head comes up. She looks at him, steely.
                         
                          LINDY
           You know... you were always smart.
           You could have done this. Not
           this... but some of these things...
           maybe a third of these things...
           without any smart drug at all. A
           third of all this... to most
           people...? ...would be plenty.
                         
          She gets up, turns away from him.

                          LINDY (CONT'D)
           I understand that stuff now, Eddie.
           And I don't blame you for taking
           it. No one could ever tell you,
           till you take it, what it can do.
           Invincibility in a bottle. And I
           know I'm going to think about
           taking it again every day for the
           rest of my life.
                         
          There's eerie quiet to her tone that Eddie hasn't heard
          before. A matter-of-fact chill.
                         
                          LINDY (CONT'D)
           But once you can see everything
           that way, mapped out like that, on
           a grid... and always be right...?
           Who'd want to wing it? Who'd want
           to fuck up? Who'd want to be human?
                         
          She heads for the door.
                         
                          LINDY (CONT'D)
           I just came up to say goodbye. I
           don't ever want to see you again.
           I'm not even going to stay in New
           York. Don't try to find me, and
           don't try to help me.
                         
          She goes. He knows there's no point in stopping her. She's
          done with him.
                         
          EXT. W HOTEL - LATER
                         
          Eddie at the WINDOW, looking down...
                         
          EXT. EDDIE'S POV - THE STREET
                         
          He sees Lindy briskly walking away. RACK FOCUS as Lindy
          passes... GENNADY. Leaning against a sign post. Lighting a
          cigarette. And looking up at Eddie's hotel. Waiting.
                         
          EXT. W HOTEL - DAY
                         
          Gennady stands there, looking up at the hotel. So he's a
          little surprised to find EDDIE walking right up to him.
                         
                          EDDIE
           Looking for me?
                         
          Gennady quickly gets aggressive:

                          GENNADY
           You think you can run out on me?
           You think I don't know where you
           are?
                         
                          EDDIE
           I was under the impression that our
           business was settled.
                         
          Something is jammed into Eddie's ribs. Something under
          Gennady's coat. Eddie doesn't blink.
                         
                          GENNADY
           Walk.
                         
          Gennady walks him around the corner, down some stairs, to the
          (deserted) ground entrance of someone's apartment. Eddie
          remains cool.
                         
                          EDDIE
           So now you're going to rob me? I
           thought you were a businessman.
                         
                          GENNADY
           I want some more of that shit.
                         
                          EDDIE
           What shit.
                         
                          GENNADY
           The pills.
                         
          He whacks Eddie, hard, across the face. Eddie, stoic, on MDT,
          doesn't react.
                         
                          EDDIE
           Well, so do I. You took the last
           one.
                         
                          GENNADY
           So you get me more.
                         
                          EDDIE
           I can't get more -- the dealer's
           dead.
                         
          Now Gennady smiles.
                         
                          GENNADY
           Oh. Well. Too bad for you. Because
           how you gonna go to those fancy
           meetings with your nose fed to my
           dog?

          business life. But he stands his ground.
                         
                          EDDIE
           Nothing. I. Can. Do.
                         
                          GENNADY
           Make some calls. One hundred pills.
                         
                          EDDIE
           A hundred can't happen. The
           dealer's dead, I have to call three
           people to even get a line on--
                         
          The gun barrel is brought up beneath Eddie's chin.
                         
                          GENNADY
           You know I don't really do this. So
           clean, like this. What I do to you,
           I do in stages.
                         
                          EDDIE
           I might... be able to get ten.
                         
                          GENNADY
           Ten. Fuck your ten.
                         
                          EDDIE
           (holding his ground)
           Ten. And no guarantee there's more.
                         
          Gennady looks at him for a long, menacing moment.
                         
                          GENNADY
           Oh, I think guarantee.
                         
          But he's accepted the ten. For now. He PUSHES Eddie against
          the wall, hard, knocking the wind out of him.
                         
           EDDIE (V.0.)
           Self-pity and MDT were not

           I already have.
                         
          A long beat as the two men size each other up. Van Loon looks
          away, but a tiny smile creases the corner of his mouth.
                         
           VAN LOON (CONT'D)
           As a matter of fact, there were

           I would never again stash my MDT,
           not in an apartment, not in Fort
           Knox.
                         
          INT. A WINDOWLESS ROOM - DAY
                         
          Eddie, buzzing with charismatic authority, speaks to TWO
          BEEFY MEN, who are professional muscle. (Note: one has very
          elaborate tattoos on his fingers.)
                         
                          EDDIE
           I don't want it known that I have
           any security. You won't precede me,
           you'll follow me, never less than
           ten steps behind... `inconspicuous'
           doesn't begin to describe you.
           You're not there. You're a CEO'S
           wife -- you're wallpaper.
                         
          The men nod. They understand.

          Eddie straightens his tie. Then opens his suit jacket,
          reaches in, and pulls along a seam. An invisible POCKET
          OPENS.
                         
           EDDIE (V.O.)
           Safer though my stash now was, I
           was not sitting around until it ran
           out.

          The place is state of the art, but it's an after-hours,
          furtive meeting Eddie is having with a TECHNICIAN, who passes
          back a small PLASTIC ENVELOPE to Eddie. In it we see SEVERAL
          TABLETS of MDT.
                         
                          TECHNICIAN
           Well, it's nothing you can cook up
           on a stove top. Whoever made it,
           it's a real pro act.
                         
                          EDDIE
           Can you make more?
                         
                          TECHNICIAN

           It was all going to work out...
                         
          His eyes flicker upwards. His two SECURITY MEN are seated at
          the bar. The CAMERA PANS to find... Also seated at the bar,
          is the DETECTIVE who questioned Eddie at the police station!
                         
          Eddie gets up, "casually" wanders over to where the detective
          is sitting, pretends to order another drink. He does not make
          eye contact with the detective, or look like he's talking to
          him.

          Eddie keeps his cool, does not look scared. Wanders back to
          the table, says a few cool words, and strolls back to the
          detective. The detective gets up. Shall we go?

           Carl Van Loon and Hank Atwood
           remained unaware that soon, I would

           possible murderer.
                         
          Eddie is making a presentation to the Van Loon Associates --
          and a skeptical-looking OLDER GUY -- HANK ATWOOD.
                         
                          EDDIE (CONT'D)
           ...well, a unified front between
           Van Loon and Atwood would be
           lethally effective, and not a
           moment too soon.. SyCorps, Andine
           and others are jockeying for the
           same industrial concessions in
           Mexico that both our companies are

                          EDDIE
           Well, the governmental bribe
           structure is, in itself, corrupt,
           so of course information about its
           inner workings, like anything, can
           be bought. And there are other
           barbarians waving cash at the
           gates. I have a list here, in
           descending order of threat...
                         
          Atwood rubs his temples, seemingly distracted. But then, he

                          VAN LOON
           You haven't asked the question.
                         
                          EDDIE
           All right. If all this comes

                          VAN LOON
           You should have pre-negotiated.
                         
                          EDDIE

           You shouldn't.
                         
          Eddie returns Van Loon's look coolly, implying that it really
          might be in Van Loon's best interest to trust him.

                          REALTOR
           Twelve point five.
                         
          Eddie has to look away from her, biting his lip. He can't
          show her any sign of sticker shock. The face he turns back to
          her is composed, even blase. He shrugs -- no problem!
                         
          We see an almost sexual excitement dance in her eyes.

           EDDIE (V.O.)
           It was, as it turned out, a good
           moment to move.
                         
          Eddie comes in. The room has been completely ripped to pieces
          -- just like Eddie's apartment. Eddie just smiles. Because
          there was nothing for anyone to find.
                         
          EXT. WASHINGTON SQUARE PARK - DAY
                         
           EDDIE (V.O.)
           No one knew, or would ever know,
           that I now carried the pills with
           me at all times.
                         
          Eddie stands, waiting, his two security guys lurking 10 steps
          behind. GENNADY appears, now with TWO RUSSIAN THUGS of his
          own. This is new, and Eddie wasn't expecting it.
                         
          Gennady's security guys eye Eddie's security guys, and vice
          versa. Gennady is wearing a suit and looks much more
          sophisticated. Eddie hands Gennady a small envelope. Gennady
          takes it. In his eyes is a penetrating intelligence.
                         
           EDDIE (V.0.) (CONT'D)
           Right away, it was obvious he was
           on MDT.
                         
          Gennady whips out a silver lighter and lights himself a
          cigarette. His movements are elegant, refined.
                         
                          GENNADY
           Next week...? I require twenty
           pills.
                         
                          EDDIE
           Next week? You can fuck yourself.

          Gennady's eyebrow goes up. Gennady's security guys reach into
          their jackets. So do Eddie's guys. Gennady's eyes flick over
          the situation, motion to his guys to keep still. Gennady
          laughs, an unpleasant sound.
                         
                          GENNADY
           I don't think your Forbes 400 new
           financial friends would appreciate
           the details of your little dilemma
           with the police?
                         
          Gennady turns with a flourish and walks off. Over his
          shoulder, with smug confidence:
                         
                          GENNADY (CONT'D)
           Thursday. You have them here.
                         
          Gennady turns, walks to the curb, where a NEW BLACK TOWN CAR
          is waiting for him and his boys.
                         
           EDDIE (V.0.)
           Obviously, this could not go on.
           But there is very little on this
           earth that 45 million dollars can't
           solve. And tomorrow at nine, Atwood
           would sign the papers.

          She speaks with great dignity, distraught, but tightly
          controlled.
                         
           MRS. ATWOOD (CONT'D)
           Obviously, it wouldn't be in our
           best interests for this to be
           reported by the press, as it might
           put some of his interests at risk.
           I just want you to know that we
           have every intention of signing the
           contract, and, as soon as he is

           Thank you so much. I rely on your
           discretion.
                         
          She shakes both of their hands. A driver has the door open
          for her; she gets in, now out of earshot.

           They'd kept me all day.
                         
          Eddie rushes down the steps, two at a time, looks at his
          watch.
                         
           EDDIE (V.0.) (CONT'D)
           I'd missed my meeting with Gennady.

          Gennady, wearing a gorgeous cashmere coat, waits, now with
                         
          THREE SECURITY GUYS.
                         
          Gennady looks at his watch, then says something low and
          sinister in Russian to his associates.
                         
           EDDIE (V.O.)
           But I had more important

          INT. VAN LOON'S OFFICE - DUSK
                         
          Eddie hurries into the room. Van Loon doesn't look up. He's
          watching a monitor, which has a live news feed to a financial
          channel.
                         
                          FEMALE NEWSCASTER
           ...And the Dow has been yo-yoing

           Van Loon Associates and Hank Atwood
           have negotiated a merger...
                         
          Van Loon turns to Eddie, furious, agitated.
                         
                          VAN LOON
           Have you been talking to anyone?

           You're not telling me there's been
           any movement.
                         
                          VAN LOON
           No. Atwood's in a coma.
                         
                          EDDIE
           A coma?
                         
          Black looks between them as the newscaster continues.
                         
           EDDIE (V.0.) (CONT'D)
           It had gotten out, somehow. But I
           felt thick, stupid, tired. A small
           pain was starting behind my eyes.
           I'd been unable to take my MDT, and
           I was overdue.
                         
          He shoots Van Loon a glance. Van Loon is miserably fixated on
          the TV.
                         
          INT. VAN LOON'S HUGE, SLEEK BATHROOM - DUSK
                         
          Eddie stands in a stall. Reaches into the lining of his coat.
          Unfastens the opening of the compartment.
                         
          CLOSE ON THE OPENING
                         
          There is nothing inside.
                         
          EDDIE,
                         
          panicked, feels again. Nothing. The MDT is simply not
          there!!! He begins to hyperventilate. Spin in place. Push
          against the stall walls, trying not to scream.
                         
           EDDIE (V.0.)
           Was it Brandt? Or someone else? The
           police station? A coat room? How?
           How?
                         
          He bursts from the stall, alone in the bathroom. Stares at
          himself, terrified, in the mirror.
                         
           EDDIE (V.0.) (CONT'D)
           In an hour I'd be useless. In two
           I'd be sick. In 24, dead.

          INT. VAN LOON'S OFFICE - NIGHT
                         
          Eddie bursts from the bathroom. Trying not to look too wild-
          eyed.
                         
                          VAN LOON
           Eddie--? This came for you.
                         
          Eddie looks at a LARGE BOX on Van Loon's desk. Indeed, his
          name is on it. Eddie, mystified, approaches it. As Van Loon
          continues to stare at the TV, disinterested in the box, Eddie
          gingerly opens it.
                         
          INT. THE BOX - CLOSE
                         
          Inside are the SEVERED HANDS OF EDDIE'S SECURITY GUYS. (One
          black hand, one with the distinctive tattoos.) Gennady.
          Clearly these guys are dead. Eddie grabs the box and starts
          from the room.
                         
                          VAN LOON
           What are you doing, Eddie--?
           EDDIE--!!!
                         
          But Eddie's gone.

          People are leaving for the night. Eddie shoves past them,
          still holding the damning box, frightened, jacked up,
          desperate, shoving people out of the way to get to the
          elevators.

          beside him.
                         
           EDDIE (V.O.)
           I couldn't think.
                         
          ON EDDIE'S FACE
                         
          His brow is beaded with sweat.
                         
           EDDIE (V.O.)
           Only MDT could help me. I had no
           MDT. And then...
                         
          PUSH IN on Eddie's eyes.

           Was there anywhere...
                         
          We begin to REWIND... in Eddie's mind... through many IMAGES
          we've seen in this movie... stopping briefly at all the
          places Eddie has stashed his MDT.

          We STOP at the END TABLE in Lindy's apartment, peer inside.
          Empty. We STOP at the UNDERSIDE of the GRILL on Eddie's old
          stove. Nothing. We continue to REWIND -- but every image we
          stop on reveals... nothing.

          Eddie sits at his huge new steel dining table, the evil box
          on the table in front of him, head in his hands.
                         
          (The room is filled with labeled boxes he has never had a
          chance to unpack.) The TV is on in the background. It's a
          financial channel. We see MRS. HANK ATWOOD is giving a
          statement.
                         
           MRS. HANK ATWOOD
           There is absolutely no truth to the
           rumor of this merger. None
           whatsoever. My husband is having
           some tests, this is a difficult
           time, and I would appreciate your
           directing further questions to our
           attorney...
                         
          She motions at the gentleman next to her. --Who is also
          Eddie's attorney, MORRIS BRANDT. The one who was so helpful
          with the police. The one who held his jacket.
                         
          Bitter amusement in Eddie's eyes. At least he knows. The
          APARTMENT BUZZER buzzes. Eddie freezes. Looks at the door. It
          BUZZES again.
                         
           EDDIE (V.0.)
           It wasn't downstairs security,
           alerting me to a visitor.

           It was my inner door. Someone was
           in the building, ten feet away,
           right now.
                         
          Eddie walks to his phone, picks it up. Pushes the button,
          puts it to his ear. It's dead.
                         
          He pushes the "on" button again and again. Nothing. The
          buzzer BUZZES again. Eddie rushes to the door, opens the COAT
          CLOSET. In the closet is a state-of-the-art SECURITY MONITOR.
                         
          Gennady and TWO MEN are outside his door! Suddenly the
          MONITOR goes BLACK. Eddie flicks the switch on the monitor.
          Nothing. Eddie flicks the switch again. It's dead. Someone,
          somewhere, has figured out how to disarm it.
                         
          The buzzer BUZZES again. Eddie backs away from the door. We
          HEAR Eddie's shallow, panicked breathing. He lunges for his
          briefcase, pulls out his CELL PHONE.

          It reads "No Signal." BAM! The first slam on the door begins.
          BAM! The second. The door holds, but Eddie begins to back
          away in horror.
                         
          BAM!

           and horribly. But this choice would
           at least be mine.
                         
          We now hear the ZZZZZZZZ! of some major power tool drilling
          at the door, punctuated by more BAMS! -- one way or another
          they're going to get in. Eddie takes a breath, tries to jump.
          He can't.

          it's full of BOOKS. Mis-labeled. JUMP CUTS as he rips open
          other boxes... his hands frantically scattering CDs, cutlery,
          cans of food... The door begins to give. Under the deafening

          MORE JUMP-CUTS as Eddie hysterically tears the packing paper
          off of promisingly- shaped objects. --No. A glass. --No. A
          vase. --YES! The sugar bowl. With sugar still inside! Eddie
          rummages, frantically, among the sugar cubes as the door
          gives a few inches, groaning, and we glimpse blurred faces on
          the other side...

          ONE MDT TABLET looks back up at him.
                         
          Yes. It's really there! Eddie grabs it, just as, with a
          splintering CRASH! -- The door goes down.
                         
          Eddie steps back, brings the pill up to his mouth... But as

          towards a GRATE in the floor -- a heating vent -- and HITS
          it... rolling... ... before disappearing forever down the
          grate.
                         
          Eddie knows that's it. His life has ended. He sucks in his
          last breath -- then, with a YELL, he rushes back for the
          terrace... for his suicide leap...
                         
          Thug #1 is quicker. Gets to the door first. Eddie will not
          have the luck to be able to jump. He's trapped between the
          two Thugs.
                         
                          GENNADY
           I told you I want more. You don't
           listen. Maybe you think I'm
           joking...
                         
          He reaches into his coat pocket...
                         
                          GENNADY (CONT'D)
           But I'm down to this last one.
                         
          ...and pulls out a syringe.
                         
                          GENNADY (CONT'D)
           See, I dissolve pill in solution.
           You shoot it - goes straight into
           blood and to brain. Works much
           better.
                         
          He pulls the plastic sleeve off the needle. Jabs himself in
          the arm and injects the cloudy liquid.
                         
                          GENNADY (CONT'D)
           Now. Where do you keep yours?
                         
          Eddie is backed to the wall. Nowhere to go.
                         
                          EDDIE
           I'm plum out.
                         
          Gennady just smiles -- that was an unfortunate choice. He
          gives an order to the Thugs who grab their tools and
          disappear deeper into the apartment. WE HEAR them starting to
          tear things up. Gennady and Eddie are alone.
                         
                          GENNADY
           They will find it. Or I will make
           you tell me. Which is quicker? We
           see, huh?

          He clicks open a BLACK ATTACHE CASE. It is filled with

          INT. EDDIE'S STUDY - NIGHT
                         
          Thug #2 has found, behind a bureau, a SAFE. He calls
          excitedly, in Russian, to the other room.
                         
          INT. EDDIE'S LIVING ROOM - NIGHT
                         
          Gennady calls back in Russian. Then picks up a particularly
          delicate, yet sharp-looking KNIFE.
                         
                          GENNADY
           This is a waste of my time, you
           know that? I am getting out of this
           part of the business... starting
           import-export company. Very
           exciting stuff. A lot on my plate.
           I need to learn to delegate...
                         
          Eddie is backed up against a table, which is covered with
          stuff he's scattered, which includes a BUTCHER BLOCK with A
          KNIFE in it... Gennady starts arranging his instruments.
                         
                          GENNADY (CONT'D)
           First, I will cut skin from you,
           flay you... you stay alive nice
           long time... then maybe we cut meat
           from you, steaks... or maybe softer
           parts... I get inspiration...
                         
          He looks up, smiles, to see the effect his words have on
          Eddie.
                         
                         ON EDDIE
                         
          Staring back at Gennady, hard, a fuck-you stare. We can't see
          behind Eddie's back, but we can see the butcher block, and
          the knife is gone.
                         
                         GENNADY
                         
          senses something is not right. Looks at Eddie quizzically.
                         
                          GENNADY (CONT'D)
                          WHAT--
                         
          Eddie brings the knife up as hard as he can, right into
          Gennady's stomach. Gennady gasps in surprise, chokes,
          writhes. Eddie drives the knife home, harder, grabbing
          Gennady's other hand, which lashes at Eddie with the fillet
          knife...

          The men fall to the floor in a death-struggle. Eddie
          exhausted, off MDT, but determined not to let go. Gennady
          writhes, flails, but doesn't cry out... he's already choking
          on blood. Eyes shocked, surprised. Eddie turns the fillet
          knife back on Gennady, slashes at his other arm; blood
          spurts. But it's not necessary. Gennady's eyes are glazing.
          His gurgling gets quieter. He's quite dead.
                         
          Eddie lies alongside him, panting, arm grazed and welling
          blood from where Gennady's filleting knife slashed him,
          suddenly weak and exhausted.
                         
          From the other room comes the BRRRRRRR! sound of the drill --
          the boys, oblivious, are hard at work on the safe. Eddie
          tries to get up, then falls back.
                         
           EDDIE (V.O.)
           Not much of a triumph, was it?
                         
          He's got the shakes... no, more of a convulsion... he sinks
          back to the floor...
                         
           EDDIE (V.0.) (CONT'D)
           Because I would die here, too.
                         
          There is a break in the convulsion. Then another one starts.
                         
           EDDIE (V.0.) (CONT'D)
           Only MDT could help me, and the
           last of it was in this fuck's
           bloodstream...
                         
          Gennady's BLOOD wells around Gennady's body in a crimson
          puddle. A puddle that's creeping closer and closer to Eddie's
          face, which is lying, convulsing, on the floor...
                         
          ON EDDIE'S EYES
                         
          between convulsions, suddenly looking. Looking at the blood.
          It creeps closer to Eddie's face. Eddie is trying to move,
          trying to push his face closer to the blood... he's there...
                         
          And now he turns his face down into the blood.
                         
          And begins to lap it up.

          behind him EXPLODE...... the MAN goes down...revealing Eddie
          standing behind him --(he's been holding up his neighbor's
          body) and, just as this registers -- WHACK! -- Eddie gives
          THUG #1 a savage shot with a fireplace poker. Thug #1 goes
          down, unconscious... the gun skitters across the floor...
                         
          THUG #2 dives, reaches for it. Eddie grabs a piece of the
          shattered glass and, in a vicious swipe, brings it down on
          the Thug's hand. But this guy is not a tough Russian
          motherfucker for nothing. Bleeding profusely, he doesn't let
          go of the gun... his bloody hand comes up, tries to aim...

          holding up the awning... The awning comes down on the thug, a
          huge canvas curtain DROPPING between the Thug and Eddie.
          BLAM! BLAM! Several holes appear in the canvas as the thug
          tries to shoot Eddie anyway, but Eddie has leapt out of the
          way.

          just watching him calmly. He starts to smirk. Eddie touches a
          MATCH to the ground. The FLAME shoots across the floor to the
          thug, who now realizes he's standing in a puddle, the
          overturned can of BBQ fluid next to him. In an instant, his
          LEGS AND PANTS are on fire. Now the man screams. Shoots
          blindly. But - click! -- is out of bullets. He rushes at
          Eddie, screaming, on fire, in animal rage. Eddie brings up a
          wrought-iron patio chair to meet him, catching him squarely
          in the ribs. He gasps, bends over... looks up at Eddie,
          beaten...
                         
          The face that looks back is without pity.

           certainly am. If my attorney was

           save his life, then why is he dead?
           At what point was the Pony Express

          casual authority, is on the phone.
                         
                          REUBEN
           ...actually, no, there's no more
           tickets. --Yeah, I know, an
           overbooked fundraiser -- there's a
           first -- well, here he comes, I'll
           ask him -- Edward!!
                         
          We see Eddie striding down the corridor, wearing a sharp
          suit, looking more dignified than we've ever seen him, more
          adult. The snap and crackle of something new -- power -- is
          in his step. TWO MALE AIDES flank him. Reuben approaches,
          falls into step with them.
                         
                          REUBEN (CONT'D)
           I think we're looking at a second,
           overflow event-- there's a wave of
           donations coming in -- and I don't
           think they're even going to try a
           second debate -- don't go yet --
                         
                          EDDIE
           I have a lunch.
                         
          They have arrived at Eddie's office. Reuben nods at the
          closed door.
                         
                          REUBEN
           John Steadman's in there.
                         
                          EDDIE
           Who's that?
                         
                          REUBEN
           --Eiben-Chemcorps? Look, they're
           your biggest contributor, give him
           his two shitty little minutes.
                         
          Eddie sighs, capitulating. Puts his hand on the door.
                         
                          EDDIE
           Eiben-Chemcorps. What are they --
           research?
                         
                          REUBEN
           Pharmaceuticals.
                         
          Eddie shoots him a look.

          INT. A LARGE, CASUAL OFFICE - DAY
                         
          Eddie comes in to find JOHN STEADMAN, 50's, well-dressed and
          gentlemanly, waiting.
                         
                          STEADMAN
           Mr. Morgan.
                         
                          EDDIE
           Nice to see you.
                         
          He shakes Steadman's hand, but Steadman doesn't get up. Odd.
          In fact Steadman looks uncommonly relaxed, almost slouched in
          his chair, looking up at Eddie with a subtle gleam in his eye
          that Eddie doesn't recognize.
                         
                          EDDIE (CONT'D)
           We appreciate everything you've
           done for us--
                         
                          STEADMAN
           Well, you've done most of it for
           yourself. Senator Morgan.
                         
          He says this with a kind of casual, prescient authority. And
          suddenly, we know he's right. Eddie will win.
                         
                          STEADMAN (CONT'D)
           I mean, everything from here's a
           technicality, isn't it, Eddie?
                         
          Again, that smile. Eddie doesn't know what this guy is
          about. And nobody calls him "Eddie" any more.
                         
                          STEADMAN (CONT'D)
           I think we both know where it's
           heading...
                          (A BEAT)

                          EDDIE
           Maintain?
                         
                          STEADMAN
           Eventually you'll run out. I just
           want you to know we're here to help
           you.
                         
          Eddie blinks at him. Did he just say what Eddie thought he
          said?
                         
                          EDDIE

           We've gotten most of the bugs out.
           It's longer lasting - you'll only
           have to take one a week.
                         
          Eddie is now dead silent. A long beat. Is it possible? Is
          he really talking to someone who makes MDT?!
                         
                          EDDIE
           Have you been watching me from the

                          STEADMAN
           No. Those of you who indulged...
           distinguished yourselves very
           quickly. You made yourselves clear
           to us.
                         
                          EDDIE
           Who's "us?"
                         
          Steadman just smiles, waves the question away.
                         
                          STEADMAN
           You went the furthest with it the
           fastest, so of course, to us,
           you're the most interesting.
                         
                          EDDIE
           How did it get on the street?
                         
                          STEADMAN
           Security breach. That was never
           our intention. We took care of it.
                         
          Meaning, they took care of Vern.
                         
                          STEADMAN (CONT'D)
           It will never again be on the
           street. It will never publicly
           exist. Obviously I don't need to
           detail the advantages for you.
                         
          A long beat. Eddie doesn't trust this guy -- not a bit.
                         
                          EDDIE
           And what about for you? Why don't

                          STEADMAN
           We don't have to. You'll take it
           for us.

           Just keep on doing what you're
           doing. We won't bother you much at
           first.

                          STEADMAN
           Well, given where you're heading,
           some of our ideas are... grandiose.
           But, I think, achievable.
                         
          Eddie takes that in.
                         
                          EDDIE
           And if I don't like your ideas?
                         
                          STEADMAN
           Then we'll say Godspeed. And your
           candle will have shed a brief, but
           lovely, light.
                         
          Eddie knows now. They own his ass.
                         
                          STEADMAN (CONT'D)
           But let's not even go there. Right
           now you should feel relieved, your
           problems are over. We just want to
           keep you healthy... and brilliant.
                         
                          EDDIE
           Luckily I can do that myself.
                         
                          STEADMAN
           Well, no, ah, that won't be the
           case. We shut your lab down this
           morning.

                          EDDIE (CONT'D)
           You think I didn't spend my days on
           MDT devising a personal defense
           structure that would scare the shit
           out of the Israelis--? You think
           there's not people with a bead on
           you right now, right in this
           building? You think this
           conversation is private?
                         
                          STEADMAN
           You don't know the caliber of
           enemies you'll be making.
                         
                          EDDIE
           You want to push that button? I'll
           show you my silos if you show me
           yours.
                         
                          STEADMAN
           You'll run out. You'll die.
                         
                          EDDIE
           Or I'll think of something. Isn't
           that what MDT does? Makes you
           think of something? Might even
           tell me how to get off it.
                         
          A flicker in Steadman's eyes. Anger.
                         
                          EDDIE (CONT'D)
           What if I just ask the drug... how
           to tell the drug... how to fuck
           itself? I mean, isn't it like the
           8-ball?
                         
          Steadman raises his hand to the driver and the limo pulls
          away.
                         
                          EDDIE (CONT'D)
           It always answers.
                         
          As the limo recedes into the distance, Eddie finally exhales.
                         
          And only then do we see it.
                         
          He's scared.
                         
                          THE END

PLEASE NOTE THE CRYSTAL WILL BE USED IN THE 
LEFT HAND OF ALL CHARACTERS.








FADE IN:
BEFORE AND DURING  TITLES

1		EXT. - SKY NIGHT											

The moon and stars are visible, but as CAMERA looks down, the SCREEN
fills with dark, billowing clouds. CAMERA moves into the clouds and
just  as they blank out the SCREEN, a distant shimmer of light
becomes visible.  Moving toward it, the shimmer becomes

2		EXT. - DOME OF GLASS - NIGHT

A glowing but not transparent structure stretching off into the
clouds  that press it. CAMERA continues to move in until the
detailed structural  webbing of the dome fills the SCREEN and then
CAMERA MOVES THROUGH IT and  we see

3		EXT. - THE CITY - DAY	

Shining below the dome (which we now see as a series of dome-like
structures standing off without end) -a marvelous crystalline city
of  great openness, building clusters, green plazas, fountains...
multi-leveled  but human scale, crisscrossed by the flickering clear
tubes of the MAZE- CARS.

4		CLOSER ANGLE - ROOFTOPS

As a MAZE-CAR slides softly to a stop.

5		ROOFTOP - THE RUNNER	

The hatch opens and a MAN in a hurry leaves the maze-car and runs
swiftly  along the rooftop and disappears into an open elevator
which instantly  starts to descend.
 
6		INT - RESIDENCE PLAZA - THE ELEVATOR	

From a busy courtyard below we watch the elevator slide down from a
great  height.  As it reaches the courtyard the RUNNER darts out,
pushes into  the crowd.

7 		OUT

8		WITH THE RUNNER

As he reappears around a corner, skirts a brimming pool and makes
for a  kind of broad corridor which seems to lead out of the
courtyard. He is  moving even faster now, glancing back as if he
fears pursuit.

9		ANOTHER ANGLE - CORRIDOR						

Above, at the railing of an oval light well, dressed in black and
silver,   a figure holding an odd looking weapon lazily in one hand
-- and watching.  It is FRANCIS.

10		WITH THE RUNNER			

Moving rapidly down the corridor, he suddenly stops as if feeling
the  presence above. He looks up, sees the SANDMAN and his face
breaks in  terror. He wheels, frantic, screaming, runs back into the
hall.

11		THE SANDMAN (FRANCIS)								

Vaulting the rail, dropping lightly to ground level, weapon poised.

12		P.O.V.		

The crowd melting, parting to reveal the Runner backed against the
pool.  People are YELLING, shaking their fists, terribly excited and
fearful.

13		THE SANDMAN			

Emotionless. Aims. Fires.

14		THE RUNNER - CLOSE			

Seeming to burst aflame in the LENS, then slipping BELOW FRAME to
reveal  Francis sauntering forward, holstering his weapon. The crowd
closing in  behind him, applauding, congratulating him.

15		THE SANDMAN		

Arriving at the pool where the body lies, half immersed. He leans
over,  lifts the right hand from the water, revealing a palm with a
black  flowercrystal shape in it. He lets the hand fall back now as
the crowd   CHEERS and APPLAUDS him.

16		EXTREME CLOSE UP - HAND - IN THE WATER - (INSERT)	

Closing in until the crystal fills the SCREEN.

MATCH DISSOLVE TO:

(TITLES END)

17		CLOSE UP - CRYSTAL - (INSERT)		

Clear, sparkling, flower-like. CAMERA PULLS BACK to reveal


18		INT. - NURSERY CORRIDOR		

The crystal is in the hand of a sleeping INFANT who is behind glass
in  one of many cubicles. Standing outside, looking in, LOGAN, dimly
lit in   the soft glow of the cubicle where the sleeping infant
lies, swaddled and  coccooned in the rosy auto-tender which caters
to the baby's every need.  Faint MUSIC bubbles like distant
laughter.

19		OUT

19X1		LOGAN 			

Logan is twenty-five, strong, virile (yet sensitive) with a kind of
austere grace.

He is somewhat manic...proud...as he peers through the nursery
window  into a kind of foam cocoon which cradles THREE SLEEPING
INFANTS. Logan is  KNOCKING on the soundless glass.

						LOGAN
			Wake up...come on, Logan-6.

19X2		FRANCIS

entering .

						FRANCIS  (shaking	
    					his head in  mild, mocking
	    				disbelief)	
			You are here. I  couldn't 
			believe it when they told me.  
			What are you doing?
	
						LOGAN (still knocking  
	    				on the soundless glass)  
			Turn this way. 
	    				(as one of the infants 
	   				stirs, smiles, bubbles) 
			No,  no...not you...YOU!
	
Francis tries to pull Logan away from the  window, but Logan is
intent on waking one of  the infants.

						FRANCIS               
			You should've seen me take my  
			last Runner...perfect. 
	    				(Logan  continues to pound the  
	     			soundless glass) 
			I backed him  up against a residence 
			pool and  when he terminated...his  
			hand... 
	    				(breaks off as Logan
	    				is paying  no attention)
			So now you've seen him...what's
			the difference awake or asleep?

						LOGAN (to infant)   
			Open your eyes once, idiot.  
					(to Francis) 
			It's not every  day that a Sandman 
			son is  born. I'm telling you, 
			Francis  - that's him!

						FRANCIS    
			Maybe,  maybe not. What's the  
			difference? Come on,  Logan, 
			let's get out of  here before 
			everybody  finds out.

But Logan isn't moving. Francis gets an  idea.

						FRANCIS 
			Okay...you really want to wake 
			him up?

Francis starts to pry at the Panel...knowing it  will sound an
ALARM.

						LOGAN 
			Hey, cut that out !

Too late: There is a SOUND OF ALARM CHIMES. The area in which they
stand  is bathed in a violet glow. Logan grabs Francis firmly and
stops him from  prying at the panel:
 
						LOGAN
			Now you've done it...

The CHIMES STOP...but the glow continues, a metallic VOICE is heard:

						VOICE 
			Break-in scanners report intrusion, 
			identify.

						LOGAN 
			Logan-5...Francis-7, authorized duty
			quadrant. Intrusion accidental.

						VOICE
			Clear Logan-5 and Francis-7.

The violet light goes off.


						FRANCIS (with affection:
					to Logan) 
			Had enough?

						LOGAN (looking at the infant)
			Even the alarm didn't wake him.

As Francis starts out:

						LOGAN (one last look; 
					joining Francis)
			All right, Francis...I'm with you.

They move off down the corridor...the lights behind them DIMMING as
they  pass cubicles suffused with soft pink light, CHILDREN
automatically  tended.

CHIMES...soft. A lullaby and a soothing impersonal VOICE.

						VOICE
			Sleep time...go to sleep.
			Sleeping time, little ones.

As they exit Nursery...Logan stops and takes one final look
backward.

						FRANCIS
			You need a lift. Let's go 
			to Arcade and celebrate...
					(teasing tone)
			your alert successor...Logan-6.
 
						LOGAN 
			Has anyone ever broken in to 
			where the babies are?

						FRANCIS 
					(putting a card key into a door 
					which opens soundlessly) 
			Not in my time...

They move through the door which closes.

20		EXT. - MAZE STATION - NIGHT

They are now on a kind of enclosed platform with widely spaced
doorways,  each glowing faintly. They pause, waiting.




						FRANCIS (peering 
					at Logan curiously)
			Why?

						LOGAN 
			just wondered...what happens?

						FRANCIS (shrugs) 
			Dunno...flameout maybe. Whatever 
			happens, you can bet it's final. 
			But who would want to find out?

One of the doorways brightens and the word ARCADE _ appears on it.
The  two men move to the spot as a maze-car stops. They enter it
through the  doorway which dims behind them as the maze-car WHOOSHES
softly off into a  kind of twilight.

21		INT. - MAZE-CAR - LOGAN AND FRANCIS

The door slides shut. They sink into seat forms which yield to them.
They   move off.
 
22		EXT. - MAZE- CAR

Moving through the city at terrific speed. Giving us glimpses of the
city  as it goes. slowing finally as we see:

23		THE CITY - FEATURING ARCADE

Brightly lit, garish. We get only a glimpse as the maze-car
disappears  into a tunnel.

24		MAZE-CAR STATION - ARCADE

As the maze-car stops, opens and Logan and Francis exit into   a
gathering  CROWD.

25		FULL SHOT - ARCADE

Glittering, crowded. Throngs of people moving on many levels, some
walking, some on moving platforms. It's The Great White Way, Luna
Park --  you name it. Gaudy booths and entrances, featuring every
delight -- too  much to take in at a glance.

26		WITH LOGAN AND FRANCIS

As they thread their way through a crowd which admires them when it
notices them, across halls and up moving platforms, the good-natured
argument continuing...

						LOGAN 
			but you don't know, you Just 
			say what everyone says.  One for 
			one. One for one."

						FRANCIS 
			Well, why no!? That's exactly how
			everything works. How else could 
			the city stay in balance -You have
			a better idea?
 

						LOGAN (laughs)
			No, but at least I wonder sometimes -- 
			instead of doing that "one for one" song 		
			of yours. You sound like a sleepteacher 
			With a stuck tape.

						FRANCIS
			Well the minute you get a better
			idea you can stop wondering.
					(beat)
			You know, Logan -- you wonder 
			a lot. Too much for a Sandman

They are passing the facade of a Relive Shop The signs urging people
to:  RELIVE YOUR MOST PRECIOUS MEMORIES. DO IT AGAIN AND AGAIN!
REFRESH AND  RENEW ANYTIME!!
 
As they cross the entrance, two men come out, grinning broadly,
falling  into step just ahead of Logan and Francis. Then one of the
men stops  abruptly, almost colliding with them. He mumbles an
apology and starts  back to RELIVE.

As he disappears into the RELIVE SHOP, his friend shrugs cheerfully
to  Logan and Francis and moves on.

27		ARCADE - ANOTHER ANGLE - NEW YOU

They are moving past a shop called NEW YOU #483 when a man comes
cannonading out, thrilled and excited. He rushes over to a pretty
young  woman who has been eying Logan and Francis, plants himself in
front of  her with his hands framing his face.

						MAN
			Well? How do you like it?

						WOMAN (critically) 
			I don't know. The cheeks maybe...
			look a little -

						MAN 
			Cheeks? Cheeks? Right. Too much, 
			you think?

						WOMAN 
			Too little.

						MAN 
			Too little?
					(gestures)
			Too little. Okay, wait for me.

And he darts back into NEW YOU #483. The woman shrugs, glances
around,  smiles and goes off with a passer-by.

28		ARCADE - ANOTHER ANGLE - LOVE SHOP

Signs promising LOVE, FULFILLMENT, RARE DELIGHTS. People streaming
in and  out. A woman comes out looking glazed, breathing
"yes...yes..." As she  passes CAMERA Logan and Francis emerge from
the crowd and CAMERA moves  with them.

						LOGAN
			Did you ever see Francis-8?

						FRANCIS (shaking his head) 
			I never even visited Nursery before 
			tonight. 
					(beat) 
			When you wonder, it slows you up --
			you know?

They are now passing the facade of HALLUCIMILL where the signs
promise:  LIFT OFF, CRAZY LIFT, SUPER LIFT...here the people going
in are simply  excited but the ones coming out are clearly stoned
out of their minds...

						FRANCIS 
			I don't know what makes you so curious. 
			You have any idea who his seed-mother was?

						LOGAN (quickly) 
			Of course not! I m curious, not sick.
					(laughs)

The crowd is growing denser, funneling into a kind of passageway.
Logan  and Francis are swallowed up in the group.

29		FULL SHOT - ARCADE GREAT HALL

An immense room into which the streams of people coming from the
entertainment area are mingling. There is a general air of
anticipation  stirring the crowd as CAMERA singles out Logan and
Francis entering,  waving to friends. CAMERA closes in on them just
as they reach a  beautiful woman who is obviously pleased to see
Francis. They embrace,  and as they break:

						FRANCIS
			and that's my friend, Logan. 
					(as she acknowledges 
					the introduction)
			We're celebrating his next in line.
			Carousel - Arcade - who knows? 
			Want to come along?

						WOMAN (smiles, shakes her head)
			Only if I make it to the top of
			Carousel.
					(she holds up her hand)
			Thirty -- and the big spin.

In her palm the crystal blinks, red, black. Francis nods, gives her
a  half-squeeze.

						FRANCIS 
			You're thirty -- already? I always 
			thought I was older than you - 
					(beat)
			Well, give it a good try.

						WOMAN (pleasantly) 
			You know I always have.

Another beautiful WOMAN joins them.

						2ND WOMAN (to the first) 
			Sorry I won't be at Carousel tonight. 
			It¹s  my Love-Shop turn.

						WOMAN
			That's all right. Happy turn.

						2ND WOMAN
			You'll renew. I've got a feeling.

 						WOMAN (smiles) 
			So do I...but if I don't at least I'll 
			have the ultimate thrill. I'd almost 
			rather have that than renew.

						2ND WOMAN 
			I feel the same way. Sometimes I think 
			I'm not even going to try and renew when 
			my time comes. But -- that's three years away.
			So long.

The 2nd Woman walks away.

						FRANCIS (after a beat; 
					to first Woman) 
 			It's been nice.

						WOMAN
			Um-huh.

They look briefly and then she turns away. Francis takes Logan's arm
and  they move off.
 
						FRANCIS
			I guess you never had her?

Logan shakes his head.

						FRANCIS
			You missed something special.

						LOGAN
			Well...you can't have them all.

						LOGAN AND FRANCIS 
					(together, it's an old joke)
 			But you can try.

They laugh, but the laughter is broken as a trio of youngsters,
moving  with erratic speed of lightning, smashes between them,
almost knocking  Francis over. He reels, Logan catches him and they
recover in time to see   the trio rip wildly through the crowd,
knocking people down, screaming  with shrill joy as they disappear.

						FRANCIS 
			The damned Yellows are getting out 
			of hand. Those three ought to be in 
			Cathedral. No business scrambling in 
			Arcade...

						LOGAN (laughs 
					cuffs Francis' arm)
			What an old, old man you're getting 
			to be, Francis. Weren't you ever a 
			Yellow? I bet you were even wilder 
			than -
					(he breaks off as the lights 
					in the Great Hall dim) 
			-- come on, Sandman.

The two of them start to move to the far end of the Great Hall.
 
30		FULL SHOT - GREAT HALL

As everyone begins to move to the far end, where great  curtains
have parted to reveal

31		ARCADE GREAT HALL - CAROUSEL ENTRANCE

AC the far end of the hall, where the throng is a huge crystal
design ornaments an entrance  The crystal is red and pulsing
rhythmically to the accompaniment of a deep and thrilling  TONE. As
we move toward it with Logan and Francis, the TONE  deepens, the
great pulse takes on a hypnotic quality...

32		WITH LOGAN AND FRANCIS

In the crowd they overtake a fellow Sandman,  DANIEL, and fall in
step with him. When they  speak now, their voices are hushed.
	
						LOGAN 
			You should have been with us in Nursery,  
			Daniel. I'm positive I  recognized him -

						FRANCIS (hustling
					Logan)
			Come on. I don't want to miss the
			filing-in. There'll be some I know
			tonight, I think...

						DANIEL (glances at his
					own red crystal, nods)
			Yes. Me, too. You know we're
			both on Monitor tonight.
	
						FRANCIS
			Damn! That's right. Just when I
			feel like an ALL OUT BLAST in
			Arcade .
	
						LOGAN
			Want me to take your shift? I'm
			feeling restless anyway
		
Francis glances at him, exchanges a look with Daniel. They vanish
into the throng passing under the great crystal, turn the corner and
we see

33		FULL SHOT - CAROUSEL

framed in a huge corridor we see a steep-sided  arena dropping down
to a shadowy center, which  even now pulsates and flickers in
changing  dimensions, but always maintaining the jewel- flower
shape. There is one entrance into the center -- a kind of ramp from
below the seats, leading directly into the mysterious bowl --	
Just now the seat's are filling, and the sense of expectation builds
People sit and immediately crane their necks, waiting...

34.		ANOTHER ANGLE

Featuring Logan and Francis as they find places in the arena. Like
the others, they crane upward. As they do, Logan gestures at a
number of pretty girls who are just being seated.

						LOGAN 
			Now there's a few who could have been 
			his seed-mother.
	
						FRANCIS 
			Only a few? You're just not trying.

35-36	    OUT

37		PANNING THE CROWD

As the seats fill, the excitement builds. Suddenly the lights begin
to dim and dim...

SOUND: A kind of collective sigh, breathing in unison...

38 		OUT

38X1		ANGLE THE TIER BELOW THE SEATS

Suddenly visible, the LASTDAY GROUP. Their arms are upraised and in
each palm the crystal blinks red-black, red-black.

39		THE CROWD	

Transfixed, gripped with a religious fervor.

40		LASTDAY GROUP	

Hands still raised, filing slowly into the mysterious well of
Carousel.

41		CROWD

Tense, beginning nervous APPLAUSE here and there.

42		CAROUSEL

As the last one enters, beginning to glow and, as it does, the bowl
slowly puts out leaves like some great plant, enfolding and hiding
the people within a series of translucent petals. As the Last one
enfolds them the Light intensifies, the exterior surfaces seeming to
shift as if a kind of motion was beginning inside it...

43		CROWD

Visible in the growing Light from Carousel -gripped with passion and
excitement, APPLAUDING, gesturing as they see

44		CAROUSEL

Moving, bands of light seeming to spiral upward Like a contained
aurora as the Carousel picks up speed.

45		LOGAN

Caught up in it Like the rest.

46		CAROUSEL

Beginning to blur with its own speed. Through the shifting,
spiraling curtain of light we see bodies moving in a kind of
weightlessness, always struggling to move higher.

Follow a shadowy form as it moves, twists through other writhing
shadows -- upward, upward. Suddenly the form is spread-eagled, and
in a moment it is sharply outlined against the swirling canopy and
then -- a searing flash. And it is gone.
		
SOUND: Crowd in a frenzy -- SCREAMING.

47		FULL ANGLE - THE BLEACHER CROWD - FAVORING LOGAN

Standing. SCREAMING their cheers as:

48		FULL SHOT - UP AT CAROUSEL

High, reaching downward out of the shadows beneath the dome,
fringing, intersecting rainbow bands appear, looping the swirling
upper Carousel like Saturn's rings. Now we see figures reaching
outward toward them...reaching and missing and falling -downward
against the curtain and the flash of extinction.

49		MEDIUM ANGLE - A MAN		

At the highest level...straining for the rainbow...

50		SWEEPING PAN SHOT - THE BLEACHER CROWD	

Hysterical...starting to chant...

						CROWD 
			Renew!

The man continues to strain:

						CROWD 
			Renew!

51		CLOSE ANGLE - THE MAN		

Almost a blur...but still straining:
		
						CROWD'S CHANT
			Renew!

52		CLOSE ON - LOGAN AND FRANCIS

						LOGAN AND FRANCIS
					(chanting with the rest) 
			Renew!

53		CLOSE ANGLE - THE MAN		

The blur...but still there...straining with all his might for the
rainbow...

						CROWD'S CHANT 
			Re...

Suddenly, the man...topples into the whirling blackness
below...where he is instantly incinerated.

54		WIDE ANGLE - THE CAROUSEL	

Whirling - whirling - the rainbows shining.

55		WIDE ANGLE - THE BLEACHERS		

Orgiastic pleasure -- a Spanish crowd at a perfect killing --
SCREAMING, fulfilled.

56 		OUT

57		FULL ANGLE - THE CAROUSEL
Other figures move to the topmost level...straining for the rainbow
bands.

58		CLOSE ON - LOGAN AND FRANCIS			

As the SCREAMING goes on in the b.g. of the SHUT... we hear a
BUZZING noise. Logan reaches into a pocket and takes out a small,
dark plastic box.

Logan looks at the box. On it we see:

			MAN: RELIVE STORE 14		
			
					 	LOGAN 
					(to Francis)	
			Looks like I'm working.
		
Francis stands.
		
						LOGAN
			Who invited you?

						FRANCIS
			I'm in my party mood.
		
Logan smiles . . . and the CAMERA PANS them rushing out of the
bleachers.

They make their way into the hall.

Logan takes out the small plastic box. We can tell from his face
that he is disappointed...until a faint BEEPING SOUND emanates from
the box.

Francis watches as Logan wheels in one direction... the beeping
stops. He turns in another direction... again, there is no beeping.

As Logan turns in a third direction...the BEEPING commences.
Logan and Francis move swiftly in that direction and the BEEPING
GROWS LOUDER...AND LOUDER...until Logan and Francis see:

59-
59X11	    WIDE ANGLE - A MAN 		

running.

CHASE: INTER CUT between Logan and Francis following the running man
in the great hall...empty. We can HEAR the CROWD SCREAMING in
Carousel offstage.

A. Logan and Francis separate...to encircle the running man.

B. The running man turns a corner and for a moment Logan cannot see
him.

C. As Logan turns the corner...Francis is on the other side and
FIRES at the running man...JUST MISSING HIM.

D.Francis winks at Logan as he pursues the running man up a ramp
and Logan gets it:  A little cat and mouse is in order.	

(NOTE: THE CHASE WILL BE THE DIRECTOR'S OPTION.)

E. Logan FIRES... just missing the man...Francis FIRES again. . .
just missing, too.

F. The man is in a panic as he continues up the ramp...to various
levels and areas.

G. Both barrels (of Logan and Francis' respective guns) glow again
as they FIRE...with both just missing the running man once more.

H. The man's face is crazed...and sweating...the mouse is going
berserk as he has been chased to a high level.

I. He stands frozen, petrified, driven to the edge of a high balcony
by the shots--teetering now. He is in full sight of Logan, Francis
is across the hall.

J. The Runner¹s face. He looks at death twenty feet away--Logan
aims.

K. Francis, watching, smiling at the perfect moment.

L. Logan's face. A shadow of thought, a hesitation.

M. The Runner lunges. Logan fires, misses.

N. Francis fires a salvo, drives the Runner back to the rail where
he teeters again, throws his hands in front of his face and plunges.
The SCREAMING in Carousel reaches a peak.

59X12-
63X1		    OUT

63X2		WITH LOGAN	

As he arrives at the dead body of the Runner, bends over him, turns
the man's left hand up. We see the flower crystal. Black.
Logan takes out his transceiver.

63X3		INSERT TRANSCEIVER			

A man's face visible. Logan checks it against the face of the dead
man. They are not the same.
	
63X4		ANOTHER ANGLE	

As Francis comes up, waits. Logan moves the transceiver to the dead
man's face, rests it on his forehead.

63X5		INSERT TRANSCEIVER READOUT:

The words appear: IDENT. AFFIRM....NEW YOU #483 ALTERATION

63X6		LOGAN

Scowls for a moment, then shrugs. He takes out a small flat pouch
and methodically strips from the body its few personal things,
stuffs them into the pouch. Then his eye is caught by the man's
right hand, clenched. Logan opens it. A metal ankh on a bit of
chain. It means nothing to Logan who stuffs it into the pouch and
closes it. Now again he fiddles with the transceiver, speaks into it
softly.

						LOGAN
			Runner terminated 0:31
					(a beat)
			Ready for cleanup.

Done with his job, he rises to face Francis.

						LOGAN 
					(smiling)
			That was a great shot you made.
	
						FRANCIS
			Yes.
					(beat)
			But you look a little rusty to me --
			what were you doing, wondering?

Logan shrugs. He's not sure himself. Together they walk off down the
hall, passing CAMERA
	
63X7		ANOTHER ANGLE

We see in the distance, a pair of Stickmen descending into the hall,
riding through the air on their odd vehicles, passing overhead then
descending. One hovers not far away as the other comes down, hangs a
few feet over the body.

63X8		1ST STICKMAN AND BODY	

The driver makes sure he's in position, then presses a button on one
of the arms of the vehicle. There is a broad spray of vapor from the
bottom which covers the corpse.	
					
63X9		CORPSE (INSERT)

It turns to crystals which sag away from the human form, as a sand
sculpture erodes when it's dry.

63X10		1ST STICKMAN CLOSE ON HEAP OF CRYSTALS

Satisfied, he revs his machine and it rises smoothly out of the
SHOT. As it leaves, the second machine moves down and into its
place.
		
63X11		2ND STICKMAN

Glances at the crystals, maneuvers into position, presses his
buttons.
			
63X12		CLOSER ANGLE - THE CRYSTALS, STICKMAN

Sucked up into the machine as it hovers. As the floor is once again
bare, the 2nd Stickman revs slightly and his machine pulls up and
away.
			
63X13		ANOTHER ANGLE	

As the Stickmen move up and out, we see the exhilarated crowd
beginning to pour out of Carousel.

63X14		LOGAN AND FRANCIS - ARCADE

Descending from the top level -- not much of a crowd. Francis is
gesturing toward the Hallucimill.

						FRANCIS 
			...Well I think you're getting stale. 
			You need old Lucey--Go on. Gee the whole 
			burn--try the new psycho-lift-they tell 
			me it turns you inside out...

He shoves Logan in that direction and continues on down.

						FRANCIS 
					(calling after him)
			I'll look for you here when I'm off--

And he is gone.
	
63X15		LOGAN

waves, smiling, then turns to the Hallucimill.

63X16		POV - HALLUCIMILL EXT.

Crazy, man.

63X17		BACK TO LOGAN	

Hesitates, as a COUPLE push past him gleefully on their way. He
looks and we see:
		
63X18		POV - ARCADE, UPPER LEVELS	

The people from Carousel starting to pour in, loud, happy, ready for
more fun.

63X19		LOGAN		
Not with it. He turns and starts making his way downwards towards
the exit.

63X20		LOGAN'S APARTMENT	

As he enters. Idle, restless. He crosses to a sideboard--makes
himself a drink, sips, doesn't like it. Gets rid of it, makes
another. He fiddles with things, a game--sits, gets up. Now he is
beginning to feel the drink. Takes another belt, smiles. Now he goes
over to a tall wall recess flanked by a console with many dials.

63X21		AT THE WALL RECESS		

As Logan dials, blurred and smoky images appear in the recess--a
slow protoplasmic eddying in many colors. He tunes it in and the
figure of a smiling young man appears--bejeweled, lustrous, willing.

63X22		LOGAN AT THE CONSOLE	

Bored as Mastroianni turns the dial again and the young man
dissolves. He dials again and now a beautiful young woman takes
shape. It is Jessica.
		
63X23		JESSICA AND LOGAN

Still in the recess, she makes no gesture of interest, no smile.
Around her neck, from a collar, a dangling ankh. It catches Logan's
eye. He smiles, clicks another dial and she becomes real. He reaches
out a hand and leads her out into the room.

64		LOGAN AND JESSICA

As Jessica turns to him, Logan moves in strongly and embraces her-
but, to his surprise, she resists. Logan, still holding her loosely,
is amused and surprised.

						LOGAN
			What's wrong, Available?

						JESSICA 
					(breaking away gently) 
			Please . . .No.

She backs away, almost apologetically. Logan follows, smiling.

						LOGAN
			Please . . . no ?
					(noting that she looks trapped,
					he understands)
			You mean "not here"--that's it?
			You're a private Available but
			particular,
					(he is moving in on her
					as he speaks, she retreating, 
					which amuses him)
			Don't worry. There's no one here but me. 
			And you.

						JESSICA 
			No. 
					(that stops him) 
			Just no.

						LOGAN 
			You prefer women?

						JESSICA 
			No.

						LOGAN
			Well then...?

						JESSICA
			Nothing. I felt sad, I put myself
			on the circuit. It was a mistake.

						LOGAN 
			Sad? What made you sad?
	
						JESSICA 		
			A friend of mine went on Carousel		
			tonight. Now he's gone.	
		
						LOGAN 
					(after a beat)
			Yes...probably he was renewed?

						JESSICA 
					(flatly)
			He was killed

						LOGAN
			Killed? Why do you use that word?

						JESSICA
			Isn't it right? Isn't that what
			you do? Kill.

						LOGAN
			I never 'killed' anybody in my life.
			Sandmen terminate  Runners
					(a beat)
			Who brought you?

						JESSICA 
			Nobody. I felt sad. .. I put myself
			on the circuit.

						LOGAN
			You felt sad. What's your name?

						JESSICA
			Jessica.

						LOGAN 
					(matter-of-fact)
			You're beautiful. Let's have sex.
	
						JESSICA
			No.
		
						LOGAN
			Later.

						JESSICA
			No.	

						LOGAN
			But you put yourself on the circuit!

						JESSICA
			I thought I had to do something.
		
						LOGAN			
			And?				

						JESSICA
			I changed my mind

						LOGAN
			And now?
	
						JESSICA
			Curious.

						LOGAN
			About what?
							
						JESSICA
			How a Sandman lives.

Logan smiles, takes off gunbelt, etc.

						LOGAN
			Let's have sex.
					(as Jessica shakes her head)
			I thought you were curious.
						
						JESSICA
			Not about that.

						LOGAN 
					(after a beat)
			I'm listening.

						JESSICA
			I'm afraid to tell you.

						LOGAN 
					(smiling)
			I'm not armed.
					(a beat)
			Well?

						JESSICA
			Why is it wrong to run?				

						LOGAN
			You shouldn't even think such things...
					(smiles)
			And you picked a strange person to
			say them to - 
		
						JESSICA
			I suppose. But what if you want
			to live?

						LOGAN
			So? Do what everyone does. Try
			like hell for renewal.

Logan stretches out his right hand. We see a red flower crystal
embedded and centered in his right palm. It is exactly the same
shape that we have seen in black in the palm of the dead runner.

						LOGAN
			When this turns black...that's it.
					(laughs) 
			If for any reason you want to be 31...
			you have the same chance as everyone 
			else...Carrousel.

Logan takes his gun and points it at her.

						LOGAN 		(playfully) 
			But if you're one of the misfits... 
			that's where I come in.

						JESSICA (somewhat
					frightened)
			I didn't say that I would run...
			I Just...

						LOGAN (interrupting;
					turning over her palm)
			Are you a 5 or a 6?
					(we see a green crystal)

						JESSICA
			Six. I go red next year.

						LOGAN
			You're years away . . . I don't know
			why you're thinking of these things,
			much less talking about them.
					(offering Jessica the gun) 
			Want to try?

Jessica shakes her head. Logan looks at Jessica carefully...in an
admiring sexual way...from her toes to her head...briefly noticing
(in the process) chat she is wearing an identical piece of jewelry
that he has taken off the dead runner...around her neck.

						LOGAN
			What Quad do you live in?

						JESSICA 
			K.

						LOGAN (softly)
			You're sure you don't want to try?

Jessica nods.

						LOGAN 	
			It's nice to know you can nod.	

Jessica smiles.

						LOGAN
			It's nice co know you can do that,
			too.
	
Suddenly Francis and two dishevel led young WOMEN burst in and come
laughing toward Logan and Jessica Stoned, hilarious, they crowd
around Logan one of them embracing him. In the wild hilarity,
Jessica slips away and Logan, seeing her go, makes a vain effort
after her. Francis notices, laughs. Amid the noise he shouts to
Logan:
	
						FRANCIS
			These are for me -- you've got your
			own.
					(looking after Jessica)
			She must have been something--?
	
At Logan's expression he roars with laughter Francis picks up an
atomizer and hurls it at the ceiling where it shatters and a great
pink cloud settles over them all.

64X1		EXT. - SAND MAN H.Q.

A frowning structure of dark stone and mirrored copper, fronted by
broad steps. Logan and Francis are climbing the steps as a SANDMAN
is coming out... His uniform is in tatters. They greet one another...then:

						LOGAN
			What happened to you?

						SANDMAN (embarrassed)
			I lost a Runner in Cathedral.

						LOGAN
			How come?

						SANDMAN
			Ran into some Cubs I couldn't manage. 
					(as they stare)
			One of them cut me bad... 
					(extends his arm and moves 
					a finger from his shoulder to 
					his wrist)
			all the way down.
					
						FRANCIS
					(with anger)	
			CUBS!	
		
						SANDMAN (shrug)
			On my way to the New You for repairs.

						LOGAN 
			Get yourself a new face while you're 
			at it They know you now.

They wave. Logan and Francis continue.

64AX1-
64BX1	    OUT
		
64CX1		INT. - SANDMAN H.Q. LOBBY (VOICE OVER)

As Logan and Francis cross, turn into a corridor.
		
						LOGAN
			I just might look in on New You 483
			myself.

						FRANCIS 
			You? Why? You're already beautiful.

						LOGAN 
			No -- it's that last Runner -- someone 
			in 483 was trying to help him.

64X2		INT. - SANDMAN H.Q. - READY ROOM

As Logan and Francis cross the room, Logan nods to other Sandmen,
who are monitoring areas of the Megalopolis on video consoles. One
of these Sand-men speaks to Francis who hasn't greeted them

					SANDMAN (Monitor)
			What's with you, Francis?
	
					FRANCIS (touching his
				head; grimacing)
			Last night
		
The other Sandmen, including Logan, smile as Logan and Francis
continue to:

65-68	OUT

69		INT. - SANDMAN H.Q. - DEBRIEFING AREA

Black door opens revealing Logan and Francis who now enter a mammoth
room. As they walk. . . they pass FOUR GIANT LIFECLOCKS...WHITE,
YELLOW GREEN AND RED.
 	  
Each LIFECLOCK pulses out the moments of every person alive in the
city, governing everyone's crystal changes automatically shifting to
the next LIFECLOCK when the time comes.

There are no humans.

Francis walks over to a circular table at the end of the room....
above which is a circular overhang. There is a groove...the shape of
a palm crystal on one part of the circular table.

Francis takes out the plastic bag which contains the contents of the
dead Runner's pockets and starts putting the contents on the table.
(These contents are the ones from the Runner Francis has killed at
the beginning of the film.)

The moment the first item touches the table...it activates a scanner
on the overhang above.	
			
Francis stands alongside the table...his attitude is very matter-of
fact. He has been through this procedure many, many times.
He touches his head...(the hangover)...and Logan smiles. Moments
later...the scanner stops...the word:
	|	
			IDENTIFY

appears on a SCREEN. Francis places his palm into the groove. . .
and the words:
	
			CLEAR
			FRANCIS-7

appear on the SCREEN.

						FRANCIS
			See you in the hydrotoner!
		
Logan nods.

Francis exits as Logan places the contents of a plastic bag with the
items he has taken off the Runner who jumped to his death. Among
them is the odd-shaped piece of jewelry.

Logan is standing nonchalantly...as the scanner moves over the
items...waiting to be quickly identified and cleared as Francis was
earlier.

The scanner continues scanning.

Logan starts becoming impatient...but the scanning goes on and on
and on.

Now...Logan is clearly puzzled...it has never...ever taken anything
remotely resembling this length of time.

Suddenly, directly before him...on the SCREEN... the word:

		PROBABILITY

blinks on and off...on and off...catching Logan's attention. As
Logan turns toward the SCREEN...the scanner stops moving. The word
PROBABILITY blinks off and is replaced by the word:
	
		APPROACH

We can tell from Logan's expression as he walks to the corner. . .
that he has never seen this before.
		
Logan sits in a chair in the area facing the SCREEN. There is a
stellar groove (that we have seen on the Table) the shape of a palm
crystal....glowing on an arm of the chair.

The word on the SCREEN is now:

		IDENTIFY

Logan places his right palm with the flower crystal into the groove.
We hear a HUMMING NOISE....then: The piece of jade Jewelry appears
on the SCREEN and below the piece of jewelry the following words
appear on the SCREEN:

		OBJECT OCCURS IN NONRANDOM 
		PATTERN AND FREQUENCY. LINKED 
		WITH OBSOLETE WORD: SANCTUARY. 
		PROBABLE EXISTENCE ESTABLISHED. 
		QUESTION: IDENTIFY OBJECT?

						LOGAN
			Negative. Question: What is it?
	
Words on SCREEN now read:

		PREMILLENNIAL SYMBOL.
		NAME: ANKH. QUESTION:
		IDENTIFY CONCEPT SANCTUARY?

						LOGAN
			Negative.

Words on SCREEN now read:

		SANCTUARY: CODE WORD PREMILL-
		ENNIAL RELIGIONS DENOTING 
		PLACE OF IMMUNITY.

						LOGAN
			I don't understand?

Words on SCREEN now read:

		SANCTUARY NOW MATHEMATICALLY 
		RELATED TO UNACCOUNTED 
		CITIZENS NUMBERING 1056.
			
						LOGAN
			Question:

Word on SCREEN now reads:	

		HOLD
	
It disappears and words on SCREEN now read:

		OBJECT ANKH ASSOCIATED 
		WITH UNACCOUNTED CITIZENS 1056. 
		CONCLUSION SANCTUARY EXISTENT.... 
		RUNNER GOAL.

						LOGAN 
			1056 unaccounted for?!

Word on SCREEN reads:

		CORRECT

						LOGAN
			Impossible!
					(Rising tone) 
			Question: Maybe they weren't all Runners. 
			Maybe most of them reached Life Renewal 
			on Carousel.

Words on SCREEN read:

		NEGATIVE...UNACCOUNTED
		CITIZENS 1056...

						LOGAN 
			Question: None of them reached renewal?

Word on SCREEN reads:

		ZERO

						LOGAN
			But everyone believes that some....

Words on SCREEN read:

		ANSWER: ZERO
		UNACCOUNTED CITIZENS
		NUMBER 1056....LOGAN-
		5 ASSIGNED TO LOCATE
		SANCTUARY AND REPORT....

						LOGAN 
			Question: You mean nobody's ever 
			been renewed?

Words on SCREEN read:

		- - QUESTION ANSWERED....
		ZERO....ECOLOGICAL-NEGATIVE...

As Logan reacts the new words which appear read:	
			
		AUTHORIZATION TO	
		PENETRATE CITY SEALS...

						LOGAN (startled)
			The Seal......
					(Breaks off)
			Question: The Seals? Go outside?!
			But there's nothing outside!

The words on the SCREEN read:

		SANCTUARY DESTRUCT...
		FIND		
		DESTROY

						LOGAN
			I will.
	
The words on the SCREEN read:

		ASSIGNMENT SECRET.

						LOGAN
			Question:
					(a beat)
			What if I need help from another
			Sandman?

The words on the SCREEN read:

		NEGATIVE. REPEAT: ASSIGNMENT 
		SECRET. LOGAN-5 TRANSFER TO 
		RUNNER SEEKING SANCTUARY.
		
Logan takes a breath.

						LOGAN
			Question: I am six Red...how can
			I pretend to be approaching Lastday?

The words on the SCREEN read:

		LIFECLOCK--ALTER

						LOGAN
			My Lifeclock...
					(slightest beat)
			Question: My Life-- 

Before the startled Logan can finish...he feels a shock of pain and
his hand is immobile. Logan stares at the back of his hand as if it
wasn't his. His forehead shines with sweat.

Now the entire area, including the chair and the screen begins to
glow bright red. The glowing becomes so bright that Logan is forced
to close his eyes.

As the glow subsides...Logan looks at his right hand. The red flower
crystal in his palm is blinking. He stares at it, fascinated,
fearful.
			
						LOGAN
			Question:
					(urgent tone)
			Am I still six Red?
			
The words on the SCREEN read:

		LIFECLOCK-ALTER

						LOGAN (standing)
			I know that but I had four more years
				(extending the blinking palm)
			This means ten days to Lastday.
			Of course I will get the four years
			back, won't I?

The words on the SCREEN read:

		TAKE OBJECT WITH YOU

						LOGAN (very urgent) 
			Question: Do I get my four years back?

Too late. The SCREEN is BLANK. For a moment his lips part as if to
say something more but he changes his mind, turns away.

Now Logan walks over to the table and removes the ankh. Almost
automatically, he starts moving his hand toward the groove...but the
SCREEN already has the words:

		CLEAR LOGAN-5

Logan looks at it - then:

The CAMERA PANS Logan out of the mammoth room.... past the GIANT
LIFECLOCKS....where he pauses.... glances at his BLINKING
CRYSTAL....and continues out into:

69X1		INT. - HYDROTONER - DAY	

Spectacularly 23rd century. Logan enters. He looks around and spots
Francis.... in a whirlpool bath....trying to recover from has
incredible hangover.

In the b.g. of the SHOT we can see some Sandmen doing calisthenics.
Logan walks over to Francis....hiding his blinking crystal by
holding his hand against his leg.
						
						FRANCIS
			What the hell took you so long?

						LOGAN 
					(after a beat) 
			Did you ever see anybody renew?

						FRANCIS 
			I think you've been skulling out too 
			much. First Nursery and now stupid 
			questions.

						LOGAN 
			Did you?

						FRANCIS 
			Of course.

						LOGAN 
			Anybody we know?

						FRANCIS 
			Look....why don't you get into the 
			water....you need it....more than I do.

						LOGAN 
					(after a beat) 
			I'm fine....
					(walking away)
			See you....

						FRANCIS 
			At Carousel tonight?

Logan nods, exits. The CAMERA REMAINS on a slightly puzzled FRANCIS
for a moment then FOLLOW Logan out to:

70		EXT. - SANDMAN BUILDING	

Logan is on the steps, irresolute. He looks at his blinking
crystal...moves as if to reenter, changes his mind. Now takes out
the black box, dials.

						LOGAN 
					(into box)
			Location...female Green Six...
			name Jessica...living in Quad K.

71-73 	OUT

73X1		INT. - LOGAN'S APARTMENT	

Logan opens the door to see Jessica. Behind her a young SANDMAN who
has obviously escorted her there.

						YOUNG SANDMAN (smiling)
			She says she's been here before...

						LOGAN
			She has.

Jessica half turns and shrugs a 'see?'. The young Sandman's smile
widens, he waves to Logan and shoves off.

						JESSICA
			You could have called me yourself.

						LOGAN
			But I wasn't sure you'd come.

						JESSICA 
					(the game has started)
			Here I am. 
					(beat)
			Shall I come in?

Logan gestures, leading her inside to the living area.

						LOGAN
			I couldn't get you out of my mind.

						JESSICA
			I'm the most beautiful woman you've
			ever seen, I suppose?

						LOGAN
			Maybe...sure....

						JESSICA
			Thanks...but I have the choice.
				
						LOGAN	
			Of course.		
						
						JESSICA	
			Then it's still no.

Logan laughs.

						JESSICA	
			You can have any woman in the city.				
			What do you really want?				

						LOGAN
			You know

						JESSICA
			I don't believe you. There has to
			be more.

						LOGAN
			All right.

Logan extends his right hand. He turns his right palm so that.
Jessica can see it blinking red.

Jessica gasps for a moment...then:

						JESSICA
			Why show me?

						LOGAN
			I'm going to run.

						JESSICA (after
					reacting)
			Why tell me?

						LOGAN
			You know something.
	
						JESSICA
			About running, dying what?

						LOGAN
			Both...running's what I'm interested
			in.

						JESSICA
			I know what everyone knows. Try
			like hell for Renewal. You have
			the same chance everyone else has.

						LOGAN
			It's different now. Help me.

						JESSICA
			How can I?

Logan takes out the ankh.

						JESSICA
			Where did you get that?

						LOGAN
			A Runner gave it to me.

						JESSICA 	
			And then you killed him, right?				

						LOGAN
			I let him go...believe me.

						JESSICA
			I don't..

						LOGAN (a beat)
			Speak to your friends for me, Jessica...
			please...

						JESSICA
			Please? What friends?

						LOGAN 
				(clutching the ankh, looking 
				at Jessica's; then:)
			I don't have much time.

						JESSICA
			I never heard of a Sandman running
			. . . ever. . .

						LOGAN (putting the
			ankh in his pocket;
			dropping the bombshell)
			And I never heard of Sanctuary.

Jessica reacts. She is about to speak. . .doesn't..

Logan reaches out and touches her hand.

						LOGAN
			What can I do to make you believe me?

Jessica draws her hand away quickly from his touch.

Logan stands and starts out...as Jessica watches him..

74-81	OUT 

82		EXT. - A SLEEK, OUTDOOR RESTAURANT - NIGHT

There are three men and a woman seated at a table. Jessica reaches
the table and sits down.

83		CLOSE ON - LOGAN	

A distance away...watching.

84-85 	OUT	 

86		EXT. - RESTAURANT - FULL ANGLE - THE THREE MEN,
		WOMAN AND JESSICA

Eating without enthusiasm...obviously more interested in their
conversation.

						SECOND MAN 
			He's blinking...so what? Sandmen get 
			old, too.

						FIRST MAN
			But what if he's telling the truth?

						THIRD MAN
			I say no. It's not worth the risk.

						WOMAN
			I absolutely agree. He's killed Runners 
			for a decade. He has no feelings.

						JESSICA
			He was born a Sandman. He had no
			choice.

						WOMAN 
			Neither do we.

87-88 	OUT

88X1		SANDMAN READY ROOM	

Four Sandmen at the consoles. They look up as Francis enters. He 
goes to one of the men who stretches, yawns, gets up.
		
						1ST SANDMAN
			Thanks, Francis.
		
						FRANCIS (taking his
					place at the console)
			Just don't be forever about it like last 
			time.

						1ST SANDMAN
			Ah-h you love it. You're afraid
			you'll miss a really good Run.		

They all laugh. Francis takes up his watch as the other exits.

89 OUT

89X1		EXT - RESTAURANT - THREE MEN A WOMAN AND JESSICA

Leaning together talking in an undertone
			
						SECOND MAN (urgently)	
			If he believes you, he'll come.	
			
						JESSICA	
			Why Arcade Station?
			
						SECOND MAN (impatiently)
			Why? It's our only chance--kill him
			and get away in the crowd heading
			for the evening slaughter --
				
						JESSICA
			Right at the station itself?

						MAN
			No - just there - on the first level.
					(beat)
			Don't look for us. We'll see you.

						WOMAN (cutting in)
			You don't seem quite sure, Jessica.
					(beat)
			Can you do it? Will you?

Slowly, Jessica nods.

						THIRD MAN
			Tonight?

						JESSICA (stalling)
			Y-yes...if I can find him.

						WOMAN
			I think you can. Don't you?

Jessica faces her squarely, nods. The woman looks deeply into her
eyes, relaxes.

						WOMAN  
			I'm sorry. We all are. But he has heard 
			about Sanctuary -- and that makes him 
			dangerous to all of us.

After murmurs of agreement:

						SECOND MAN 
					(staring at Jessica) 
			We're counting on you.

Jessica exits. They look at each other in dismay.. After a moment,
one of the men follows her. They don't trust her.

90-92	OUT

93-94 	OUT

94A1		READY ROOM - FRANCIS	

Obviously enjoying the work, watching--tracking a Runner's progress,
the assignment of a Sandman, the kill.
	
94X1		WITH JESSICA		

Making her way through the strolling crowd, her face thoughtful.

94X2		ANOTHER ANGLE

The man from the restaurant, following.

94X3		GALLERY, SANDMAN RESIDENCE -- JESSICA

Walking slowly up to a door, she hesitates, KNOCKS.

Logan opens the door, reacts.

						LOGAN
			Are you here to help me?
	
						JESSICA
			What do you need?

A moment, then Logan moves toward her hungrily, pulling her in to
him as the door closes.

94X4 	OUT

DISSOLVE TO:
		
94X5		WITH LOGAN AND JESSICA

Walking along a handsomely landscaped stream. Laughing together,
stopping to admire the beautiful fish (koi).

						JESSICA
			What're you going to do?

						LOGAN
			That's tomorrow.

						JESSICA 
					(turning away slightly)
			I wish I could help you.

						LOGAN 
					(turning her gently back)
			Maybe you'll chink of something...

						JESSICA 
					(hating herself)		
			I wish I knew what you think I know.		

Logan smiles at her, both knowing what's false, but drawn to each
other anyhow. They commence walking again.
		
94X6		ANOTHER ANGLE		

The followers, ahead now, watching, trying to make up their minds as
to whether Jessica is bringing Logan to the ambush. As they argue,
Logan and Jessica approach.

94X7		WITH LOGAN AND JESSICA	

						LOGAN
			If you did know, you'd tell me.
					
						JESSICA
			Of course--

						LOGAN (overriding)
			If you trusted me, you'd know.
				
						JESSICA (evading it)
			We're coming to Arcade.
					(beat)	-
			Shall we Relive together?
	
94X8		CLOSE ANGLE

As they pass, Jessica looks full in the face of one of the
followers, looks away. Logan does not notice. The followers are
partly reassured. One of the men is now holding a garrote made from
his necklace. The man who first followed gestures and the others go
off purposefully. He continues after Logan and Jessica as they exit
round a corner.

94X9 	OUT

94AX9	READY ROOM	

As 1st Sandman returns, still cheerfully chewing. Francis is
reluctant to give up his place and when he does, he remains standing
there, watching. He loves the work--they all do.

94X10	ARCADE - LOWER LEVEL	

Logan and Jessica entering. Logan is aware of Jessica's increasing
tension. He pretends unconcern, but he is wary.

94X11	ANOTHER ANGLE

Behind them, visible through the crowd--two of the men we saw
before. The Follower and the man with the garrote. They are moving
so as to intersect with Logan and Jessica where the crowd is
thickest, streams coming together to move to a higher level.

94X12	FEATURING JESSICA	

As they move, fearful--torn between her promise and her feeling for
Logan. Catching a glimpse of the followers, she makes a small sound,
hesitates, pretends to have stumbled.

94X13	THE AMBUSHERS	

Closer now, closing in -- the wire garrote gleaming between the
man's hands.
	
94X14	LOGAN AND JESSICA	

Suddenly she stops. He comes round facing as people eddy by them.
Logan looks at her searchingly.

						LOGAN 
			Tell me, Jessica.

Behind him the two men move in. The man with the garrote raises his
hands. One more step... Logan senses something, half-turns just as
we hear a familiar urgent SOUND--the sound of his transceiver.
Behind him the man hesitates, drops his hands. Logan takes the
transceiver from his belt and moves out of the crowd to the side,
Jessica with him. Now he bends to read the message and Jessica
cranes her head to see too.
	
94X15	READY ROOM - FRANCIS AND SANDMEN

As the Runner alarm pulses and the readout flashes its message: 

		RUNNER FEMALE: CATHEDRAL Q-2
		...LOGAN-5

The Sandman at the console turns and says:		

						1ST SANDMAN
			Hey, Logan's got a mean one tonight--
			why don't you--

But Francis is already at the door. A wave and he's gone. The others
ad lib interest-- "watch out in there--they can cut you before you
see them" etc.

95-105 	OUT

105X1	ARCADE STATION - THE AMBUSH	

The two watching, muscles taut -- wondering.

106-
106X1	OUT

106X2	ARCADE - TWO SHOT - LOGAN AND JESSICA	

As he speaks he leads her into the maze-car station and punches out
his destination on the car caller.

						LOGAN
			A Runner...Cathedral. A woman.

106X3	MAZE-CAR STATION ARCADE	

						JESSICA
			You're not going, are you?
		
						LOGAN (a beat)
			Why not? Maybe she'll help me.
			You won't. You'd better stay here.

The maze-car arrives and they move to it.
	
						JESSICA (touching his
					arm)
			I'd rather be with you.
	
						LOGAN (knowing she is
					lying through her teeth)
			That's nice.
		
They enter the car which instantly moves off. As it passes, the men
in ambush come forward and read the destination. They ring for
another car which pulls in immediately.

107-
109X1 	OUT
		
109X2	ANOTHER ANGLE	

As the two jam into the maze-car which rockets off in pursuit...

110-
120 		OUT

121		INT - MAZE-CAR - LOGAN AND JESSICA - MOVING SHOT

						LOGAN
			Have you ever been through Cathedral?

Jessica shakes her head.

						LOGAN
			They're like beasts. Wild.
	
						JESSICA		
			Maybe they're angry because they're
			grown in meccano-breeders.

						LOGAN (interrupting,
					grimacing) 
			Instead of what? Nine months inside a 
			woman:
					(ugh) 
			We're all raised the same but most of 
			us don't become cubs in Cathedral.

						JESSICA 
			Some people say children need human 
			mothering.

						LOGAN 
			Insane. Nurseries are better than any 
			mother could be.

						JESSICA 
			I'm only telling you what I've heard...
					(slightest beat) 
			Haven't you ever wondered what your 
			seed-mother was Like...?

						LOGAN 
			Uh-uh.

						JESSICA 
			I have.

						LOGAN 
					(after a beat) 
			When did you begin to question Lastday?

						JESSICA 
			I don't remember exactly...except I was 
			a Green.
					(another beat) 
			What would you like to relive, Logan?

						LOGAN (smiling)
			Let's see - how long has it been?

As Jessica turns her head...looking somewhat guilty, the maze-car
slides to a stop.

A warning light pulses on the car's console and a RECORDED VOICE
speaks before the hatch opens.

						VOICE			
			Attention passengers. Cathedral		
			Station is a personal risk area.	
			Persons with business are warned
			to be careful.

121X1	EXT. - MAZE-CAR - CATHEDRAL STATION	

Now the hatch opens. They step out, Logan first, Jessica timidly,
looking around. Behind them the hatch closes, the maze-car sighs
away into the distance.

						JESSICA
			I've never been in this quadrant.
					(looks off)
			Is that Arcade off there?
		
There are standing on the maze-car platform -- a high overlook like
an "elevated" station.
		
121X2	POV - THE CITY BEYOND THE WALLS OF CATHEDRAL

Arcade shining like distant fireworks.

122		EXT. - MAZE-CAR M PLATFORM - CATHEDRAL

Below them a narrow, sharply angled concrete canyon, buttressed
walls rising featureless. The look of an old fortress, blank, dim
and cool. Still visible over an opening the chiseled legend
"Cathedral Plaza--2025 A.D.--Skidmore, Rosenfelt, Hennesy
architects."

Jessica shivers, looking around her. Logan takes her arm and they
descend into the canyon, move toward the wall. Their footsteps the
only SOUND.

						LOGAN 
			Let me go first. Sometimes they're 
			waiting just inside there--to rush 
			you when it opens...

						LOGAN
			Quickly now--

He helps her through the narrow opening--the portal's walls are very
thick.. They turn abruptly and see:

123		INT. - WALL - DAZZLE CHAMBER

A room of angled, reflecting surfaces. At one end a jagged corridor,
also mirrored, leads away. The zigzag, angled effect creates an
absolute confusion of images. but Logan leads her unhesitatingly
across the chamber to the corridor. Jessica hangs back, momentarily
certain she's about to smash into something.

						LOGAN (guiding her) 
			Just follow--no matter how it seems...

						JESSICA (doing her
					best)
			But what is this--why?
	
						LOGAN (as they enter	
					the corridor)	
			The Cubs. When they're flying on muscle 
			there's  no way to catch up. Without the 
			dazzle, they'd just go past us--
					(gesture)
			too fast

						JESSICA
			Muscle? I don't know that one.
	
Logan is leading her down the zigzag corridor. It's stop and go--a
fun house in which you can get hurt.
	
						LOGAN
			It's unauthorized. No good for any-
			one over thirteen anyhow--shakes you
			to pieces--speeds everything up to a
			blur--
					(he is amused)
			you can see what happens when some
			flying Cub tries to go through this
			on muscle--splat!
	
Jessica reacts...to what Logan has said...then:  A moment later:
	
124		ANOTHER ANGLE	

As they approach the end of the corridor, a small FIGURE in a
tattered garment approaches them. She stops SINGING as she sees
Logan and Jessica.

						JESSICA (gently)
			Don't be afraid.

We see that it is a little GIRL of seven. Her face is grimy and hair
is tangled.

						JESSICA
			What's your name?

						MARY
			I'm Mary 2.

						JESSICA
			Where do you live, Mary?

						MARY
			Here.

						JESSICA			
			Why aren't you in Nursery?			

						MARY
			I'm very smart.

						JESSICA
			When do you go up?

						MARY
			I never go upstairs. You're a
			nice old lady.

As soon as she finishes her last sentence, Mary grabs at Jessica's
clothing...tearing a pin (piece of Jewelry) off...and running away
swiftly.

As Jessica instinctively starts after her...Logan... holds her back.

						LOGAN 
					(shaking his head)
			Not here. Might be a decoy.

Cautiously, Logan and Jessica exit from the wall, stepping out into-

125		EXT. - CATHEDRAL ITSELF

An area of rubble and dilapidated buildings.

Logan crouches, holding the transceiver and fanning the area,
listening...

SOUND: a soft beeping which abruptly grows louder and holds steady.

Logan gestures to Jessica to follow him, and moves carefully in the
direction of the BEEPING, quartering occasionally like a hunting
dog. Coming up to an angle of wall, he stops, flicks the sound off,
puts the machine back onto his belt. He gestures to Jessica to stand
still then he straightens, steps out, calls:

						LOGAN
			Runner!

Silence. Jessica involuntarily moves to him and as she does, the
Runner moves from behind an upright and stands.- The figure is
shadowed, the arms out, palms facing in a kind of gesture of
surrender. In the Runner's left hand, the tiny red crystal pulses on
and off. The Runner is a woman!

There is an instant of frozen confrontation and then suddenly
Jessica gasps, grasping at him.	
		
As Logan whirls:	
		
125X1		ANOTHER ANGLE	

Suddenly, from everywhere out of the shadows, a pack of snarling
Cubs materializes--moving with blinding speed. At their appearance
the Runner whirls and races off into the dark shadows. Logan makes a
futile gesture after her, then turns to face the Cubs.

A strutting, feral-faced fourteen or fifteen year old heads the
pack, dressed in fierce-looking tatters and hung with rip-off
trophies. He gestures to one of his followers to stand still.

						BILLY 
					(speaking of the Runner) 
			Don't worry about her. We'll have that 
			one later. Right now I think we've got 
			a Runner and his pairup. And what a Runner!

The CAMERA PANS the other Cubs...mean, filthy.

						A VOICE 
			We're going to have ourselves a time, 
			we are. Right, Billy?!

There is a chilling laughter of agreement from the rest.

						LOGAN		
			I'm a Sandman!		

						BILLY
			I cut up a Sandman yesterday.  They
			said I'd never get him...but I cut
			him up good, I did.

						LOGAN (firm tone)
			I feel sorry for you, boy!

Some murmuring as the pack watches their leader.

						BILLY
			For me? Better feel sorry for your-
			self, Sandman!

						LOGAN
			No, for you! How old are you, Billy?

Billy is silent.

						LOGAN 
			Fourteen? Fifteen? Your days are running 
			out. How long can you last? A year. Six 
			months?
					(he points to the yellow
					flower in Billy's palm)
			What happens when you're sixteen and
			you go green?

						BILLY (lashing out) 
			Nothing will happen! I make the
			rules as I go!! Cubs do what I say!
			Always have! Always will! I got
			Cathedral and I'll never let go!

						LOGAN 
			No cubs over fifteen, Billy! Ever 
			heard of a cub with a green flower? 
			You'll leave Cathedral then, Billy, 
			when you're on green, because they 
			won't let a green stay here.
					(slightest beat) 
			If you try to stay the young ones will 
			gut-rip you apart!

						BILLY
			Shut up! Shut up your damn mouth!

Logan falls back into a fighting crouch...but before he can strike a
blow..he is grabbed and slammed against the wall of an abandoned
building.

						ANOTHER VOICE	
			Let him suck Muscle! That'll shut	
			his mouth! Let's watch him shake		
			himself to death!!
		
We see the Cubs take out drugpads. They squeeze the pads and inhale
the "Muscle." At once their movements become blurringly rapid. They
take menacing positions - some leaping overhead.
			
						A VOICE
			Give him some Muscle!!
		
Like lightning they change positions and flash around Logan and
Jessica
			
126		CLOSE ON - JESSICA	

Watching..terrified.

127		CLOSE ON - LOGAN
	
Being held against the wall by Cubs as:
				
						ANOTHER VOICE
			Shake him to death!!

						A VOICE 
			Kill him!

128		ANOTHER ANGLE - INCLUDING BILLY
	
moving a drugpad against Logan's face.

Logan is holding his breath...desperately trying not to breathe the
"Muscle" directly from the pad into his system.

						BILLY (chilling laugh) 
			He's trying to hold his breath...

As Billy presses the pad tighter against Logan's face:

With all his might, Logan wrenches his arms loose... drops to the
ground and pulls out his gun.

He fires and fire girdles a pillar...and they start to back away.

						BILLY		
			We can rush him...we can take 	
			can take him	again, we can!!	

The pack hesitates...stops backing away.

						LOGAN 
					(moving the gun slowly 
					back and forth)
			All right! How many of you want this to 
			be Lastday?!

The pack moves back again...and  disperses, leaving Billy facing
Logan alone.

						LOGAN
			Come on, Billy...come on...you cut
			a Sandman, didn't you?!

Logan tucks the gun back into his waist.

						LOGAN
			Come on, Billy...cut me...Come on

After a beat, Billy turns and runs away.

Logan comforts the shivering Jessica for a moment then takes out the
small box from his pocket and turns it...until it starts BEEPING.

The CAMERA PANS Logan and Jessica...following the SOUND.

They move over the rubble...and cautiously around abandoned
buildings.

We HEAR A SCREAM...and HEAR the Cubs who've only obviously found and
attacked someone. The SOUND is coming from a different direction
than where the beeping is coming from.

						LOGAN 
					(shaking his head) 
			They've got someone else! Why would 
			anybody come here?

Jessica shudders as the scream dies abruptly.

The BEEPING is now very loud.

Logan homes in on an abandoned building, enters, crosses swiftly to
a door inside and kicks it down.

We SEE the Runner. The WOMAN cringing, expecting death.

129		FULL SHOT - LOGAN AND THE WOMAN	

frozen for a moment. In f.g. a figure stirs, moves and we see it is
Francis. His weapon is drawn and aimed, but as he watches, he lowers
the barrel and smiles. The is Logan's job.

130		CLOSE ON - JESSICA	

watching

131		LOGAN AND THE WOMAN

						WOMAN (nearing
					hysteria)
			There's been a terrible error! My
			Lifeclock must have broken in some way!
					(rising tone)
			I'm nowhere near thirty...look at
			me...I'm twenty-two. I should be
			green! Did you hear me?
					(shouting)
			Green!

						LOGAN (quietly)
			Don't be afraid--	

Before Logan can continue...the Woman...who is now wild-eyed and
hysterical lunges at Logan...and starts grappling with him.
	
						WOMAN
			I'll kill you!! I'll kill you!!

After Logan pushes her away...and she falls down:

						LOGAN (breathing hard) 
			I'm not going to hurt you.

Slowly, she rises.

Logan takes out the ankh.

						LOGAN 
			Sanctuary? Anything?

Logan reaches into his pocket and takes out a small round
object...the size of a large marble.

						LOGAN	
			If they find you throw this hard	
			enough to break it. Then hold your	
			breath till you get away...It's
			blind gas.

Her reaction is blank, then, with desperate ferocity she attacks
Logan again.

During the course of the struggle, Logan subdues her again.

Jessica enters, bends over the near-crazed Runner as Logan holds
her. Eyeing him, the woman stands and takes the small round
object...she appears somewhat bewildered as Logan and Jessica move
off.
		
132		EXT. - THE OTHER SIDE OF THE ABANDONED BUILDING - 
		MED. ANGLE - FRANCIS WATCHING

He is shocked, unbelieving.
	
133		CLOSE ON FRANCIS

Stunned and uncertain, Francis aims his gun toward Logan and
Jessica...but he wavers...watching them disappear into the rubble... 

134		ANOTHER ANGLE - FRANCIS

shivering like a wet dog. He turns toward open window.
		
						FRANCIS (in a firm, cold
					tone)
			Runner!
		
The woman turns, staring insanely. Her mouth opens like a fish as:
Francis FIRES his gun. A moment later, as the burning body topples
to the floor;

134X1		MAZE-CAR PLATFORM - THE MEN	

hearing the unmistakable SCREAMING sound of the kill, they exchange
a look.

135		LOGAN AND JESSICA 	

At the flash of FIRE from Francis' gun, they turn.
Logan and Francis' eyes meet. A beat, then Logan grabs Jessica and
pulls her away.

136		FRANCIS 

After a long, long hesitation, takes out his small plastic box and
starts to speak into it:

						FRANCIS (quietly)
			Runner terminated at G.16
			Ready for cleanup at Cathedral
			Quadrant 39.
			
137		ANOTHER ANGLE - OVERLOOKING CATHEDRAL ENTRANCE 

The Second and Third Men...very close to the maze-car platform...
peering into the darkness and seeing Logan and Jessica emerge onto
the maze-car platform. We can tell from the way the two men look at
one another that they believe Logan has fired the shot they have
heard.

They hide from the approaching Logan and Jessica.

						SECOND MAN
			I almost believed her.

They move off soundlessly. Behind them, a maze-car has arrived.

138		MED. - ANGLE - FRANCIS 

Gun in hand...running through Cathedral toward the maze-car
platform.

139		INT. - MAZE-CAR - LOGAN AND JESSICA - MOVING SHOT 	

				 		JESSICA
			I'm ashamed. I was bringing you
			to be killed.

						LOGAN
			Where? Sanctuary? Can you take
			me there?	

						JESSICA 
			Logan, I don't know where Sanctuary is. 
			But if I take you to them, they'll kill you.

						LOGAN (a beat) 
			All right. But why? I didn't kill the 
			Runner.

						JESSICA (interrupting) 
			Yes, but they won't know that...or care. 
			They're hunting you, Logan. Maybe me too, 
			now...

						LOGAN (wry laugh) 
			That's nothing...there's a Sandman
			behind us, too and there'll be
			more soon. Take me to them.

						JESSICA (torn) 
			I - I can't.

						LOGAN
			Then - why don't you leave me - go
			to them - explain

						JESSICA 
			No. Not that either.

Logan considers her. A long BEAT. Thinking, then:

						LOGAN
			All right. New You 483. I'll find
			out myself.

139X1		INT. - SANDMAN READY ROOM - FRANCIS

Distracted...ignoring the greetings of Sandmen who are monitoring
the city.

139X2		ANOTHER ANGLE - FRANCIS

Walking past the GIANT LIFECLOCKS into the debriefing area.

The scanners begin moving.

Moments later the scanner stops...the word:

		IDENTIFY	

appears on a SCREEN Francis pauses a moment and places his palm into
the groove.

Now he takes out the items of the dead woman Runner and places them
on the scanning table.

An ALARM SOUNDS and the word:

		REJECT

flashes on and off on the SCREEN.

Sandmen come running into the Area.

						SANDMAN
			What happened?!

Francis hesitates....then....quickly, as if changing his mind,
taking the items off the table:	
		
						FRANCIS
			Can you beat it....I've got the damn
			wrong bag.

						SANDMAN 
			You ought to put yourself on reliefcall, 
			Francis.

						FRANCIS (starting out) 
			Yeah....

140		EXT. - NEW YOU #483 - TWO SHOT - LOGAN AND JESSICA	

as they enter NEW YOU #483 they are being watched by:

141		MED. ANGLE - THE SECOND AND THIRD MEN

A safe distance behind.

142		INT. - NEW YOU #483

The waiting room has many mirrors...where customers ...male and
female...are checking their faces (and bodies).

There are also various photographs on the walls... suggestions for
changes to foreheads, eyes, cheeks, lips, etcetera. The chatty
informality is very much like people in a beauty parlor or barber
shop.

There is a RECEPTIONIST seated behind a desk in a corner.

Logan and Jessica walk up to the desk.

The receptionist looks at Logan...ignoring Jessica.

						RECEPTIONIST 
			Hello, Sandman.

						LOGAN 
			Hello.

						RECEPTIONIST 
			Do you want to see Doc?

Logan nods, impatient - he knows someone's watching.

						RECEPTIONIST	
			We don't get many Sandmen. I think
			we've only had one other since I've
			been here.

						LOGAN (brusquely) 
			A Sandman can get as sick of his face 
			as anyone else. Where's the doctor?

						RECEPTIONIST (smiling) 
			I like your face. Would you mind if Doc 
			took a picture? I'd Like him to give 
			your face to somebody else.

						LOGAN
			It's all right with me. Is he here?

						RECEPTIONIST
			My name's Holly...Holly 13. In
			ancient times they said my number
			was unlucky. Do you believe in luck?

						LOGAN
			No - Look, I'm in a hurry.

						HOLLY
			Doc'll be with you soon, Sandman.

Logan and Jessica walk to one of the chairs in the waiting area and
sit down next to an attractive WOMAN.

						WOMAN CUSTOMER 
			Is this your first time?

Logan and Jessica nod.

						WOMAN CUSTOMER (smiling) 
			This is my third...
					(a beat) 
			... I did it when I turned yellow ...
			and green.
					(showing her palm) 
			I turned red yesterday.

						LOGAN (looking) 
			Beautiful work. This man do them all?

						WOMAN CUSTOMER 
			No. But I hear he's terrific. Have you 
			seen any of his work?

						LOGAN	
			Just one. 
		
						HOLLY
			Doc's ready, Sandman.
	
Logan and Jessica stand. They follow Holly into a large, shining,
stainless steel room where we see:
	
143		MED. ANGLE - DOC

who looks about twenty-one years old, exchanges a pointed look with
Jessica. 
	
						DOC
			It's a real privilege, Sandman.

						LOGAN
			Thanks.
					(slightest beat)
			I thought you'd be older. I ex-
			pected a Red.

						DOC (showing his palm;
					the flower crystal is Red)
			I am.

						LOGAN
			Your own work?

						DOC (with pride)
			And I did it myself right on there.

144		FULL - ANGLE - THE SURGICAL APPARATUS

Aesculaptor Mark III -- the latest in servo-surgical designs.
Completely self-contained -- tilt-bed, cryojector services embedded
in the platform. The Mark III's laser heads are integrated into the
whole cocoon, swiveled and gimbaled so as to be able to focus any of
the surgical beams in microscopic delicacy or wide-bladed scraping.

The machine vaguely resembles an enormously complicated x-ray table
on an angle -- the great slotted laser heads overhanging it and
Integral with it. From the cryonic receptor base there is a steady
exhalation of cold -- the vapor seeping steadily downwards, blurring
the endlessly looped and tangled tubes and wires and containers
Which join in solid state circuitry so that any random or
involuntary twitch of a patient will be instantly compensated by an
equivalent move of the laser head -- keeping the focus precise.

At one end -- where the halves of the Mark III join, is n console of
switches and dials -- lights nod servo-recorders which control the	
operation from the first injection of cold to the final healing
vacuum drafts and scar burnishing. With the air of a magician
demonstrating, Doc goes to the console and flips switches. Instantly
the table responds -- the platform tilting, the crab-like laser arms
descending flexing -- small vapor jets oozing as the beams slash
harmlessly across the table. Beaming, Doc turns it off and the whole
apparatus subsides.
	
						DOC
			I designed it myself.
					(slightest beat)
			What'll it be ...a face job or
			a full-body job?

						LOGAN 
			Just the face.

						DOC 
			Fine....Holly will get you ready. 
			You're in good hands, believe me.

Holly comes forward and unbuttons the collar on Logan's tunic.

As Holly brushes her fingertips lightly down Logan's arms:

						DOC 
			Holly works here because she gets a 
			lift out of watching the Table...
					(smiles)
			and other things. I'll be back in a 
			minute.

						HOLLY
			He's going to sterilize himself.

						LOGAN  
			Do I have to undress?

						HOLLY 
			Not for your face.

Logan follows Holly to the Table. (Jessica remains behind with Doc
who speaks to her with soft urgency).

						DOC	
			You shouldn't have brought him here.	

						JESSICA;
			I didn't bring him -- what's
			the difference. He's blinking.
			He wants to run.
		
						DOC
			Run!? He's a Sandman.

						JESSICA
			I tell you he's running. I know.
		
						DOC
			Maybe...Maybe. But I wish he'd
			gone somewhere else.
					(a beat, a shrug)
			All right. He gets a face.
		
144X1		THE SURGICAL TABLE - LOGAN AND HOLLY

Logan lies down.

The Table ripples...accepting his weight prisoning and positioning
him.

						HOLLY
					(leaning - close to 
					Logan) 
			I like dark hair. Have him give you 
			dark hair.

						DOC'S VOICE		
			All set?			
			
						HOLLY
			Um huh. Would you take a picture
			of him, Doc? I'd like you to give
			his face to somebody else.

						DOC 
			Why not?

Doc pushes a button...there is a tiny FLASH.

						DOC
			Do you have anything special in mind?

						LOGAN
			I don't care...Just get it over
			with.

						DOC (smiling) 
			Hurry...hurry...hurry.

						HOLLY (whispering) 
			Dark hair.

						LOGAN
			Holly'd like dark hair.
			
						DOC
			Holly'd like a lot of things.
					(studying Logan's face)
			We can start by narrowing the
			cheekbones.
			
Doc presses buttons on the control board. Jessica, who is standing
next to Doc, is slightly startled as the Table begins to HUM...as a
pair of laser beams separate themselves from the overhead cluster
and extend toward Logan, forming inner cones as they approach.

CryoJector needles start to close in on them, nearing their faces
and shoulders slowly...the visible cold streaming off the points.

A vibrobeam begins to KEEN.

SOUND: An insistent chiming.

Doc hears the sound and turns with the martyred air of a man who's
been called to the phone too many times. He turns to a phone-like
apparatus nearby, shifting the table into neutral as he turns. The
table and the laser heads stop moving.		
					
						DOC 
					(as if speaking on a phone)
			Hello
					(listening)
			Yes
					(listening)
			Yes, they are.
					(listening; his expression
					changing)
			Done.

Doc turns back to the console, pausing to stare intently at Logan,
then up at the brightly smiling Holly. Something in his look
registers, and Holly's smile fades. Now Doc engages the machine
again...

						DOC
			Pay attention, Sandman. I'm
			proud of this machine.

As he speaks he presses and an arm sweeps downward and into position
near Logan's face. It pauses as

						DOC
			With this one there's no waiting
			for scar burnishing. It's all in
			one...watch now...

The laser arm sweeps across Logan's forehead and cheeks, leaving a
bright trail of blood as

						DOC 
			But here's the improvement. Instant 
			healing---before you feel a thing. 
			Watch now...

Doc pushes a special button and the arm sweeps back along the track,
spraying healing fluid. Magically the blood vanishes and the skin is
moist and whole.

144X2		THE SURGICAL TABLE - LOGAN 	

His face tense--he knows something's wrong. Over him Holly's bright
face with its rapt look. She's not sure, but she enjoys whatever's
happening.

144X3		BACK TO DOC 

who is playing the console as he speaks.

						DOC			
			Perfect depth adjustment on this			
			one, Sandman. The beam will cut	
			through that uniform and just
			exactly through the skin beneath--
			absolute precision. Watch now
	
And the machine does its stuff, slashing through Logan's tunic--a
seam of blood following the rip.

						DOC
			Of course, it doesn't mend uniforms,
			Sandman, but otherwise it does
			everything, doesn't it? Just
			imagine what would happen to you
			if the healing stopped functioning.
		
And the arm moves back again, spraying the healing fluid into
Logan's new wound. Again the blood disappears.
		
Suddenly Doc's look is ferocious. He turns off the healing switch
and punches buttons fiercely. The laser arms begin to move wildly
and the SOUNDS become shrill. Holly looks alarmed.

						HOLLY
			No! You're scrambling the table.
			He'll be cut to pieces, Doc.
	
						DOC
			Damn right! It was a trap. They
			know!
	
						LOGAN
			No - I'm Running!

Machine begins to WHINE LOUDLY.

Jessica tries to turn the machine off...Doc starts to wrestle with
her as:

145-145X4		INTERCUT: CLOSE ANGLES - THE CLUSTER ABOVE LOGAN 

Moving.

HOLLY

Watching two stun beams lower.

Doc knocks Jessica down. She is groggy on the floor as

The stun beams lance into Logan's cheeks.

The Table holds him, biting into his right leg below the knee.

146-148		QUICK CUTS OF DOC AND HOLLY	

Watching intently as:
	
149-150		CLOSE ANGLES - LOGAN AND THE CLUSTER ABOVE HIM

As surgical beams slit his shirt from the shoulder to the waist
leaving two threads of blood.  A vacu-head dips to suck the blood
away neatly.

151		ANOTHER ANGLE - LOGAN

As Logan desperately sucks in his belly....trying to flatten himself
into the Table.

152-153	CLOSE ANGLES - LOGAN AND THE CLUSTER ABOVE HIM

As laser blades cut into his face....followed by a spray of healing
liquid on the cuts.
	
154		CLOSE - ON HOLLY

Excited....flushed....as:

155		CLOSE - ON LOGAN AND THE CLUSTER ABOVE HIM

As two wide blades of light sweep downward....and hover three inches
above his neck....and keep lowering ....HUMMING loudly....and one
inadvertently frees Logan's right arm.

156		CLOSE ON - DOC

Shocked as Logan reaches for his gun.

157		CLOSE - ON LOGAN AND THE CLUSTER ABOVE HIM.

As dozens of laser beams slash toward Logan....he twists away....and
breaks off....jumping off the Table.

Doc rushes Logan holding what appears to he a frozen police billy.	

In an instant he has knocked Logan's gun away....and as Logan looks
down at it....we see it lying on the floor completely frozen.

Slowly, Doc moves toward Logan the short smoke-colored stick
menacing in his hand.

						LOGAN (out-of-breath)
			What I told you is the....

Abruptly, Doc lunges toward Logan...missing him as Logan ducks away.

As Doc turns to attack....Logan smashes his elbows into Doc's chest
and Doc falls back onto the Table.

157X1	CLOSE ON - HOLLY

SCREAMING, as Doc is slashed by the machine amid showers of sparks
and gouts of steam as the metal twists and wires short out and
various fluids boil and spill onto hot surfaces. Holly tries to
fight her way into the mess to help Doc, but Jessica, recovering,
pulls her down and the two struggle.

157X2	CLOSE ON - DOC

In terror as the laser beams begin to slash him to ribbons.

157X3	LOGAN

Making an effort to stop the machine, pulling levers and pushing
buttons in vain. He sees what's happening, pulls Jessica away from
Holly and, grabbing up his gun and tunic, heads for the entrance.
Crossing the waiting room they are stopped by the sight of:

158-
162XI 	OUT

163		FRANCIS

Entering...gun in hand.

164		REVERSE ANGLE - LOGAN AND JESSICA

As they face Francis.

165		FULL ANGLE - FRANCIS LOGAN AND JESSICA

						FRANCIS (frowning)
			What's going on, Logan?!

						LOGAN
			It has nothing to do with you.

						FRANCIS 
					(choking but still loyal)
			What are you talking about?! I saw you 
			let a Runner go? 
					(up a notch)
			I saw you, Logan?? Tell me!!

Suddenly the machine behind them erupts into a great burst of smoke
and noise, momentarily drawing Francis' attention. Instantly Logan
jumps him, grabs and throws him sprawling. Without a look back, he
and Jessica run out.

166 		OUT

166X1		FRANCIS

Enraged, finds his gun on the floor and, before rising, gets off a
shot at them as they disappear. Then leaping to his feet, dashing
off in pursuit.

167		ARCADE TRACKING	

Logan and Jessica running through Arcade.
	
167X1	LOGAN AND JESSICA	

Suddenly she pulls him in another direction.

						JESSICA
			Follow me, Logan. Stay close.

As they run into Hallucimill...Francis...never too far behind...
spots them and follows.

168-
173 		OUT

174		EXT. - HALLUCIMILL - TWO SHOT - LOGAN AND JESSICA

Exiting from the other side...and running through the crowd toward
and into a Love Shop...followed by Francis coming out of the
Hallucimill, too... and running toward the Love Shop.

175		INT. - LOVE SHOP - LOGAN AND JESSICA
	
As they enter the hot darkness. The Love Shop is throbbing with
sexuality. In it, the darkness breaks at Irregular intervals -- when
booths and cubicles flare into brilliance, each time revealing an
orgiastic tableau. The Love Shop is multi-leveled and the random
flashes may appear from any direction at any time, blinding and
stunning the viewer. Logan and Jessica pause to get their bearings
and as they do, a beautiful WANTON grabs Logan, pulling and
laughing:

						WANTON
			I have an empty one, Sandman

Logan tries to pull away, looks around for Jessica just in time to
see a man almost carrying her off.  Then the light is gone again and
Jessica with it.

176		LOGAN AND THE WANTON	

As she tears at his clothing, wrapping herself around him, trying to
pull him down. Then, as the light flares again she suddenly lets go
and grabs another man...Logan is, freed, starts looking for Jessica.

177-
179		SERIES OF SHOTS

Logan hunting through the Love Shop, fighting them off.

INTERCUT SHOTS of the suddenly-illuminated tableaus. Sex, manifold
and multiform -- everybody doing it.

180		ANOTHER ANGLE - FRANCIS

Entering, starting to look around -- grabbed by one of the laughing
Wantons.

181-182	LOGAN, JESSICA

Brief glimpses of them looking for each other.

183		FRANCIS

Hunting both.

184		WITH LOGAN

As he suddenly collides with a woman -- shoves her away and sees
it's Jessica. Now together they make for an archway where multiple
mirrors enclose them.

Suddenly they are in darkness. Then a heavy door slides open and
Jessica leads Logan through the opening. Behind them the door slides
shut again.
			
185		FRANCIS

Desperately trying to get rid of a woman, sees a flash of Logan and
Jessica far across the room -sees them leave. Then he's pulled down
again as the orgy continues.

186-
186X1 	OUT

186X2	INT. - AN IMMENSE METAL STAIRWAY	

After a moment, Jessica takes Logan's hand and they start down in
the darkness. The SOUNDS of Love Shop still heard from behind the
wall.

						LOGAN
			Are you taking me to them?

						JESSICA 
			Yes.
					(beat)
			I don't know what else to do -- with
			him following us.
					(she hesitates) 
			Why do you keep running from your--

						LOGAN
			Because he's my friend -
					(a beat) 
			and I don't want to be killed by him - 
			or anyone.

						JESSICA 
			He's good, isn't he?

						LOGAN
			Will he find us and kill us?
			Yes...or one of the others.
					(a beat) 
			You know there's only one place 
			to go now...

						 JESSICA (hopelessly) 
			They won't believe us.

						LOGAN	
					(beat)		
			I'd rather take my chances with
			them...than with Francis.

						JESSICA
			They won¹t listen.
			
						LOGAN (interrupting)
			You think Sandmen will?
					(before she can answer)
			There's no other way for me,

						JESSICA 
			We'll convince them.

They pause. He puts his hand over hers. Jessica is silent. Then she
turns his hand over. The crystal blinks red -- on, off.

						JESSICA 
			Yes, Logan.
					(turning to him blindly)
			I'm glad they didn't change your
			face.
	
Logan embraces her, but his look is strange and remote. They
continue down into the darkness.
	
Behind them the SOUNDS of Love Shop die away and only their
footsteps are heard.

187 		OUT
		
187X1	FRANCIS
	
At the mirrored archway, looking around carefully, testing. He knows
they went through somehow. Hands claw at him - he brushes them away
as he searches.

188-200 	OUT

200X1	WITH LOGAN AND JESSICA	

They have come to the foot of the stair. Here the flooring shines
wetly in the darkness.

						JESSICA (softly) 
			Exactly four steps now. Let me lead you.
					(they walk) 
			Now to the right. It's narrow here, 
			you'll have to get behind me.

						LOGAN (whispering) 
			How will they know we're coming?

						JESSICA (whispering)	
			They're watching us now. They'll	
			let us in when they're sure.	

200X2	CLOSE-UP - LOGAN'S HAND (INSERT)
			
As he fumbles the transceiver switches at his belt, punching out a
signal.

200X3	INT. - SANDMAN H.Q. READY ROOM

As the Sandmen monitoring SEE THE SIGNAL FLASH and move smoothly
into action.

200X4	LOGAN AND JESSICA	

Close together, he behind, waiting--alert as a VOICE is suddenly
heard:

						VOICE (scratchy, 
					filtered) 
			Sandman, put your hands on your head. 
					(he does)
			Clasp your fingers together. Now turn 
			your hands over. Palms up. 
					(beat) 
			In a moment a light will shine in your 
			eyes. Walk into it--Jessica first, 
			then you, Sandman. You will have to 
			stoop--but don't unclasp your hands. 
			Do you agree?

Logan nods.

Jessica glances back at him but their faces are unreadable in the
dark. Then suddenly--in front of her--a blindingly bright, narrow
rectangle of light illuminating them fiercely. Jessica moves
forward. Even she has to stoop. Logan is close behind. As he bends
awkwardly into the opening, the light goes out.

201		LOGAN, JESSICA -- SANCTUARY HQ

As he pushes her through the opening then moves instantly to the
side, pulling her with him.. The move fails. Both are pinned
helplessly in the blinding glare of the spotlight and the sudden
appearance of glass-silver spear points pressed against them. Logan
is unable to draw his gun.

						VOICE
			Hold still, Sandman, or die where
			you are.

						2ND VOICE
			Is she the one?
	
						OTHER VOICES (like angry
					stage whispers)
			She betrayed us. Kill him. Kill them both.
			Jessica you sold us. Sandman butcher.
			Sandman murderer.

Logan and Jessica stand rigid against the spear points, only their
heads turning to the echoing sibilants.. The spotlight goes off.

202-204 	OUT

205		INT. - SANCTUARY HQ. - LOGAN, JESSICA - CLOSE	

In the darkness we see the glass-silver spear points are glowing all
around them, the long shafts falling away into darkness, the points,
steaming gently when they touch--making an instant, wincing burn.
Logan moves--a spear point presses--he flinches.

						LOGAN 
			I'm a runner. She brought me here because 
			I begged her to help me.

He turns his palm. The red crystal blinks impressively in the
darkness.

At the sight, a BABBLE of SOUNDS. Argument.

						VOICE
			He's lying. No Sandman ever ran.

						2ND VOICE
			You don't run. You kill runners.
			You have killed runners all your life.	-

						LOGAN	
			Yes I have.		
					(beat)	
			Now it's my turn. And I want to
			live.

Another angry murmur of VOICES. Over it Jessica suddenly:

						JESSICA (shouting) 
			What's the matter with you. He's a runner--
			he's blinking. We must help anyone who 
			asks...we must-or we're the same as they 
			are--deciding who lives and dies.

One of the points lifts and touches Jessica's cheek. A quick, fierce
burn. She shrieks--a tiny sound--and is silent.

206		LOGAN	

Reacts fiercely, spinning against the spear points, he is Jabbed and
pierced in a dozen places as he manages to get Jessica closer,
shielding her with his body. But the spear points are too much. He
subsides, as VOICES rise angrily "Kill him now".

Suddenly a RINGING ALARM. All sound stops at once and we hear a
CLATTER of FOOTSTEPS down the iron stair and across the outer floor.
The spotlight bursts on again and a figure staggers into the
chamber, straightening into the light, hair dishevelled, hands in
front against the glare. It's Holly.

						HOLLY 
			Holly. Holly, New You 483... He's dead. 
			Doc's dead and the Sandmen came...

						VOICE (gentle)
			Holly--Holly. Remember the code.
			The code, please Holly...

						HOLLY (hysteria)	
			They smashed everything and I barely
			got away.
					(beat)
			Holly. Station 12, Sanctuary 7.
			Holly. Holly...

She lowers her hands and we see her, tattered, frightened--the
bright smile strange. She comes to herself a bit, looks to the side
and sees Logan and Jessica, pinned against the wall.

She reacts with fear at the sight.	
			
						HOLLY	
			It's him! The first Sandman. He
			killed...Doc.

						JESSICA
			No, Holly--wait! He's running.
			Tell them the rest!
	
						HOLLY (suddenly
					exhausted)
			He's the one. You too. I remember.
			He was in a hurry. Just a face job.
			Dark hair, I said. Then he killed
			Doc and you grabbed me--and the
			machine blew up and I ran...I ran
	
	 					JESSICA
			Holly. Holly! Please...The other
			Sandman. Remember the one who came
			after--

Holly suddenly remembers and the shock makes her lucid.

						HOLLY (pouring 
					it out) 
			That's right. The other one came after. 
			The older one. Smashing, killing, burning!

						JESSICA (coaching
					desperately) 
			...and he was hunting the first one, 
			this one. Wasn't he? Wasn't he? This 
			one was running, the other one was 
			hunting him...

						HOLLY (remembers)
			Yes. Oh yes.
					(to Logan) 
			He was after you. I remember. You're 
			running!

207-208 	OUT

208X1	ANOTHER ANGLE 1

The spear points are withdrawn. Logan and Jessica relieved but
shaken, wary.

						LOGAN 
			May we move?

A long beat. Then--

						VOICE
			I saw we pass them through.			
			Somebody help Holly.	

Other VOICES mumble agreement. Holly moves off into the dark room,
hands reaching out to help her.

						VOICE 
			You two. Just go straight ahead. 
			Follow the corridors with the pipes 
			overhead to the end. Then use the key.

As the voice speaks the spotlight finally goes off and by a dim glow
around the perimeter, we see we're in some kind of large underground
chamber--some part of the vast undercellars of the city. The light
is enough to reveal that there are perhaps twenty people in the
room, reds and greens both--but all are silhouetted, no face seen.
There's a kind of aisle open down the room's center and it's
obviously the way they are to go. Logan and Jessica move off. Logan
pauses.

						LOGAN
			I don't know who you are. I'd
			like to thank someone.

						VOICE 
			It doesn't matter who we are. Follow 
			the tunnel to the end.

						LOGAN
			I Will there be someone to tell us
			where to go from there...?

A murmur of discussion then:

						VOICE 
			Someone will follow. When you come to 
			the lock, he will tell you how Co go 
			on the other side. Jessica may go with 
			you as far as the lock.

						LOGAN 
					(a deep breath) 
			No. Jessica goes back now. Take her back. 
					(suddenly his tone is 
					urgent as he speaks to her) 
			Now! Go on back. Back outside, Jessica.

She is bewildered by the change.

						JESSICA
			Why?- No...no...I'm going with you.

						VOICE1
			Only to the lock. After that 
			there's no way back. 

						JESSICA (small voice) 
			I don't care. I'm going to Sanctuary. 
			With you.

A BABBLE of VOICES. "Impossible"...She ignores, watches Logan.
			
						JESSICA (cont'd)
			Will you take me with you?

						LOGAN
			Why, Jessica? You're still a green.
			
JESSICA shakes her head. She doesn't know why.

Logan puts his arm around her, marveling, trying to understand,
moved. But suddenly he remembers the urgency of the moment. He
wheels, pulling her with him.
			
						LOGAN
			Come on then--they'll be here any
			minute!

Uncomprehending, she starts to run with him. Too late. An EXPLOSION
shakes the chamber--the wall bellies inward and a group of Sandmen,
led by Francis, burst into the room, firing as they come.
			
Panic. Turmoil. PEOPLE running, SCREAMING--the ALARM BELL RINGING,
RINGING as Sandmen methodically slaughter the people in the wreckage
of the room.

209 		OUT

209X1	LOGAN AND JESSICA 	

As the brief, one-sided battle rages, echoing SHOTS and SCREAMS in
the dust filled room, Logan pulls her down out of the way. They
watch, helplessly. Suddenly the figure of a Sandman looms before
them. He stares at Logan, unsure. Logan reacts, draws, fires. The
Sandman is smashed away, burning.

209X2	LOGAN 

Suddenly aware that he has killed a Sandman. Jessica pulls him down
again into the shadow. Neither realizes chat the soft pulsing of his
crystal can be seen from the room.

210		ANOTHER ANGLE

Francis, quartering the room like a hound, searching, searching,
stopping as he sees

211		FRANCIS P.O.V.
	
The crystal blinking red, eerie in the darkness.

						FRANCIS 
					(believing the	
					blinking crystal is Jessica's)	
			Logan. I know you're in here. 
 			What've you done...gone crazy over a 
			Runner?
					(whispering) 
			Nobody knows except me. You know I 
			won't say anything. I should have 
			turned you in but I couldn't. Leave 
			her. Come on out with me. It'll look 
			like you're part of the group that 
			hit this nest.
					(pleading) 
			Logan...you're a Sandman!
					(slightest beat)
			Logan...now...now...Logan...

After the slightest beat, Logan FIRES and Francis falls, a great
chunk of the cave roof falling between him and Logan -- all vision
obscured while EXPLOSIONS and SCREAMS continue.

212		LOGAN AND JESSICA

As he pulls her shakily to her feet. She nods, she's okay. He leads
her off down the tunnel.

213		WITH LOGAN AND JESSICA - TUNNEL

following the tracks. The way leads down, curves, recurves, but
always down.

214		ANOTHER ANGLE - INCLUDING LOCK
	
As Logan and Jessica rush toward it. The corridor has widened into a
kind of chamber which ends in a great metal door like an immense
submarine hatch.

The tracks run straight to it and beneath it. The base of the door 
tands in a couple of inches of water.
	
With great urgency, Logan and Jessica examine the huge door. Logan
gives the wheel a tug...nothing.

SOUND: A WHIRRING like clockwork...A METALLIC BELL SOUND and then a
RECORDED VOICE.

						VOICE	
			Runner, this is the last gate. Use			
			your key now. When the Bell sounds			
			again...use your key. Good luck,
			Runner. May you find Sanctuary.

SILENCE. Then the BELL CHIME SOUND and a light illumines the center
of the wheel where there's a kind of keyhole. The WHIRRING continues
for about ten seconds. Then it stops	and the light goes out.

214X1	LOGAN AND JESSICA	

Hearing a SOUND they turn and see:
	
214X2	ANOTHER ANGLE - P.O.V.

Far behind them, in the wet glisten of the tunnel, a bobbing light
and shadow -- the SOUND of RUNNING

215-216	CLOSE ON - LOGAN AND JESSICA

As Jessica takes the ankh from her neck - fumbling with the chain.

						JESSICA (breathlessly) 
			Every key only works once...and only 
			a Lastday key must open this door.... 
			They said it would fit - but....

She tries to fit the ankh into the glowing one, but her hand shakes.
Logan tries to steady her - and in helping, she drops it into the
dark pool of water. They fall to their knees, searching desperately.
Then Logan remembers.

						LOGAN 
			Wait - I have the one I took from 
			the Runner.

SOUND: The same as before as Logan searches his pockets for the
Runner's ankh.

Logan finds it just as the WHIRRING SOUND has STOPPED again...and
the light has gone out again in the center of the wheel.

As Logan and Jessica wait for the sound, etcetera to repeat again
another TREMENDOUS EXPLOSION is heard rocking everything.  In the
distance, Jessica can see the shadow of a FIGURE approaching.

As the SOUND, etcetera, repeat-s once more...Logan pushes the ankh
into the lighted center of the wheel. The ankh fuses and the lighted
center becomes brighter as the door opens.

There is a hesitation...in which Logan turning his head back...
realizes what he has done and is shaken.

As the shadowed FIGURE looms LARGER:

						JESSICA
			There's no turning back, is there?

Logan turns and pushes Jessica through the door... following her...
as the door closes and they are:

217		ON THE OTHER SIDE	

now, they can still hear the SOUND, etcetera for the last time.

Beyond the lock is the ruins of a vast undersea complex in which
food was raised and harvested. What we see is an endless shadowy
labyrinth of breeding pens which stretch off into the green darkness
-- a kind of mammoth aquarium with catwalks and ramps intersecting
the huge tanks. The levels are multiple and everything is slimed,
rusted, rotted and wet.

In the tanks themselves are shoals of fish, gardens of seaweed, etc.
The machinery for harvesting and winnowing has long since gone to
rust -- and visible in the great tanks are the wrecks of vessels and
gear -- the kind of stuff Cousteau and Co. are using now.

Footing is dangerous -- a slip from any catwalk means a plunge into
water and some of the walkways are well under water anyhow. From an
invisible ceiling comes a steady dripping and everything is crusted
and smells of salt and decay and life in the darkness.

217X1	WITH FRANCIS	

As he arrives at the door, the ankh glowing as before.

But Francis has a light. He examines the door with it, and as it
lights the pool of water on the ground, it picks out Jessica's ankh.
FRANCIS stoops, gets it and looks from it to the one glowing
	
128		LOGAN AND JESSICA	

Bewildered -- uncertain, as their eyes adjust to the dim light.
Finally, Logan gestures ''this way" and sets out.

(NOTE: The action of the sequence is the action of people groping
through a labyrinth. They go along, gripping a rail where possible,
sometimes sinking deep into water, sometimes rising above it. They
run into blind endings and retrace to the last junction -- always
trying for what looks driest and seems to stretch farthest along the
great wall...)

219-224	WITH LOGAN AND JESSICA - SERIES OF CUTS	

A. Making their way along the walkway side by side.

B. Stopping as the walkway disappears under water. Logan wading in
while she waits -- until he re-emerges. She follows.	

C. Choosing between diverging ramps. Having to return.

						JESSICA
			How do we know this is the right
			way?

						LOGAN
			It's the only way.
			
D. POV an alley way full of machinery. Logan gives a wheel a half
turn -- great rusty net-combs start to winnow the water.

E. Helping Jessica, Logan slips...falls into darkness. Jessica's
fear until he emerges, hand over slimy hand. The water is cold.

F. POV ancient signs - PROTOPLANK...DEPOT NO #11 DO NOT DECANT...
HABITAT MARITIME...ETC.

They speculate.

						JESSICA
			What do you suppose this was...?

						LOGAN
			Some kind of breeding pens...I
			suppose...They say people used
			to breed animal s, fish, anything
					(at her disbelieving look)
			To eat, of course.
			
						JESSICA
			Ycch.
					(shudders)
			To kill things and then eat them.
			It must have been a savage world.
			
Logan shrugs, but the idea makes him queasy, too.
			
G. They stop, tired. Peer through at the wreckage of a small
inspection vessel and suddenly hear:

SOUND: FOOTSTEPS, coming, halting, WATER sloshing. Steps again.

225		POV - THROUGH THE MAZE OF TANKS - A LIGHT	

moving, hunting.

						LOGAN (alert)	
			Stay here, while I see what it is.	

Jessica nods, frightened. Logan slips off into the darkness. In a
moment he's back. His face - is grim.

						JESSICA
			It's Francis, isn't it?

He nods.

226		LOGAN AND JESSICA

Trying to move faster now, Logan makes a wrong turning and they must
go back. But as they do so, Francis is ever closer -- a gigantic
distorted SHAPE now visible through the eerie glass -then suddenly
seeming small and distant.

As they emerge from the blind alley once again close to the wall,
suddenly:

227		FRANCIS

looming huge, gun drawn, apparently only a few feet away.

228		LOGAN AND JESSICA	

Logan desperately claws at machinery, succeeds in starting motion,
somewhere what sounds like a GENERATOR begins laboring, ancient
machinery GROANS.
		
They turn and run as they HEAR:
	
						FRANCIS (distorted;
					echo; etcetera)
			LOGAN N N N.
		
229		POV - FRANCIS' LIGHT

is splashing the walls ahead and in it they suddenly see:

THE DOOR -- a waterlock with a wheel. As the light passes, Logan
heaves desperately on it. It starts to give as the light comes back
and they are revealed.

230		CLOSE - ON FRANCIS

aiming at Logan...then slowly moving his hand until Jessica is in
his sights.

231		LOGAN - JESSICA - FRANCIS 

Francis FIRES -- tremendous SOUND, ECHOING and RESOUNDING. One of
the great tanks buckles and a cascade of water erupts over
everything. Through it, Logan manages to get the door open and
pushes a half-drowning Jessica through.

232		INT. - THE SHAFT 	

A sort of ancient freight elevator which commences to move groaning
when the waterlock door closes.
		
Logan slumps to the floor.

233		INT. - SHAFT - TWO SHOT - LOGAN AND JESSICA 

Moving at an extremely high speed...We can see the outside -
flickering - dark, light, - dark, light... and finally to a white
color. They lie slumped, motionless. Finally it stops. The door
opens into a kind of glistening darkness, suffused by a bluish glow.
It is now very cold.

In the silence Logan stirs. Groping, he touches Jessica, who moves
close to him. Logan puts his arm around her and they rise. Slowly,
tentatively, he leads her out into the dark chamber where they stand
for a moment trying to find themselves. What little light there is
seems to come from the left. Arm around Jessica, Logan starts to
move.

						JESSICA (whispering) 
			I'm afraid.

						LOGAN	
			It's brighter there...besides, we
			can't go back.

He starts to move again but Jessica hangs back.

						JESSICA 
			Wait.

He halts.

						JESSICA (cont'd)	
			I don't know what's going to happen	
			to us Logan but --	
					(a beat)
			Are you glad you didn't kill him?

						LOGAN 
			It doesn't make any difference anymore.

						JESSICA 
			You're really one of us now, aren't you?

						LOGAN 
			You knew that I wasn't before, didn't you?
					(Jessica nods)
			Why did you stay with me?

						JESSICA (feelingly) 
			I wanted to...
				(Logan puts his arms
				around her) 
			...And you...what made you kill Sandmen?

						LOGAN
			I had to. I did kill...for the
			first time in my life I killed.

						JESSICA 
			Because you felt like a Runner, 
			didn't you.

						LOGAN 
			I guess so...I know I felt something 
			I never felt before...and I didn't 
			like it...not a bit.
					(after another long beat) 
			I'll tell you one thing...Sanctuary 
			better be worth it. That's the last 
			place for me to live now.

						JESSICA 
			For us.

Logan mouths "Us"...a strange word...and why not... in the last
minutes he has done strange things.

234-236 	OUT
		
236x1	INT. - ICE CAVERN

Suddenly they are blinded by a brilliant light coming from the side
and revealing for the first time where they are.

236x2	ANGLE

Before them a vase, dim, ice-shrouded storage area, row upon endless
row of frozen lockers trailing away into darkness, their legends and
contents unreadable in the thick covering of ice and frost. To the
side, a bright light.
		
236x3	LOGAN AND JESSICA

Walk toward the light.

236x4	WITH LOGAN AND JESSICA

We see a huge, high-domed cavern ringed and ornamented with
extraordinary ice sculptures-They are everywhere: Otters, fish, a
tusked walrus---overhead a flight of birds.

236x5	ANOTHER ANGLE

As they look in wonder:

						VOICE
			Overwhelming, isn't it?

Logan and Jessica turn and see:

237-238	OUT

239		FULL ANGLE - BOX	

Box is half-man...half-metal.

From the midpoint of his sternum to his hips he is coils and cables.
One hand is a cutting tool. His head is half-flesh...half-metal. his
legs are a chrome pedestal.

						BOX		
			Are you too startled? Am I too	
			removed from your ken?	
					(slightest beat)
			I'm neither machine nor man...but
			a perfect fusion of the two...and
			better than either.
					(with great pride)
			No human sculptor could match this
			greatness...don't you agree?

						LOGAN
			All right - what are you?
	
						BOX (laughs)
			Your turn.
	
						JESSICA
			It's incredibly beautiful.

						BOX	
			Ah, but wait for the winds. Then	
			my birds sing. My walrus breathes.	
			My palace chimes and bells. And the
			deep grottoes whisper my name...Box
			Box...Bahhhhxxxxsss...

						LOGAN (after a beat)
			We're hungry	do you have anything
			to eat?
	
						BOX
			Anything to eat?

Box starts to laugh...He is roaring with laughter as:

						JESSICA (quietly)
			We're human and we're hungry.

						BOX (still laughing) 
			I know...I know.

						LOGAN
			This place is a link to Sanctuary,
			isn't it?

Box looks totally confused.

						LOGAN (angrily) 
			How do you think we got here??!!

						BOX
			You walked in. I saw you. Don't
			you remember?

Logan contains his anger.

						LOGAN (beginning 
					again; quietly) 
			Where do you think we came from?

						BOX 
			From? From? From?

						LOGAN	
			We were sent here and you know it.
			Others have been sent here. Where
			are they? Hiding?
	
Box looks around the cavern:
	
						BOX (mischievously)
			Hiding? Yes! Hiding, hiding.

						LOGAN
			Where do we go?!	
					(up a notch)			
			Where do we go from here??!!

We hear a NOISE outside.

						BOX 
			Is that the wind?
					(smiling)
			Not yet...
					(slightest beat) 
			You must hear my birds sing.

						LOGAN 
			You know about Sanctuary! I know 
			you do! You have to help us! You 
			don't have a choice! It isn't your 
			decision!! Tell us.

						BOX
			Never a pair. I have never had a
			pair.

						LOGAN
			Where do you send them?

						BOX
			You're a beautiful pair.

						JESSICA 
			Please.

						BOX 
			I've never seen humans whom I thought 
			worthy of being here...
					(a beat) 
			I'd like to sculpt you.
					(looking around) 
			Where would I put you?
					(smiling) 
			I know...you'd be the base of the 
			column. You'd hold up my world!

						LOGAN (exasperated) 
			Answer the question!

						BOX 
			Do you know how long all this will 
			last? Not thirty years...or thirty 
			thousand years...but thirty thousand 
			thousand years...and you'll be part 
			of it. Ages will roll...Ages. And 
			you'll be here...the two of you... 
			eternally frozen...frozen...beautiful.

						LOGAN (to Jessica)	
			There must be somebody else up here.	
			I can't believe that he's--	

						BOX (interrupting;
					his voice tone changing;
					very lucid)
			Let me sculpt you and I will show
			you where the others have gone.
	
						LOGAN
			That's better.
					(slightest beat)
			How do you want us?

						BOX
			Nude. Imagine, a pair.

						LOGAN (starting to 
					take off his clothes; 
					as Jessica hesitates, 
					Logan smiles)
			It'll be all right...

240-241	JESSICA 

Undresses.

Box motions to a pedestal covered with deep white furs.

						BOX
			Up there.

Logan helps Jessica up to the pedestal. As they stand there:

						LOGAN
			How do you want us?

						BOX (beat)
			Up there.

Logan looks at Jessica. Her beauty is glowing in the lamplight.

Logan takes Jessica into his arms.

						BOX
			Enchanting. Is that what humans do?

By this time, Logan and Jessica are no longer listening to
Box...their arms are enveloping one another...with strong feelings.

						BOX'S VOICE	
			Superb!	

242		ANOTHER ANGLE - INCLUDING BOX

As his metal hand begins to BUZZ...he brings it to the base of the
huge column supporting the cavern.

As he works furiously...at Incredible speed:


243		LOGAN AND JESSICA

...oblivious to Box...their feelings intensifying as they continue
to hold one another.

244-245	OUT

246		CLOSE - ON BOX

						BOX (stepping back) 
			Done...behold...!

247		REVERSE ANGLE - LOGAN AND JESSICA

Before they turn to view the sculpture they kiss long and
passionately.

Their mood is broken by:

						BOX'S VOICE
			Done...Done...Done...

Logan and Jessica break. They turn and see:

248		FULL ANGLE - THE ICE SCULPTURE

Box has captured them perfectly...shimmering with life...filled with
emotion.

249		WIDE ANGLE - INCLUDING LOGAN, JESSICA AND BOX

There are tears in Jessica's eyes as she reacts to the sculpture.

						JESSICA (squeezing	
					Logan's hand)	
			It's glorious 

Logan helps Jessica off the pedestal and they both start to dress.

						LOGAN
			All right. Now you keep your
			bargain.

						BOX (rapt by his
					work) 
			Wait for the wind! Wait and hear
			the birds sing over you!

						LOGAN (only interested
					in getting out)
			We're ready.

Box mumbles as he leads Logan and Jessica toward the rear of the Ice
Cavern.

250		INT. - ICE ROOM

As Box enters followed by Logan and Jessica.

This room has a fairly low ceiling and it is not too wide.

It stretches back as far as the eye can see.

The ice along the left wall is frosted...but the ice along the right
wall is perfectly clear.

And embedded in the ice along the perfectly clear right wall are:

251		WIDE ANGLE - MEN AND WOMEN

Standing in erect positions.

At first it appears that they might be more of Box's perfect works
of sculpture.

But as Logan and Jessica examine them closely through the clear
ice...it is soon apparent that they are real people...who have been
frozen.

252		CLOSE ON LOGAN AND JESSICA

Horrified as they move slowly along the wall.

253		ANOTHER ANGLE - INCLUDING THE MEN AND WOMEN FROZEN	
		IN THE WALL

We can see that each of them has a black crystal flower in the palm
of their right hands.
	
Logan walks to the end of this wall. Each frozen body has a number
above it. The final body's number is 1056...That number which the
voice in Sandman's headquarters revealed as the number of missing
Runners.

The CAMERA PANS Logan back to Box.

254		ANOTHER ANGLE - INCLUDING BOX

As Logan turns toward him.

						LOGAN (stupefied) 
			How did they get in here?

						BOX
			Regular storage procedure...the
			same as the other food... The
			other food stopped coming and they
			started.
	
						LOGAN
			What other food?

						BOX
			Fish and plankton, sea greens and
			protein from the sea.
					(pointing to the frosted
					ice wall)
			It's all here - ready - fresh as
			harvest day. Fish and plankton,			
			sea greens and protein from the
			sea...And then it stopped coming
			and they (gesture) came instead.
			So I store them here. I'm ready.
			And you're ready. It's my Job -
			protein, plankton, grass from the
			sea

Logan pulls out his gun.

						LOGAN	
			Tell us how to get out...or I¹ll	
			destroy you..I'll kill you!

Box laughs...The same LOUD, ROARING LAUGH we HEARD earlier.  Then:

						BOX (calmly)
			Such a beautiful pair. I'll stand
			you facing one another.
		
Box starts his saw hand BUZZING.  He turns all the flesh parts of
his body away from Logan and starts advancing toward him and Jessica
who is now standing behind Logan.

Box is now like an armed vehicle.

Logan FIRES...the fire reflecting harmlessly off Box's metal frame.

						BOX (advancing)
			Resign yourself.

255		MED. ANGLE - LOGAN AND JESSICA

Retreating...as Logan FIRES again and again...to no avail.

As Logan and Jessica retreat further and further toward the rear of
this room and:

256		REVERSE ANGLE - BOX

Advancing

We can SEE PERSON AFTER PERSON...embedded in the clear wall of ice.
A strange mute audience to this to-the-death drama.

257		TWO SHOT - LOGAN AND JESSICA

Finally reaching the rear wall of this room as:

258		REVERSE ANGLE - BOX

Relentlessly moving toward them.

259		TWO SHOT - LOGAN AND JESSICA

Seemingly pinned back against the rear wall.

Logan is FIRING his gun futilely with his right hand...while moving
his empty hand against the rear wall...trying to find a knob or
button which might open it.

The entire time he never takes his eyes off:

260		REVERSE ANGLE - BOX

Getting closer. The saw is BUZZING LOUDLY.

						BOX (chilling tone) 
			I make such a small, quick incision ...
			you can hardly feel it.

261		REVERSE ANGLE - LOGAN AND JESSICA

Against the rear wall...We can SEE...but they cannot...that above
them...on the ceiling...there are a number of exposed cables.

262		FULL ANGLE - LOGAN, JESSICA AND BOX
	
Box is practically upon them.  As he lunges forward with his
WHIRRING saw hand Logan pushes Jessica to the floor and drops down
alongside her.

Box cannot stop his forward thrust and cuts a sizable chunk of ice
out of the rear wall as:

Logan SHOOTS at Box from the floor Level...upwards ...trying to
penetrate some part of his seemingly impregnable body. He misses but
hits the exposed cables on the ceiling.

There is an EXPLOSION.

						BOX (looking up; 
					screaming) 
			No! The coils!

Box rushes past Logan and Jessica toward the huge ice cavern
containing his sculptures.

						BOX (still screaming)	
			All my work!' All my work!!	

As Logan and Jessica stand:

263-270	OUT
			
270x1	ANGLE - THE REFRIGERANT COILS

Bursting open, discharging great streams of gases.

270x2	LOGAN

Seeing the effect, shooting again and again at the ceiling and
walls.

270x3	ANOTHER ANGLE	
		
Coils bursting everywhere, vapor billowing into the cavern.
			
270x4	ANOTHER ANGLE	
	
Huge slabs of ice instantly loosening, crashing over.
			
270x5	FULL SHOT	

AS the effect multiplies--Ln the hissing vapor-sculptures crashing
over and enormous chunks of ice loosened and crashing.

270x6	BOX

Careening around wildly in the growing ruin, as the lights dim and
flicker out.

270X7	ANGLE

The ceiling full of birds loosening, crashing down upon Box. Again
and again like great spears and wedges 

270X8	BOX
	
Buried in his work, still feebly moving, then still as the roaring
ice crashes down, in the terrible darkness.
	
270X9	LOGAN AND JESSICA
 
Cowering in the crashing maelstrom of ice blocks--saved only by
Being in an angle of the cave.

270X10	FULL SHOT	
	
The SCREEN blotted out by the cave-in, going out of focus. Silence.
Then:

SOUND: Ice melting, water running.

270X11	LOGAN AND JESSICA

Stir in the dimness, amazed to be alive.

SOUND: A heavy crash and splash as another huge ice block falls into
the water.

As it falls, the cave is suddenly illuminated again. They look and
see the light is coming from a great fissure in the wall--opened by
the last ice fall. Water rains across the opening.

Logan and Jessica make their way to it, step out.

271-272	OUT

273		EXT. - HIGH LEDGE

Water is pouring down in a waterfall from the icemelt.

They are blinded by:

274		SUNSHINE: A HUGE RISING SUN	

As Logan and Jessica shield their eyes...then realizing that the
dazzling light will not go away:

Standing together...in fear of the sunrise.

						JESSICA 		
			Is there something on fire!!	 

Logan shakes his head...he doesn't know.

As Logan looks up at the sun.
			
						LOGAN
			It seems to be moving away.
			Come on...

274X1	ANGLE - LOGAN AND JESSICA

clambering cautiously down from the barren ledge.

274X2	LOWER - AN AREA OF BOULDERS	

Suddenly, a FAIRLY STRONG WIND starts blowing.

						JESSICA (frightened) 
			What's that?

						LOGAN 
			It feels like breath. It makes 
			everything move. Your hair is moving.

						JESSICA (smiling) 
			And yours.

They reach the level below and pause, look around.

						LOGAN
			Jessica -- we must be outside!

She looks at him, uncertainly, he puts an arm around her and they
set out again.

275-276	OUT

276X1	INT. - CAVE - CLOSE ON FRANCIS

Picking his way through the ruined cave, puzzled.

277-287X1	
OUT

288		EXT . - FOREST AREA

As Logan and Jessica reach it.

They are startled by the SOUND of BIRDS SINGING for a moment...then
continue through some high grass and thorned bushes being scratched,
etcetera.

A swarm of insects attack...Logan and Jessica fight them off:

						JESSICA (starting to panic)
			I hate outside! I hate it!

						LOGAN (holding her; 
					comforting tone)
			We'll be all right...
					(a beat)
			We will...

The sun is starting to go down...as they see a rabbit dart away in
the grass...startling them for a moment.
		
288XA1	FRANCIS
Coming out through the fissure in the rock, squinting at the
unexpected light from the sky, then setting out as Logan and Jessica
did.
		
288XB1	WITH LOGAN AND JESSICA - A BUSHY AREA

They come upon bushes of berries. Logan picks a few, looks at them
and smells them. As he is about to put them in his mouth...Jesslca
grabs hold of his hand.

						JESSICA
			Don't!

						LOGAN
			Sooner or later, we'll have to try
			something

Logan eats the berries...as Jessica watches intently.

After a beat

						LOGAN
			They're good.

Logan and Jessica pick berries and eat. When they are finished: 

						JESSICA
			It's getting dark and cold.	
			I'm tired.		

						LOGAN 
			Why don't we rest here? We know we can 
			eat these.

They sit on the ground.

LAP DISSOLVE TO:

288X1	TWO SHOT - LOGAN AND JESSICA - NIGHT	

Sitting on the ground.

Jessica is shivering. Logan has his arms around her trying to keep
her warm. 

						JESSICA 
			Where do you think that heat-ball went?

Logan shrugs.

						JESSICA
			Do you think everything's going to
			turn to ice?

						LOGAN
 			I doubt it.
	
						JESSICA
			Don't ever let go.

						LOGAN
			I won't.
	
After a long beat:

						LOGAN
			It all seemed to make sense until
			Box.

						JESSICA
			Do you think he was telling the
			Truth?

Logan shrugs.

						JESSICA (trying to 
					convince herself) 
			Maybe we're the first ones to get 
			through... 
					(hopeful tone) 
			Maybe Sanctuary is near, now... 
			another protected place. It couldn't 
			be outside.

						LOGAN (grunts) 
			How would anyone know? Even if we find 
			it -- we can never go back.

At her stricken look...Logan touches her in a caring way.

						LOGAN
			You're right...it must be near
			now. We'll find it.

						JESSICA (yawning;		
					closing her eyes; resting	
					on his shoulder)	
			Thirty thousand years didn't last
			very long, did they?
	
288X2	EXT. - BARREN TERRAIN - NIGHT - FRANCIS
	
Looking frightened as he looks up at the moon and the stars his gun
drawn.

Suddenly, a rabbit darts by.

Francis jumps up in great fear and starts FIRING his gun...blasting
the rabbit to smithereens.

He is breathing hard (fear)...and looking around...gun in hand.

288X3	EXT. - FOREST AREA - DAY - LOGAN AND JESSICA

walking in the hot sun...grimy...thirsty.

288X4	EXT. - FOREST AREA - FRANCIS

His face still betrays a wild, frightened look as he moves very
cautiously.

He reaches the bushes of berries and sees some of them on the
ground.

He picks a few off the bush...is ravenous...but finally...too
frightened that they might be some kind of poison to eat any.

As he angrily crushes the berries in his hand... then wipes his hand
on his trousers:

288X5	EXT. - FOREST AREA - LOGAN AND JESSICA

Seeing shimmering in the distance. They walk toward it.

288X6-
288X8	TRACKING SHOTS WITH LOGAN AND JESSICA

Reaching...

289		FULL ANGLE - A BROOK

They rush to it...drink...then undress...swim...and as they embrace
in the water:

						JESSICA
			Logan!!!Look!!
					(Logan turns around)
			No...your palm...look!!! 	

Logan looks at his palm...the blinking crystal is clear.

He grabs Jessica's hand and looks at her palm... the same.

						JESSICA (quietly)
			What does it mean?
	
						LOGAN (trying to
					assimilate its meaning
					himself)
			The Lifeclocks have no power outside. 

Jessica takes Logan's palm and kisses it.

						JESSICA (with laughter)
			You can have any woman in the city.
			What do you really want?

						LOGAN (straight)
			You know, Jessica.

						JESSICA. (a beat)
			...But I still have the choice...?

						LOGAN
			Of course.

						JESSICA
			Then the answer's Yes...

They embrace there in the water...
			
290 		OUT

291		HIGH ANGLE - SHOOTING DOWN - LOGAN AND JESSICA

Coming out of the forest...climbing up a green hilly area...reaching
the top and seeing:

292-301	OUT

301X10	CLOSEUP - LOGAN AND JESSICA	

Looking up at statue.

						LOGAN 
			I have never seen a face like that 
			before. It must be the look of great 
			age. Whoever he was he was terribly old.

						JESSICA (beat) 
			Yes, do you think that's why he looks 
			so sad---?

Logan shrugs. They turn, start to EXIT from memorial.

301X11	INT. - MEMORIAL - HIGH ANGLE OVER STATUE'S BACK

301X16	CLOSEUP - LOGAN AND JESSICA	

As they pass the stones, Logan glances at them.

						LOGAN
			They all have names and numbers
			on them. I wonder what they are?

						JESSICA
			"Beloved Husband". "Beloved Wife".
			What can all that mean?
		
Just then their attention is focused by a distant SOUND as of
SHOUTING -- a man's voice. Jessica stops.
		
						JESSICA
			Francis?
		
Logan shakes his head. They EXIT cemetery toward capitol.
		
301X17	LONG SHOT - CAPITOL (MATTE COMPOSITE)

Logan and Jessica walking up steps toward building.

301X18	TWO SHOT - LOGAN AND JESSICA

Logan and Jessica enter the ancient room. They stop and look around.

301X20	CLOSEUP - LOGAN AND JESSICA

They walk to the door and open it cautiously.

They EXIT right.

React, then they enter Senate and stop and look.

301X24	INT. - SENATE - OVER LOGAN AND JESSICA'S BACK - A WHITE
		HAIRED MAN OF S SIXTY-PLUS	

There are HUNDREDS OF CATS...and THOUSANDS OF BOOKS all over the
place.

						JESSICA (frowning; 
					whispering)
			Look at his face...and his hair... 
					(grimacing)
			Is that what it is to grow old?

						LOGAN (still stunned)
			It could be...

There are a COUPLE OF CATS on the man's lap as he turns and faces
Logan and Jessica...when he HEARS them move closer.

The man is stroking the cats calmly...unperturbed by the appearance
of Logan and Jessica.

						LOGAN
			How old are you?		

						MAN
			As old as I am I suppose...who
			knows ?

						LOGAN 
			Your hair is white.

						MAN		
			It wasn't always. I remember when		
			it wasn't. But it wasn't your	
			color either.
					(looking at Jessica) 
			...or yours. I have my color somewhere.

						JESSICA
			Those cracks in your face...do they hurt?

						MAN 
			Oh, no...

						JESSICA 
			Could I touch them?

						MAN
			Oh, my...please try.

Jessica walks up to the man and touches his face.

						JESSICA 
			What's your name?

						MAN
			I've forgotten. It's been so
			long since I've used it.
	
Logan and Jessica exchange a quick glance...feeling they have come
upon a nutsy, fruitsy cupcake.
	
						MAN
			But all of my cats have names.
	
						LOGAN
			Is that what they're called--
			cats?

						OLD MAN
			Yes, cats, of course. What else
			could they be? Cats. Of course
			each one has his own name too.
	
						JESSICA
			But there are so many of them.
			Do you know each one separately.
		
						OLD MAN
			Yes indeed, everyone. Actually,
			they all have three.
					(reciting)
			"The naming of cats is a difficult
			matter. It isn't just one of your
			holiday games. You may think at	
			first I'm mad as a hatter when I	
			tell you a cat must have THREE
			DIFFERENT NAMES."
					(a beat)
			An ordinary name and a fancy name.
			That's two. Do you want to guess
			what the third one is?
		
Logan and Jessica are silent.

						OLD MAN (reciting again)	
			"But above and beyond there's	
			still one name left over,	
			And that is the name that you
			never will guess;
			The name that no human research
			can discover -- -
			But THE CAT HIMSELF KNOWS, and
			will never confess."
					(reaching down and
					stroking another cat)
			Will you, my pet?
		
One of the cats jumps off his lap.

						OLD MAN (reciting)
			"Why did you go little fourpaws?
			You forgot to shut your big eyes."
					(the man closes his
					eyes for a moment; then:)
			"I have a Gumble Cat in mind!"
		
As the man opens his eyes:
	
						LOGAN
			How long have you been living
			here?
	
						OLD MAN
			For as long as I can remember.
	
						LOGAN
			What kind of place is this?
	
						OLD MAN
			Just a place, I suppose...who
			knows?

The man looks puzzled.

						LOGAN
			How did you get here?

						OLD MAN
			I have always been here...

						LOGAN			
			Are there any other humans?	
	
						OLD MAN
			Gracious...no.

						LOGAN 
			Have any other people ever passed 
			through?

The man shakes his head...then:

						OLD MAN 
			But there may be a few around somewhere.

						LOGAN 
			What makes you think so?

						OLD MAN 
			My parents thought so. Mother and 
			Father. You know?

						LOGAN (astonished) 
			Mother and -- ? You knew your mother 
			and father?

The man nods.

						JESSICA 
			And...and how were you grown? Inside
			your mother?

						OLD MAN
			Yes...

						JESSICA 
			Are you sure?

						OLD MAN 
			Mother and Father said so... you know?

						LOGAN 
			Where are they?

						OLD MAN
			Dead...they're dead...and buried.

						JESSICA (not knowing
					what it is)
			Buried???

Logan wheels...as he HEARS THE NOISE OF A DOOR SQUEAKING
SLIGHTLY...as it opens a bit wider:

302		CLOSE ON A CAT

Coming through the opening - did he push it?

303		CLOSE ON THE MAN

						OLD MAN (pleased; 
					reciting) 
			"Gus is the cat at the theatre door. 
			His name, as I ought to have told 
			you before, Is really Asparagus. 
			That's such a fuss To pronounce, 
			that we usually call him just Gus."

306		WIDER ANGLE - INCLUDING LOGAN AND JESSICA	

						OLD MAN
			May I see your hand again?

Logan and Jessica extend their left hands. The Old Man takes them,
looks from one to another with delight.
		
						OLD MAN
			They're beautiful. May I have
			one too please?
		
						LOGAN
			No--I'm sorry. It's not possible.
			
						OLD MAN (offended)
			It isn't fair. I'll give you one
			of my favorite cats...a Jellicle
			cat.
					(reciting)
			"Jellicle cats have cheerful faces,
			Jellicle cats have bright black eyes;
			They like to practice their airs and graces
			And wait for the Jellicle Moon to rise."


						LOGAN	
			I'm sorry but I don't have anything to 
			give you.	
		
As the man continues to look petulant:

						JESSICA (simply; 
					sincerely)
			That's the truth.

Jessica takes off a ring and hands it to the man.

						JESSICA
			Here you can have this.

The man seems pleased.
	
						OLD MAN
			What kind of jewel is this?

						JESSICA
			I don't know.
	
						OLD MAN
			You're both full of secrets like
			Macavity.	
					(looking at the ring)
			Did you steal this?
	
						JESSICA
			No.
		
						OLD MAN 
					(reciting)
			"Macavity, Macavity, there's no
			one like Macavity,
			There never was a cat of such
			deceitfulness and suavity."
	
						LOGAN
			What's beyond this place - do you
			know?
	
						OLD MAN
			No, no, no
		
						LOGAN
			Did your Mother or Father ever
			mention another place?
	
						OLD MAN
			Never, never, ever. Nothing.

After a pause:

						LOGAN	
			May we stay here for a while?	
			We'd like to rest.	

						OLD MAN
			Of course you can stay. This
			belongs to the people.

						JESSICA
			What belongs to the people?

						OLD MAN
			All this. All of it.
		
						JESSICA
			What people?
			
						OLD MAN
			I don't know...but it does.

The man stands...and starts walking toward a door to an adjoining
room.

						OLD MAN
			I'll be right back.
					(stopping)
			Oh, yes...about the cats...
			one rule is true:
					(reciting)
			"Don't speak till you are spoken to."
			
The man smiles and leaves.
		
305		LOGAN AND JESSICA 	

Logan clears two chairs of cats and they sit down.

Jessica picks up a book and starts leafing through it.

Logan is deep in thought.

Jessica looks up from the book.

						JESSICA (quietly)
			How curious people used to be --
			All these books...

Silence...until:

						LOGAN
			That sweet madman -- how could he
			Come to exist?
	
						JESSICA	
			He had a mother and father --	
			and he knew them.	

						LOGAN
			One in a million, I suppose

						LOGAN AND JESSICA (together; 
					smiling) 
			...Who knows? 

						JESSICA (after a beat) 
			We're going on, aren't we?

						LOGAN 
					(shaking his head) 
			There's nothing to go on to, Jessica.

Logan continues to shake his head through Jessica's following line:

						JESSICA 
			There's a Sanctuary...there is!

						LOGAN
			You want there to be one...that
			Doesn't...

						JESSICA (interrupting; 
					urgent tone) 
			There has to be! I know it exists! It 
			has to!!

						LOGAN (gently) 
			No, there doesn't. Not really --just so 
			many want it to exist...so many who 
			don't want to die...want it so much 
			that a place called Sanctuary becomes 
			"real". But it doesn't exist. It never 
			existed. Just the hope.

						JESSICA (becoming	
					hysterical)
			You're wrong!! It has to be!!
			It Just has to be!!

As Logan takes her in his arms...comforting her:

306		FULL ANGLE - INCLUDING THE MAN

The man returns with a portrait in hand.

						OLD MAN	
			Oh, my don't cry.

The man proudly shows them the portrait....which is a portrait of
himself in his twenties. He sort of brushes the hair...which is rich
auburn.

						OLD MAN (gesturing) 
			There are larger pictures of other 
			people over there. I don't know who 
			they are. Perhaps they're family.

She man leads Logan across the chamber to a far corner.

307		CLOSE ON - JESSICA	

Remaining near the podium. She is dejected. Logan's argument that
there is no Sanctuary has sunk in and taken hold.

308 		OUT

308x1	THE CORNER - LOGAN AND THE OLD MAN

We see portraits of Presidents of the United States.

We can recognize all of them...with the exception of the dozen or so
that come after Ford.

As Logan looks at the portraits he recognizes Lincoln.

						LOGAN 
			That's the same fellow who's outside. 
			If he was so important - why isn't he 
			first?

The old man shakes his head.

309		INT - SENATE CHAMBER - CLOSE ON - JESSICA	

As Francis suddenly appears alongside her.

Jessica is terrified...speechless. Francis glances across the
chamber, sees Logan. When he speaks, it is softly but urgently.

						FRANCIS 
			What did you do to him?

Jessica is silent. Francis' tone becomes increasingly sexual.

						FRANCIS	
			Why? Why you?	
					(grabbing her)	
			Do you know you ruined him? Do
			you know that? Can you tell me
			why? Why you?
					(a beat)
			And now you've killed him, you
			know...

Francis starts to tear off her clothes...obviously to rape...but his
expression remains cold and without passion.

						JESSICA (screaming) 
			Logan!!!

As she screams, Francis clamps a hand over her mouth and drags her
O.S.

310 		OUT

310x1	LOGAN

hears the scream, wheels -- sees nothing for a moment.

311		INT. - SENATE CHAMBER

						FRANCIS' VOICE 
			Here!!!!

Logan looks up...and we see Francis crouched behind the railing of
the first row of the gallery...with his gun pointing down at Logan,
holding the terrified Jessica with his other arm.

						OLD MAN (cheerfully) 
			How nice...more company...

						FRANCIS (emotional; 
					disjointed thoughts) 
			We had such good times together... 
			I let you go! 
					(frenzied) 
			You didn't terminate a Runner and 
			I let you go!!
					(a beat)
			She did this to us! How could you
			let her?! An ordinary available??!!
					(with this he flings
					Jessica down and away.
					She lies there...stunned)
			And what about Logan-6 and Francis-8? 
					(a tear in his eye)
			....Why didn't you chink about them?!
					(up a notch)
			There's over two hundred years of
			Sandmen's blood in you, Logan....
			and now you'll spill it for a
			stinking Runner!!

312		CLOSE ON - LOGAN

Holding up his right palm.

						LOGAN 
			Look at your palm, Francis.... 
			look! It's clear. Clear!

313		REVERSE ANGLE - FRANCIS

Looking at his palm....shocked...dropping his gun. It falls on the
CHAMBER FLOOR.

						FRANCIS 
			Why did you do that??!!

						LOGAN
			I didn't do anything, Francis!
			They've made us believe that....

						FRANCIS (interrupting; 
					wild) 
			Why did you do that???!!!

Francis leaps from the gallery and falls on Logan.

314		WIDE ANGLE - CATS

Scattering in all directions as:

315-319	CLOSE ACTION SHOTS - FRANCIS AND LOGAN

In hand to hand combat punching...Kicking...wrestling

320		INTERCUT WITH: JESSICA AND THE MAN REACTING

Jessica deeply disturbed...The man enjoying himself as if Logan and
Francis were putting on a show for him.

321-331	THE FIGHT- SERIES OF SHOTS

A. Francis manages to pick up a chair and smashes it down on Logan.

B. As Logan slumps to the floor and Francis cries to follow through
his advantage by crushing Logan's face with his foot:

C. Logan grabs Francis' foot and twists it...sending Francis reeling
backward.

D. Standing, Logan grabs a table and hurls it at Francis...who
ducks.

E. Francis sees a steel flagpole (with an American flag that has
sixty-one stars) and takes hold of it.

F. Francis moves toward Logan...with the menacing steel flagpole in
front of him.

G. Logan is wary...watching every movement of the steel pole.

H. Francis swings the steel pole twice...We can HEAR the WHISH-WHISH
as it cuts through the air...with Logan avoiding the blows.

I. On the third swing...Logan grabs hold of the steel pole and
swings around on it...kicking Francis in the chest.

J. Francis lets go of the steel pole as he staggers backward.
Francis and Logan look at one another for a brief anguished moment
as Logan crashes the steel pole (which he is now holding) down on
Francis' head.

K. Francis crumbles to the floor. Feebly, he raises a hand toward
Logan...

Logan touches Francis' hand and Francis grasps his wrist, holding
death off with the strong grip.

						FRANCIS (delirious)	
			That was the right shot--Look out	
			there, he's trying to break free		
			Watch it, Logan, steady, now!......

His eyes focus briefly and he sees Logan's palm-the crystal shining
clear and white. Francis is suddenly radiant.

						FRANCIS 
			Logan! You renewed!

And he is dead.	DIRECT CUT TO:
	
332		JESSICA AND THE MAN

The man walks over to Francis and bends down.

						OLD MAN
			Oh, my...he died...

333		CLOSE ON - LOGAN

Rubbing his face with the palms of his hands...clearly upset.

334		ANOTHER ANGLE - INCLUDING JESSICA AND THE MAN

						OLD MAN
			We¹ll have to bury him.

						JESSICA
			What¹s that?

						OLD MAN
			They¹re put into the ground so
			they can be visited by the living...

Logan¹s eyes are glistening with tears.  The man starts out.

						OLD MAN
			I¹ll make the arrangements.

						JESSICA (softly)
			At least it¹s over...

Jessica¹s words don¹t help as Logan shakes his head...then:

						OLD MAN
			Are you ready to put him in?
	
						LOGAN
			Not yet.

						OLD MAN
			All right.

The man sits down.

Gently, Logan lifts Francis¹ body...trying to straighten him out
from the slightly twisted position he assumed when he fell to the
floor.

After resting Francis¹ body on the floor again.  He cradles Francis¹
head in his arms.

DISSOLVE TO:

339X1	CLOSER ANGLE - CEMETERY

As they look down at Francis' body...in the open grave.

Jessica watches as Logan and the man start shoveling dirt into the
grave...starting to fill it.

339X2	JESSICA

quietly watching:

DISSOLVE TO:
		
339X3	INT. - SENATE - NEXT MORNING

On Logan sleeping - Jessica and Old Man in a spirited but soft
conversation in a far corner.

As Logan wakes he hears:

						OLD MAN
			Of course...that's settled then.
			But just you remember your promise...

						JESSICA 
			We'll remember. But that's a long time 
			off...

She sees Logan awake and listening, crosses to him, smiling. Logan
rises to her.

						LOGAN 
			What are we promising him? What can we 
			possibly give him?

						JESSICA 
			He asked if we would bury him when his 
			time comes.

						 LOGAN (beat)
			We can't. We're going back.

						JESSICA 
			To what?

						LOGAN		
			I'm going to try and tell people what 
			we've seen and--

						JESSICA (interrupting) 
			You're lying! You'll never have the 
			chance to tell anybody anything! 
			You'll be killed the moment you're seen!

						LOGAN 
			Do you expect me to let things go on 
			without trying to change them?!

						JESSICA 
			Things won't change...you know that! 
			We can live here together, Logan...
			have a life as long as his... together!

						LOGAN (showing his palm) 
			Things change!

						JESSICA
			You want to go back to kill, is that it?! 
			Now, you'll want to kill your own!!! kill 
			Sandmen!!! Killing's all you ever...!!!!

Logan shakes Jessica who is becoming hysterical.

						LOGAN (softly) 
			Jessica...listen to me...listen to me...
					(as she quiets down)
			The Lifeclocks made me kill
			Francis. They make people die or
			be killed every day. If I didn't
			try and destroy that...I couldn't
			live here or anywhere. Do you
			understand?

						JESSICA
			I want to be alive and with you,
			that's all I want.

Logan puts his arms around her.

						LOGAN 
			I know...I know...

The Old Man comes to them, wondering.

						LOGAN 
			We're leaving.

						 OLD MAN		
			What a pity. I was hoping you'd	
			be here to bury me.	

						JESSICA 
			Come with us.

						OLD MAN 
			Where are you going?

						LOGAN 
			To a city with thousands and thousands 
			of people.

						OLD MAN 
			Alive?

Logan nods.

						OLD MAN 
			Thousands and thousands...as many as 
			my cats?

						LOGAN 
			More...many more.

						OLD MAN 
			And all alive you say?

Logan nods.

						OLD MAN
			Yes, I would like to see that. Is it 
			a long journey?

Again, Logan nods.

						OLD MAN (mumbling) 
			Thousands and thousands alive... oh, my...

340-349	OUT

350		HIGH ANGLE - GREENBELT AREA - SHOOTING DOWN - DAY

Logan, Jessica and the Old MAN are walking...with the Capitol

SHOT.	

351-361 	OUT

361X1	EXT. - FOREST AREA - AFTERNOON

The Old Man has picked Some wild vegetables...and hands a piece to
Logan and a piece to Jessica.

As they hesitate...the Old Man bites into it... heartily. 

As Logan and Jessica start eating it, too:

						OLD MAN (marveling tone) 
			Never see the sun or the moon... 
			I hope we get there soon...

361X1A	NIGHT - WOODED AREA - CLOSE	

On Logan, Jessica and the Old Man as they emerge from a small grove
of trees and stand looking O.S. past CAMERA Behind, a flicker of
firelight.

						OLD MAN (weary but
					enthusiastic)
			Is that really it? It doesn't
			seem very far. Will we be there
			soon?

						LOGAN
			I promise. We '11 go on as soon
			as it's light.

						JESSICA (gently, 
					turning O.M. away) 
			But now I'm tired. Let's go back to 
			the fire...

They turn, the Old Man still marveling at the sight.

P.O.V. WHAT THEY SEE (TO BE INTERCUT)

NIGHT (Matte) view of the domed city seen through a fringe of trees and beyond distance hills.

361X1B	EXT. - WOODED AREA - NIGHT

As the three return to where a small fire is burning on the ground.

						OLD MAN 
			That's better than gold when it's cold.

						LOGAN		
			Thank you.			
					(turning to Old Man)	
			Tell me - what do those words mean?
			"Beloved husband²...²Beloved son"...
			"Beloved wife"'...

						OLD MAN
			My father was the husband and my
			mother was the wife. "Beloved" is	
			a word they used - to stay together.

						LOGAN 
			Stay? They lived together all their years?

						OLD MAN 
			Oh, yes...I think...

						JESSICA (reading; 
					moved) 
			³Beloved son²... 
					(a beat) 
			So people stayed together for that 
			feeling of love... They would live and 
			raise children together and be remembered. 
					(another beat) 
			I think I feel that way, Logan. Can we 
			be that way?

						LOGAN (facing Jessica) 
			Yes. You and I, Jessica. 
					(a beat)

						JESSICA		
			And Sanctuary?		

						LOGAN 
			Sanctuary is the right to live.... 
			nothing more. But nothing less, either....

There is a long beat...then Jessica snuggles up to Logan...she is
ready for sleep.

						JESSICA (whispering)
			Beloved husband...

						LOGAN (kissing her)
			Beloved wife...

As they walk the great glowing dome is visible in the distance.

The Old Man marvels at what he sees...they walk on.

362		LONG, LONG ANGLE - LOGAN JESSICA AND THE OLD MAN - DAY

Walking up the beach toward the domed city. We get an idea of the
scale. They appear as ants in front of redwood trees.

363 		OUT

364		LOGAN, JESSICA AND THE OLD MAN

Approaching. The wave power inlet in f.g. They

HEAR: THE ROAR OF THE WATER

As they approach cautiously...they see:

365		WAVE POWER INLET

Waves pounding over ACRES OF STRANGE STEPPED CONSTRUCTION...
DESCENDING TO A VORTEX.

						JESSICA
			What does that water do?

						LOGAN
			It's part of the hydrogalvanic
			system. The ocean tides are changed
			into energy somehow.

						JESSICA
			Is it inside the city?

						LOGAN
			Of course.
					(a beat)
			I don't know where...
					(frowning)
			I Just took them for granted. 
					(Logan takes Jessica's hand)
			It's our only chance.

The CAMERA PANS LOGAN, JESSICA and the OLD MAN down the STRANGE
STEPPED CONSTRUCTION until they reach:

366		FULL ANGLE - A POOL OF WATER

At the CENTER of this IMMENSE WATER FLOWING CONSTRUCTION OF STEPS.

After a beat Jessica looks at the Old Man:
		
						LOGAN (softly)	
			I know...
					(after a beat; to the
					Old Man)
			We're going to try and get in this
			way. I don't think you can make it.

						OLD MAN (sadly)
			Oh...I did so look forward to seeing
			all those people.

						LOGAN
			I'm sorry.

						OLD MAN
			Yes...

						LOGAN
			Can you make it back?

						OLD MAN
			Oh my...I'll try. 

						JESSICA (kissing the Old Man)
			Goodbye.

						OLD MAN
			Oh, my...

The Old Man watches Logan and Jessica dive into the POOL and
disappear.

367		THE OLD MAN

he bends and plays with the water in the POOL for a moment...like a
young child at a pond or lake.

368		INT. - POWER CENTER OF THE CITY - LOGAN AND JESSICA 

Emerging from the water.

It is a labyrinth of humming turbines, automonitored cables and
impulse collectors.

Logan leads her swiftly through the humming maze toward an exit.

369-
369Xl 	OUT

369AX2	GREAT HALL - AT CAROUSEL ENTRANCE

As the CROWD is pouring in:

						LOGAN'S VOICE
			No!! Don't go in there !!

The CROWD turns and looks up at:

369X2	LOGAN

On a high balcony in the Great Hall.

Looking down at them.

						LOGAN 
			You don't have to die!! No one has 
			to die at thirty!!! You don't have 
			to blink out on Lastday. There's no 
			renewal on Carrousel! You can live 
			longer and grow old... I've seen it.
			She's seen it!! Believe me!!

There is an angry murmur in the CROWD as Logan continues:

						LOGAN (holding up
					his palm)
			See... it's' clear. The Lifeclocks
			are a lie - Carousel is a lie!!

369X3	WIDEN ANGLE - INCLUDING SANDMEN

Trying to grab Logan. There is a struggle. Some Sandmen are knocked
over the railing.

But remaining Sandmen fire a gas tranquilizer which subdues Logan
and Jessica.

The CROWD cheers...and continues into Carousel as:

370		INT. - SANDMAN DEBRIEFING AREA

It is the same area where Logan received the original assignment to
find and destroy Sanctuary.

In the rear...with the panel open...the sign reading:
	
		PROBABILITY	
				
blinks on and off.		

Logan is dragged in by a number of SANDMEN.

We see Jessica , too, still groggy, being held by SANDMEN in the
b.g. of the SHOT.

Logan is placed on the chair in which his CRYSTAL was altered.

371		CLOSE ANGLE - LOGAN IN THE CHAIR

A shaft of light glows on and he stiffens - bound by it.

372 		OUT

372X1-
372X3	FULL SHOT - LOGAN AND THE SCREEN

As around him in the air, a series of spectral greenish HEADS appear
-- one after the other -in response to questions. Each of these
heads is Logan. Each revolves slowly on its axis as it responds.

As the real Logan (in the chair) is questioned, each of the heads
answers in turn. They are each a part of his persona and his brain.

373-378 	OUT

378X1-
378X18	INTERCUT WITH CLOSER SHOTS OF LOGAN HIMSELF WRITHING IN
		AGONY AS THE IMPASSIVE HEADS SPEAK.

ANOTHER ANGLE - LOGAN AND HEADS

A. 						FIRST HEAD SPEAKS

B. Logan himself - twisting in pain.

C. The word NEGATIVE appears on the SCREEN.

D.						A SECOND HEAD

			A creature called Box - all frozen, 
			all frozen.

E. Logan writhes in the chair.		
			
F. Again the word NEGATIVE appears on the SCREEN.	

G. 						A THIRD IDENTICAL HEAD
					(Logan's Voice)
			No...There is no Sanctuary.

H. The SCREEN seems to shimmer. It blinks.

I. A third time the word negative appears on the SCREEN.

J. 						A FOURTH HEAD 
					(Logan's voice)
			There is no Sanctuary

K. The SCREEN'S glow increases...to an almost blinding light...
starting to frighten the Sandmen present.

L. At the same time, we see JESSICA coming out of her tranquilized
daze...fearful...still in the Sandmen's custody.

M.						A FIFTH HEAD
					(Logan's voice)
			An old man without a crystal...But
			there is no Sanctuary.

N. Now the SCREEN is starting to spark. Behind it we SEE the
intermittent glow of overheated electronic components.

O. And we see the word negative...once more on the SCREEN -- but
broken now.

P. 						A SIXTH HEAD 
					(Logan's voice)
			There is no Sanctuary.

Q. Now the noise and the light from the SCREEN are peaking...and we
can see the increasing fear of the Sandmen.

R. On the SCREEN the word negative is beginning to shake...as the
SCREEN begins to shake.

379		FULL ANGLE - THE SIX HEADS

						LOGAN'S VOICE (emanating
					 from all of them)
			There is no Sanctuary. There is

The noise and the light coming out of the screen Increase, as it
begins to burst into showers of sparks and flame.

380-410 	OUT

410X1	ANOTHER ANGLE - LOGAN

Straining twisting, as the light above him bursts, goes out in a
puff of smoke -- releasing him. Logan staggers to his feet in time
to meet:

410X2	SANDMEN

Rushing in from the Ready Room to join the others who have closed in
on Logan One holding Jessica.

410X3	LOGAN AND SANDMEN
	
Manages to get one of the Sandmen's guns, instantly blasting him
with it. In the noise and confusion, the fight becomes general. A
Sandman fires back at Logan, misses -- the shot hits one of the
Lifeclocks which flares electrically, ribboning out a great arc.
Instantly Logan gets off a couple of shots at the other Lifeclocks
which similarly flare and burst into violent electrical fire and
discharges.

410X4	THE BATTLE

The electrical discharges, smoke and noise making great confusion.
Sandmen hampered by their own numbers and by trying to miss the
machinery. Logan firing methodically at the Lifeclocks, moving.
Stumbles over Jessica, prone in the smoke. Helps her to her feet.
Crouched, they make for the exit.

410X5	ANOTHER ANGLE - THE. SCREEN	

Sputtering its life out in strange predictive words....PROBABILITY
flashing on and off.... EQUILIBRIUM...DESTRUCT...EQUIL...NO
BALANCE...NO BALANCE...FAMINE... INACCEPTABLE ...NO BALANCE...etc.,
flashing vainly through the eddying smoke and the fierce discharges
which fill the great room.

410X6	SANDMEN

The battle is lost -- the smoke and noise overwhelming. They pick up
their wounded and get out as best they can.

410X7	INT. SANDMAN H.Q. LOBBY

Sandmen rushing out through the gathering smoke and the flare of
fire behind them.

410X8	EXT. SANDMAN H.Q.

Sandmen pouting out through smoke and fire effects. Pushing through
passers-by herding everyone away from the scene.

People getting the hell out of there.

Ad Libs: Get away from here. The whole thing's going.

410X9	INT. LIFECLOCK ROOM

Through the smoke, etc. The Lifeclocks EXPLODE.

410X10	EXT. SANDMAN H.Q.

The building EXPLODES -- great geyser of flame shooting upward.

410X11	GREAT HALL

The sound of the explosion creates panic. Lights begin to flicker.
The great red crystal lights fitfully on and off. People are
panicking, running in different directions. Some pressing into
Carrousel for safety.

410X12	CAROUSEL

As people run in there, the red crystal glowing and sputtering, the
petals moving spasmodically. As people look, the white crystal comes
on, begins spinning wildly, bursting into strange, lancing lights. A
great roaring commences and the whole arena starts to rock with the
crystals. Now the white crystal explodes and the whole room is
crisscrossed with deadly arcing discharges. People flee the scene of
destruction.

410X13	GREAT HALL

The panic is-full, people getting the hell out of there.

410X14	ARCADE

People are stampeding like cattle, all heading down and for the
exits, trampling  each other in their fright.

410X15-
X21		PANIC MONTAGE SERIES OF CUTS

A. EXT. The City under the dome -- fitfully lit as the dome itself
seems to be cracking strange electrical discharges emanating from it
as from a gigantic line storm.

B. The lights in Arcade flicker and go dim.

C. The chandeliers in Arcade swaying, a couple falling onto the
screaming panicky people.

D. Maze-Car Station. People fighting to cram into cars. Car lights
go out. People turn and bolt in another direction.

E. Love Shop -- pandemonium as the drugged bodies clamber over each
other in fear, struggling to get away.

F. Great Hall emptying -- the signs of panic everywhere.

G. The great crystal -- a wildly spluttering electrical fire
wrecking it.


410X22	EXT. - DOMED CITY - FIRE FX AND CRACKING

Running past Power Center.

411	EXT. - CITY - FULL SHOT

The dome of the city torn. Lightning effects playing on the stunned
people...who look up and see the starry heavens, too, as they
stumble forward into the darkness.

A wind begins to blow...where air had never stirred anything. There
is a sense of wonder. Hysteria is lessening...as the people find
themselves moving through the crack...as they discover the fact that
the crystals have disappeared from their palms.

Some are joyful...others frightened...others puzzled...as they
emerge from the crack in the dome at:

412		FULL ANGLE - THE ACRES OF STRANGE STEPPED CONSTRUCTION
	
We can still see the fires in the b.g. of the SHOT as Logan holds on
to Jessica...(like Gable onto Jeanette MacDonald at the end of SAN
FRANCISCO)...full of happiness and hope for the future.

AS people continue to mill all over the acres of strange stepped
construction...we see the Old Man WALKING INTO THE SHOT.

Logan and Jessica run to him. He looks around. People start to
gather...they have never seen a white-haired Old Man in their lives.

As people continue to gather around the Old Man... who couldn't be
more delighted...Logan and Jessica are smiling...inviting people to
touch him...and some do.

Yes, he is an old man...Yes, they will all live again to be old men
and old women...Yes, this is the world renewing itself once again.

PLEASE NOTE THE CRYSTAL WILL BE USED IN THE 
LEFT HAND OF ALL CHARACTERS.








FADE IN:
BEFORE AND DURING  TITLES

1		EXT. - SKY NIGHT											

The moon and stars are visible, but as CAMERA looks down, the SCREEN
fills with dark, billowing clouds. CAMERA moves into the clouds and
just  as they blank out the SCREEN, a distant shimmer of light
becomes visible.  Moving toward it, the shimmer becomes

2		EXT. - DOME OF GLASS - NIGHT

A glowing but not transparent structure stretching off into the
clouds  that press it. CAMERA continues to move in until the
detailed structural  webbing of the dome fills the SCREEN and then
CAMERA MOVES THROUGH IT and  we see

3		EXT. - THE CITY - DAY	

Shining below the dome (which we now see as a series of dome-like
structures standing off without end) -a marvelous crystalline city
of  great openness, building clusters, green plazas, fountains...
multi-leveled  but human scale, crisscrossed by the flickering clear
tubes of the MAZE- CARS.

4		CLOSER ANGLE - ROOFTOPS

As a MAZE-CAR slides softly to a stop.

5		ROOFTOP - THE RUNNER	

The hatch opens and a MAN in a hurry leaves the maze-car and runs
swiftly  along the rooftop and disappears into an open elevator
which instantly  starts to descend.
 
6		INT - RESIDENCE PLAZA - THE ELEVATOR	

From a busy courtyard below we watch the elevator slide down from a
great  height.  As it reaches the courtyard the RUNNER darts out,
pushes into  the crowd.

7 		OUT

8		WITH THE RUNNER

As he reappears around a corner, skirts a brimming pool and makes
for a  kind of broad corridor which seems to lead out of the
courtyard. He is  moving even faster now, glancing back as if he
fears pursuit.

9		ANOTHER ANGLE - CORRIDOR						

Above, at the railing of an oval light well, dressed in black and
silver,   a figure holding an odd looking weapon lazily in one hand
-- and watching.  It is FRANCIS.

10		WITH THE RUNNER			

Moving rapidly down the corridor, he suddenly stops as if feeling
the  presence above. He looks up, sees the SANDMAN and his face
breaks in  terror. He wheels, frantic, screaming, runs back into the
hall.

11		THE SANDMAN (FRANCIS)								

Vaulting the rail, dropping lightly to ground level, weapon poised.

12		P.O.V.		

The crowd melting, parting to reveal the Runner backed against the
pool.  People are YELLING, shaking their fists, terribly excited and
fearful.

13		THE SANDMAN			

Emotionless. Aims. Fires.

14		THE RUNNER - CLOSE			

Seeming to burst aflame in the LENS, then slipping BELOW FRAME to
reveal  Francis sauntering forward, holstering his weapon. The crowd
closing in  behind him, applauding, congratulating him.

15		THE SANDMAN		

Arriving at the pool where the body lies, half immersed. He leans
over,  lifts the right hand from the water, revealing a palm with a
black  flowercrystal shape in it. He lets the hand fall back now as
the crowd   CHEERS and APPLAUDS him.

16		EXTREME CLOSE UP - HAND - IN THE WATER - (INSERT)	

Closing in until the crystal fills the SCREEN.

MATCH DISSOLVE TO:

(TITLES END)

17		CLOSE UP - CRYSTAL - (INSERT)		

Clear, sparkling, flower-like. CAMERA PULLS BACK to reveal


18		INT. - NURSERY CORRIDOR		

The crystal is in the hand of a sleeping INFANT who is behind glass
in  one of many cubicles. Standing outside, looking in, LOGAN, dimly
lit in   the soft glow of the cubicle where the sleeping infant
lies, swaddled and  coccooned in the rosy auto-tender which caters
to the baby's every need.  Faint MUSIC bubbles like distant
laughter.

19		OUT

19X1		LOGAN 			

Logan is twenty-five, strong, virile (yet sensitive) with a kind of
austere grace.

He is somewhat manic...proud...as he peers through the nursery
window  into a kind of foam cocoon which cradles THREE SLEEPING
INFANTS. Logan is  KNOCKING on the soundless glass.

						LOGAN
			Wake up...come on, Logan-6.

19X2		FRANCIS

entering .

						FRANCIS  (shaking	
    					his head in  mild, mocking
	    				disbelief)	
			You are here. I  couldn't 
			believe it when they told me.  
			What are you doing?
	
						LOGAN (still knocking  
	    				on the soundless glass)  
			Turn this way. 
	    				(as one of the infants 
	   				stirs, smiles, bubbles) 
			No,  no...not you...YOU!
	
Francis tries to pull Logan away from the  window, but Logan is
intent on waking one of  the infants.

						FRANCIS               
			You should've seen me take my  
			last Runner...perfect. 
	    				(Logan  continues to pound the  
	     			soundless glass) 
			I backed him  up against a residence 
			pool and  when he terminated...his  
			hand... 
	    				(breaks off as Logan
	    				is paying  no attention)
			So now you've seen him...what's
			the difference awake or asleep?

						LOGAN (to infant)   
			Open your eyes once, idiot.  
					(to Francis) 
			It's not every  day that a Sandman 
			son is  born. I'm telling you, 
			Francis  - that's him!

						FRANCIS    
			Maybe,  maybe not. What's the  
			difference? Come on,  Logan, 
			let's get out of  here before 
			everybody  finds out.

But Logan isn't moving. Francis gets an  idea.

						FRANCIS 
			Okay...you really want to wake 
			him up?

Francis starts to pry at the Panel...knowing it  will sound an
ALARM.

						LOGAN 
			Hey, cut that out !

Too late: There is a SOUND OF ALARM CHIMES. The area in which they
stand  is bathed in a violet glow. Logan grabs Francis firmly and
stops him from  prying at the panel:
 
						LOGAN
			Now you've done it...

The CHIMES STOP...but the glow continues, a metallic VOICE is heard:

						VOICE 
			Break-in scanners report intrusion, 
			identify.

						LOGAN 
			Logan-5...Francis-7, authorized duty
			quadrant. Intrusion accidental.

						VOICE
			Clear Logan-5 and Francis-7.

The violet light goes off.


						FRANCIS (with affection:
					to Logan) 
			Had enough?

						LOGAN (looking at the infant)
			Even the alarm didn't wake him.

As Francis starts out:

						LOGAN (one last look; 
					joining Francis)
			All right, Francis...I'm with you.

They move off down the corridor...the lights behind them DIMMING as
they  pass cubicles suffused with soft pink light, CHILDREN
automatically  tended.

CHIMES...soft. A lullaby and a soothing impersonal VOICE.

						VOICE
			Sleep time...go to sleep.
			Sleeping time, little ones.

As they exit Nursery...Logan stops and takes one final look
backward.

						FRANCIS
			You need a lift. Let's go 
			to Arcade and celebrate...
					(teasing tone)
			your alert successor...Logan-6.
 
						LOGAN 
			Has anyone ever broken in to 
			where the babies are?

						FRANCIS 
					(putting a card key into a door 
					which opens soundlessly) 
			Not in my time...

They move through the door which closes.

20		EXT. - MAZE STATION - NIGHT

They are now on a kind of enclosed platform with widely spaced
doorways,  each glowing faintly. They pause, waiting.




						FRANCIS (peering 
					at Logan curiously)
			Why?

						LOGAN 
			just wondered...what happens?

						FRANCIS (shrugs) 
			Dunno...flameout maybe. Whatever 
			happens, you can bet it's final. 
			But who would want to find out?

One of the doorways brightens and the word ARCADE _ appears on it.
The  two men move to the spot as a maze-car stops. They enter it
through the  doorway which dims behind them as the maze-car WHOOSHES
softly off into a  kind of twilight.

21		INT. - MAZE-CAR - LOGAN AND FRANCIS

The door slides shut. They sink into seat forms which yield to them.
They   move off.
 
22		EXT. - MAZE- CAR

Moving through the city at terrific speed. Giving us glimpses of the
city  as it goes. slowing finally as we see:

23		THE CITY - FEATURING ARCADE

Brightly lit, garish. We get only a glimpse as the maze-car
disappears  into a tunnel.

24		MAZE-CAR STATION - ARCADE

As the maze-car stops, opens and Logan and Francis exit into   a
gathering  CROWD.

25		FULL SHOT - ARCADE

Glittering, crowded. Throngs of people moving on many levels, some
walking, some on moving platforms. It's The Great White Way, Luna
Park --  you name it. Gaudy booths and entrances, featuring every
delight -- too  much to take in at a glance.

26		WITH LOGAN AND FRANCIS

As they thread their way through a crowd which admires them when it
notices them, across halls and up moving platforms, the good-natured
argument continuing...

						LOGAN 
			but you don't know, you Just 
			say what everyone says.  One for 
			one. One for one."

						FRANCIS 
			Well, why no!? That's exactly how
			everything works. How else could 
			the city stay in balance -You have
			a better idea?
 

						LOGAN (laughs)
			No, but at least I wonder sometimes -- 
			instead of doing that "one for one" song 		
			of yours. You sound like a sleepteacher 
			With a stuck tape.

						FRANCIS
			Well the minute you get a better
			idea you can stop wondering.
					(beat)
			You know, Logan -- you wonder 
			a lot. Too much for a Sandman

They are passing the facade of a Relive Shop The signs urging people
to:  RELIVE YOUR MOST PRECIOUS MEMORIES. DO IT AGAIN AND AGAIN!
REFRESH AND  RENEW ANYTIME!!
 
As they cross the entrance, two men come out, grinning broadly,
falling  into step just ahead of Logan and Francis. Then one of the
men stops  abruptly, almost colliding with them. He mumbles an
apology and starts  back to RELIVE.

As he disappears into the RELIVE SHOP, his friend shrugs cheerfully
to  Logan and Francis and moves on.

27		ARCADE - ANOTHER ANGLE - NEW YOU

They are moving past a shop called NEW YOU #483 when a man comes
cannonading out, thrilled and excited. He rushes over to a pretty
young  woman who has been eying Logan and Francis, plants himself in
front of  her with his hands framing his face.

						MAN
			Well? How do you like it?

						WOMAN (critically) 
			I don't know. The cheeks maybe...
			look a little -

						MAN 
			Cheeks? Cheeks? Right. Too much, 
			you think?

						WOMAN 
			Too little.

						MAN 
			Too little?
					(gestures)
			Too little. Okay, wait for me.

And he darts back into NEW YOU #483. The woman shrugs, glances
around,  smiles and goes off with a passer-by.

28		ARCADE - ANOTHER ANGLE - LOVE SHOP

Signs promising LOVE, FULFILLMENT, RARE DELIGHTS. People streaming
in and  out. A woman comes out looking glazed, breathing
"yes...yes..." As she  passes CAMERA Logan and Francis emerge from
the crowd and CAMERA moves  with them.

						LOGAN
			Did you ever see Francis-8?

						FRANCIS (shaking his head) 
			I never even visited Nursery before 
			tonight. 
					(beat) 
			When you wonder, it slows you up --
			you know?

They are now passing the facade of HALLUCIMILL where the signs
promise:  LIFT OFF, CRAZY LIFT, SUPER LIFT...here the people going
in are simply  excited but the ones coming out are clearly stoned
out of their minds...

						FRANCIS 
			I don't know what makes you so curious. 
			You have any idea who his seed-mother was?

						LOGAN (quickly) 
			Of course not! I m curious, not sick.
					(laughs)

The crowd is growing denser, funneling into a kind of passageway.
Logan  and Francis are swallowed up in the group.

29		FULL SHOT - ARCADE GREAT HALL

An immense room into which the streams of people coming from the
entertainment area are mingling. There is a general air of
anticipation  stirring the crowd as CAMERA singles out Logan and
Francis entering,  waving to friends. CAMERA closes in on them just
as they reach a  beautiful woman who is obviously pleased to see
Francis. They embrace,  and as they break:

						FRANCIS
			and that's my friend, Logan. 
					(as she acknowledges 
					the introduction)
			We're celebrating his next in line.
			Carousel - Arcade - who knows? 
			Want to come along?

						WOMAN (smiles, shakes her head)
			Only if I make it to the top of
			Carousel.
					(she holds up her hand)
			Thirty -- and the big spin.

In her palm the crystal blinks, red, black. Francis nods, gives her
a  half-squeeze.

						FRANCIS 
			You're thirty -- already? I always 
			thought I was older than you - 
					(beat)
			Well, give it a good try.

						WOMAN (pleasantly) 
			You know I always have.

Another beautiful WOMAN joins them.

						2ND WOMAN (to the first) 
			Sorry I won't be at Carousel tonight. 
			It¹s  my Love-Shop turn.

						WOMAN
			That's all right. Happy turn.

						2ND WOMAN
			You'll renew. I've got a feeling.

 						WOMAN (smiles) 
			So do I...but if I don't at least I'll 
			have the ultimate thrill. I'd almost 
			rather have that than renew.

						2ND WOMAN 
			I feel the same way. Sometimes I think 
			I'm not even going to try and renew when 
			my time comes. But -- that's three years away.
			So long.

The 2nd Woman walks away.

						FRANCIS (after a beat; 
					to first Woman) 
 			It's been nice.

						WOMAN
			Um-huh.

They look briefly and then she turns away. Francis takes Logan's arm
and  they move off.
 
						FRANCIS
			I guess you never had her?

Logan shakes his head.

						FRANCIS
			You missed something special.

						LOGAN
			Well...you can't have them all.

						LOGAN AND FRANCIS 
					(together, it's an old joke)
 			But you can try.

They laugh, but the laughter is broken as a trio of youngsters,
moving  with erratic speed of lightning, smashes between them,
almost knocking  Francis over. He reels, Logan catches him and they
recover in time to see   the trio rip wildly through the crowd,
knocking people down, screaming  with shrill joy as they disappear.

						FRANCIS 
			The damned Yellows are getting out 
			of hand. Those three ought to be in 
			Cathedral. No business scrambling in 
			Arcade...

						LOGAN (laughs 
					cuffs Francis' arm)
			What an old, old man you're getting 
			to be, Francis. Weren't you ever a 
			Yellow? I bet you were even wilder 
			than -
					(he breaks off as the lights 
					in the Great Hall dim) 
			-- come on, Sandman.

The two of them start to move to the far end of the Great Hall.
 
30		FULL SHOT - GREAT HALL

As everyone begins to move to the far end, where great  curtains
have parted to reveal

31		ARCADE GREAT HALL - CAROUSEL ENTRANCE

AC the far end of the hall, where the throng is a huge crystal
design ornaments an entrance  The crystal is red and pulsing
rhythmically to the accompaniment of a deep and thrilling  TONE. As
we move toward it with Logan and Francis, the TONE  deepens, the
great pulse takes on a hypnotic quality...

32		WITH LOGAN AND FRANCIS

In the crowd they overtake a fellow Sandman,  DANIEL, and fall in
step with him. When they  speak now, their voices are hushed.
	
						LOGAN 
			You should have been with us in Nursery,  
			Daniel. I'm positive I  recognized him -

						FRANCIS (hustling
					Logan)
			Come on. I don't want to miss the
			filing-in. There'll be some I know
			tonight, I think...

						DANIEL (glances at his
					own red crystal, nods)
			Yes. Me, too. You know we're
			both on Monitor tonight.
	
						FRANCIS
			Damn! That's right. Just when I
			feel like an ALL OUT BLAST in
			Arcade .
	
						LOGAN
			Want me to take your shift? I'm
			feeling restless anyway
		
Francis glances at him, exchanges a look with Daniel. They vanish
into the throng passing under the great crystal, turn the corner and
we see

33		FULL SHOT - CAROUSEL

framed in a huge corridor we see a steep-sided  arena dropping down
to a shadowy center, which  even now pulsates and flickers in
changing  dimensions, but always maintaining the jewel- flower
shape. There is one entrance into the center -- a kind of ramp from
below the seats, leading directly into the mysterious bowl --	
Just now the seat's are filling, and the sense of expectation builds
People sit and immediately crane their necks, waiting...

34.		ANOTHER ANGLE

Featuring Logan and Francis as they find places in the arena. Like
the others, they crane upward. As they do, Logan gestures at a
number of pretty girls who are just being seated.

						LOGAN 
			Now there's a few who could have been 
			his seed-mother.
	
						FRANCIS 
			Only a few? You're just not trying.

35-36	    OUT

37		PANNING THE CROWD

As the seats fill, the excitement builds. Suddenly the lights begin
to dim and dim...

SOUND: A kind of collective sigh, breathing in unison...

38 		OUT

38X1		ANGLE THE TIER BELOW THE SEATS

Suddenly visible, the LASTDAY GROUP. Their arms are upraised and in
each palm the crystal blinks red-black, red-black.

39		THE CROWD	

Transfixed, gripped with a religious fervor.

40		LASTDAY GROUP	

Hands still raised, filing slowly into the mysterious well of
Carousel.

41		CROWD

Tense, beginning nervous APPLAUSE here and there.

42		CAROUSEL

As the last one enters, beginning to glow and, as it does, the bowl
slowly puts out leaves like some great plant, enfolding and hiding
the people within a series of translucent petals. As the Last one
enfolds them the Light intensifies, the exterior surfaces seeming to
shift as if a kind of motion was beginning inside it...

43		CROWD

Visible in the growing Light from Carousel -gripped with passion and
excitement, APPLAUDING, gesturing as they see

44		CAROUSEL

Moving, bands of light seeming to spiral upward Like a contained
aurora as the Carousel picks up speed.

45		LOGAN

Caught up in it Like the rest.

46		CAROUSEL

Beginning to blur with its own speed. Through the shifting,
spiraling curtain of light we see bodies moving in a kind of
weightlessness, always struggling to move higher.

Follow a shadowy form as it moves, twists through other writhing
shadows -- upward, upward. Suddenly the form is spread-eagled, and
in a moment it is sharply outlined against the swirling canopy and
then -- a searing flash. And it is gone.
		
SOUND: Crowd in a frenzy -- SCREAMING.

47		FULL ANGLE - THE BLEACHER CROWD - FAVORING LOGAN

Standing. SCREAMING their cheers as:

48		FULL SHOT - UP AT CAROUSEL

High, reaching downward out of the shadows beneath the dome,
fringing, intersecting rainbow bands appear, looping the swirling
upper Carousel like Saturn's rings. Now we see figures reaching
outward toward them...reaching and missing and falling -downward
against the curtain and the flash of extinction.

49		MEDIUM ANGLE - A MAN		

At the highest level...straining for the rainbow...

50		SWEEPING PAN SHOT - THE BLEACHER CROWD	

Hysterical...starting to chant...

						CROWD 
			Renew!

The man continues to strain:

						CROWD 
			Renew!

51		CLOSE ANGLE - THE MAN		

Almost a blur...but still straining:
		
						CROWD'S CHANT
			Renew!

52		CLOSE ON - LOGAN AND FRANCIS

						LOGAN AND FRANCIS
					(chanting with the rest) 
			Renew!

53		CLOSE ANGLE - THE MAN		

The blur...but still there...straining with all his might for the
rainbow...

						CROWD'S CHANT 
			Re...

Suddenly, the man...topples into the whirling blackness
below...where he is instantly incinerated.

54		WIDE ANGLE - THE CAROUSEL	

Whirling - whirling - the rainbows shining.

55		WIDE ANGLE - THE BLEACHERS		

Orgiastic pleasure -- a Spanish crowd at a perfect killing --
SCREAMING, fulfilled.

56 		OUT

57		FULL ANGLE - THE CAROUSEL
Other figures move to the topmost level...straining for the rainbow
bands.

58		CLOSE ON - LOGAN AND FRANCIS			

As the SCREAMING goes on in the b.g. of the SHUT... we hear a
BUZZING noise. Logan reaches into a pocket and takes out a small,
dark plastic box.

Logan looks at the box. On it we see:

			MAN: RELIVE STORE 14		
			
					 	LOGAN 
					(to Francis)	
			Looks like I'm working.
		
Francis stands.
		
						LOGAN
			Who invited you?

						FRANCIS
			I'm in my party mood.
		
Logan smiles . . . and the CAMERA PANS them rushing out of the
bleachers.

They make their way into the hall.

Logan takes out the small plastic box. We can tell from his face
that he is disappointed...until a faint BEEPING SOUND emanates from
the box.

Francis watches as Logan wheels in one direction... the beeping
stops. He turns in another direction... again, there is no beeping.

As Logan turns in a third direction...the BEEPING commences.
Logan and Francis move swiftly in that direction and the BEEPING
GROWS LOUDER...AND LOUDER...until Logan and Francis see:

59-
59X11	    WIDE ANGLE - A MAN 		

running.

CHASE: INTER CUT between Logan and Francis following the running man
in the great hall...empty. We can HEAR the CROWD SCREAMING in
Carousel offstage.

A. Logan and Francis separate...to encircle the running man.

B. The running man turns a corner and for a moment Logan cannot see
him.

C. As Logan turns the corner...Francis is on the other side and
FIRES at the running man...JUST MISSING HIM.

D.Francis winks at Logan as he pursues the running man up a ramp
and Logan gets it:  A little cat and mouse is in order.	

(NOTE: THE CHASE WILL BE THE DIRECTOR'S OPTION.)

E. Logan FIRES... just missing the man...Francis FIRES again. . .
just missing, too.

F. The man is in a panic as he continues up the ramp...to various
levels and areas.

G. Both barrels (of Logan and Francis' respective guns) glow again
as they FIRE...with both just missing the running man once more.

H. The man's face is crazed...and sweating...the mouse is going
berserk as he has been chased to a high level.

I. He stands frozen, petrified, driven to the edge of a high balcony
by the shots--teetering now. He is in full sight of Logan, Francis
is across the hall.

J. The Runner¹s face. He looks at death twenty feet away--Logan
aims.

K. Francis, watching, smiling at the perfect moment.

L. Logan's face. A shadow of thought, a hesitation.

M. The Runner lunges. Logan fires, misses.

N. Francis fires a salvo, drives the Runner back to the rail where
he teeters again, throws his hands in front of his face and plunges.
The SCREAMING in Carousel reaches a peak.

59X12-
63X1		    OUT

63X2		WITH LOGAN	

As he arrives at the dead body of the Runner, bends over him, turns
the man's left hand up. We see the flower crystal. Black.
Logan takes out his transceiver.

63X3		INSERT TRANSCEIVER			

A man's face visible. Logan checks it against the face of the dead
man. They are not the same.
	
63X4		ANOTHER ANGLE	

As Francis comes up, waits. Logan moves the transceiver to the dead
man's face, rests it on his forehead.

63X5		INSERT TRANSCEIVER READOUT:

The words appear: IDENT. AFFIRM....NEW YOU #483 ALTERATION

63X6		LOGAN

Scowls for a moment, then shrugs. He takes out a small flat pouch
and methodically strips from the body its few personal things,
stuffs them into the pouch. Then his eye is caught by the man's
right hand, clenched. Logan opens it. A metal ankh on a bit of
chain. It means nothing to Logan who stuffs it into the pouch and
closes it. Now again he fiddles with the transceiver, speaks into it
softly.

						LOGAN
			Runner terminated 0:31
					(a beat)
			Ready for cleanup.

Done with his job, he rises to face Francis.

						LOGAN 
					(smiling)
			That was a great shot you made.
	
						FRANCIS
			Yes.
					(beat)
			But you look a little rusty to me --
			what were you doing, wondering?

Logan shrugs. He's not sure himself. Together they walk off down the
hall, passing CAMERA
	
63X7		ANOTHER ANGLE

We see in the distance, a pair of Stickmen descending into the hall,
riding through the air on their odd vehicles, passing overhead then
descending. One hovers not far away as the other comes down, hangs a
few feet over the body.

63X8		1ST STICKMAN AND BODY	

The driver makes sure he's in position, then presses a button on one
of the arms of the vehicle. There is a broad spray of vapor from the
bottom which covers the corpse.	
					
63X9		CORPSE (INSERT)

It turns to crystals which sag away from the human form, as a sand
sculpture erodes when it's dry.

63X10		1ST STICKMAN CLOSE ON HEAP OF CRYSTALS

Satisfied, he revs his machine and it rises smoothly out of the
SHOT. As it leaves, the second machine moves down and into its
place.
		
63X11		2ND STICKMAN

Glances at the crystals, maneuvers into position, presses his
buttons.
			
63X12		CLOSER ANGLE - THE CRYSTALS, STICKMAN

Sucked up into the machine as it hovers. As the floor is once again
bare, the 2nd Stickman revs slightly and his machine pulls up and
away.
			
63X13		ANOTHER ANGLE	

As the Stickmen move up and out, we see the exhilarated crowd
beginning to pour out of Carousel.

63X14		LOGAN AND FRANCIS - ARCADE

Descending from the top level -- not much of a crowd. Francis is
gesturing toward the Hallucimill.

						FRANCIS 
			...Well I think you're getting stale. 
			You need old Lucey--Go on. Gee the whole 
			burn--try the new psycho-lift-they tell 
			me it turns you inside out...

He shoves Logan in that direction and continues on down.

						FRANCIS 
					(calling after him)
			I'll look for you here when I'm off--

And he is gone.
	
63X15		LOGAN

waves, smiling, then turns to the Hallucimill.

63X16		POV - HALLUCIMILL EXT.

Crazy, man.

63X17		BACK TO LOGAN	

Hesitates, as a COUPLE push past him gleefully on their way. He
looks and we see:
		
63X18		POV - ARCADE, UPPER LEVELS	

The people from Carousel starting to pour in, loud, happy, ready for
more fun.

63X19		LOGAN		
Not with it. He turns and starts making his way downwards towards
the exit.

63X20		LOGAN'S APARTMENT	

As he enters. Idle, restless. He crosses to a sideboard--makes
himself a drink, sips, doesn't like it. Gets rid of it, makes
another. He fiddles with things, a game--sits, gets up. Now he is
beginning to feel the drink. Takes another belt, smiles. Now he goes
over to a tall wall recess flanked by a console with many dials.

63X21		AT THE WALL RECESS		

As Logan dials, blurred and smoky images appear in the recess--a
slow protoplasmic eddying in many colors. He tunes it in and the
figure of a smiling young man appears--bejeweled, lustrous, willing.

63X22		LOGAN AT THE CONSOLE	

Bored as Mastroianni turns the dial again and the young man
dissolves. He dials again and now a beautiful young woman takes
shape. It is Jessica.
		
63X23		JESSICA AND LOGAN

Still in the recess, she makes no gesture of interest, no smile.
Around her neck, from a collar, a dangling ankh. It catches Logan's
eye. He smiles, clicks another dial and she becomes real. He reaches
out a hand and leads her out into the room.

64		LOGAN AND JESSICA

As Jessica turns to him, Logan moves in strongly and embraces her-
but, to his surprise, she resists. Logan, still holding her loosely,
is amused and surprised.

						LOGAN
			What's wrong, Available?

						JESSICA 
					(breaking away gently) 
			Please . . .No.

She backs away, almost apologetically. Logan follows, smiling.

						LOGAN
			Please . . . no ?
					(noting that she looks trapped,
					he understands)
			You mean "not here"--that's it?
			You're a private Available but
			particular,
					(he is moving in on her
					as he speaks, she retreating, 
					which amuses him)
			Don't worry. There's no one here but me. 
			And you.

						JESSICA 
			No. 
					(that stops him) 
			Just no.

						LOGAN 
			You prefer women?

						JESSICA 
			No.

						LOGAN
			Well then...?

						JESSICA
			Nothing. I felt sad, I put myself
			on the circuit. It was a mistake.

						LOGAN 
			Sad? What made you sad?
	
						JESSICA 		
			A friend of mine went on Carousel		
			tonight. Now he's gone.	
		
						LOGAN 
					(after a beat)
			Yes...probably he was renewed?

						JESSICA 
					(flatly)
			He was killed

						LOGAN
			Killed? Why do you use that word?

						JESSICA
			Isn't it right? Isn't that what
			you do? Kill.

						LOGAN
			I never 'killed' anybody in my life.
			Sandmen terminate  Runners
					(a beat)
			Who brought you?

						JESSICA 
			Nobody. I felt sad. .. I put myself
			on the circuit.

						LOGAN
			You felt sad. What's your name?

						JESSICA
			Jessica.

						LOGAN 
					(matter-of-fact)
			You're beautiful. Let's have sex.
	
						JESSICA
			No.
		
						LOGAN
			Later.

						JESSICA
			No.	

						LOGAN
			But you put yourself on the circuit!

						JESSICA
			I thought I had to do something.
		
						LOGAN			
			And?				

						JESSICA
			I changed my mind

						LOGAN
			And now?
	
						JESSICA
			Curious.

						LOGAN
			About what?
							
						JESSICA
			How a Sandman lives.

Logan smiles, takes off gunbelt, etc.

						LOGAN
			Let's have sex.
					(as Jessica shakes her head)
			I thought you were curious.
						
						JESSICA
			Not about that.

						LOGAN 
					(after a beat)
			I'm listening.

						JESSICA
			I'm afraid to tell you.

						LOGAN 
					(smiling)
			I'm not armed.
					(a beat)
			Well?

						JESSICA
			Why is it wrong to run?				

						LOGAN
			You shouldn't even think such things...
					(smiles)
			And you picked a strange person to
			say them to - 
		
						JESSICA
			I suppose. But what if you want
			to live?

						LOGAN
			So? Do what everyone does. Try
			like hell for renewal.

Logan stretches out his right hand. We see a red flower crystal
embedded and centered in his right palm. It is exactly the same
shape that we have seen in black in the palm of the dead runner.

						LOGAN
			When this turns black...that's it.
					(laughs) 
			If for any reason you want to be 31...
			you have the same chance as everyone 
			else...Carrousel.

Logan takes his gun and points it at her.

						LOGAN 		(playfully) 
			But if you're one of the misfits... 
			that's where I come in.

						JESSICA (somewhat
					frightened)
			I didn't say that I would run...
			I Just...

						LOGAN (interrupting;
					turning over her palm)
			Are you a 5 or a 6?
					(we see a green crystal)

						JESSICA
			Six. I go red next year.

						LOGAN
			You're years away . . . I don't know
			why you're thinking of these things,
			much less talking about them.
					(offering Jessica the gun) 
			Want to try?

Jessica shakes her head. Logan looks at Jessica carefully...in an
admiring sexual way...from her toes to her head...briefly noticing
(in the process) chat she is wearing an identical piece of jewelry
that he has taken off the dead runner...around her neck.

						LOGAN
			What Quad do you live in?

						JESSICA 
			K.

						LOGAN (softly)
			You're sure you don't want to try?

Jessica nods.

						LOGAN 	
			It's nice to know you can nod.	

Jessica smiles.

						LOGAN
			It's nice co know you can do that,
			too.
	
Suddenly Francis and two dishevel led young WOMEN burst in and come
laughing toward Logan and Jessica Stoned, hilarious, they crowd
around Logan one of them embracing him. In the wild hilarity,
Jessica slips away and Logan, seeing her go, makes a vain effort
after her. Francis notices, laughs. Amid the noise he shouts to
Logan:
	
						FRANCIS
			These are for me -- you've got your
			own.
					(looking after Jessica)
			She must have been something--?
	
At Logan's expression he roars with laughter Francis picks up an
atomizer and hurls it at the ceiling where it shatters and a great
pink cloud settles over them all.

64X1		EXT. - SAND MAN H.Q.

A frowning structure of dark stone and mirrored copper, fronted by
broad steps. Logan and Francis are climbing the steps as a SANDMAN
is coming out... His uniform is in tatters. They greet one another...then:

						LOGAN
			What happened to you?

						SANDMAN (embarrassed)
			I lost a Runner in Cathedral.

						LOGAN
			How come?

						SANDMAN
			Ran into some Cubs I couldn't manage. 
					(as they stare)
			One of them cut me bad... 
					(extends his arm and moves 
					a finger from his shoulder to 
					his wrist)
			all the way down.
					
						FRANCIS
					(with anger)	
			CUBS!	
		
						SANDMAN (shrug)
			On my way to the New You for repairs.

						LOGAN 
			Get yourself a new face while you're 
			at it They know you now.

They wave. Logan and Francis continue.

64AX1-
64BX1	    OUT
		
64CX1		INT. - SANDMAN H.Q. LOBBY (VOICE OVER)

As Logan and Francis cross, turn into a corridor.
		
						LOGAN
			I just might look in on New You 483
			myself.

						FRANCIS 
			You? Why? You're already beautiful.

						LOGAN 
			No -- it's that last Runner -- someone 
			in 483 was trying to help him.

64X2		INT. - SANDMAN H.Q. - READY ROOM

As Logan and Francis cross the room, Logan nods to other Sandmen,
who are monitoring areas of the Megalopolis on video consoles. One
of these Sand-men speaks to Francis who hasn't greeted them

					SANDMAN (Monitor)
			What's with you, Francis?
	
					FRANCIS (touching his
				head; grimacing)
			Last night
		
The other Sandmen, including Logan, smile as Logan and Francis
continue to:

65-68	OUT

69		INT. - SANDMAN H.Q. - DEBRIEFING AREA

Black door opens revealing Logan and Francis who now enter a mammoth
room. As they walk. . . they pass FOUR GIANT LIFECLOCKS...WHITE,
YELLOW GREEN AND RED.
 	  
Each LIFECLOCK pulses out the moments of every person alive in the
city, governing everyone's crystal changes automatically shifting to
the next LIFECLOCK when the time comes.

There are no humans.

Francis walks over to a circular table at the end of the room....
above which is a circular overhang. There is a groove...the shape of
a palm crystal on one part of the circular table.

Francis takes out the plastic bag which contains the contents of the
dead Runner's pockets and starts putting the contents on the table.
(These contents are the ones from the Runner Francis has killed at
the beginning of the film.)

The moment the first item touches the table...it activates a scanner
on the overhang above.	
			
Francis stands alongside the table...his attitude is very matter-of
fact. He has been through this procedure many, many times.
He touches his head...(the hangover)...and Logan smiles. Moments
later...the scanner stops...the word:
	|	
			IDENTIFY

appears on a SCREEN. Francis places his palm into the groove. . .
and the words:
	
			CLEAR
			FRANCIS-7

appear on the SCREEN.

						FRANCIS
			See you in the hydrotoner!
		
Logan nods.

Francis exits as Logan places the contents of a plastic bag with the
items he has taken off the Runner who jumped to his death. Among
them is the odd-shaped piece of jewelry.

Logan is standing nonchalantly...as the scanner moves over the
items...waiting to be quickly identified and cleared as Francis was
earlier.

The scanner continues scanning.

Logan starts becoming impatient...but the scanning goes on and on
and on.

Now...Logan is clearly puzzled...it has never...ever taken anything
remotely resembling this length of time.

Suddenly, directly before him...on the SCREEN... the word:

		PROBABILITY

blinks on and off...on and off...catching Logan's attention. As
Logan turns toward the SCREEN...the scanner stops moving. The word
PROBABILITY blinks off and is replaced by the word:
	
		APPROACH

We can tell from Logan's expression as he walks to the corner. . .
that he has never seen this before.
		
Logan sits in a chair in the area facing the SCREEN. There is a
stellar groove (that we have seen on the Table) the shape of a palm
crystal....glowing on an arm of the chair.

The word on the SCREEN is now:

		IDENTIFY

Logan places his right palm with the flower crystal into the groove.
We hear a HUMMING NOISE....then: The piece of jade Jewelry appears
on the SCREEN and below the piece of jewelry the following words
appear on the SCREEN:

		OBJECT OCCURS IN NONRANDOM 
		PATTERN AND FREQUENCY. LINKED 
		WITH OBSOLETE WORD: SANCTUARY. 
		PROBABLE EXISTENCE ESTABLISHED. 
		QUESTION: IDENTIFY OBJECT?

						LOGAN
			Negative. Question: What is it?
	
Words on SCREEN now read:

		PREMILLENNIAL SYMBOL.
		NAME: ANKH. QUESTION:
		IDENTIFY CONCEPT SANCTUARY?

						LOGAN
			Negative.

Words on SCREEN now read:

		SANCTUARY: CODE WORD PREMILL-
		ENNIAL RELIGIONS DENOTING 
		PLACE OF IMMUNITY.

						LOGAN
			I don't understand?

Words on SCREEN now read:

		SANCTUARY NOW MATHEMATICALLY 
		RELATED TO UNACCOUNTED 
		CITIZENS NUMBERING 1056.
			
						LOGAN
			Question:

Word on SCREEN now reads:	

		HOLD
	
It disappears and words on SCREEN now read:

		OBJECT ANKH ASSOCIATED 
		WITH UNACCOUNTED CITIZENS 1056. 
		CONCLUSION SANCTUARY EXISTENT.... 
		RUNNER GOAL.

						LOGAN 
			1056 unaccounted for?!

Word on SCREEN reads:

		CORRECT

						LOGAN
			Impossible!
					(Rising tone) 
			Question: Maybe they weren't all Runners. 
			Maybe most of them reached Life Renewal 
			on Carousel.

Words on SCREEN read:

		NEGATIVE...UNACCOUNTED
		CITIZENS 1056...

						LOGAN 
			Question: None of them reached renewal?

Word on SCREEN reads:

		ZERO

						LOGAN
			But everyone believes that some....

Words on SCREEN read:

		ANSWER: ZERO
		UNACCOUNTED CITIZENS
		NUMBER 1056....LOGAN-
		5 ASSIGNED TO LOCATE
		SANCTUARY AND REPORT....

						LOGAN 
			Question: You mean nobody's ever 
			been renewed?

Words on SCREEN read:

		- - QUESTION ANSWERED....
		ZERO....ECOLOGICAL-NEGATIVE...

As Logan reacts the new words which appear read:	
			
		AUTHORIZATION TO	
		PENETRATE CITY SEALS...

						LOGAN (startled)
			The Seal......
					(Breaks off)
			Question: The Seals? Go outside?!
			But there's nothing outside!

The words on the SCREEN read:

		SANCTUARY DESTRUCT...
		FIND		
		DESTROY

						LOGAN
			I will.
	
The words on the SCREEN read:

		ASSIGNMENT SECRET.

						LOGAN
			Question:
					(a beat)
			What if I need help from another
			Sandman?

The words on the SCREEN read:

		NEGATIVE. REPEAT: ASSIGNMENT 
		SECRET. LOGAN-5 TRANSFER TO 
		RUNNER SEEKING SANCTUARY.
		
Logan takes a breath.

						LOGAN
			Question: I am six Red...how can
			I pretend to be approaching Lastday?

The words on the SCREEN read:

		LIFECLOCK--ALTER

						LOGAN
			My Lifeclock...
					(slightest beat)
			Question: My Life-- 

Before the startled Logan can finish...he feels a shock of pain and
his hand is immobile. Logan stares at the back of his hand as if it
wasn't his. His forehead shines with sweat.

Now the entire area, including the chair and the screen begins to
glow bright red. The glowing becomes so bright that Logan is forced
to close his eyes.

As the glow subsides...Logan looks at his right hand. The red flower
crystal in his palm is blinking. He stares at it, fascinated,
fearful.
			
						LOGAN
			Question:
					(urgent tone)
			Am I still six Red?
			
The words on the SCREEN read:

		LIFECLOCK-ALTER

						LOGAN (standing)
			I know that but I had four more years
				(extending the blinking palm)
			This means ten days to Lastday.
			Of course I will get the four years
			back, won't I?

The words on the SCREEN read:

		TAKE OBJECT WITH YOU

						LOGAN (very urgent) 
			Question: Do I get my four years back?

Too late. The SCREEN is BLANK. For a moment his lips part as if to
say something more but he changes his mind, turns away.

Now Logan walks over to the table and removes the ankh. Almost
automatically, he starts moving his hand toward the groove...but the
SCREEN already has the words:

		CLEAR LOGAN-5

Logan looks at it - then:

The CAMERA PANS Logan out of the mammoth room.... past the GIANT
LIFECLOCKS....where he pauses.... glances at his BLINKING
CRYSTAL....and continues out into:

69X1		INT. - HYDROTONER - DAY	

Spectacularly 23rd century. Logan enters. He looks around and spots
Francis.... in a whirlpool bath....trying to recover from has
incredible hangover.

In the b.g. of the SHOT we can see some Sandmen doing calisthenics.
Logan walks over to Francis....hiding his blinking crystal by
holding his hand against his leg.
						
						FRANCIS
			What the hell took you so long?

						LOGAN 
					(after a beat) 
			Did you ever see anybody renew?

						FRANCIS 
			I think you've been skulling out too 
			much. First Nursery and now stupid 
			questions.

						LOGAN 
			Did you?

						FRANCIS 
			Of course.

						LOGAN 
			Anybody we know?

						FRANCIS 
			Look....why don't you get into the 
			water....you need it....more than I do.

						LOGAN 
					(after a beat) 
			I'm fine....
					(walking away)
			See you....

						FRANCIS 
			At Carousel tonight?

Logan nods, exits. The CAMERA REMAINS on a slightly puzzled FRANCIS
for a moment then FOLLOW Logan out to:

70		EXT. - SANDMAN BUILDING	

Logan is on the steps, irresolute. He looks at his blinking
crystal...moves as if to reenter, changes his mind. Now takes out
the black box, dials.

						LOGAN 
					(into box)
			Location...female Green Six...
			name Jessica...living in Quad K.

71-73 	OUT

73X1		INT. - LOGAN'S APARTMENT	

Logan opens the door to see Jessica. Behind her a young SANDMAN who
has obviously escorted her there.

						YOUNG SANDMAN (smiling)
			She says she's been here before...

						LOGAN
			She has.

Jessica half turns and shrugs a 'see?'. The young Sandman's smile
widens, he waves to Logan and shoves off.

						JESSICA
			You could have called me yourself.

						LOGAN
			But I wasn't sure you'd come.

						JESSICA 
					(the game has started)
			Here I am. 
					(beat)
			Shall I come in?

Logan gestures, leading her inside to the living area.

						LOGAN
			I couldn't get you out of my mind.

						JESSICA
			I'm the most beautiful woman you've
			ever seen, I suppose?

						LOGAN
			Maybe...sure....

						JESSICA
			Thanks...but I have the choice.
				
						LOGAN	
			Of course.		
						
						JESSICA	
			Then it's still no.

Logan laughs.

						JESSICA	
			You can have any woman in the city.				
			What do you really want?				

						LOGAN
			You know

						JESSICA
			I don't believe you. There has to
			be more.

						LOGAN
			All right.

Logan extends his right hand. He turns his right palm so that.
Jessica can see it blinking red.

Jessica gasps for a moment...then:

						JESSICA
			Why show me?

						LOGAN
			I'm going to run.

						JESSICA (after
					reacting)
			Why tell me?

						LOGAN
			You know something.
	
						JESSICA
			About running, dying what?

						LOGAN
			Both...running's what I'm interested
			in.

						JESSICA
			I know what everyone knows. Try
			like hell for Renewal. You have
			the same chance everyone else has.

						LOGAN
			It's different now. Help me.

						JESSICA
			How can I?

Logan takes out the ankh.

						JESSICA
			Where did you get that?

						LOGAN
			A Runner gave it to me.

						JESSICA 	
			And then you killed him, right?				

						LOGAN
			I let him go...believe me.

						JESSICA
			I don't..

						LOGAN (a beat)
			Speak to your friends for me, Jessica...
			please...

						JESSICA
			Please? What friends?

						LOGAN 
				(clutching the ankh, looking 
				at Jessica's; then:)
			I don't have much time.

						JESSICA
			I never heard of a Sandman running
			. . . ever. . .

						LOGAN (putting the
			ankh in his pocket;
			dropping the bombshell)
			And I never heard of Sanctuary.

Jessica reacts. She is about to speak. . .doesn't..

Logan reaches out and touches her hand.

						LOGAN
			What can I do to make you believe me?

Jessica draws her hand away quickly from his touch.

Logan stands and starts out...as Jessica watches him..

74-81	OUT 

82		EXT. - A SLEEK, OUTDOOR RESTAURANT - NIGHT

There are three men and a woman seated at a table. Jessica reaches
the table and sits down.

83		CLOSE ON - LOGAN	

A distance away...watching.

84-85 	OUT	 

86		EXT. - RESTAURANT - FULL ANGLE - THE THREE MEN,
		WOMAN AND JESSICA

Eating without enthusiasm...obviously more interested in their
conversation.

						SECOND MAN 
			He's blinking...so what? Sandmen get 
			old, too.

						FIRST MAN
			But what if he's telling the truth?

						THIRD MAN
			I say no. It's not worth the risk.

						WOMAN
			I absolutely agree. He's killed Runners 
			for a decade. He has no feelings.

						JESSICA
			He was born a Sandman. He had no
			choice.

						WOMAN 
			Neither do we.

87-88 	OUT

88X1		SANDMAN READY ROOM	

Four Sandmen at the consoles. They look up as Francis enters. He 
goes to one of the men who stretches, yawns, gets up.
		
						1ST SANDMAN
			Thanks, Francis.
		
						FRANCIS (taking his
					place at the console)
			Just don't be forever about it like last 
			time.

						1ST SANDMAN
			Ah-h you love it. You're afraid
			you'll miss a really good Run.		

They all laugh. Francis takes up his watch as the other exits.

89 OUT

89X1		EXT - RESTAURANT - THREE MEN A WOMAN AND JESSICA

Leaning together talking in an undertone
			
						SECOND MAN (urgently)	
			If he believes you, he'll come.	
			
						JESSICA	
			Why Arcade Station?
			
						SECOND MAN (impatiently)
			Why? It's our only chance--kill him
			and get away in the crowd heading
			for the evening slaughter --
				
						JESSICA
			Right at the station itself?

						MAN
			No - just there - on the first level.
					(beat)
			Don't look for us. We'll see you.

						WOMAN (cutting in)
			You don't seem quite sure, Jessica.
					(beat)
			Can you do it? Will you?

Slowly, Jessica nods.

						THIRD MAN
			Tonight?

						JESSICA (stalling)
			Y-yes...if I can find him.

						WOMAN
			I think you can. Don't you?

Jessica faces her squarely, nods. The woman looks deeply into her
eyes, relaxes.

						WOMAN  
			I'm sorry. We all are. But he has heard 
			about Sanctuary -- and that makes him 
			dangerous to all of us.

After murmurs of agreement:

						SECOND MAN 
					(staring at Jessica) 
			We're counting on you.

Jessica exits. They look at each other in dismay.. After a moment,
one of the men follows her. They don't trust her.

90-92	OUT

93-94 	OUT

94A1		READY ROOM - FRANCIS	

Obviously enjoying the work, watching--tracking a Runner's progress,
the assignment of a Sandman, the kill.
	
94X1		WITH JESSICA		

Making her way through the strolling crowd, her face thoughtful.

94X2		ANOTHER ANGLE

The man from the restaurant, following.

94X3		GALLERY, SANDMAN RESIDENCE -- JESSICA

Walking slowly up to a door, she hesitates, KNOCKS.

Logan opens the door, reacts.

						LOGAN
			Are you here to help me?
	
						JESSICA
			What do you need?

A moment, then Logan moves toward her hungrily, pulling her in to
him as the door closes.

94X4 	OUT

DISSOLVE TO:
		
94X5		WITH LOGAN AND JESSICA

Walking along a handsomely landscaped stream. Laughing together,
stopping to admire the beautiful fish (koi).

						JESSICA
			What're you going to do?

						LOGAN
			That's tomorrow.

						JESSICA 
					(turning away slightly)
			I wish I could help you.

						LOGAN 
					(turning her gently back)
			Maybe you'll chink of something...

						JESSICA 
					(hating herself)		
			I wish I knew what you think I know.		

Logan smiles at her, both knowing what's false, but drawn to each
other anyhow. They commence walking again.
		
94X6		ANOTHER ANGLE		

The followers, ahead now, watching, trying to make up their minds as
to whether Jessica is bringing Logan to the ambush. As they argue,
Logan and Jessica approach.

94X7		WITH LOGAN AND JESSICA	

						LOGAN
			If you did know, you'd tell me.
					
						JESSICA
			Of course--

						LOGAN (overriding)
			If you trusted me, you'd know.
				
						JESSICA (evading it)
			We're coming to Arcade.
					(beat)	-
			Shall we Relive together?
	
94X8		CLOSE ANGLE

As they pass, Jessica looks full in the face of one of the
followers, looks away. Logan does not notice. The followers are
partly reassured. One of the men is now holding a garrote made from
his necklace. The man who first followed gestures and the others go
off purposefully. He continues after Logan and Jessica as they exit
round a corner.

94X9 	OUT

94AX9	READY ROOM	

As 1st Sandman returns, still cheerfully chewing. Francis is
reluctant to give up his place and when he does, he remains standing
there, watching. He loves the work--they all do.

94X10	ARCADE - LOWER LEVEL	

Logan and Jessica entering. Logan is aware of Jessica's increasing
tension. He pretends unconcern, but he is wary.

94X11	ANOTHER ANGLE

Behind them, visible through the crowd--two of the men we saw
before. The Follower and the man with the garrote. They are moving
so as to intersect with Logan and Jessica where the crowd is
thickest, streams coming together to move to a higher level.

94X12	FEATURING JESSICA	

As they move, fearful--torn between her promise and her feeling for
Logan. Catching a glimpse of the followers, she makes a small sound,
hesitates, pretends to have stumbled.

94X13	THE AMBUSHERS	

Closer now, closing in -- the wire garrote gleaming between the
man's hands.
	
94X14	LOGAN AND JESSICA	

Suddenly she stops. He comes round facing as people eddy by them.
Logan looks at her searchingly.

						LOGAN 
			Tell me, Jessica.

Behind him the two men move in. The man with the garrote raises his
hands. One more step... Logan senses something, half-turns just as
we hear a familiar urgent SOUND--the sound of his transceiver.
Behind him the man hesitates, drops his hands. Logan takes the
transceiver from his belt and moves out of the crowd to the side,
Jessica with him. Now he bends to read the message and Jessica
cranes her head to see too.
	
94X15	READY ROOM - FRANCIS AND SANDMEN

As the Runner alarm pulses and the readout flashes its message: 

		RUNNER FEMALE: CATHEDRAL Q-2
		...LOGAN-5

The Sandman at the console turns and says:		

						1ST SANDMAN
			Hey, Logan's got a mean one tonight--
			why don't you--

But Francis is already at the door. A wave and he's gone. The others
ad lib interest-- "watch out in there--they can cut you before you
see them" etc.

95-105 	OUT

105X1	ARCADE STATION - THE AMBUSH	

The two watching, muscles taut -- wondering.

106-
106X1	OUT

106X2	ARCADE - TWO SHOT - LOGAN AND JESSICA	

As he speaks he leads her into the maze-car station and punches out
his destination on the car caller.

						LOGAN
			A Runner...Cathedral. A woman.

106X3	MAZE-CAR STATION ARCADE	

						JESSICA
			You're not going, are you?
		
						LOGAN (a beat)
			Why not? Maybe she'll help me.
			You won't. You'd better stay here.

The maze-car arrives and they move to it.
	
						JESSICA (touching his
					arm)
			I'd rather be with you.
	
						LOGAN (knowing she is
					lying through her teeth)
			That's nice.
		
They enter the car which instantly moves off. As it passes, the men
in ambush come forward and read the destination. They ring for
another car which pulls in immediately.

107-
109X1 	OUT
		
109X2	ANOTHER ANGLE	

As the two jam into the maze-car which rockets off in pursuit...

110-
120 		OUT

121		INT - MAZE-CAR - LOGAN AND JESSICA - MOVING SHOT

						LOGAN
			Have you ever been through Cathedral?

Jessica shakes her head.

						LOGAN
			They're like beasts. Wild.
	
						JESSICA		
			Maybe they're angry because they're
			grown in meccano-breeders.

						LOGAN (interrupting,
					grimacing) 
			Instead of what? Nine months inside a 
			woman:
					(ugh) 
			We're all raised the same but most of 
			us don't become cubs in Cathedral.

						JESSICA 
			Some people say children need human 
			mothering.

						LOGAN 
			Insane. Nurseries are better than any 
			mother could be.

						JESSICA 
			I'm only telling you what I've heard...
					(slightest beat) 
			Haven't you ever wondered what your 
			seed-mother was Like...?

						LOGAN 
			Uh-uh.

						JESSICA 
			I have.

						LOGAN 
					(after a beat) 
			When did you begin to question Lastday?

						JESSICA 
			I don't remember exactly...except I was 
			a Green.
					(another beat) 
			What would you like to relive, Logan?

						LOGAN (smiling)
			Let's see - how long has it been?

As Jessica turns her head...looking somewhat guilty, the maze-car
slides to a stop.

A warning light pulses on the car's console and a RECORDED VOICE
speaks before the hatch opens.

						VOICE			
			Attention passengers. Cathedral		
			Station is a personal risk area.	
			Persons with business are warned
			to be careful.

121X1	EXT. - MAZE-CAR - CATHEDRAL STATION	

Now the hatch opens. They step out, Logan first, Jessica timidly,
looking around. Behind them the hatch closes, the maze-car sighs
away into the distance.

						JESSICA
			I've never been in this quadrant.
					(looks off)
			Is that Arcade off there?
		
There are standing on the maze-car platform -- a high overlook like
an "elevated" station.
		
121X2	POV - THE CITY BEYOND THE WALLS OF CATHEDRAL

Arcade shining like distant fireworks.

122		EXT. - MAZE-CAR M PLATFORM - CATHEDRAL

Below them a narrow, sharply angled concrete canyon, buttressed
walls rising featureless. The look of an old fortress, blank, dim
and cool. Still visible over an opening the chiseled legend
"Cathedral Plaza--2025 A.D.--Skidmore, Rosenfelt, Hennesy
architects."

Jessica shivers, looking around her. Logan takes her arm and they
descend into the canyon, move toward the wall. Their footsteps the
only SOUND.

						LOGAN 
			Let me go first. Sometimes they're 
			waiting just inside there--to rush 
			you when it opens...

						LOGAN
			Quickly now--

He helps her through the narrow opening--the portal's walls are very
thick.. They turn abruptly and see:

123		INT. - WALL - DAZZLE CHAMBER

A room of angled, reflecting surfaces. At one end a jagged corridor,
also mirrored, leads away. The zigzag, angled effect creates an
absolute confusion of images. but Logan leads her unhesitatingly
across the chamber to the corridor. Jessica hangs back, momentarily
certain she's about to smash into something.

						LOGAN (guiding her) 
			Just follow--no matter how it seems...

						JESSICA (doing her
					best)
			But what is this--why?
	
						LOGAN (as they enter	
					the corridor)	
			The Cubs. When they're flying on muscle 
			there's  no way to catch up. Without the 
			dazzle, they'd just go past us--
					(gesture)
			too fast

						JESSICA
			Muscle? I don't know that one.
	
Logan is leading her down the zigzag corridor. It's stop and go--a
fun house in which you can get hurt.
	
						LOGAN
			It's unauthorized. No good for any-
			one over thirteen anyhow--shakes you
			to pieces--speeds everything up to a
			blur--
					(he is amused)
			you can see what happens when some
			flying Cub tries to go through this
			on muscle--splat!
	
Jessica reacts...to what Logan has said...then:  A moment later:
	
124		ANOTHER ANGLE	

As they approach the end of the corridor, a small FIGURE in a
tattered garment approaches them. She stops SINGING as she sees
Logan and Jessica.

						JESSICA (gently)
			Don't be afraid.

We see that it is a little GIRL of seven. Her face is grimy and hair
is tangled.

						JESSICA
			What's your name?

						MARY
			I'm Mary 2.

						JESSICA
			Where do you live, Mary?

						MARY
			Here.

						JESSICA			
			Why aren't you in Nursery?			

						MARY
			I'm very smart.

						JESSICA
			When do you go up?

						MARY
			I never go upstairs. You're a
			nice old lady.

As soon as she finishes her last sentence, Mary grabs at Jessica's
clothing...tearing a pin (piece of Jewelry) off...and running away
swiftly.

As Jessica instinctively starts after her...Logan... holds her back.

						LOGAN 
					(shaking his head)
			Not here. Might be a decoy.

Cautiously, Logan and Jessica exit from the wall, stepping out into-

125		EXT. - CATHEDRAL ITSELF

An area of rubble and dilapidated buildings.

Logan crouches, holding the transceiver and fanning the area,
listening...

SOUND: a soft beeping which abruptly grows louder and holds steady.

Logan gestures to Jessica to follow him, and moves carefully in the
direction of the BEEPING, quartering occasionally like a hunting
dog. Coming up to an angle of wall, he stops, flicks the sound off,
puts the machine back onto his belt. He gestures to Jessica to stand
still then he straightens, steps out, calls:

						LOGAN
			Runner!

Silence. Jessica involuntarily moves to him and as she does, the
Runner moves from behind an upright and stands.- The figure is
shadowed, the arms out, palms facing in a kind of gesture of
surrender. In the Runner's left hand, the tiny red crystal pulses on
and off. The Runner is a woman!

There is an instant of frozen confrontation and then suddenly
Jessica gasps, grasping at him.	
		
As Logan whirls:	
		
125X1		ANOTHER ANGLE	

Suddenly, from everywhere out of the shadows, a pack of snarling
Cubs materializes--moving with blinding speed. At their appearance
the Runner whirls and races off into the dark shadows. Logan makes a
futile gesture after her, then turns to face the Cubs.

A strutting, feral-faced fourteen or fifteen year old heads the
pack, dressed in fierce-looking tatters and hung with rip-off
trophies. He gestures to one of his followers to stand still.

						BILLY 
					(speaking of the Runner) 
			Don't worry about her. We'll have that 
			one later. Right now I think we've got 
			a Runner and his pairup. And what a Runner!

The CAMERA PANS the other Cubs...mean, filthy.

						A VOICE 
			We're going to have ourselves a time, 
			we are. Right, Billy?!

There is a chilling laughter of agreement from the rest.

						LOGAN		
			I'm a Sandman!		

						BILLY
			I cut up a Sandman yesterday.  They
			said I'd never get him...but I cut
			him up good, I did.

						LOGAN (firm tone)
			I feel sorry for you, boy!

Some murmuring as the pack watches their leader.

						BILLY
			For me? Better feel sorry for your-
			self, Sandman!

						LOGAN
			No, for you! How old are you, Billy?

Billy is silent.

						LOGAN 
			Fourteen? Fifteen? Your days are running 
			out. How long can you last? A year. Six 
			months?
					(he points to the yellow
					flower in Billy's palm)
			What happens when you're sixteen and
			you go green?

						BILLY (lashing out) 
			Nothing will happen! I make the
			rules as I go!! Cubs do what I say!
			Always have! Always will! I got
			Cathedral and I'll never let go!

						LOGAN 
			No cubs over fifteen, Billy! Ever 
			heard of a cub with a green flower? 
			You'll leave Cathedral then, Billy, 
			when you're on green, because they 
			won't let a green stay here.
					(slightest beat) 
			If you try to stay the young ones will 
			gut-rip you apart!

						BILLY
			Shut up! Shut up your damn mouth!

Logan falls back into a fighting crouch...but before he can strike a
blow..he is grabbed and slammed against the wall of an abandoned
building.

						ANOTHER VOICE	
			Let him suck Muscle! That'll shut	
			his mouth! Let's watch him shake		
			himself to death!!
		
We see the Cubs take out drugpads. They squeeze the pads and inhale
the "Muscle." At once their movements become blurringly rapid. They
take menacing positions - some leaping overhead.
			
						A VOICE
			Give him some Muscle!!
		
Like lightning they change positions and flash around Logan and
Jessica
			
126		CLOSE ON - JESSICA	

Watching..terrified.

127		CLOSE ON - LOGAN
	
Being held against the wall by Cubs as:
				
						ANOTHER VOICE
			Shake him to death!!

						A VOICE 
			Kill him!

128		ANOTHER ANGLE - INCLUDING BILLY
	
moving a drugpad against Logan's face.

Logan is holding his breath...desperately trying not to breathe the
"Muscle" directly from the pad into his system.

						BILLY (chilling laugh) 
			He's trying to hold his breath...

As Billy presses the pad tighter against Logan's face:

With all his might, Logan wrenches his arms loose... drops to the
ground and pulls out his gun.

He fires and fire girdles a pillar...and they start to back away.

						BILLY		
			We can rush him...we can take 	
			can take him	again, we can!!	

The pack hesitates...stops backing away.

						LOGAN 
					(moving the gun slowly 
					back and forth)
			All right! How many of you want this to 
			be Lastday?!

The pack moves back again...and  disperses, leaving Billy facing
Logan alone.

						LOGAN
			Come on, Billy...come on...you cut
			a Sandman, didn't you?!

Logan tucks the gun back into his waist.

						LOGAN
			Come on, Billy...cut me...Come on

After a beat, Billy turns and runs away.

Logan comforts the shivering Jessica for a moment then takes out the
small box from his pocket and turns it...until it starts BEEPING.

The CAMERA PANS Logan and Jessica...following the SOUND.

They move over the rubble...and cautiously around abandoned
buildings.

We HEAR A SCREAM...and HEAR the Cubs who've only obviously found and
attacked someone. The SOUND is coming from a different direction
than where the beeping is coming from.

						LOGAN 
					(shaking his head) 
			They've got someone else! Why would 
			anybody come here?

Jessica shudders as the scream dies abruptly.

The BEEPING is now very loud.

Logan homes in on an abandoned building, enters, crosses swiftly to
a door inside and kicks it down.

We SEE the Runner. The WOMAN cringing, expecting death.

129		FULL SHOT - LOGAN AND THE WOMAN	

frozen for a moment. In f.g. a figure stirs, moves and we see it is
Francis. His weapon is drawn and aimed, but as he watches, he lowers
the barrel and smiles. The is Logan's job.

130		CLOSE ON - JESSICA	

watching

131		LOGAN AND THE WOMAN

						WOMAN (nearing
					hysteria)
			There's been a terrible error! My
			Lifeclock must have broken in some way!
					(rising tone)
			I'm nowhere near thirty...look at
			me...I'm twenty-two. I should be
			green! Did you hear me?
					(shouting)
			Green!

						LOGAN (quietly)
			Don't be afraid--	

Before Logan can continue...the Woman...who is now wild-eyed and
hysterical lunges at Logan...and starts grappling with him.
	
						WOMAN
			I'll kill you!! I'll kill you!!

After Logan pushes her away...and she falls down:

						LOGAN (breathing hard) 
			I'm not going to hurt you.

Slowly, she rises.

Logan takes out the ankh.

						LOGAN 
			Sanctuary? Anything?

Logan reaches into his pocket and takes out a small round
object...the size of a large marble.

						LOGAN	
			If they find you throw this hard	
			enough to break it. Then hold your	
			breath till you get away...It's
			blind gas.

Her reaction is blank, then, with desperate ferocity she attacks
Logan again.

During the course of the struggle, Logan subdues her again.

Jessica enters, bends over the near-crazed Runner as Logan holds
her. Eyeing him, the woman stands and takes the small round
object...she appears somewhat bewildered as Logan and Jessica move
off.
		
132		EXT. - THE OTHER SIDE OF THE ABANDONED BUILDING - 
		MED. ANGLE - FRANCIS WATCHING

He is shocked, unbelieving.
	
133		CLOSE ON FRANCIS

Stunned and uncertain, Francis aims his gun toward Logan and
Jessica...but he wavers...watching them disappear into the rubble... 

134		ANOTHER ANGLE - FRANCIS

shivering like a wet dog. He turns toward open window.
		
						FRANCIS (in a firm, cold
					tone)
			Runner!
		
The woman turns, staring insanely. Her mouth opens like a fish as:
Francis FIRES his gun. A moment later, as the burning body topples
to the floor;

134X1		MAZE-CAR PLATFORM - THE MEN	

hearing the unmistakable SCREAMING sound of the kill, they exchange
a look.

135		LOGAN AND JESSICA 	

At the flash of FIRE from Francis' gun, they turn.
Logan and Francis' eyes meet. A beat, then Logan grabs Jessica and
pulls her away.

136		FRANCIS 

After a long, long hesitation, takes out his small plastic box and
starts to speak into it:

						FRANCIS (quietly)
			Runner terminated at G.16
			Ready for cleanup at Cathedral
			Quadrant 39.
			
137		ANOTHER ANGLE - OVERLOOKING CATHEDRAL ENTRANCE 

The Second and Third Men...very close to the maze-car platform...
peering into the darkness and seeing Logan and Jessica emerge onto
the maze-car platform. We can tell from the way the two men look at
one another that they believe Logan has fired the shot they have
heard.

They hide from the approaching Logan and Jessica.

						SECOND MAN
			I almost believed her.

They move off soundlessly. Behind them, a maze-car has arrived.

138		MED. - ANGLE - FRANCIS 

Gun in hand...running through Cathedral toward the maze-car
platform.

139		INT. - MAZE-CAR - LOGAN AND JESSICA - MOVING SHOT 	

				 		JESSICA
			I'm ashamed. I was bringing you
			to be killed.

						LOGAN
			Where? Sanctuary? Can you take
			me there?	

						JESSICA 
			Logan, I don't know where Sanctuary is. 
			But if I take you to them, they'll kill you.

						LOGAN (a beat) 
			All right. But why? I didn't kill the 
			Runner.

						JESSICA (interrupting) 
			Yes, but they won't know that...or care. 
			They're hunting you, Logan. Maybe me too, 
			now...

						LOGAN (wry laugh) 
			That's nothing...there's a Sandman
			behind us, too and there'll be
			more soon. Take me to them.

						JESSICA (torn) 
			I - I can't.

						LOGAN
			Then - why don't you leave me - go
			to them - explain

						JESSICA 
			No. Not that either.

Logan considers her. A long BEAT. Thinking, then:

						LOGAN
			All right. New You 483. I'll find
			out myself.

139X1		INT. - SANDMAN READY ROOM - FRANCIS

Distracted...ignoring the greetings of Sandmen who are monitoring
the city.

139X2		ANOTHER ANGLE - FRANCIS

Walking past the GIANT LIFECLOCKS into the debriefing area.

The scanners begin moving.

Moments later the scanner stops...the word:

		IDENTIFY	

appears on a SCREEN Francis pauses a moment and places his palm into
the groove.

Now he takes out the items of the dead woman Runner and places them
on the scanning table.

An ALARM SOUNDS and the word:

		REJECT

flashes on and off on the SCREEN.

Sandmen come running into the Area.

						SANDMAN
			What happened?!

Francis hesitates....then....quickly, as if changing his mind,
taking the items off the table:	
		
						FRANCIS
			Can you beat it....I've got the damn
			wrong bag.

						SANDMAN 
			You ought to put yourself on reliefcall, 
			Francis.

						FRANCIS (starting out) 
			Yeah....

140		EXT. - NEW YOU #483 - TWO SHOT - LOGAN AND JESSICA	

as they enter NEW YOU #483 they are being watched by:

141		MED. ANGLE - THE SECOND AND THIRD MEN

A safe distance behind.

142		INT. - NEW YOU #483

The waiting room has many mirrors...where customers ...male and
female...are checking their faces (and bodies).

There are also various photographs on the walls... suggestions for
changes to foreheads, eyes, cheeks, lips, etcetera. The chatty
informality is very much like people in a beauty parlor or barber
shop.

There is a RECEPTIONIST seated behind a desk in a corner.

Logan and Jessica walk up to the desk.

The receptionist looks at Logan...ignoring Jessica.

						RECEPTIONIST 
			Hello, Sandman.

						LOGAN 
			Hello.

						RECEPTIONIST 
			Do you want to see Doc?

Logan nods, impatient - he knows someone's watching.

						RECEPTIONIST	
			We don't get many Sandmen. I think
			we've only had one other since I've
			been here.

						LOGAN (brusquely) 
			A Sandman can get as sick of his face 
			as anyone else. Where's the doctor?

						RECEPTIONIST (smiling) 
			I like your face. Would you mind if Doc 
			took a picture? I'd Like him to give 
			your face to somebody else.

						LOGAN
			It's all right with me. Is he here?

						RECEPTIONIST
			My name's Holly...Holly 13. In
			ancient times they said my number
			was unlucky. Do you believe in luck?

						LOGAN
			No - Look, I'm in a hurry.

						HOLLY
			Doc'll be with you soon, Sandman.

Logan and Jessica walk to one of the chairs in the waiting area and
sit down next to an attractive WOMAN.

						WOMAN CUSTOMER 
			Is this your first time?

Logan and Jessica nod.

						WOMAN CUSTOMER (smiling) 
			This is my third...
					(a beat) 
			... I did it when I turned yellow ...
			and green.
					(showing her palm) 
			I turned red yesterday.

						LOGAN (looking) 
			Beautiful work. This man do them all?

						WOMAN CUSTOMER 
			No. But I hear he's terrific. Have you 
			seen any of his work?

						LOGAN	
			Just one. 
		
						HOLLY
			Doc's ready, Sandman.
	
Logan and Jessica stand. They follow Holly into a large, shining,
stainless steel room where we see:
	
143		MED. ANGLE - DOC

who looks about twenty-one years old, exchanges a pointed look with
Jessica. 
	
						DOC
			It's a real privilege, Sandman.

						LOGAN
			Thanks.
					(slightest beat)
			I thought you'd be older. I ex-
			pected a Red.

						DOC (showing his palm;
					the flower crystal is Red)
			I am.

						LOGAN
			Your own work?

						DOC (with pride)
			And I did it myself right on there.

144		FULL - ANGLE - THE SURGICAL APPARATUS

Aesculaptor Mark III -- the latest in servo-surgical designs.
Completely self-contained -- tilt-bed, cryojector services embedded
in the platform. The Mark III's laser heads are integrated into the
whole cocoon, swiveled and gimbaled so as to be able to focus any of
the surgical beams in microscopic delicacy or wide-bladed scraping.

The machine vaguely resembles an enormously complicated x-ray table
on an angle -- the great slotted laser heads overhanging it and
Integral with it. From the cryonic receptor base there is a steady
exhalation of cold -- the vapor seeping steadily downwards, blurring
the endlessly looped and tangled tubes and wires and containers
Which join in solid state circuitry so that any random or
involuntary twitch of a patient will be instantly compensated by an
equivalent move of the laser head -- keeping the focus precise.

At one end -- where the halves of the Mark III join, is n console of
switches and dials -- lights nod servo-recorders which control the	
operation from the first injection of cold to the final healing
vacuum drafts and scar burnishing. With the air of a magician
demonstrating, Doc goes to the console and flips switches. Instantly
the table responds -- the platform tilting, the crab-like laser arms
descending flexing -- small vapor jets oozing as the beams slash
harmlessly across the table. Beaming, Doc turns it off and the whole
apparatus subsides.
	
						DOC
			I designed it myself.
					(slightest beat)
			What'll it be ...a face job or
			a full-body job?

						LOGAN 
			Just the face.

						DOC 
			Fine....Holly will get you ready. 
			You're in good hands, believe me.

Holly comes forward and unbuttons the collar on Logan's tunic.

As Holly brushes her fingertips lightly down Logan's arms:

						DOC 
			Holly works here because she gets a 
			lift out of watching the Table...
					(smiles)
			and other things. I'll be back in a 
			minute.

						HOLLY
			He's going to sterilize himself.

						LOGAN  
			Do I have to undress?

						HOLLY 
			Not for your face.

Logan follows Holly to the Table. (Jessica remains behind with Doc
who speaks to her with soft urgency).

						DOC	
			You shouldn't have brought him here.	

						JESSICA;
			I didn't bring him -- what's
			the difference. He's blinking.
			He wants to run.
		
						DOC
			Run!? He's a Sandman.

						JESSICA
			I tell you he's running. I know.
		
						DOC
			Maybe...Maybe. But I wish he'd
			gone somewhere else.
					(a beat, a shrug)
			All right. He gets a face.
		
144X1		THE SURGICAL TABLE - LOGAN AND HOLLY

Logan lies down.

The Table ripples...accepting his weight prisoning and positioning
him.

						HOLLY
					(leaning - close to 
					Logan) 
			I like dark hair. Have him give you 
			dark hair.

						DOC'S VOICE		
			All set?			
			
						HOLLY
			Um huh. Would you take a picture
			of him, Doc? I'd like you to give
			his face to somebody else.

						DOC 
			Why not?

Doc pushes a button...there is a tiny FLASH.

						DOC
			Do you have anything special in mind?

						LOGAN
			I don't care...Just get it over
			with.

						DOC (smiling) 
			Hurry...hurry...hurry.

						HOLLY (whispering) 
			Dark hair.

						LOGAN
			Holly'd like dark hair.
			
						DOC
			Holly'd like a lot of things.
					(studying Logan's face)
			We can start by narrowing the
			cheekbones.
			
Doc presses buttons on the control board. Jessica, who is standing
next to Doc, is slightly startled as the Table begins to HUM...as a
pair of laser beams separate themselves from the overhead cluster
and extend toward Logan, forming inner cones as they approach.

CryoJector needles start to close in on them, nearing their faces
and shoulders slowly...the visible cold streaming off the points.

A vibrobeam begins to KEEN.

SOUND: An insistent chiming.

Doc hears the sound and turns with the martyred air of a man who's
been called to the phone too many times. He turns to a phone-like
apparatus nearby, shifting the table into neutral as he turns. The
table and the laser heads stop moving.		
					
						DOC 
					(as if speaking on a phone)
			Hello
					(listening)
			Yes
					(listening)
			Yes, they are.
					(listening; his expression
					changing)
			Done.

Doc turns back to the console, pausing to stare intently at Logan,
then up at the brightly smiling Holly. Something in his look
registers, and Holly's smile fades. Now Doc engages the machine
again...

						DOC
			Pay attention, Sandman. I'm
			proud of this machine.

As he speaks he presses and an arm sweeps downward and into position
near Logan's face. It pauses as

						DOC
			With this one there's no waiting
			for scar burnishing. It's all in
			one...watch now...

The laser arm sweeps across Logan's forehead and cheeks, leaving a
bright trail of blood as

						DOC 
			But here's the improvement. Instant 
			healing---before you feel a thing. 
			Watch now...

Doc pushes a special button and the arm sweeps back along the track,
spraying healing fluid. Magically the blood vanishes and the skin is
moist and whole.

144X2		THE SURGICAL TABLE - LOGAN 	

His face tense--he knows something's wrong. Over him Holly's bright
face with its rapt look. She's not sure, but she enjoys whatever's
happening.

144X3		BACK TO DOC 

who is playing the console as he speaks.

						DOC			
			Perfect depth adjustment on this			
			one, Sandman. The beam will cut	
			through that uniform and just
			exactly through the skin beneath--
			absolute precision. Watch now
	
And the machine does its stuff, slashing through Logan's tunic--a
seam of blood following the rip.

						DOC
			Of course, it doesn't mend uniforms,
			Sandman, but otherwise it does
			everything, doesn't it? Just
			imagine what would happen to you
			if the healing stopped functioning.
		
And the arm moves back again, spraying the healing fluid into
Logan's new wound. Again the blood disappears.
		
Suddenly Doc's look is ferocious. He turns off the healing switch
and punches buttons fiercely. The laser arms begin to move wildly
and the SOUNDS become shrill. Holly looks alarmed.

						HOLLY
			No! You're scrambling the table.
			He'll be cut to pieces, Doc.
	
						DOC
			Damn right! It was a trap. They
			know!
	
						LOGAN
			No - I'm Running!

Machine begins to WHINE LOUDLY.

Jessica tries to turn the machine off...Doc starts to wrestle with
her as:

145-145X4		INTERCUT: CLOSE ANGLES - THE CLUSTER ABOVE LOGAN 

Moving.

HOLLY

Watching two stun beams lower.

Doc knocks Jessica down. She is groggy on the floor as

The stun beams lance into Logan's cheeks.

The Table holds him, biting into his right leg below the knee.

146-148		QUICK CUTS OF DOC AND HOLLY	

Watching intently as:
	
149-150		CLOSE ANGLES - LOGAN AND THE CLUSTER ABOVE HIM

As surgical beams slit his shirt from the shoulder to the waist
leaving two threads of blood.  A vacu-head dips to suck the blood
away neatly.

151		ANOTHER ANGLE - LOGAN

As Logan desperately sucks in his belly....trying to flatten himself
into the Table.

152-153	CLOSE ANGLES - LOGAN AND THE CLUSTER ABOVE HIM

As laser blades cut into his face....followed by a spray of healing
liquid on the cuts.
	
154		CLOSE - ON HOLLY

Excited....flushed....as:

155		CLOSE - ON LOGAN AND THE CLUSTER ABOVE HIM

As two wide blades of light sweep downward....and hover three inches
above his neck....and keep lowering ....HUMMING loudly....and one
inadvertently frees Logan's right arm.

156		CLOSE ON - DOC

Shocked as Logan reaches for his gun.

157		CLOSE - ON LOGAN AND THE CLUSTER ABOVE HIM.

As dozens of laser beams slash toward Logan....he twists away....and
breaks off....jumping off the Table.

Doc rushes Logan holding what appears to he a frozen police billy.	

In an instant he has knocked Logan's gun away....and as Logan looks
down at it....we see it lying on the floor completely frozen.

Slowly, Doc moves toward Logan the short smoke-colored stick
menacing in his hand.

						LOGAN (out-of-breath)
			What I told you is the....

Abruptly, Doc lunges toward Logan...missing him as Logan ducks away.

As Doc turns to attack....Logan smashes his elbows into Doc's chest
and Doc falls back onto the Table.

157X1	CLOSE ON - HOLLY

SCREAMING, as Doc is slashed by the machine amid showers of sparks
and gouts of steam as the metal twists and wires short out and
various fluids boil and spill onto hot surfaces. Holly tries to
fight her way into the mess to help Doc, but Jessica, recovering,
pulls her down and the two struggle.

157X2	CLOSE ON - DOC

In terror as the laser beams begin to slash him to ribbons.

157X3	LOGAN

Making an effort to stop the machine, pulling levers and pushing
buttons in vain. He sees what's happening, pulls Jessica away from
Holly and, grabbing up his gun and tunic, heads for the entrance.
Crossing the waiting room they are stopped by the sight of:

158-
162XI 	OUT

163		FRANCIS

Entering...gun in hand.

164		REVERSE ANGLE - LOGAN AND JESSICA

As they face Francis.

165		FULL ANGLE - FRANCIS LOGAN AND JESSICA

						FRANCIS (frowning)
			What's going on, Logan?!

						LOGAN
			It has nothing to do with you.

						FRANCIS 
					(choking but still loyal)
			What are you talking about?! I saw you 
			let a Runner go? 
					(up a notch)
			I saw you, Logan?? Tell me!!

Suddenly the machine behind them erupts into a great burst of smoke
and noise, momentarily drawing Francis' attention. Instantly Logan
jumps him, grabs and throws him sprawling. Without a look back, he
and Jessica run out.

166 		OUT

166X1		FRANCIS

Enraged, finds his gun on the floor and, before rising, gets off a
shot at them as they disappear. Then leaping to his feet, dashing
off in pursuit.

167		ARCADE TRACKING	

Logan and Jessica running through Arcade.
	
167X1	LOGAN AND JESSICA	

Suddenly she pulls him in another direction.

						JESSICA
			Follow me, Logan. Stay close.

As they run into Hallucimill...Francis...never too far behind...
spots them and follows.

168-
173 		OUT

174		EXT. - HALLUCIMILL - TWO SHOT - LOGAN AND JESSICA

Exiting from the other side...and running through the crowd toward
and into a Love Shop...followed by Francis coming out of the
Hallucimill, too... and running toward the Love Shop.

175		INT. - LOVE SHOP - LOGAN AND JESSICA
	
As they enter the hot darkness. The Love Shop is throbbing with
sexuality. In it, the darkness breaks at Irregular intervals -- when
booths and cubicles flare into brilliance, each time revealing an
orgiastic tableau. The Love Shop is multi-leveled and the random
flashes may appear from any direction at any time, blinding and
stunning the viewer. Logan and Jessica pause to get their bearings
and as they do, a beautiful WANTON grabs Logan, pulling and
laughing:

						WANTON
			I have an empty one, Sandman

Logan tries to pull away, looks around for Jessica just in time to
see a man almost carrying her off.  Then the light is gone again and
Jessica with it.

176		LOGAN AND THE WANTON	

As she tears at his clothing, wrapping herself around him, trying to
pull him down. Then, as the light flares again she suddenly lets go
and grabs another man...Logan is, freed, starts looking for Jessica.

177-
179		SERIES OF SHOTS

Logan hunting through the Love Shop, fighting them off.

INTERCUT SHOTS of the suddenly-illuminated tableaus. Sex, manifold
and multiform -- everybody doing it.

180		ANOTHER ANGLE - FRANCIS

Entering, starting to look around -- grabbed by one of the laughing
Wantons.

181-182	LOGAN, JESSICA

Brief glimpses of them looking for each other.

183		FRANCIS

Hunting both.

184		WITH LOGAN

As he suddenly collides with a woman -- shoves her away and sees
it's Jessica. Now together they make for an archway where multiple
mirrors enclose them.

Suddenly they are in darkness. Then a heavy door slides open and
Jessica leads Logan through the opening. Behind them the door slides
shut again.
			
185		FRANCIS

Desperately trying to get rid of a woman, sees a flash of Logan and
Jessica far across the room -sees them leave. Then he's pulled down
again as the orgy continues.

186-
186X1 	OUT

186X2	INT. - AN IMMENSE METAL STAIRWAY	

After a moment, Jessica takes Logan's hand and they start down in
the darkness. The SOUNDS of Love Shop still heard from behind the
wall.

						LOGAN
			Are you taking me to them?

						JESSICA 
			Yes.
					(beat)
			I don't know what else to do -- with
			him following us.
					(she hesitates) 
			Why do you keep running from your--

						LOGAN
			Because he's my friend -
					(a beat) 
			and I don't want to be killed by him - 
			or anyone.

						JESSICA 
			He's good, isn't he?

						LOGAN
			Will he find us and kill us?
			Yes...or one of the others.
					(a beat) 
			You know there's only one place 
			to go now...

						 JESSICA (hopelessly) 
			They won't believe us.

						LOGAN	
					(beat)		
			I'd rather take my chances with
			them...than with Francis.

						JESSICA
			They won¹t listen.
			
						LOGAN (interrupting)
			You think Sandmen will?
					(before she can answer)
			There's no other way for me,

						JESSICA 
			We'll convince them.

They pause. He puts his hand over hers. Jessica is silent. Then she
turns his hand over. The crystal blinks red -- on, off.

						JESSICA 
			Yes, Logan.
					(turning to him blindly)
			I'm glad they didn't change your
			face.
	
Logan embraces her, but his look is strange and remote. They
continue down into the darkness.
	
Behind them the SOUNDS of Love Shop die away and only their
footsteps are heard.

187 		OUT
		
187X1	FRANCIS
	
At the mirrored archway, looking around carefully, testing. He knows
they went through somehow. Hands claw at him - he brushes them away
as he searches.

188-200 	OUT

200X1	WITH LOGAN AND JESSICA	

They have come to the foot of the stair. Here the flooring shines
wetly in the darkness.

						JESSICA (softly) 
			Exactly four steps now. Let me lead you.
					(they walk) 
			Now to the right. It's narrow here, 
			you'll have to get behind me.

						LOGAN (whispering) 
			How will they know we're coming?

						JESSICA (whispering)	
			They're watching us now. They'll	
			let us in when they're sure.	

200X2	CLOSE-UP - LOGAN'S HAND (INSERT)
			
As he fumbles the transceiver switches at his belt, punching out a
signal.

200X3	INT. - SANDMAN H.Q. READY ROOM

As the Sandmen monitoring SEE THE SIGNAL FLASH and move smoothly
into action.

200X4	LOGAN AND JESSICA	

Close together, he behind, waiting--alert as a VOICE is suddenly
heard:

						VOICE (scratchy, 
					filtered) 
			Sandman, put your hands on your head. 
					(he does)
			Clasp your fingers together. Now turn 
			your hands over. Palms up. 
					(beat) 
			In a moment a light will shine in your 
			eyes. Walk into it--Jessica first, 
			then you, Sandman. You will have to 
			stoop--but don't unclasp your hands. 
			Do you agree?

Logan nods.

Jessica glances back at him but their faces are unreadable in the
dark. Then suddenly--in front of her--a blindingly bright, narrow
rectangle of light illuminating them fiercely. Jessica moves
forward. Even she has to stoop. Logan is close behind. As he bends
awkwardly into the opening, the light goes out.

201		LOGAN, JESSICA -- SANCTUARY HQ

As he pushes her through the opening then moves instantly to the
side, pulling her with him.. The move fails. Both are pinned
helplessly in the blinding glare of the spotlight and the sudden
appearance of glass-silver spear points pressed against them. Logan
is unable to draw his gun.

						VOICE
			Hold still, Sandman, or die where
			you are.

						2ND VOICE
			Is she the one?
	
						OTHER VOICES (like angry
					stage whispers)
			She betrayed us. Kill him. Kill them both.
			Jessica you sold us. Sandman butcher.
			Sandman murderer.

Logan and Jessica stand rigid against the spear points, only their
heads turning to the echoing sibilants.. The spotlight goes off.

202-204 	OUT

205		INT. - SANCTUARY HQ. - LOGAN, JESSICA - CLOSE	

In the darkness we see the glass-silver spear points are glowing all
around them, the long shafts falling away into darkness, the points,
steaming gently when they touch--making an instant, wincing burn.
Logan moves--a spear point presses--he flinches.

						LOGAN 
			I'm a runner. She brought me here because 
			I begged her to help me.

He turns his palm. The red crystal blinks impressively in the
darkness.

At the sight, a BABBLE of SOUNDS. Argument.

						VOICE
			He's lying. No Sandman ever ran.

						2ND VOICE
			You don't run. You kill runners.
			You have killed runners all your life.	-

						LOGAN	
			Yes I have.		
					(beat)	
			Now it's my turn. And I want to
			live.

Another angry murmur of VOICES. Over it Jessica suddenly:

						JESSICA (shouting) 
			What's the matter with you. He's a runner--
			he's blinking. We must help anyone who 
			asks...we must-or we're the same as they 
			are--deciding who lives and dies.

One of the points lifts and touches Jessica's cheek. A quick, fierce
burn. She shrieks--a tiny sound--and is silent.

206		LOGAN	

Reacts fiercely, spinning against the spear points, he is Jabbed and
pierced in a dozen places as he manages to get Jessica closer,
shielding her with his body. But the spear points are too much. He
subsides, as VOICES rise angrily "Kill him now".

Suddenly a RINGING ALARM. All sound stops at once and we hear a
CLATTER of FOOTSTEPS down the iron stair and across the outer floor.
The spotlight bursts on again and a figure staggers into the
chamber, straightening into the light, hair dishevelled, hands in
front against the glare. It's Holly.

						HOLLY 
			Holly. Holly, New You 483... He's dead. 
			Doc's dead and the Sandmen came...

						VOICE (gentle)
			Holly--Holly. Remember the code.
			The code, please Holly...

						HOLLY (hysteria)	
			They smashed everything and I barely
			got away.
					(beat)
			Holly. Station 12, Sanctuary 7.
			Holly. Holly...

She lowers her hands and we see her, tattered, frightened--the
bright smile strange. She comes to herself a bit, looks to the side
and sees Logan and Jessica, pinned against the wall.

She reacts with fear at the sight.	
			
						HOLLY	
			It's him! The first Sandman. He
			killed...Doc.

						JESSICA
			No, Holly--wait! He's running.
			Tell them the rest!
	
						HOLLY (suddenly
					exhausted)
			He's the one. You too. I remember.
			He was in a hurry. Just a face job.
			Dark hair, I said. Then he killed
			Doc and you grabbed me--and the
			machine blew up and I ran...I ran
	
	 					JESSICA
			Holly. Holly! Please...The other
			Sandman. Remember the one who came
			after--

Holly suddenly remembers and the shock makes her lucid.

						HOLLY (pouring 
					it out) 
			That's right. The other one came after. 
			The older one. Smashing, killing, burning!

						JESSICA (coaching
					desperately) 
			...and he was hunting the first one, 
			this one. Wasn't he? Wasn't he? This 
			one was running, the other one was 
			hunting him...

						HOLLY (remembers)
			Yes. Oh yes.
					(to Logan) 
			He was after you. I remember. You're 
			running!

207-208 	OUT

208X1	ANOTHER ANGLE 1

The spear points are withdrawn. Logan and Jessica relieved but
shaken, wary.

						LOGAN 
			May we move?

A long beat. Then--

						VOICE
			I saw we pass them through.			
			Somebody help Holly.	

Other VOICES mumble agreement. Holly moves off into the dark room,
hands reaching out to help her.

						VOICE 
			You two. Just go straight ahead. 
			Follow the corridors with the pipes 
			overhead to the end. Then use the key.

As the voice speaks the spotlight finally goes off and by a dim glow
around the perimeter, we see we're in some kind of large underground
chamber--some part of the vast undercellars of the city. The light
is enough to reveal that there are perhaps twenty people in the
room, reds and greens both--but all are silhouetted, no face seen.
There's a kind of aisle open down the room's center and it's
obviously the way they are to go. Logan and Jessica move off. Logan
pauses.

						LOGAN
			I don't know who you are. I'd
			like to thank someone.

						VOICE 
			It doesn't matter who we are. Follow 
			the tunnel to the end.

						LOGAN
			I Will there be someone to tell us
			where to go from there...?

A murmur of discussion then:

						VOICE 
			Someone will follow. When you come to 
			the lock, he will tell you how Co go 
			on the other side. Jessica may go with 
			you as far as the lock.

						LOGAN 
					(a deep breath) 
			No. Jessica goes back now. Take her back. 
					(suddenly his tone is 
					urgent as he speaks to her) 
			Now! Go on back. Back outside, Jessica.

She is bewildered by the change.

						JESSICA
			Why?- No...no...I'm going with you.

						VOICE1
			Only to the lock. After that 
			there's no way back. 

						JESSICA (small voice) 
			I don't care. I'm going to Sanctuary. 
			With you.

A BABBLE of VOICES. "Impossible"...She ignores, watches Logan.
			
						JESSICA (cont'd)
			Will you take me with you?

						LOGAN
			Why, Jessica? You're still a green.
			
JESSICA shakes her head. She doesn't know why.

Logan puts his arm around her, marveling, trying to understand,
moved. But suddenly he remembers the urgency of the moment. He
wheels, pulling her with him.
			
						LOGAN
			Come on then--they'll be here any
			minute!

Uncomprehending, she starts to run with him. Too late. An EXPLOSION
shakes the chamber--the wall bellies inward and a group of Sandmen,
led by Francis, burst into the room, firing as they come.
			
Panic. Turmoil. PEOPLE running, SCREAMING--the ALARM BELL RINGING,
RINGING as Sandmen methodically slaughter the people in the wreckage
of the room.

209 		OUT

209X1	LOGAN AND JESSICA 	

As the brief, one-sided battle rages, echoing SHOTS and SCREAMS in
the dust filled room, Logan pulls her down out of the way. They
watch, helplessly. Suddenly the figure of a Sandman looms before
them. He stares at Logan, unsure. Logan reacts, draws, fires. The
Sandman is smashed away, burning.

209X2	LOGAN 

Suddenly aware that he has killed a Sandman. Jessica pulls him down
again into the shadow. Neither realizes chat the soft pulsing of his
crystal can be seen from the room.

210		ANOTHER ANGLE

Francis, quartering the room like a hound, searching, searching,
stopping as he sees

211		FRANCIS P.O.V.
	
The crystal blinking red, eerie in the darkness.

						FRANCIS 
					(believing the	
					blinking crystal is Jessica's)	
			Logan. I know you're in here. 
 			What've you done...gone crazy over a 
			Runner?
					(whispering) 
			Nobody knows except me. You know I 
			won't say anything. I should have 
			turned you in but I couldn't. Leave 
			her. Come on out with me. It'll look 
			like you're part of the group that 
			hit this nest.
					(pleading) 
			Logan...you're a Sandman!
					(slightest beat)
			Logan...now...now...Logan...

After the slightest beat, Logan FIRES and Francis falls, a great
chunk of the cave roof falling between him and Logan -- all vision
obscured while EXPLOSIONS and SCREAMS continue.

212		LOGAN AND JESSICA

As he pulls her shakily to her feet. She nods, she's okay. He leads
her off down the tunnel.

213		WITH LOGAN AND JESSICA - TUNNEL

following the tracks. The way leads down, curves, recurves, but
always down.

214		ANOTHER ANGLE - INCLUDING LOCK
	
As Logan and Jessica rush toward it. The corridor has widened into a
kind of chamber which ends in a great metal door like an immense
submarine hatch.

The tracks run straight to it and beneath it. The base of the door 
tands in a couple of inches of water.
	
With great urgency, Logan and Jessica examine the huge door. Logan
gives the wheel a tug...nothing.

SOUND: A WHIRRING like clockwork...A METALLIC BELL SOUND and then a
RECORDED VOICE.

						VOICE	
			Runner, this is the last gate. Use			
			your key now. When the Bell sounds			
			again...use your key. Good luck,
			Runner. May you find Sanctuary.

SILENCE. Then the BELL CHIME SOUND and a light illumines the center
of the wheel where there's a kind of keyhole. The WHIRRING continues
for about ten seconds. Then it stops	and the light goes out.

214X1	LOGAN AND JESSICA	

Hearing a SOUND they turn and see:
	
214X2	ANOTHER ANGLE - P.O.V.

Far behind them, in the wet glisten of the tunnel, a bobbing light
and shadow -- the SOUND of RUNNING

215-216	CLOSE ON - LOGAN AND JESSICA

As Jessica takes the ankh from her neck - fumbling with the chain.

						JESSICA (breathlessly) 
			Every key only works once...and only 
			a Lastday key must open this door.... 
			They said it would fit - but....

She tries to fit the ankh into the glowing one, but her hand shakes.
Logan tries to steady her - and in helping, she drops it into the
dark pool of water. They fall to their knees, searching desperately.
Then Logan remembers.

						LOGAN 
			Wait - I have the one I took from 
			the Runner.

SOUND: The same as before as Logan searches his pockets for the
Runner's ankh.

Logan finds it just as the WHIRRING SOUND has STOPPED again...and
the light has gone out again in the center of the wheel.

As Logan and Jessica wait for the sound, etcetera to repeat again
another TREMENDOUS EXPLOSION is heard rocking everything.  In the
distance, Jessica can see the shadow of a FIGURE approaching.

As the SOUND, etcetera, repeat-s once more...Logan pushes the ankh
into the lighted center of the wheel. The ankh fuses and the lighted
center becomes brighter as the door opens.

There is a hesitation...in which Logan turning his head back...
realizes what he has done and is shaken.

As the shadowed FIGURE looms LARGER:

						JESSICA
			There's no turning back, is there?

Logan turns and pushes Jessica through the door... following her...
as the door closes and they are:

217		ON THE OTHER SIDE	

now, they can still hear the SOUND, etcetera for the last time.

Beyond the lock is the ruins of a vast undersea complex in which
food was raised and harvested. What we see is an endless shadowy
labyrinth of breeding pens which stretch off into the green darkness
-- a kind of mammoth aquarium with catwalks and ramps intersecting
the huge tanks. The levels are multiple and everything is slimed,
rusted, rotted and wet.

In the tanks themselves are shoals of fish, gardens of seaweed, etc.
The machinery for harvesting and winnowing has long since gone to
rust -- and visible in the great tanks are the wrecks of vessels and
gear -- the kind of stuff Cousteau and Co. are using now.

Footing is dangerous -- a slip from any catwalk means a plunge into
water and some of the walkways are well under water anyhow. From an
invisible ceiling comes a steady dripping and everything is crusted
and smells of salt and decay and life in the darkness.

217X1	WITH FRANCIS	

As he arrives at the door, the ankh glowing as before.

But Francis has a light. He examines the door with it, and as it
lights the pool of water on the ground, it picks out Jessica's ankh.
FRANCIS stoops, gets it and looks from it to the one glowing
	
128		LOGAN AND JESSICA	

Bewildered -- uncertain, as their eyes adjust to the dim light.
Finally, Logan gestures ''this way" and sets out.

(NOTE: The action of the sequence is the action of people groping
through a labyrinth. They go along, gripping a rail where possible,
sometimes sinking deep into water, sometimes rising above it. They
run into blind endings and retrace to the last junction -- always
trying for what looks driest and seems to stretch farthest along the
great wall...)

219-224	WITH LOGAN AND JESSICA - SERIES OF CUTS	

A. Making their way along the walkway side by side.

B. Stopping as the walkway disappears under water. Logan wading in
while she waits -- until he re-emerges. She follows.	

C. Choosing between diverging ramps. Having to return.

						JESSICA
			How do we know this is the right
			way?

						LOGAN
			It's the only way.
			
D. POV an alley way full of machinery. Logan gives a wheel a half
turn -- great rusty net-combs start to winnow the water.

E. Helping Jessica, Logan slips...falls into darkness. Jessica's
fear until he emerges, hand over slimy hand. The water is cold.

F. POV ancient signs - PROTOPLANK...DEPOT NO #11 DO NOT DECANT...
HABITAT MARITIME...ETC.

They speculate.

						JESSICA
			What do you suppose this was...?

						LOGAN
			Some kind of breeding pens...I
			suppose...They say people used
			to breed animal s, fish, anything
					(at her disbelieving look)
			To eat, of course.
			
						JESSICA
			Ycch.
					(shudders)
			To kill things and then eat them.
			It must have been a savage world.
			
Logan shrugs, but the idea makes him queasy, too.
			
G. They stop, tired. Peer through at the wreckage of a small
inspection vessel and suddenly hear:

SOUND: FOOTSTEPS, coming, halting, WATER sloshing. Steps again.

225		POV - THROUGH THE MAZE OF TANKS - A LIGHT	

moving, hunting.

						LOGAN (alert)	
			Stay here, while I see what it is.	

Jessica nods, frightened. Logan slips off into the darkness. In a
moment he's back. His face - is grim.

						JESSICA
			It's Francis, isn't it?

He nods.

226		LOGAN AND JESSICA

Trying to move faster now, Logan makes a wrong turning and they must
go back. But as they do so, Francis is ever closer -- a gigantic
distorted SHAPE now visible through the eerie glass -then suddenly
seeming small and distant.

As they emerge from the blind alley once again close to the wall,
suddenly:

227		FRANCIS

looming huge, gun drawn, apparently only a few feet away.

228		LOGAN AND JESSICA	

Logan desperately claws at machinery, succeeds in starting motion,
somewhere what sounds like a GENERATOR begins laboring, ancient
machinery GROANS.
		
They turn and run as they HEAR:
	
						FRANCIS (distorted;
					echo; etcetera)
			LOGAN N N N.
		
229		POV - FRANCIS' LIGHT

is splashing the walls ahead and in it they suddenly see:

THE DOOR -- a waterlock with a wheel. As the light passes, Logan
heaves desperately on it. It starts to give as the light comes back
and they are revealed.

230		CLOSE - ON FRANCIS

aiming at Logan...then slowly moving his hand until Jessica is in
his sights.

231		LOGAN - JESSICA - FRANCIS 

Francis FIRES -- tremendous SOUND, ECHOING and RESOUNDING. One of
the great tanks buckles and a cascade of water erupts over
everything. Through it, Logan manages to get the door open and
pushes a half-drowning Jessica through.

232		INT. - THE SHAFT 	

A sort of ancient freight elevator which commences to move groaning
when the waterlock door closes.
		
Logan slumps to the floor.

233		INT. - SHAFT - TWO SHOT - LOGAN AND JESSICA 

Moving at an extremely high speed...We can see the outside -
flickering - dark, light, - dark, light... and finally to a white
color. They lie slumped, motionless. Finally it stops. The door
opens into a kind of glistening darkness, suffused by a bluish glow.
It is now very cold.

In the silence Logan stirs. Groping, he touches Jessica, who moves
close to him. Logan puts his arm around her and they rise. Slowly,
tentatively, he leads her out into the dark chamber where they stand
for a moment trying to find themselves. What little light there is
seems to come from the left. Arm around Jessica, Logan starts to
move.

						JESSICA (whispering) 
			I'm afraid.

						LOGAN	
			It's brighter there...besides, we
			can't go back.

He starts to move again but Jessica hangs back.

						JESSICA 
			Wait.

He halts.

						JESSICA (cont'd)	
			I don't know what's going to happen	
			to us Logan but --	
					(a beat)
			Are you glad you didn't kill him?

						LOGAN 
			It doesn't make any difference anymore.

						JESSICA 
			You're really one of us now, aren't you?

						LOGAN 
			You knew that I wasn't before, didn't you?
					(Jessica nods)
			Why did you stay with me?

						JESSICA (feelingly) 
			I wanted to...
				(Logan puts his arms
				around her) 
			...And you...what made you kill Sandmen?

						LOGAN
			I had to. I did kill...for the
			first time in my life I killed.

						JESSICA 
			Because you felt like a Runner, 
			didn't you.

						LOGAN 
			I guess so...I know I felt something 
			I never felt before...and I didn't 
			like it...not a bit.
					(after another long beat) 
			I'll tell you one thing...Sanctuary 
			better be worth it. That's the last 
			place for me to live now.

						JESSICA 
			For us.

Logan mouths "Us"...a strange word...and why not... in the last
minutes he has done strange things.

234-236 	OUT
		
236x1	INT. - ICE CAVERN

Suddenly they are blinded by a brilliant light coming from the side
and revealing for the first time where they are.

236x2	ANGLE

Before them a vase, dim, ice-shrouded storage area, row upon endless
row of frozen lockers trailing away into darkness, their legends and
contents unreadable in the thick covering of ice and frost. To the
side, a bright light.
		
236x3	LOGAN AND JESSICA

Walk toward the light.

236x4	WITH LOGAN AND JESSICA

We see a huge, high-domed cavern ringed and ornamented with
extraordinary ice sculptures-They are everywhere: Otters, fish, a
tusked walrus---overhead a flight of birds.

236x5	ANOTHER ANGLE

As they look in wonder:

						VOICE
			Overwhelming, isn't it?

Logan and Jessica turn and see:

237-238	OUT

239		FULL ANGLE - BOX	

Box is half-man...half-metal.

From the midpoint of his sternum to his hips he is coils and cables.
One hand is a cutting tool. His head is half-flesh...half-metal. his
legs are a chrome pedestal.

						BOX		
			Are you too startled? Am I too	
			removed from your ken?	
					(slightest beat)
			I'm neither machine nor man...but
			a perfect fusion of the two...and
			better than either.
					(with great pride)
			No human sculptor could match this
			greatness...don't you agree?

						LOGAN
			All right - what are you?
	
						BOX (laughs)
			Your turn.
	
						JESSICA
			It's incredibly beautiful.

						BOX	
			Ah, but wait for the winds. Then	
			my birds sing. My walrus breathes.	
			My palace chimes and bells. And the
			deep grottoes whisper my name...Box
			Box...Bahhhhxxxxsss...

						LOGAN (after a beat)
			We're hungry	do you have anything
			to eat?
	
						BOX
			Anything to eat?

Box starts to laugh...He is roaring with laughter as:

						JESSICA (quietly)
			We're human and we're hungry.

						BOX (still laughing) 
			I know...I know.

						LOGAN
			This place is a link to Sanctuary,
			isn't it?

Box looks totally confused.

						LOGAN (angrily) 
			How do you think we got here??!!

						BOX
			You walked in. I saw you. Don't
			you remember?

Logan contains his anger.

						LOGAN (beginning 
					again; quietly) 
			Where do you think we came from?

						BOX 
			From? From? From?

						LOGAN	
			We were sent here and you know it.
			Others have been sent here. Where
			are they? Hiding?
	
Box looks around the cavern:
	
						BOX (mischievously)
			Hiding? Yes! Hiding, hiding.

						LOGAN
			Where do we go?!	
					(up a notch)			
			Where do we go from here??!!

We hear a NOISE outside.

						BOX 
			Is that the wind?
					(smiling)
			Not yet...
					(slightest beat) 
			You must hear my birds sing.

						LOGAN 
			You know about Sanctuary! I know 
			you do! You have to help us! You 
			don't have a choice! It isn't your 
			decision!! Tell us.

						BOX
			Never a pair. I have never had a
			pair.

						LOGAN
			Where do you send them?

						BOX
			You're a beautiful pair.

						JESSICA 
			Please.

						BOX 
			I've never seen humans whom I thought 
			worthy of being here...
					(a beat) 
			I'd like to sculpt you.
					(looking around) 
			Where would I put you?
					(smiling) 
			I know...you'd be the base of the 
			column. You'd hold up my world!

						LOGAN (exasperated) 
			Answer the question!

						BOX 
			Do you know how long all this will 
			last? Not thirty years...or thirty 
			thousand years...but thirty thousand 
			thousand years...and you'll be part 
			of it. Ages will roll...Ages. And 
			you'll be here...the two of you... 
			eternally frozen...frozen...beautiful.

						LOGAN (to Jessica)	
			There must be somebody else up here.	
			I can't believe that he's--	

						BOX (interrupting;
					his voice tone changing;
					very lucid)
			Let me sculpt you and I will show
			you where the others have gone.
	
						LOGAN
			That's better.
					(slightest beat)
			How do you want us?

						BOX
			Nude. Imagine, a pair.

						LOGAN (starting to 
					take off his clothes; 
					as Jessica hesitates, 
					Logan smiles)
			It'll be all right...

240-241	JESSICA 

Undresses.

Box motions to a pedestal covered with deep white furs.

						BOX
			Up there.

Logan helps Jessica up to the pedestal. As they stand there:

						LOGAN
			How do you want us?

						BOX (beat)
			Up there.

Logan looks at Jessica. Her beauty is glowing in the lamplight.

Logan takes Jessica into his arms.

						BOX
			Enchanting. Is that what humans do?

By this time, Logan and Jessica are no longer listening to
Box...their arms are enveloping one another...with strong feelings.

						BOX'S VOICE	
			Superb!	

242		ANOTHER ANGLE - INCLUDING BOX

As his metal hand begins to BUZZ...he brings it to the base of the
huge column supporting the cavern.

As he works furiously...at Incredible speed:


243		LOGAN AND JESSICA

...oblivious to Box...their feelings intensifying as they continue
to hold one another.

244-245	OUT

246		CLOSE - ON BOX

						BOX (stepping back) 
			Done...behold...!

247		REVERSE ANGLE - LOGAN AND JESSICA

Before they turn to view the sculpture they kiss long and
passionately.

Their mood is broken by:

						BOX'S VOICE
			Done...Done...Done...

Logan and Jessica break. They turn and see:

248		FULL ANGLE - THE ICE SCULPTURE

Box has captured them perfectly...shimmering with life...filled with
emotion.

249		WIDE ANGLE - INCLUDING LOGAN, JESSICA AND BOX

There are tears in Jessica's eyes as she reacts to the sculpture.

						JESSICA (squeezing	
					Logan's hand)	
			It's glorious 

Logan helps Jessica off the pedestal and they both start to dress.

						LOGAN
			All right. Now you keep your
			bargain.

						BOX (rapt by his
					work) 
			Wait for the wind! Wait and hear
			the birds sing over you!

						LOGAN (only interested
					in getting out)
			We're ready.

Box mumbles as he leads Logan and Jessica toward the rear of the Ice
Cavern.

250		INT. - ICE ROOM

As Box enters followed by Logan and Jessica.

This room has a fairly low ceiling and it is not too wide.

It stretches back as far as the eye can see.

The ice along the left wall is frosted...but the ice along the right
wall is perfectly clear.

And embedded in the ice along the perfectly clear right wall are:

251		WIDE ANGLE - MEN AND WOMEN

Standing in erect positions.

At first it appears that they might be more of Box's perfect works
of sculpture.

But as Logan and Jessica examine them closely through the clear
ice...it is soon apparent that they are real people...who have been
frozen.

252		CLOSE ON LOGAN AND JESSICA

Horrified as they move slowly along the wall.

253		ANOTHER ANGLE - INCLUDING THE MEN AND WOMEN FROZEN	
		IN THE WALL

We can see that each of them has a black crystal flower in the palm
of their right hands.
	
Logan walks to the end of this wall. Each frozen body has a number
above it. The final body's number is 1056...That number which the
voice in Sandman's headquarters revealed as the number of missing
Runners.

The CAMERA PANS Logan back to Box.

254		ANOTHER ANGLE - INCLUDING BOX

As Logan turns toward him.

						LOGAN (stupefied) 
			How did they get in here?

						BOX
			Regular storage procedure...the
			same as the other food... The
			other food stopped coming and they
			started.
	
						LOGAN
			What other food?

						BOX
			Fish and plankton, sea greens and
			protein from the sea.
					(pointing to the frosted
					ice wall)
			It's all here - ready - fresh as
			harvest day. Fish and plankton,			
			sea greens and protein from the
			sea...And then it stopped coming
			and they (gesture) came instead.
			So I store them here. I'm ready.
			And you're ready. It's my Job -
			protein, plankton, grass from the
			sea

Logan pulls out his gun.

						LOGAN	
			Tell us how to get out...or I¹ll	
			destroy you..I'll kill you!

Box laughs...The same LOUD, ROARING LAUGH we HEARD earlier.  Then:

						BOX (calmly)
			Such a beautiful pair. I'll stand
			you facing one another.
		
Box starts his saw hand BUZZING.  He turns all the flesh parts of
his body away from Logan and starts advancing toward him and Jessica
who is now standing behind Logan.

Box is now like an armed vehicle.

Logan FIRES...the fire reflecting harmlessly off Box's metal frame.

						BOX (advancing)
			Resign yourself.

255		MED. ANGLE - LOGAN AND JESSICA

Retreating...as Logan FIRES again and again...to no avail.

As Logan and Jessica retreat further and further toward the rear of
this room and:

256		REVERSE ANGLE - BOX

Advancing

We can SEE PERSON AFTER PERSON...embedded in the clear wall of ice.
A strange mute audience to this to-the-death drama.

257		TWO SHOT - LOGAN AND JESSICA

Finally reaching the rear wall of this room as:

258		REVERSE ANGLE - BOX

Relentlessly moving toward them.

259		TWO SHOT - LOGAN AND JESSICA

Seemingly pinned back against the rear wall.

Logan is FIRING his gun futilely with his right hand...while moving
his empty hand against the rear wall...trying to find a knob or
button which might open it.

The entire time he never takes his eyes off:

260		REVERSE ANGLE - BOX

Getting closer. The saw is BUZZING LOUDLY.

						BOX (chilling tone) 
			I make such a small, quick incision ...
			you can hardly feel it.

261		REVERSE ANGLE - LOGAN AND JESSICA

Against the rear wall...We can SEE...but they cannot...that above
them...on the ceiling...there are a number of exposed cables.

262		FULL ANGLE - LOGAN, JESSICA AND BOX
	
Box is practically upon them.  As he lunges forward with his
WHIRRING saw hand Logan pushes Jessica to the floor and drops down
alongside her.

Box cannot stop his forward thrust and cuts a sizable chunk of ice
out of the rear wall as:

Logan SHOOTS at Box from the floor Level...upwards ...trying to
penetrate some part of his seemingly impregnable body. He misses but
hits the exposed cables on the ceiling.

There is an EXPLOSION.

						BOX (looking up; 
					screaming) 
			No! The coils!

Box rushes past Logan and Jessica toward the huge ice cavern
containing his sculptures.

						BOX (still screaming)	
			All my work!' All my work!!	

As Logan and Jessica stand:

263-270	OUT
			
270x1	ANGLE - THE REFRIGERANT COILS

Bursting open, discharging great streams of gases.

270x2	LOGAN

Seeing the effect, shooting again and again at the ceiling and
walls.

270x3	ANOTHER ANGLE	
		
Coils bursting everywhere, vapor billowing into the cavern.
			
270x4	ANOTHER ANGLE	
	
Huge slabs of ice instantly loosening, crashing over.
			
270x5	FULL SHOT	

AS the effect multiplies--Ln the hissing vapor-sculptures crashing
over and enormous chunks of ice loosened and crashing.

270x6	BOX

Careening around wildly in the growing ruin, as the lights dim and
flicker out.

270X7	ANGLE

The ceiling full of birds loosening, crashing down upon Box. Again
and again like great spears and wedges 

270X8	BOX
	
Buried in his work, still feebly moving, then still as the roaring
ice crashes down, in the terrible darkness.
	
270X9	LOGAN AND JESSICA
 
Cowering in the crashing maelstrom of ice blocks--saved only by
Being in an angle of the cave.

270X10	FULL SHOT	
	
The SCREEN blotted out by the cave-in, going out of focus. Silence.
Then:

SOUND: Ice melting, water running.

270X11	LOGAN AND JESSICA

Stir in the dimness, amazed to be alive.

SOUND: A heavy crash and splash as another huge ice block falls into
the water.

As it falls, the cave is suddenly illuminated again. They look and
see the light is coming from a great fissure in the wall--opened by
the last ice fall. Water rains across the opening.

Logan and Jessica make their way to it, step out.

271-272	OUT

273		EXT. - HIGH LEDGE

Water is pouring down in a waterfall from the icemelt.

They are blinded by:

274		SUNSHINE: A HUGE RISING SUN	

As Logan and Jessica shield their eyes...then realizing that the
dazzling light will not go away:

Standing together...in fear of the sunrise.

						JESSICA 		
			Is there something on fire!!	 

Logan shakes his head...he doesn't know.

As Logan looks up at the sun.
			
						LOGAN
			It seems to be moving away.
			Come on...

274X1	ANGLE - LOGAN AND JESSICA

clambering cautiously down from the barren ledge.

274X2	LOWER - AN AREA OF BOULDERS	

Suddenly, a FAIRLY STRONG WIND starts blowing.

						JESSICA (frightened) 
			What's that?

						LOGAN 
			It feels like breath. It makes 
			everything move. Your hair is moving.

						JESSICA (smiling) 
			And yours.

They reach the level below and pause, look around.

						LOGAN
			Jessica -- we must be outside!

She looks at him, uncertainly, he puts an arm around her and they
set out again.

275-276	OUT

276X1	INT. - CAVE - CLOSE ON FRANCIS

Picking his way through the ruined cave, puzzled.

277-287X1	
OUT

288		EXT . - FOREST AREA

As Logan and Jessica reach it.

They are startled by the SOUND of BIRDS SINGING for a moment...then
continue through some high grass and thorned bushes being scratched,
etcetera.

A swarm of insects attack...Logan and Jessica fight them off:

						JESSICA (starting to panic)
			I hate outside! I hate it!

						LOGAN (holding her; 
					comforting tone)
			We'll be all right...
					(a beat)
			We will...

The sun is starting to go down...as they see a rabbit dart away in
the grass...startling them for a moment.
		
288XA1	FRANCIS
Coming out through the fissure in the rock, squinting at the
unexpected light from the sky, then setting out as Logan and Jessica
did.
		
288XB1	WITH LOGAN AND JESSICA - A BUSHY AREA

They come upon bushes of berries. Logan picks a few, looks at them
and smells them. As he is about to put them in his mouth...Jesslca
grabs hold of his hand.

						JESSICA
			Don't!

						LOGAN
			Sooner or later, we'll have to try
			something

Logan eats the berries...as Jessica watches intently.

After a beat

						LOGAN
			They're good.

Logan and Jessica pick berries and eat. When they are finished: 

						JESSICA
			It's getting dark and cold.	
			I'm tired.		

						LOGAN 
			Why don't we rest here? We know we can 
			eat these.

They sit on the ground.

LAP DISSOLVE TO:

288X1	TWO SHOT - LOGAN AND JESSICA - NIGHT	

Sitting on the ground.

Jessica is shivering. Logan has his arms around her trying to keep
her warm. 

						JESSICA 
			Where do you think that heat-ball went?

Logan shrugs.

						JESSICA
			Do you think everything's going to
			turn to ice?

						LOGAN
 			I doubt it.
	
						JESSICA
			Don't ever let go.

						LOGAN
			I won't.
	
After a long beat:

						LOGAN
			It all seemed to make sense until
			Box.

						JESSICA
			Do you think he was telling the
			Truth?

Logan shrugs.

						JESSICA (trying to 
					convince herself) 
			Maybe we're the first ones to get 
			through... 
					(hopeful tone) 
			Maybe Sanctuary is near, now... 
			another protected place. It couldn't 
			be outside.

						LOGAN (grunts) 
			How would anyone know? Even if we find 
			it -- we can never go back.

At her stricken look...Logan touches her in a caring way.

						LOGAN
			You're right...it must be near
			now. We'll find it.

						JESSICA (yawning;		
					closing her eyes; resting	
					on his shoulder)	
			Thirty thousand years didn't last
			very long, did they?
	
288X2	EXT. - BARREN TERRAIN - NIGHT - FRANCIS
	
Looking frightened as he looks up at the moon and the stars his gun
drawn.

Suddenly, a rabbit darts by.

Francis jumps up in great fear and starts FIRING his gun...blasting
the rabbit to smithereens.

He is breathing hard (fear)...and looking around...gun in hand.

288X3	EXT. - FOREST AREA - DAY - LOGAN AND JESSICA

walking in the hot sun...grimy...thirsty.

288X4	EXT. - FOREST AREA - FRANCIS

His face still betrays a wild, frightened look as he moves very
cautiously.

He reaches the bushes of berries and sees some of them on the
ground.

He picks a few off the bush...is ravenous...but finally...too
frightened that they might be some kind of poison to eat any.

As he angrily crushes the berries in his hand... then wipes his hand
on his trousers:

288X5	EXT. - FOREST AREA - LOGAN AND JESSICA

Seeing shimmering in the distance. They walk toward it.

288X6-
288X8	TRACKING SHOTS WITH LOGAN AND JESSICA

Reaching...

289		FULL ANGLE - A BROOK

They rush to it...drink...then undress...swim...and as they embrace
in the water:

						JESSICA
			Logan!!!Look!!
					(Logan turns around)
			No...your palm...look!!! 	

Logan looks at his palm...the blinking crystal is clear.

He grabs Jessica's hand and looks at her palm... the same.

						JESSICA (quietly)
			What does it mean?
	
						LOGAN (trying to
					assimilate its meaning
					himself)
			The Lifeclocks have no power outside. 

Jessica takes Logan's palm and kisses it.

						JESSICA (with laughter)
			You can have any woman in the city.
			What do you really want?

						LOGAN (straight)
			You know, Jessica.

						JESSICA. (a beat)
			...But I still have the choice...?

						LOGAN
			Of course.

						JESSICA
			Then the answer's Yes...

They embrace there in the water...
			
290 		OUT

291		HIGH ANGLE - SHOOTING DOWN - LOGAN AND JESSICA

Coming out of the forest...climbing up a green hilly area...reaching
the top and seeing:

292-301	OUT

301X1	ESTABLISHING SHOT - WASHINGTON, D.C. - MATTE COMPOSITE

The monument rising up out of a tangle of forest -- other buildings
gleaming, half hidden.  In the foreground Logan and Jessica walk

301X10	CLOSEUP - LOGAN AND JESSICA	

Looking up at statue.

						LOGAN 
			I have never seen a face like that 
			before. It must be the look of great 
			age. Whoever he was he was terribly old.

						JESSICA (beat) 
			Yes, do you think that's why he looks 
			so sad---?

Logan shrugs. They turn, start to EXIT from memorial.

301X11	INT. - MEMORIAL - HIGH ANGLE OVER STATUE'S BACK

301X16	CLOSEUP - LOGAN AND JESSICA	

As they pass the stones, Logan glances at them.

						LOGAN
			They all have names and numbers
			on them. I wonder what they are?

						JESSICA
			"Beloved Husband". "Beloved Wife".
			What can all that mean?
		
Just then their attention is focused by a distant SOUND as of
SHOUTING -- a man's voice. Jessica stops.
		
						JESSICA
			Francis?
		
Logan shakes his head. They EXIT cemetery toward capitol.
		
301X17	LONG SHOT - CAPITOL (MATTE COMPOSITE)

Logan and Jessica walking up steps toward building.

301X18	TWO SHOT - LOGAN AND JESSICA

Walking up the steps...many of which are cracked.

Logan and Jessica enter the ancient room. They stop and look around.

301X20	CLOSEUP - LOGAN AND JESSICA

They walk to the door and open it cautiously.

They EXIT right.

React, then they enter Senate and stop and look.

301X24	INT. - SENATE - OVER LOGAN AND JESSICA'S BACK - A WHITE
		HAIRED MAN OF S SIXTY-PLUS	

There are HUNDREDS OF CATS...and THOUSANDS OF BOOKS all over the
place.

						JESSICA (frowning; 
					whispering)
			Look at his face...and his hair... 
					(grimacing)
			Is that what it is to grow old?

						LOGAN (still stunned)
			It could be...

There are a COUPLE OF CATS on the man's lap as he turns and faces
Logan and Jessica...when he HEARS them move closer.

The man is stroking the cats calmly...unperturbed by the appearance
of Logan and Jessica.

						LOGAN
			How old are you?		

						MAN
			As old as I am I suppose...who
			knows ?

						LOGAN 
			Your hair is white.

						MAN		
			It wasn't always. I remember when		
			it wasn't. But it wasn't your	
			color either.
					(looking at Jessica) 
			...or yours. I have my color somewhere.

						JESSICA
			Those cracks in your face...do they hurt?

						MAN 
			Oh, no...

						JESSICA 
			Could I touch them?

						MAN
			Oh, my...please try.

Jessica walks up to the man and touches his face.

						JESSICA 
			What's your name?

						MAN
			I've forgotten. It's been so
			long since I've used it.
	
Logan and Jessica exchange a quick glance...feeling they have come
upon a nutsy, fruitsy cupcake.
	
						MAN
			But all of my cats have names.
	
						LOGAN
			Is that what they're called--
			cats?

						OLD MAN
			Yes, cats, of course. What else
			could they be? Cats. Of course
			each one has his own name too.
	
						JESSICA
			But there are so many of them.
			Do you know each one separately.
		
						OLD MAN
			Yes indeed, everyone. Actually,
			they all have three.
					(reciting)
			"The naming of cats is a difficult
			matter. It isn't just one of your
			holiday games. You may think at	
			first I'm mad as a hatter when I	
			tell you a cat must have THREE
			DIFFERENT NAMES."
					(a beat)
			An ordinary name and a fancy name.
			That's two. Do you want to guess
			what the third one is?
		
Logan and Jessica are silent.

						OLD MAN (reciting again)	
			"But above and beyond there's	
			still one name left over,	
			And that is the name that you
			never will guess;
			The name that no human research
			can discover -- -
			But THE CAT HIMSELF KNOWS, and
			will never confess."
					(reaching down and
					stroking another cat)
			Will you, my pet?
		
One of the cats jumps off his lap.

						OLD MAN (reciting)
			"Why did you go little fourpaws?
			You forgot to shut your big eyes."
					(the man closes his
					eyes for a moment; then:)
			"I have a Gumble Cat in mind!"
		
As the man opens his eyes:
	
						LOGAN
			How long have you been living
			here?
	
						OLD MAN
			For as long as I can remember.
	
						LOGAN
			What kind of place is this?
	
						OLD MAN
			Just a place, I suppose...who
			knows?

The man looks puzzled.

						LOGAN
			How did you get here?

						OLD MAN
			I have always been here...

						LOGAN			
			Are there any other humans?	
	
						OLD MAN
			Gracious...no.

						LOGAN 
			Have any other people ever passed 
			through?

The man shakes his head...then:

						OLD MAN 
			But there may be a few around somewhere.

						LOGAN 
			What makes you think so?

						OLD MAN 
			My parents thought so. Mother and 
			Father. You know?

						LOGAN (astonished) 
			Mother and -- ? You knew your mother 
			and father?

The man nods.

						JESSICA 
			And...and how were you grown? Inside
			your mother?

						OLD MAN
			Yes...

						JESSICA 
			Are you sure?

						OLD MAN 
			Mother and Father said so... you know?

						LOGAN 
			Where are they?

						OLD MAN
			Dead...they're dead...and buried.

						JESSICA (not knowing
					what it is)
			Buried???

Logan wheels...as he HEARS THE NOISE OF A DOOR SQUEAKING
SLIGHTLY...as it opens a bit wider:

302		CLOSE ON A CAT

Coming through the opening - did he push it?

303		CLOSE ON THE MAN

						OLD MAN (pleased; 
					reciting) 
			"Gus is the cat at the theatre door. 
			His name, as I ought to have told 
			you before, Is really Asparagus. 
			That's such a fuss To pronounce, 
			that we usually call him just Gus."

306		WIDER ANGLE - INCLUDING LOGAN AND JESSICA	

						OLD MAN
			May I see your hand again?

Logan and Jessica extend their left hands. The Old Man takes them,
looks from one to another with delight.
		
						OLD MAN
			They're beautiful. May I have
			one too please?
		
						LOGAN
			No--I'm sorry. It's not possible.
			
						OLD MAN (offended)
			It isn't fair. I'll give you one
			of my favorite cats...a Jellicle
			cat.
					(reciting)
			"Jellicle cats have cheerful faces,
			Jellicle cats have bright black eyes;
			They like to practice their airs and graces
			And wait for the Jellicle Moon to rise."


						LOGAN	
			I'm sorry but I don't have anything to 
			give you.	
		
As the man continues to look petulant:

						JESSICA (simply; 
					sincerely)
			That's the truth.

Jessica takes off a ring and hands it to the man.

						JESSICA
			Here you can have this.

The man seems pleased.
	
						OLD MAN
			What kind of jewel is this?

						JESSICA
			I don't know.
	
						OLD MAN
			You're both full of secrets like
			Macavity.	
					(looking at the ring)
			Did you steal this?
	
						JESSICA
			No.
		
						OLD MAN 
					(reciting)
			"Macavity, Macavity, there's no
			one like Macavity,
			There never was a cat of such
			deceitfulness and suavity."
	
						LOGAN
			What's beyond this place - do you
			know?
	
						OLD MAN
			No, no, no
		
						LOGAN
			Did your Mother or Father ever
			mention another place?
	
						OLD MAN
			Never, never, ever. Nothing.

After a pause:

						LOGAN	
			May we stay here for a while?	
			We'd like to rest.	

						OLD MAN
			Of course you can stay. This
			belongs to the people.

						JESSICA
			What belongs to the people?

						OLD MAN
			All this. All of it.
		
						JESSICA
			What people?
			
						OLD MAN
			I don't know...but it does.

The man stands...and starts walking toward a door to an adjoining
room.

						OLD MAN
			I'll be right back.
					(stopping)
			Oh, yes...about the cats...
			one rule is true:
					(reciting)
			"Don't speak till you are spoken to."
			
The man smiles and leaves.
		
305		LOGAN AND JESSICA 	

Logan clears two chairs of cats and they sit down.

Jessica picks up a book and starts leafing through it.

Logan is deep in thought.

Jessica looks up from the book.

						JESSICA (quietly)
			How curious people used to be --
			All these books...

Silence...until:

						LOGAN
			That sweet madman -- how could he
			Come to exist?
	
						JESSICA	
			He had a mother and father --	
			and he knew them.	

						LOGAN
			One in a million, I suppose

						LOGAN AND JESSICA (together; 
					smiling) 
			...Who knows? 

						JESSICA (after a beat) 
			We're going on, aren't we?

						LOGAN 
					(shaking his head) 
			There's nothing to go on to, Jessica.

Logan continues to shake his head through Jessica's following line:

						JESSICA 
			There's a Sanctuary...there is!

						LOGAN
			You want there to be one...that
			Doesn't...

						JESSICA (interrupting; 
					urgent tone) 
			There has to be! I know it exists! It 
			has to!!

						LOGAN (gently) 
			No, there doesn't. Not really --just so 
			many want it to exist...so many who 
			don't want to die...want it so much 
			that a place called Sanctuary becomes 
			"real". But it doesn't exist. It never 
			existed. Just the hope.

						JESSICA (becoming	
					hysterical)
			You're wrong!! It has to be!!
			It Just has to be!!

As Logan takes her in his arms...comforting her:

306		FULL ANGLE - INCLUDING THE MAN

The man returns with a portrait in hand.

						OLD MAN	
			Oh, my don't cry.

The man proudly shows them the portrait....which is a portrait of
himself in his twenties. He sort of brushes the hair...which is rich
auburn.

						OLD MAN (gesturing) 
			There are larger pictures of other 
			people over there. I don't know who 
			they are. Perhaps they're family.

She man leads Logan across the chamber to a far corner.

307		CLOSE ON - JESSICA	

Remaining near the podium. She is dejected. Logan's argument that
there is no Sanctuary has sunk in and taken hold.

308 		OUT

308x1	THE CORNER - LOGAN AND THE OLD MAN

We see portraits of Presidents of the United States.

We can recognize all of them...with the exception of the dozen or so
that come after Ford.

As Logan looks at the portraits he recognizes Lincoln.

						LOGAN 
			That's the same fellow who's outside. 
			If he was so important - why isn't he 
			first?

The old man shakes his head.

309		INT - SENATE CHAMBER - CLOSE ON - JESSICA	

As Francis suddenly appears alongside her.

Jessica is terrified...speechless. Francis glances across the
chamber, sees Logan. When he speaks, it is softly but urgently.

						FRANCIS 
			What did you do to him?

Jessica is silent. Francis' tone becomes increasingly sexual.

						FRANCIS	
			Why? Why you?	
					(grabbing her)	
			Do you know you ruined him? Do
			you know that? Can you tell me
			why? Why you?
					(a beat)
			And now you've killed him, you
			know...

Francis starts to tear off her clothes...obviously to rape...but his
expression remains cold and without passion.

						JESSICA (screaming) 
			Logan!!!

As she screams, Francis clamps a hand over her mouth and drags her
O.S.

310 		OUT

310x1	LOGAN

hears the scream, wheels -- sees nothing for a moment.

311		INT. - SENATE CHAMBER

						FRANCIS' VOICE 
			Here!!!!

Logan looks up...and we see Francis crouched behind the railing of
the first row of the gallery...with his gun pointing down at Logan,
holding the terrified Jessica with his other arm.

						OLD MAN (cheerfully) 
			How nice...more company...

						FRANCIS (emotional; 
					disjointed thoughts) 
			We had such good times together... 
			I let you go! 
					(frenzied) 
			You didn't terminate a Runner and 
			I let you go!!
					(a beat)
			She did this to us! How could you
			let her?! An ordinary available??!!
					(with this he flings
					Jessica down and away.
					She lies there...stunned)
			And what about Logan-6 and Francis-8? 
					(a tear in his eye)
			....Why didn't you chink about them?!
					(up a notch)
			There's over two hundred years of
			Sandmen's blood in you, Logan....
			and now you'll spill it for a
			stinking Runner!!

312		CLOSE ON - LOGAN

Holding up his right palm.

						LOGAN 
			Look at your palm, Francis.... 
			look! It's clear. Clear!

313		REVERSE ANGLE - FRANCIS

Looking at his palm....shocked...dropping his gun. It falls on the
CHAMBER FLOOR.

						FRANCIS 
			Why did you do that??!!

						LOGAN
			I didn't do anything, Francis!
			They've made us believe that....

						FRANCIS (interrupting; 
					wild) 
			Why did you do that???!!!

Francis leaps from the gallery and falls on Logan.

314		WIDE ANGLE - CATS

Scattering in all directions as:

315-319	CLOSE ACTION SHOTS - FRANCIS AND LOGAN

In hand to hand combat punching...Kicking...wrestling

320		INTERCUT WITH: JESSICA AND THE MAN REACTING

Jessica deeply disturbed...The man enjoying himself as if Logan and
Francis were putting on a show for him.

321-331	THE FIGHT- SERIES OF SHOTS

A. Francis manages to pick up a chair and smashes it down on Logan.

B. As Logan slumps to the floor and Francis cries to follow through
his advantage by crushing Logan's face with his foot:

C. Logan grabs Francis' foot and twists it...sending Francis reeling
backward.

D. Standing, Logan grabs a table and hurls it at Francis...who
ducks.

E. Francis sees a steel flagpole (with an American flag that has
sixty-one stars) and takes hold of it.

F. Francis moves toward Logan...with the menacing steel flagpole in
front of him.

G. Logan is wary...watching every movement of the steel pole.

H. Francis swings the steel pole twice...We can HEAR the WHISH-WHISH
as it cuts through the air...with Logan avoiding the blows.

I. On the third swing...Logan grabs hold of the steel pole and
swings around on it...kicking Francis in the chest.

J. Francis lets go of the steel pole as he staggers backward.
Francis and Logan look at one another for a brief anguished moment
as Logan crashes the steel pole (which he is now holding) down on
Francis' head.

K. Francis crumbles to the floor. Feebly, he raises a hand toward
Logan...

Logan touches Francis' hand and Francis grasps his wrist, holding
death off with the strong grip.

						FRANCIS (delirious)	
			That was the right shot--Look out	
			there, he's trying to break free		
			Watch it, Logan, steady, now!......

His eyes focus briefly and he sees Logan's palm-the crystal shining
clear and white. Francis is suddenly radiant.

						FRANCIS 
			Logan! You renewed!

And he is dead.	DIRECT CUT TO:
	
332		JESSICA AND THE MAN

The man walks over to Francis and bends down.

						OLD MAN
			Oh, my...he died...

333		CLOSE ON - LOGAN

Rubbing his face with the palms of his hands...clearly upset.

334		ANOTHER ANGLE - INCLUDING JESSICA AND THE MAN

						OLD MAN
			We¹ll have to bury him.

						JESSICA
			What¹s that?

						OLD MAN
			They¹re put into the ground so
			they can be visited by the living...

Logan¹s eyes are glistening with tears.  The man starts out.

						OLD MAN
			I¹ll make the arrangements.

						JESSICA (softly)
			At least it¹s over...

Jessica¹s words don¹t help as Logan shakes his head...then:

						OLD MAN
			Are you ready to put him in?
	
						LOGAN
			Not yet.

						OLD MAN
			All right.

The man sits down.

Gently, Logan lifts Francis¹ body...trying to straighten him out
from the slightly twisted position he assumed when he fell to the
floor.

After resting Francis¹ body on the floor again.  He cradles Francis¹
head in his arms.

DISSOLVE TO:

335-338	OUT

339		EXT. - HIGH ANGLE - CEMETERY - NIGHT - SHOOTING DOWN 

						OLD MAN'S VOICE 
			"Vigil wondrous and vigil sweet there 
			in the fragrant silent night."

339X1	CLOSER ANGLE - CEMETERY

As they look down at Francis' body...in the open grave.

Jessica watches as Logan and the man start shoveling dirt into the
grave...starting to fill it.

339X2	JESSICA

quietly watching:

DISSOLVE TO:
		
339X3	INT. - SENATE - NEXT MORNING

On Logan sleeping - Jessica and Old Man in a spirited but soft
conversation in a far corner.

As Logan wakes he hears:

						OLD MAN
			Of course...that's settled then.
			But just you remember your promise...

						JESSICA 
			We'll remember. But that's a long time 
			off...

She sees Logan awake and listening, crosses to him, smiling. Logan
rises to her.

						LOGAN 
			What are we promising him? What can we 
			possibly give him?

						JESSICA 
			He asked if we would bury him when his 
			time comes.

						 LOGAN (beat)
			We can't. We're going back.

						JESSICA 
			To what?

						LOGAN		
			I'm going to try and tell people what 
			we've seen and--

						JESSICA (interrupting) 
			You're lying! You'll never have the 
			chance to tell anybody anything! 
			You'll be killed the moment you're seen!

						LOGAN 
			Do you expect me to let things go on 
			without trying to change them?!

						JESSICA 
			Things won't change...you know that! 
			We can live here together, Logan...
			have a life as long as his... together!

						LOGAN (showing his palm) 
			Things change!

						JESSICA
			You want to go back to kill, is that it?! 
			Now, you'll want to kill your own!!! kill 
			Sandmen!!! Killing's all you ever...!!!!

Logan shakes Jessica who is becoming hysterical.

						LOGAN (softly) 
			Jessica...listen to me...listen to me...
					(as she quiets down)
			The Lifeclocks made me kill
			Francis. They make people die or
			be killed every day. If I didn't
			try and destroy that...I couldn't
			live here or anywhere. Do you
			understand?

						JESSICA
			I want to be alive and with you,
			that's all I want.

Logan puts his arms around her.

						LOGAN 
			I know...I know...

The Old Man comes to them, wondering.

						LOGAN 
			We're leaving.

						 OLD MAN		
			What a pity. I was hoping you'd	
			be here to bury me.	

						JESSICA 
			Come with us.

						OLD MAN 
			Where are you going?

						LOGAN 
			To a city with thousands and thousands 
			of people.

						OLD MAN 
			Alive?

Logan nods.

						OLD MAN 
			Thousands and thousands...as many as 
			my cats?

						LOGAN 
			More...many more.

						OLD MAN 
			And all alive you say?

Logan nods.

						OLD MAN
			Yes, I would like to see that. Is it 
			a long journey?

Again, Logan nods.

						OLD MAN (mumbling) 
			Thousands and thousands alive... oh, my...

340-349	OUT

350		HIGH ANGLE - GREENBELT AREA - SHOOTING DOWN - DAY

Logan, Jessica and the Old MAN are walking...with the Capitol
Building blurred by overgrown foliage receding in the b.g. of the
SHOT.	

351-361 	OUT

361X1	EXT. - FOREST AREA - AFTERNOON

The Old Man has picked Some wild vegetables...and hands a piece to
Logan and a piece to Jessica.

As they hesitate...the Old Man bites into it... heartily. 

As Logan and Jessica start eating it, too:

						OLD MAN (marveling tone) 
			Never see the sun or the moon... 
			I hope we get there soon...

361X1A	NIGHT - WOODED AREA - CLOSE	

On Logan, Jessica and the Old Man as they emerge from a small grove
of trees and stand looking O.S. past CAMERA Behind, a flicker of
firelight.

						OLD MAN (weary but
					enthusiastic)
			Is that really it? It doesn't
			seem very far. Will we be there
			soon?

						LOGAN
			I promise. We '11 go on as soon
			as it's light.

						JESSICA (gently, 
					turning O.M. away) 
			But now I'm tired. Let's go back to 
			the fire...

They turn, the Old Man still marveling at the sight.

P.O.V. WHAT THEY SEE (TO BE INTERCUT)

NIGHT (Matte) view of the domed city seen through a fringe of trees and beyond distance hills.

361X1B	EXT. - WOODED AREA - NIGHT

As the three return to where a small fire is burning on the ground.

						OLD MAN 
			That's better than gold when it's cold.

						LOGAN		
			Thank you.			
					(turning to Old Man)	
			Tell me - what do those words mean?
			"Beloved husband²...²Beloved son"...
			"Beloved wife"'...

						OLD MAN
			My father was the husband and my
			mother was the wife. "Beloved" is	
			a word they used - to stay together.

						LOGAN 
			Stay? They lived together all their years?

						OLD MAN 
			Oh, yes...I think...

						JESSICA (reading; 
					moved) 
			³Beloved son²... 
					(a beat) 
			So people stayed together for that 
			feeling of love... They would live and 
			raise children together and be remembered. 
					(another beat) 
			I think I feel that way, Logan. Can we 
			be that way?

						LOGAN (facing Jessica) 
			Yes. You and I, Jessica. 
					(a beat)

						JESSICA		
			And Sanctuary?		

						LOGAN 
			Sanctuary is the right to live.... 
			nothing more. But nothing less, either....

There is a long beat...then Jessica snuggles up to Logan...she is
ready for sleep.

						JESSICA (whispering)
			Beloved husband...

						LOGAN (kissing her)
			Beloved wife...

361X5	EXT. - WOODED AREA - NIGHT - LOGAN, JESSICA AND THE OLD MAN
	
As they walk the great glowing dome is visible in the distance.

The Old Man marvels at what he sees...they walk on.

362		LONG, LONG ANGLE - LOGAN JESSICA AND THE OLD MAN - DAY

Walking up the beach toward the domed city. We get an idea of the
scale. They appear as ants in front of redwood trees.

363 		OUT

364		LOGAN, JESSICA AND THE OLD MAN

Approaching. The wave power inlet in f.g. They

HEAR: THE ROAR OF THE WATER

As they approach cautiously...they see:

365		WAVE POWER INLET

Waves pounding over ACRES OF STRANGE STEPPED CONSTRUCTION...
DESCENDING TO A VORTEX.

						JESSICA
			What does that water do?

						LOGAN
			It's part of the hydrogalvanic
			system. The ocean tides are changed
			into energy somehow.

						JESSICA
			Is it inside the city?

						LOGAN
			Of course.
					(a beat)
			I don't know where...
					(frowning)
			I Just took them for granted. 
					(Logan takes Jessica's hand)
			It's our only chance.

The CAMERA PANS LOGAN, JESSICA and the OLD MAN down the STRANGE
STEPPED CONSTRUCTION until they reach:

366		FULL ANGLE - A POOL OF WATER

At the CENTER of this IMMENSE WATER FLOWING CONSTRUCTION OF STEPS.

After a beat Jessica looks at the Old Man:
		
						LOGAN (softly)	
			I know...
					(after a beat; to the
					Old Man)
			We're going to try and get in this
			way. I don't think you can make it.

						OLD MAN (sadly)
			Oh...I did so look forward to seeing
			all those people.

						LOGAN
			I'm sorry.

						OLD MAN
			Yes...

						LOGAN
			Can you make it back?

						OLD MAN
			Oh my...I'll try. 

						JESSICA (kissing the Old Man)
			Goodbye.

						OLD MAN
			Oh, my...

The Old Man watches Logan and Jessica dive into the POOL and
disappear.

367		THE OLD MAN

he bends and plays with the water in the POOL for a moment...like a
young child at a pond or lake.

368		INT. - POWER CENTER OF THE CITY - LOGAN AND JESSICA 

Emerging from the water.

It is a labyrinth of humming turbines, automonitored cables and
impulse collectors.

Logan leads her swiftly through the humming maze toward an exit.

369-
369Xl 	OUT

369AX2	GREAT HALL - AT CAROUSEL ENTRANCE

As the CROWD is pouring in:

						LOGAN'S VOICE
			No!! Don't go in there !!

The CROWD turns and looks up at:

369X2	LOGAN

On a high balcony in the Great Hall.

Looking down at them.

						LOGAN 
			You don't have to die!! No one has 
			to die at thirty!!! You don't have 
			to blink out on Lastday. There's no 
			renewal on Carrousel! You can live 
			longer and grow old... I've seen it.
			She's seen it!! Believe me!!

There is an angry murmur in the CROWD as Logan continues:

						LOGAN (holding up
					his palm)
			See... it's' clear. The Lifeclocks
			are a lie - Carousel is a lie!!

369X3	WIDEN ANGLE - INCLUDING SANDMEN

Trying to grab Logan. There is a struggle. Some Sandmen are knocked
over the railing.

But remaining Sandmen fire a gas tranquilizer which subdues Logan
and Jessica.

The CROWD cheers...and continues into Carousel as:

370		INT. - SANDMAN DEBRIEFING AREA

It is the same area where Logan received the original assignment to
find and destroy Sanctuary.

In the rear...with the panel open...the sign reading:
	
		PROBABILITY	
				
blinks on and off.		

Logan is dragged in by a number of SANDMEN.

We see Jessica , too, still groggy, being held by SANDMEN in the
b.g. of the SHOT.

Logan is placed on the chair in which his CRYSTAL was altered.

371		CLOSE ANGLE - LOGAN IN THE CHAIR

A shaft of light glows on and he stiffens - bound by it.

372 		OUT

372X1-
372X3	FULL SHOT - LOGAN AND THE SCREEN

As around him in the air, a series of spectral greenish HEADS appear
-- one after the other -in response to questions. Each of these
heads is Logan. Each revolves slowly on its axis as it responds.

As the real Logan (in the chair) is questioned, each of the heads
answers in turn. They are each a part of his persona and his brain.

373-378 	OUT

378X1-
378X18	INTERCUT WITH CLOSER SHOTS OF LOGAN HIMSELF WRITHING IN
		AGONY AS THE IMPASSIVE HEADS SPEAK.

ANOTHER ANGLE - LOGAN AND HEADS

A. 						FIRST HEAD SPEAKS
					(Logan's voice)
			A Jewelry store. 

B. Logan himself - twisting in pain.

C. The word NEGATIVE appears on the SCREEN.

D.						A SECOND HEAD
					(Logan's voice)
			A creature called Box - all frozen, 
			all frozen.

E. Logan writhes in the chair.		
			
F. Again the word NEGATIVE appears on the SCREEN.	

G. 						A THIRD IDENTICAL HEAD
					(Logan's Voice)
			No...There is no Sanctuary.

H. The SCREEN seems to shimmer. It blinks.

I. A third time the word negative appears on the SCREEN.

J. 						A FOURTH HEAD 
					(Logan's voice)
			There is no Sanctuary

K. The SCREEN'S glow increases...to an almost blinding light...
starting to frighten the Sandmen present.

L. At the same time, we see JESSICA coming out of her tranquilized
daze...fearful...still in the Sandmen's custody.

M.						A FIFTH HEAD
					(Logan's voice)
			An old man without a crystal...But
			there is no Sanctuary.

N. Now the SCREEN is starting to spark. Behind it we SEE the
intermittent glow of overheated electronic components.

O. And we see the word negative...once more on the SCREEN -- but
broken now.

P. 						A SIXTH HEAD 
					(Logan's voice)
			There is no Sanctuary.

Q. Now the noise and the light from the SCREEN are peaking...and we
can see the increasing fear of the Sandmen.

R. On the SCREEN the word negative is beginning to shake...as the
SCREEN begins to shake.

379		FULL ANGLE - THE SIX HEADS

						LOGAN'S VOICE (emanating
					 from all of them)
			There is no Sanctuary. There is
			no Sanctuary.

The sign PROBABILITY bursts...the SIX HEADS of Logan go out.	 

The noise and the light coming out of the screen Increase, as it
begins to burst into showers of sparks and flame.

380-410 	OUT

410X1	ANOTHER ANGLE - LOGAN

Straining twisting, as the light above him bursts, goes out in a
puff of smoke -- releasing him. Logan staggers to his feet in time
to meet:

410X2	SANDMEN

Rushing in from the Ready Room to join the others who have closed in
on Logan One holding Jessica.

410X3	LOGAN AND SANDMEN
	
Manages to get one of the Sandmen's guns, instantly blasting him
with it. In the noise and confusion, the fight becomes general. A
Sandman fires back at Logan, misses -- the shot hits one of the
Lifeclocks which flares electrically, ribboning out a great arc.
Instantly Logan gets off a couple of shots at the other Lifeclocks
which similarly flare and burst into violent electrical fire and
discharges.

410X4	THE BATTLE

The electrical discharges, smoke and noise making great confusion.
Sandmen hampered by their own numbers and by trying to miss the
machinery. Logan firing methodically at the Lifeclocks, moving.
Stumbles over Jessica, prone in the smoke. Helps her to her feet.
Crouched, they make for the exit.

410X5	ANOTHER ANGLE - THE. SCREEN	

Sputtering its life out in strange predictive words....PROBABILITY
flashing on and off.... EQUILIBRIUM...DESTRUCT...EQUIL...NO
BALANCE...NO BALANCE...FAMINE... INACCEPTABLE ...NO BALANCE...etc.,
flashing vainly through the eddying smoke and the fierce discharges
which fill the great room.

410X6	SANDMEN

The battle is lost -- the smoke and noise overwhelming. They pick up
their wounded and get out as best they can.

410X7	INT. SANDMAN H.Q. LOBBY

Sandmen rushing out through the gathering smoke and the flare of
fire behind them.

410X8	EXT. SANDMAN H.Q.

Sandmen pouting out through smoke and fire effects. Pushing through
passers-by herding everyone away from the scene.

People getting the hell out of there.

Ad Libs: Get away from here. The whole thing's going.

410X9	INT. LIFECLOCK ROOM

Through the smoke, etc. The Lifeclocks EXPLODE.

410X10	EXT. SANDMAN H.Q.

The building EXPLODES -- great geyser of flame shooting upward.

410X11	GREAT HALL

The sound of the explosion creates panic. Lights begin to flicker.
The great red crystal lights fitfully on and off. People are
panicking, running in different directions. Some pressing into
Carrousel for safety.

410X12	CAROUSEL

As people run in there, the red crystal glowing and sputtering, the
petals moving spasmodically. As people look, the white crystal comes
on, begins spinning wildly, bursting into strange, lancing lights. A
great roaring commences and the whole arena starts to rock with the
crystals. Now the white crystal explodes and the whole room is
crisscrossed with deadly arcing discharges. People flee the scene of
destruction.

410X13	GREAT HALL

The panic is-full, people getting the hell out of there.

410X14	ARCADE

People are stampeding like cattle, all heading down and for the
exits, trampling  each other in their fright.

410X15-
X21		PANIC MONTAGE SERIES OF CUTS

A. EXT. The City under the dome -- fitfully lit as the dome itself
seems to be cracking strange electrical discharges emanating from it
as from a gigantic line storm.

B. The lights in Arcade flicker and go dim.

C. The chandeliers in Arcade swaying, a couple falling onto the
screaming panicky people.

D. Maze-Car Station. People fighting to cram into cars. Car lights
go out. People turn and bolt in another direction.

E. Love Shop -- pandemonium as the drugged bodies clamber over each
other in fear, struggling to get away.

F. Great Hall emptying -- the signs of panic everywhere.

G. The great crystal -- a wildly spluttering electrical fire
wrecking it.


410X22	EXT. - DOMED CITY - FIRE FX AND CRACKING 

INTERCUT with above:

410X23	LOGAN AND JESSICA

Making their way through Cathedral -- out the dazzle chamber,
running O.S. past Maze Car Station.

410X24	LOGAN AND JESSICA
		
Running past Power Center.

411	EXT. - CITY - FULL SHOT

The dome of the city torn. Lightning effects playing on the stunned
people...who look up and see the starry heavens, too, as they
stumble forward into the darkness.

A wind begins to blow...where air had never stirred anything. There
is a sense of wonder. Hysteria is lessening...as the people find
themselves moving through the crack...as they discover the fact that
the crystals have disappeared from their palms.

Some are joyful...others frightened...others puzzled...as they
emerge from the crack in the dome at:

412		FULL ANGLE - THE ACRES OF STRANGE STEPPED CONSTRUCTION
	
We can still see the fires in the b.g. of the SHOT as Logan holds on
to Jessica...(like Gable onto Jeanette MacDonald at the end of SAN
FRANCISCO)...full of happiness and hope for the future.

AS people continue to mill all over the acres of strange stepped
construction...we see the Old Man WALKING INTO THE SHOT.

Logan and Jessica run to him. He looks around. People start to
gather...they have never seen a white-haired Old Man in their lives.

As people continue to gather around the Old Man... who couldn't be
more delighted...Logan and Jessica are smiling...inviting people to
touch him...and some do.

Yes, he is an old man...Yes, they will all live again to be old men
and old women...Yes, this is the world renewing itself once again.

FADE OUT:

          EXT. EDGE OF CORN FIELDS - DAY

          A pocket watch. Open. Ticking. Swinging from a chain.
          Held by a young man named JOE in a clearing beside a Kansas
          corn field. Sky pregnant with rain.
          Waiting. He checks the watch, removes his earbud headphones,
          stands.
          Without much ceremony a BLOODIED MAN in a suit appears from
          thin air, kneeling before the young man. Hands and feet
          tied. Burlap sack over his head. Muffled screams, gagged.
          With no hesitation Joe raises a squat gun and blows the man
          apart with a single cough of a shot.

                         LATER
          Joe loads the corpse into the flatbed of his truck.
          Cuts open the back of the body's jacket, revealing FOUR bars
          of gold taped to the dead man's back. Joe takes them.

          EXT. INDUSTRIAL PLANT - DAY

          Massive, in the middle of nowhere. Black smoke.

          JOE (V.O.)
          Time travel has not yet been
          invented. But twenty five years
          from now it will be. Once the
          technology exists, it will be
          relatively cheap and available to
          the public at large. And so. It
          will be instantly outlawed, used
          only in secret by the largest
          criminal organizations. And then
          only for a very specific purpose.
          Joe drives up and parks his truck, removes the wrapped corpse
          from the flatbed.

          JOE (V.O.) (CONT'D)
          It's nearly impossible to dispose
          of a body in the future. I'm told.
          Tagging techniques, whatnot. So
          when these future criminal
          organizations in the future need
          someone gone, they use specialized
          assassins in our present, called
          loopers.

          INT. INDUSTRIAL PLANT - DAY

          Cavernous and empty. Joe carries the body to an iron hatch,
          opens it, and dumps him in.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          2.

          JOE (V.O.)
          And so. Thirty years from now. My
          employers in the future nab the
          target, they zap him back to me,
          their looper. And I do the
          necessaries. So the target has
          vanished from the future, and I've
          just disposed of a body that
          technically does not exist. Clean.
          The body slides down a long chute. Vanishes in a little
          flare of angry red fire.

          EXT. DINER - DAY

          A sidecar roadside diner in the middle of nowhere. Joe's
          truck in front.

          INT. DINER

          Nearly empty, Joe at a booth listening to headphones. A
          waitress sets down coffee.
          Her bright red name tag: BEATRIX.

                         BEATRIX
          Bon jour, Joe.

                         JOE
          Bon jour, Beatrix.

                         BEATRIX
          How's the French?

                         JOE
          Slow. How's the coffee?

                         BEATRIX
          Burnt.
          Cream in the coffee. White clouds boil deep down.

          EXT. FARMLAND ROAD - DAY

          Joe's truck zooms from the flat fields towards a mid sized
          city on the horizon.

          INT. PAWN SHOP - DAY

          Grungy, heavily fortified. Joe enters and puts his gun in a
          basket labeled âLOOPERS - BLUNDERBUSSESâ
          Slips down a narrow passage, which ends at a steel wall with
          a protruding duct taped camera and microphone.

                         JOE
          Two, Jedd.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          3.
          Joe fishes the two gold bars from his jacket.
          A small narrow slot slides open in the wall, and gnarled old
          hands take the gold bars. It slides shut again.
          In the background the front door to the pawn shop dings open.
          The slot slides open and Jedd's hands push a wad of cash.
          Joe pockets it, and backs around Dale, another Looper.

                         DALE
          Hey Joe. Be at the Belle tonight?

                         JOE
          Yup.
          Dale hands four gold bars through the slot as Joe retrieves
          his gun and exits.

                         DALE
          Four, Jedd.

          INT. JOE'S APARTMENT - AFTERNOON

          High ceilings, big clean windows overlooking a sooty city.
          Joe finishes smoothing out an oriental rug and scoots a
          coffee table in place over it.
          Puts a bebop LP on a turntable.

                         LATER
          On the bed, shooting at the ceiling with his fingers.

                         JOE
          Bon jour, mademoiselle. Bang!

          INT. CAR GARAGE - EVENING

          Suit-and-tie Joe pulls a tarp off a cherried-out 1992 Mazda
          Miata. Lingers over it. His baby.

          EXT. CITY STREETS - EARLY EVENING

          Joe drives through the sooty city streets. A muted beep, and
          he fishes a matchbook sized screen from his pocket.

                         JOE
          Yeah Seth? Yeah. Ok.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          4.

          EXT. STREET CORNER - EARLY EVENING

          A young looper named SETH on the side of the road, kneeling
          beside a motorcycle without wheels called a SLAT BIKE. He
          kicks it in frustration.
          A VAGRANT approaches and SETH pulls a gun, identical to
          Joe's.

                         SETH
          Walk around! Around, I'm not
          kidding. Wide around, ya shit.
          The vagrant crosses the street. Joe pulls up.

                         JOE
          Seth.

                         SETH
          Hi Joe.

                         JOE
          That's new.
          Seth kicks the bike.

                         SETH
          Thanks. Goddamn thing. You going
          to the Belle?

          EXT. DRIVING THROUGH THE CITY STREETS

          Seth and Joe.

                         JOE
          Slat Bikes are all junk. Stick
          with rubber on the road.

                         SETH
          Yeah but Gat Men pull up in them,
          they get respect.

                         JOE
          They get respect cause they run the
          town. How much did that thing set
          you back? How much?
          Seth holds a quarter idly in his palm.

                         SETH
          I was gonna pull up in it.
          Tonight. Heads or tails, call it
          in the air.
          The coin lifts, floats several inches in the air, quivering.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          5.

                         JOE
          Congratulations. You're pulling up
          with me instead.
          Joe notices the floating quarter.

                         JOE (CONT'D)
          And don't, if we're going in, don't
          do that.

                         SETH
          Chicks dig TKs.

                         JOE
          It's tacky, don't do it.
          Seth catches the quarter, sullen.

          JOE (V.O.) (CONT'D)
          When the TK mutation started
          appearing in the general populace
          it was on every magazine - âNext
          Step in Evolution, what's next.â
          Everyone got tested. But turns out
          this was it, and now it's just a
          bunch of assholes thinking they're
          blowing your mind by floating
          quarters.

          EXT. LA BELLE AURORE - NIGHT

          A shitty but bright nightclub in the heart of the city.
          Flashy people shiver behind a velvet rope, huge black cars,
          big rollers in odd suits swept in by the bouncers.
          All trying very hard to be big time.

          JOE (V.O.)
          Big heads. Small potatoes.
          Drives past, revving the engine.

          EXT. PARKING LOT

          Down the street. Joe tosses the keys to an attendant.

          EXT. LA BELLE AURORE SIDE ENTRANCE

          A dingy stage door in back of the building. Joe and Seth
          ring a buzzer, smile for a camera, and the door opens.

          INT. COAT CHECK

          A long dark hallway leads to a tiny antechamber with a coat
          check room used for guns. BIG CRAIG leans out of it, and
          stops the two.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          6.

                         BIG CRAIG
          No loopers in the club on
          Wednesdays, Joe. Gat men only.
          Seth backs towards the door, Joe stops him.

                         JOE
          We'll stick backstage, just meeting
          up. In and out.

                         BIG CRAIG
          Packing your blunderbusses?

                         JOE
          Hardly. Right Seth?

                         SETH
          Hardly. I'm with Joe.
          Big Craig pats them down, waves them in.

          INT. BACKSTAGE

          A claustrophobic maze of twisty halls and passages.
          DANGEROUS MEN and half naked SHOW GIRLS weave through.
          Joe expertly navigates the turns, going someplace. Seth
          struggles to keep up.

                         SETH
          So are we - hey -
          Joe has vanished. Seth stops meekly, butted by passing men.

          INT. BORDELLO ENTRANCE

          An ornate parlor, LACY WOMEN entertaining men. A velvet
          curtained doorway leads to back rooms.
          Joe lingers by the entrance, watching one girl in particular,
          SUZIE. Bold dark eye makeup. A BIG MAN leads her off
          through the curtains. Joe's eyes drop. Pained.
          A fat MADAME doesn't look up from her ledger.

                         MADAME
          No loopers on Wednesday, Joe. Gat
          Men only.

                         JOE
          So I've read.
          He ducks out.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          7.

          INT. BACKSTAGE

          Joe plods. Dale, the Looper from the pawn shop, passes fast.
          Curious, Joe follows. They pass Seth, who tails after them.

                         SETH
          Hey, Joe. We leaving? Cuz, what-
          Joe?
          And Seth loses them again, butted back by passing men.

          INT. STEEP STAIRS

          A starkly lit steep stairwell leads down. Five or six young
          loopers gather at the top. Joe and Dale join them.

                         JOE
          What?

                         DALE
          Zach. In there right now, with
          Abe.
          Dale makes a quarter float above his palm. Joe rolls his
          eyes.

                         JOE
          For what?

                         DALE
          He closed his loop.
          This lands heavily on Joe.

                         JOE
          No shit?
          The door at the bottom of the stairs opens, and ZACH, another
          looper, steps out. An OLDER MAN'S HAND pats his shoulder
          then retracts into the door.
          The loopers watch him in awe.

          JOE (V.O.) (CONT'D)
          There's a reason we're called
          loopers.

          EXT. ABANDONED LOT - DAY (FLASHBACK)

          Zach stands waiting, checking his wristwatch, gun in hand.
          Obviously performing a similar ritual to Joe's.

          JOE (V.O.)
          Time travel in the future is so
          illegal, that when we sign up for
          this job we agree to a very
          specific proviso.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          8.
          Zach raises his gun.

          JOE (V.O.) (CONT'D)
          If our employers in the future get
          busted up by the law, their first
          priority is going to be erasing any
          trace of their relationship with us
          ever existing.
          A flash of light, and a HOG TIED MAN with a sack over his
          head kneels in front of Zach.
          Zach fires, and the man's chest explodes.

          JOE (V.O.) (CONT'D)
          So. If they're busted, and if
          we're still alive 30 years from
          now, they'll find our older self
          and zap him back to us, like any
          other job.
          Zach rips open the back of the corpse's jacket, revealing
          several dozen gold bars taped to his back.

          JOE (V.O.) (CONT'D)
          This is called closing your loop.
          Zach freezes. Looks at the shape of the corpse's face
          through the sack.

          JOE (V.O.) (CONT'D)
          And you get paid out a mythic
          amount of money, and you get a
          handshake and get released from
          your contract. Enjoy the next 30
          years.

          INT. STEEP STAIRS

          Zach reaches the top of the stairs, a grin on his face.

          JOE (V.O.)
          This job doesn't tend to attract
          the most forward thinking people.

                         ZACH
          So are we celebrating?
          At the bottom of the stairs, a skinny young thug in ratty
          jeans. This is KID BLUE.

                         KID BLUE
          No loopers on fucking Wednesdays!
          The loopers collectively flip him off.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          9.

                         ZACH
          Suck one, kid!

          INT. LA BELLE AURORE CLUB - NIGHT

          Lurid and very loud mixture of a dance club and cabaret. One
          by one the LOOPERS emerge from side exits, sneaking in.
          Paupers at the feast.

          INT. LA BELLE AURORE BATHROOM - NIGHT

          Joe and several other Loopers pass around an EYE DROPPER.
          Pupils slacken. The drug spins him into a slurred revelry.

          INT. LA BELLE AURORE CLUB

          Joe staggers out on the dance floor. Miles high.

          EXT. LA BELLE AURORE - NIGHT

          Joe and the loopers are kicked out by burly GAT MEN, followed
          by Kid Blue, pointing and yelling at them. The loopers laugh
          their asses off.

          EXT. CITY STREETS - NIGHT

          Joe's Miata screams through the abandoned city streets,
          racing with several other loopers in trucks and sports cars.

          IN THE CAR
          Jammed with Seth and Loopers, Joe at the wheel. Still so
          high. Suddenly one of the Loopers SHOUTS -- Joe slams the

                         BRAKES

          EXT. VAGRANT VILLAGE - NIGHT

          Screaming to a halt just shy of a malnourished BEGGAR KID.
          Caught in the headlights. Behind him, a miserable vagrant
          village in a field.

          IN THE CAR
          Joe stares at the kid, frozen. A moment. Then spins the
          wheel, peels out. The Loopers hoot and shout. Joe's Miata
          screams along the dirt road bordering the vagrant village,
          whizzing past open fires and dirty huddled families.
          JOE'S FACE - serene and focused. Going somewhere.

          EXT. SETH'S APARTMENT - DAWN

          Joe drops Seth off at his building with its bright red
          garage.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          10.

                         JOE
          Sell that goddamn slat bike back.
          That's a lot of stupid money.

                         SETH
          I got stupid money.
          Seth holds his hand under fuzzy dice hanging from Joe's
          mirror, and they spin.

                         JOE
          Alright.
          Seth stumbles toward his door, checks his pants.

                         SETH
          I think I did something. You know
          what? TKs are special. Fuck you.

                         JOE
          Hey Seth.
          Seth slumps against the car.

                         JOE (CONT'D)
          Alright, Zach. What's his payout,
          30? 40? If that? That's not
          going to last you 30 years. And it
          won't get you overseas.

                         SETH
          Overseas...

                         JOE
          So in five, ten years you're back
          to riding the rails, or worse
          you're like Kid Blue, working as a
          gat man, wagging your dick at
          loopers and roughing up shop clerks
          for payoff money.

                         SETH
          Fuckin Kid Blue.

                         JOE
          Save a little something. Alright?
          Cause that'll be yours, and then
          you've got yours and that's all
          that matters, your life is your
          own.

                         SETH
          I gots mine you gots yours. I wish
          I was smart like you. Saint Joe.
          Seth pats Joe's cheek, and waddles off towards his apartment.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          11.

          INT. JOE'S APARTMENT - MORNING

          An alarm wakes Joe, red-eyed.

          INT. JOE'S APARTMENT ENTRYWAY - MORNING

          In his bathrobe, Joe checks his apartment mailbox. A slip of
          folded paper inside, with â14:30â handwritten on it.

          INT. JOE'S APARTMENT

          Dressed now, Joe double-checks his french book for a phrase
          and heads out.

          EXT. FARMLAND ROAD - DAY

          Joe's truck zooms away from the city, into corn fields.

          EXT. CORN FIELD

          Joe's pocket watch at 2:29, ticking away.
          A hog-tied MAN with a sack on his head appears before Joe.
          Shoots the man in the chest, without hesitation.

          INT. DINER - DAY

          Joe sits at a booth, the waitress Beatrix brings his coffee.

                         BEATRIX
          Bon jour Joe.

                         JOE
          Ravi de te voir, Beatrix.

                         BEATRIX
          Ooh la la.

          INT. PAWN SHOP BACK ROOM - DAY

          JEDD, 70s and knarled, sits in a tiny closet of a work room.
          Following a BUZZ, Joe appears on a fuzzy monitor, standing in
          the hall.

          JOE (OVER SPEAKER)
          Two, Jedd.
          Jedd opens a slot and takes two gold bars from Joe, then
          hands him out a small stack of cash.
          Marks in a notebook Joe's name, the date and the number â2'.
          All the other transactions have the number â4'.

          INT. JOE'S APARTMENT

          Joe smooths out the oriental rug.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          12.

          INT. LA BELLE AURORE CLUB - NIGHT

          Joe drinks with Dale, watches a group of Loopers celebrating
          at another table.

                         DALE
          What's that, fourth loop closed
          this month?
          Dale casually makes a fork float above his palm, lifting his
          eyebrows at passing ladies.

                         JOE
          Fourth.
          On the stage, flinging her legs with a line of can-can
          dancers, is Suzie. The girl Joe watched in the bordello. As
          her dance ends Joe stands and goes backstage.

          INT. BACKSTAGE

          Suzie weaves towards her dressing room. Joe catches her.

                         SUZIE
          Hey.

                         JOE
          You working a shift tonight?

                         SUZIE
          Yeah.

                         (REALIZES)
          Yeah, but one of the gat men bought
          me out already. For the night.

                         JOE
          Oh.

                         SUZIE
          Sweetie. I gotta work.
          She leaves him watching her go.
          He turns - sees Kid Blue leaning in the shadows. He's seen
          this whole exchange. The Kid smirks.

          INT. LA BELLE AURORE CLUB

          Joe bursts back into the club with a vengeance.

          INT. JOE'S APARTMENT - NIGHT - LATER

          Joe staggers in. Not doing so hot.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          13.

          INT. JOE'S BATHROOM - NIGHT

          Looks at himself in the mirror. Eyes red as candy. He pops
          open a hidden drawer next to his medicine cabinet, pulls out
          an eye dropper and puts one in each.

          INT. JOE'S APARTMENT - LATER THAT NIGHT

          A harsh POUNDING.
          Joe, flopped on the bed, stirs. Then wakes with a jump,
          shaky on his feet.
          Goes to the door. A screen shows nobody in the hall outside.
          Still punch-drunk, Joe listens. POUND POUND POUND. The
          window. Joe slides it open. Seth tumbles in off the fire
          escape.

                         JOE
          Jesus, Seth.

                         SETH
          They're gonna be here any minute,
          are they here?

                         JOE
          No, they're not here. Who?

                         SETH
          Christ. Joe. Christ.
          Joe's eyes focus a bit, he tunes in to the situation. Turns
          the apartment lights off.

                         SETH (CONT'D)
          (re: the lights)
          What are you doing? Right. Smart.

                         JOE
          Seth, sit down here.
          CRASH! Seth knocks something over in the dark. Joe opens
          the fridge, pale light. Seth sits at the kitchen table.

                         SETH
          Late to my own funeral. Mom always
          said...

                         JOE
          Tell me now.

                         SETH
          Christ, Joe. Late to my own
          goddamn funeral. Can you help me?

                         

                         

                         

                         

          14.

                         JOE
          Seth, what did you do?

                         SETH
          You can protect me a little, right?
          Just so they don't... jeez. Oh
          jeez. This is like a nightmare.
          This is a nightmare.

          JOE (V.O.)
          I knew then what he did so I don't
          know why I asked.

                         JOE (CONT'D)
          What did you do?
          Seth lifts his eyes to Joe.

                         SETH
          He was singing.

          EXT. CORN FIELD - DAY (FLASHBACK)

          FLASH: a hog-tied man with a sack over his head appears.
          Singing.
          Seth, with his gun raised, hesitates.

          SETH (V.O.)
          Through the gag and mask, but I
          could hear the tune. Deep
          memories, my mom in a dark room,
          singing. Back warm and safe, when
          I coulda still been good. And once
          I knew it was him... Joe I
          couldn't. I couldn't. I had to
          see.
          Seth pulls the sack off the man's head.

          INT. JOE'S APARTMENT


                         SETH
          Joe I can't even tell you. Looking
          in his eyes. I had to let him
          talk, then. I don't even remember
          the words, but I remember believing
          every one of them, or not even
          believing, but submitting. I've
          never felt that small before. I've
          never felt that happy. He told me.
          I remember, there's a new holy
          terror boss-man in the future, and
          he's closing all the loops. The
          Rainmaker, they call him. He told
          me.

                         SETH (CONT'D)
          Then he wanted a cigarette and I
          untied him, and he gives me this
          look. And he just starts running.

          EXT. CORN FIELD - DAY (FLASHBACK)

          Seth standing with his gun in his limp arm, receding behind
          us as we run away.

          SETH (V.O.)
          And I had my blunderbuss so I know
          he's got about fifteen strides till
          he's out of my range. And they
          come and go, and I just watch him
          till he's gone.

          INT. JOE'S APARTMENT

          Seth breaks down crying.

          JOE (V.O.)
          This is called letting your loop
          run. It's not a good thing.

                         SETH
          What do I do? You're the only
          friend I got Joe you gotta help me

                         JOE
          You fucking idiot coming here.
          Seth, sucker punched.

          JOE (CONT'D)
          You can't be here, I'll give you a
          little money but you gotta

                         SETH
          Joe? A little - where am I gonna -

                         JOE
          You hop a freight train, you beat
          it the hell out
          POUND POUND POUND. On the door this time. Seth makes a sound
          like he's going to die, Joe closes the fridge, hisses

                         JOE (CONT'D)
          Shut up. Don't move.
          Goes to the door. Two GAT MEN and Kid Blue stand outside.

                         KID BLUE
          Open up Joe!
          (to the gat man)
          Watch the window.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          16.
          Joe spins from the door. Considers briefly.

                         JOE
          I can't do anything for you Seth.
          Seth crumples to his knees, grasping Joe's hand.

                         SETH
          No! You gotta hide me! Joe, hide
          me, please Christ please Joe please
          hide me tell em something to buy
          time and I'll leave please-

          POUND POUND POUND.

                         JOE
          Hold on!
          Watching Seth, Joe's face breaks in a moment of decision. He
          flips the lights on, and briskly pulls back his oriental rug.
          A FLOOR SAFE with a touch pad. He enters a code, opens it.
          Wide and deeper than you'd expect, lined with gold bars. Big
          enough for a man. Seth scrambles in.
          Joe takes one last look at Seth's frightened, grateful face,
          framed by the gold bars, then closes the safe and smooths the
          oriental rug.
          POUND POUND POUND- Joe opens the door.
          Kid Blue storms in, his gun drawn, sweeping through the
          apartment with over-eager purpose.
          One gat man stays outside, the other casually sits at Joe's
          kitchen table. Kid Blue gets in Joe's face.

                         KID BLUE
          That took awhile.

                         JOE
          You think it's easy looking this
          good?

                         KID BLUE
          Tye's going to watch your apartment
          while we go have a talk with Abe.
          Joe grabs a jacket.

                         JOE
          There's coffee in the tin.

                         TYE

          17.

          INT. STEEP STAIRS

          Kid Blue leads Joe down the stairs and into the door at their
          base.

          INT. WAITING ROOM

          Dingy with a few benches. In one wall three steep stairs
          lead to a high door. Kid Blue knocks. Muffled voice from

                         WITHIN:

          ABE (O.S.)
          Two minutes.

                         LATER
          Joe and Kid Blue on benches, facing each other. The Kid
          stares daggers and spins his gun. Joe tries his best not to
          engage.

                         KID BLUE
          You know why they call that pea
          shooter a blunderbuss? Cuz it's
          impossible to hit anything farther
          than 15 feet, and impossible to
          miss anything closer. A gun for
          fuck up turkeys. Not like a gat.
          A gat has range. Accuracy.
          His gun spinning gets fancier. His gun meaner looking than
          Joe's blunderbuss, long and slim and chrome.

                         JOE
          Alright, cut it out Kid. You're
          gonna blow your foot off again.
          The Kid almost snaps back, but then grins.

                         KID BLUE
          You're right, it'd be real easy for
          it to accidentally go off.
          He clicks the safety off. Joe shifts uncomfortably.

                         JOE
          C'mon.

                         KID BLUE
          Don't disrespect a gat man, Looper.
          Joe stifles a chuckle.
          In a flash, the Kid stands and pistol-whips him across the
          face. Joe falls back. The Kid raises his gun at Joe.
          Frozen in that tableau a moment, the Kid savors his victory.
          Lowers his gun.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          18.

          ABE (O.S.)
          What the hell is going on out there-
          The high door swings open fast, SMACKING Kid Blue hard on the
          side of the head. His gun goes off, firing into the wall.
          Out of nowhere three gat men burst into the room, guns drawn.
          ABE, a sallow man in his 50s, appears in the high doorway.

                         KID BLUE
          S'alright, s'alright.
          Humiliated, the Kid tries to stand, but falls over again.
          After a moment everyone realizes what's happened, and the
          tension breaks.

                         ABE
          Alright. Joe.
          Joe climbs into the doorway. Kid Blue stands shakily.

                         ABE (CONT'D)
          You didn't shoot your other foot
          off, didja kid?
          The door closes, and the gat men laugh at the Kid.

          INT. ABE'S OFFICE

          Cluttered, with a big desk. Joe sits, Abe hands him a
          handkerchief for the ugly gash on his cheek.

                         ABE
          My great grandfather always told my
          grandfather, men's like spiders.
          It's the little ones you gotta be
          careful of.

                         JOE
          Dunno I agree with that.

                         ABE
          Oh yeah? Well. What the fuck did
          my great grandfather know.

          JOE (V.O.)
          This man is from the future. He
          was sent back here by the mob, a
          one way ticket, to run the Loopers.
          That's low effort even for Abe, so
          to pass the time he recruited some
          real muscle, the Gat Men. Now he
          runs the city. Any other city,
          that'd be impressive.
          Abe settles in his chair. Regards Joe.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          19.

                         ABE
          How can you kids stand those
          chokers? This, the cravats.

                         JOE
          Ties.

                         ABE
          Ridiculous. You're aware we don't
          have a dress code.

                         JOE

                         (SHRUGS)
          Fashion.

                         ABE
          You know, you don't know, the
          movies you're dressing like were
          copying other movies. Goddamn 20th
          century affectations, do something
          new. Put a glowing thing around
          your neck or use... rubberized..
          (waves at Joe's suit)
          Be new.

                         JOE
          Okay.
          A beat of silence.

                         JOE (CONT'D)
          Well it was nice chatting with you
          Abe.

                         ABE
          I do like you, Joe. But we're sure
          enough Seth paid you a visit we're
          gonna hafta do something about
          this.

                         JOE
          Seth?

                         ABE
          You're expecting we're gonna break
          your fingers with a hammer or
          something awful, and I'm going to
          diffuse that tension right now,
          that isn't going to happen. What's
          going to happen is, I'm going to
          talk for a little, not even that
          long, then you're gonna give up
          your friend.

                         JOE
          My friend Seth? I'm confused.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          20.

                         ABE
          Well then I'll talk a little. You
          know you were the youngest looper I
          ever hired? You looked goddamn
          ridiculous they said, the
          blunderbuss up to here on you. But
          I remember they brought you in, I
          forget what it was for,

                         JOE
          Watch shop.

                         ABE
          That's yeah, you had rolled one of
          our fronts, a watch shop. And they
          had you, your arms pinned, this
          kid. Like an animal. But you
          looked at me, your hair stuck to
          half your face so just this one eye
          looking at me. And I thought
          what's this kid lived through, what
          he had taken away from him. What's
          he lost. And I could see, like
          seeing it happen clear as seeing
          it, the bad path in front of you,
          the bad version of your life. Like
          a vision I saw it happen, you
          turning bad. So I cleaned you up
          and put a gun in your hand. I gave
          you something that was yours.

                         JOE
          You know I'm grateful, Abe.
          Genuine. But Abe shakes his hands, not where he's going.

                         ABE
          I gave you something that was
          yours. And I remember that kid,
          and I think when you ask yourself
          you ask who would I sacrifice for
          what's mine, I think Seth is deep
          and cozy inside that circle.
          Pause. Both their eyes go to a hammer sitting on the desk.

                         ABE (CONT'D)
          That hammer's there for something
          else later, that's not, it's a bad
          coincidence.

                         JOE
          Okay.

                         ABE
          Show you how much I know you, I'm
          not even gonna break you, just set
          you back a ways.

                         (MORE)

                         

                         

                         

                         

          21.

                         ABE (CONT'D)
          We know you've been stashing half
          your bars. Which is smart. You
          give up Seth, or you give us half
          your stash. For Seth.
          Joe holds Abe's gaze for a moment, then his eyes drop and
          it's over.

                         JOE
          Will you kill him?

                         ABE
          No. Would be too cataclysmic a
          change to the future. What we'll
          do is dangerous in that regard, but
          not as dangerous as killing him,
          and not by twice as having him run
          free.

                         (BEAT)
          Joe I let him run more than a few
          days, the boys in the future get
          nervous, then bing! my replacement
          shows up. With a gun. So we'll do
          what we have to do.
          Silence.

                         JOE
          Floor safe, beneath the rug. 6742.
          One of the gat men quietly exits.

                         ABE
          It's the little ones that get you.

          INT. WAITING ROOM

          Abe leads Joe out, past gat men and Kid Blue, smirking again.

                         ABE
          Why don't you kill an hour, Joe.
          On the house.
          After Joe exits, Abe and Kid exchange looks.

          ABE (CONT'D)
          Call the doc.

          INT. BORDELLO ENTRANCE

          Joe slumps in. Several girls, none of them Suzie.

                         MADAME
          Suzie's just getting off. Doubt
          she's up for it.
          He pushes through the velvet curtained door.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          22.

          INT. BLACK HALLWAY

          A large gat man pushes past Joe.
          At the end of the hall, Suzie leans in a doorway smoking a
          cigarette. Not sexy, just tired. She sees Joe, and is about
          to say no. But she sees Joe's eyes, and doesn't.
          Exhaling a plume of smoke, she withdraws into her doorway.
          Joe follows. Through her smoke.

          INT. SUZIE'S BEDROOM - LATER

          Suzie naked at the mirror. She goes to Joe, lying on the
          bed, distant.

                         JOE
          I can't remember my mother's face.
          I remember her touching my hair.
          Like this.
          He takes Suzie's hand strokes it over his hair. She smiles
          briefly, tired, then takes her hand away and puts drops in
          his eyes.

                         JOE (CONT'D)
          Do you want to go overseas?

                         SUZIE
          Do I want to go overseas? With
          you? Now?

                         JOE
          Soon, maybe.

                         SUZIE
          Baby that's sweet. You're a sweet
          boy. You gotta be careful, it's
          easy to think you know someone once
          you been like this. What's in here
          is services rendered.

                         JOE
          Is that how it aughta be?

                         SUZIE
          What, in nature?

                         (BEAT)
          You know I get this a lot.
          Especially young guys. I must have
          wife eyes or something.
          His face clouds.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          23.

          INT. JOE'S APARTMENT - NIGHT

          Joe gets home. Empty, quiet. Everything in place. He goes
          to the rug, pulls it aside. Opens the safe.
          All the gold, and nothing else. One bar juts from the side,
          knocked out of place.
          He pushes it back, and when he lifts his fingers they have a
          bright smear of fresh red blood.

          EXT. CITY OUTSKIRTS - NIGHT

          A hunched figure sprints through an abandoned lot towards a
          train yard.
          It is a 55 YEAR OLD SETH. He limps up to a razor-wire fence
          bordering the train yard.
          Surveys the sharp wire, rips the lining from his jacket and
          wraps first his left hand then his right.
          But stops.
          On the palm of his right hand, a WEATHERED SCAR. Clearly
          carved in the shape of an arrow, pointing down to his wrist.
          Old Seth squints at it, confused. He pulls back his sleeve,
          revealing his clean bare forearm.
          Then his face changes.
          Because his arm is no longer bare. Suddenly, out of nowhere,
          more intricate scarring has appeared down its length.
          The scars spell out clearly: âBE AT 75 WIRE STREET IN 15

                         MINUTESÂ
          Old Seth's breath returns, jagged. He pulls his sleeve up
          and hoists himself up the fence, climbing fast.
          He reaches the top, gets a good grasp on the wire to hoist
          himself over... and stops again.
          His right hand is missing a finger. The ring finger is just
          gone, its stump worn with age.
          Old Seth stares. And now his middle finger is gone as well.
          A freight train whistle moans. The cars, open and inviting,
          leading out of town. Behind him, the city.
          Terror and indecision seizes his chest, so much so that it
          takes a moment for him to realize the sound of his breathing
          has changed to a ragged whistle.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          24.
          He lifts his hand, now with just two fingers, to his face...
          and the smooth scarred hole where his nose used to be.

          EXT. CITY STREETS

          The train yard far in the distance. Old Seth RUNNING back
          into town.
          He looks down at his right hand, fingerless now but for his
          thumb.
          He speeds up, desperate. Cuts through an alley. And has no
          right hand, just a stump.

                         OLD SETH
          No no no no no!
          A bell-like DING. Old Seth spins, sees a WEDDING BAND lying
          on the sidewalk.
          He picks it up with the four remaining fingers on his left
          hand, stuffs it in his pocket, sobbing.
          Bursts out of the alleyway, limping now, straight into the
          street and into the headlights of an oncoming car.
          The car screeches to a halt, and its harsh white light shows
          Old Seth's missing right ear, and deep scars down his face.

          IN THE CAR
          Old Seth throws open the drivers side door and throws out the
          DRIVER. Jams on the gas.
          Speeding through the streets, hands slipping on the wheel.
          His pant leg crumples. Empty boot tangling with the pedals.

          EXT. WIRE STREET

          The car hits a pole.
          Out climbs what's left of Old Seth, his face mangled, missing
          a foot, one arm gone to the elbow.
          Street sign - WIRE STREET. The numbers, 45.
          He runs. Howling, missing his tongue. Arm totally gone.
          Then falls as his leg goes to the knees. And he's crawling,
          an animal form, bellowing wordlessly.
          Makes it to an iron street-side door. 75. And with his one
          arm, slams it.
          Slumps against it, heaving. After a long moment it swings
          open.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          25.
          With no hesitation, a BLAST from the darkened doorway, and
          Old Seth's head mists open. He slumps to the pavement.
          Kid Blue steps from the doorway, drags the body inside.
          Deep in the dark doorway we glimpse a DOCTOR in a surgical
          frock smeared with bright red blood. The door SLAMS.

          INT. JOE'S APARTMENT - MORNING

          Joe wakes with a start.

          EXT. CORN FIELD

          Joe's pocket watch at 2:29, ticking away. He takes his
          stance. Earbud headphones, the drone of French lessons.
          A hog-tied MAN with a sack on his head appears kneeling
          before Joe. Joe raises his gun without hesitation and shoots
          the man in the chest.
          Walks to the body, flips it. The man's hands, tied and
          purplish. Joe hesitates. Puts his hand next to them.
          Similar.
          He flips the man onto his back, stares long and hard at the
          shape of the man's face under the cloth sack.
          Tears it off. An older Asian man's face, frozen in terror.
          Joe smirks, the spell broken. His face hardens.

          INT. PLANT - DAY

          Joe watches the Asian man's body slide down the hatch and
          vanish in a puff of distant fire.

                         BEGIN MONTAGE:
          1. Joe in the club, drinking, watching more loopers
          celebrate.
          2. Joe in the field, he shoots a hog-tied man.
          3. Joe in his floor safe, setting more gold bars.
          4. Joe in the field, BANG.
          5. Joe in the club, watching Suzie with her red hair.
          6. Joe in the field, BANG.
          7. In the plant, a body sliding into the fire.
          8. Joe in the field, BANG. BANG. BANG. His face more
          determined with each shot.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          26.

          EXT. CORN FIELD - DAY

          Our montage comes to an end suddenly and all is silent.
          Joe in the corn field, in his stance, ready to draw.
          But nothing happens. Silence. Joe checks his watch,
          confused.
          2:30 and change. Waits. Watching the blank space where the
          man is supposed to appear.
          Hand on his gun. Breathing shallow. Something is wrong.
          2:32. An eternity. Then, there he is.
          But different. Not kneeling. On his side, so he flops over
          and has to straighten himself. The man's hands are UNTIED.
          Holy shit.
          Joe raises his gun, scared. Time slows. Finger tightens on
          the trigger.
          Then he sees: the man has NO SACK ON HIS HEAD. And the face
          that stares back at Joe is his own.
          57 YEAR OLD JOE. His eyes fixed on Joe.
          And for just one split second, Joe's face slackens, and his
          finger eases on the trigger.
          It's all the hesitation Old Joe needs. He throws his body
          into a spin.
          Joe snaps out of it, and PULLS THE TRIGGER.
          The shot catches Old Joe square in the back, and the impact
          blows him forward. But instead of blood beneath his torn
          jacket's back, we see the layered gold bars spill out. They
          caught the blast.
          In what seems like one fluid motion Old Joe's fingers grab
          one of the bars, he spins again, throwing handfuls of dirt
          and the bar back towards Joe.
          Joe flinches, again just for a moment, and when his eyes
          focus again and his arm steadies the gun it's too late.
          Old Joe is on top of him, with a heavy blow knocking the gun
          aside, and with an even heavier one swinging down on Joe's
          head, a fist and then

          THE CORN FIELD, HOURS LATER
          Joe wakes. Blood caked on his face. Headphones beside him,
          still squawking French lessons. Sits up.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          27.

                         JOE
          Oh god.
          Gold bars scattered in the dirt. But no Old Joe. And no
          truck. Joe staggers to his feet, shaky. Head thick. But
          realizing.

                         JOE (CONT'D)
          Late to my own funeral.

          EXT. FARMLAND ROAD - LATE AFTERNOON

          Joe runs, shaky, towards town. Fishes his phone-device from
          his pocket, chucks it.

          EXT. JOE'S APARTMENT BUILDING - NIGHT

          Across the street, Joe huddles behind a car, breathing hard.
          Looks up at his lit window. Debating.

          INT. JOE'S APARTMENT HALLWAY

          Joe walks silently towards his apartment door.
          It is ajar. He hesitates. Knows he shouldn't.

          INT. JOE'S APARTMENT

          Holding his breath, Joe edges in. It's ravaged, torn to
          pieces. The floor safe is open, about half the gold bars
          missing. But the apartment seems empty.
          Exhaling, Joe works quickly. Knocks a tile aside, pulls a
          wad of cash from the wall. A heavy jacket from the closet.
          Eyes dart around the room - what else? But too late --
          footsteps in the hallway. Joe ducks into the bathroom just
          as Kid Blue and a TALL GAT MAN enter the apartment.

          INT. JOE'S BATHROOM

          Joe crouches. Outside, Kid Blue piles the man's arms full of
          gold bars.

          KID BLUE (O.S.)
          That's twenty four there. I'm
          keeping count.

          TALL GAT MAN (O.S.)
          Uh huh.

          KID BLUE (O.S.)
          Two more trips should do it.
          Joe gently lifts himself off his haunches.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          28.

          INT. JOE'S APARTMENT

          The Tall Gat Man exits, Kid Blue stays crouched over the
          floor safe hefting out bars, his back to the bathroom. In
          the distance, a GUNSHOT. Kid Blue's head perks up.
          CREAK! From the bathroom. Quick as lightning, the Kid draws
          his gat and spins - but Joe is already upon him, full sprint.
          SLAM! Joe tackles the Kid backwards. But while Joe uses his
          momentum to leap over the OPEN FLOOR SAFE, the Kid tumbles
          back into it, vanishing inside with a painful thud.
          Joe scrambles to a stop, lifts the heavy safe trap door and
          SLAMS it down - just as the Kid's hand grasps the open edge.
          With a sickening CRACK, the trap door closes on the Kid's
          fingers.
          A bellowing howl, his fingers withdraw, and the safe door
          clicks shut. The ELECTRIC BOX rigged to the code pad to
          crack it clatters off, and whirrrr, CLICK. Locked. Joe,
          panting, goes on hands and knees to the safe door and shouts
          clear and earnest:

                         JOE
          Kid listen Kid. I'm sorry. Tell
          Abe I'm going to fix this. Tell
          him keep my bars safe cause I swear
          to god I'm going to fix this, I'm
          going to find my loop and I'm gonna
          kill him. Tell Abe-
          CRACK CRACK! The wood paneled floor above the safe door
          splinters upwards with gunshots, and a chunk of Joe's right
          ear explodes.
          More blood than you'd think spills down his neck, Joe falls
          back. Three more shots - CRACK CRACK CRACK! And now
          footsteps running down the hall.
          Joe on his feet, slipping in his own blood, sprints across
          the apartment. The TALL GAT MAN appears in the doorway,
          shooting blindly at Joe, chunks of wall and plaster exploding
          as Joe doesn't stop but JUMPS OUT THE WINDOW.

          EXT. JOE'S APARTMENT WINDOW - NIGHT

          5 floors up, Joe leaps out, hits the fire escape, bullets
          shattering the window. Blind with blood, ears ringing, Joe
          barrels down the fire escape. A confused blur of iron steps,
          slipping and scrambling down, but now the tall gat man is out
          the window and shooting down at him.
          Somehow Joe slips and rolls, grabs at thin air, falling -
          three stories at least, falling.
          When he hits the ground the world goes away.

                         

                         

                         

                         

                         OLD JOE

                         

                         

                         

                         

          29.

          EXT. CORN FIELD - DAY

          We abruptly CUT ON to a very familiar scene.
          Young Joe stands alone in the corn field, in his stance,
          ready to draw. But nothing happens. Silence. Joe checks
          his watch, confused. 2:30 and change.
          This is exactly the scene where Old Joe appears, being
          replayed before our eyes. But when Old Joe does APPEAR, it's
          different: his hands are tied, his head covered with a sack.
          And something very different happens:
          Joe raises his gun and without hesitation PULLS THE TRIGGER.
          Old Joe's chest explodes. He falls dead.
          Joe approaches the body, and slows. Sensing something. He
          pulls off the sack. The face of his older self. Old Joe.
          He flips him over. Gold bars CLINK beneath a bloody jacket.
          Joe has closed his loop.

          INT. LA BELLE AURORE CLUB - NIGHT

          The other LOOPERS buy Joe drinks and cheer him, celebrating.

          INT. JOE'S APARTMENT - MORNING

          His belongings in boxes. Joe unloads the GOLD BARS from the
          trap door.

          EXT. CARGO SHIP DECK - DAY

          Out at sea. Joe, bundled against the cold, leans on a
          railing, eagerly watching the horizon.

          INT. PARIS APARTMENT - DAY

          Joe smoking in window of an empty apartment, half unpacked.

          EXT. PARIS STREETS - DAY

          Joe walking the city streets, breathing deep. Alive.

          INT. PARIS BODEGA - NIGHT

          Joe picks up a bottle of beer.
          Several FRENCH GANGSTERS in suits shake down the OWNER of the
          shop for money from the register. One holds a gun in the
          owner's face.
          Joe ignores them, walks out.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          30.

          INT. PARIS CLUB - NIGHT

          Loud and dark. Joe shotguns eye drops right out in the open,
          dances like a madman.

          INT. PARIS APARTMENT - DAY

          Joe's apartment, unpacked and lived in. Joe smokes.
          In a NOOK behind a wall panel - stacks of CASH.

          EXT. PARIS STREETS - DAY

          Cloudy and cold. Joe wanders alone. Buffeted by strangers.

          EXT. PARIS CLUB - NIGHT

          Music pumping, Joe deadened at a table, in another world.
          Beside him a YOUNG PUNK makes a glass float using his TK
          power, then shatters the glass. Red liquid goes everywhere.

          INT. PARIS APARTMENT - DAY

          Joe takes money from the stacks in the nook, which have grown
          drastically low.
          LATER - sets a hypo down in the ashtray.

          INT. PARIS BODEGA - DAY

          A GUN in the face of the shop's OWNER. Held by Joe. Several
          years older now, in his mid thirties.
          Dressed in a suit, surrounded by fellow GANGSTERS. Now part
          of their gang.

          EXT. PARIS STREETS - NIGHT

          A shoot-out between rival gangs. Joe's guns blaze.
          A remorseless killer. Blasting away, cold and skillful.
          Smashing up shops that won't pay protection. He's muscle.

          INT. PARIS GANG HEADQUARTERS

          A dingy dark hallway. Distant thumping bass indicates it's
          maybe behind a club.
          The hall is lined with French Gangster, all similarly
          dressed. Reminiscent of the Gat Men. It takes us a moment
          to recognize Joe among them.
          In his EARLY 40s now. His face a hard weathered mask. A
          soldier. (Note - it is here we transition from the actor
          playing Young Joe to the one playing Old Joe.)

                         

                         

                         

                         

          31.

          EXT. PARIS STREETS - DAY

          Snow on the ground.

          INT. PARIS CLUB - NIGHT

          Old Joe high as a kite, in an all out brawl. Punched to the
          ground. Laughing his ass off.
          A bar fight blossoms in slow motion all around.
          Old Joe looks up, sees the woman who will be his WIFE for the
          first time. Long red hair (reminiscent of but NOT Suzie.) In
          a green dress. She flees the fighting, towards the exit.

          âSORTIE.â
          Transfixed and high, Old Joe follows her. Puts his hand on
          her shoulder. She turns, looks him over. Flips him off.
          Leaves. Old Joe watches her go. In love.

          INT. PARIS CAFE - DAY

          Old Joe hits on his future Wife, she tells him to fuck off.

          INT. PARIS BEDROOM - DAY

          Old Joe in bed with his future Wife. They kiss.

          EXT. PARIS STREETS - DAY

          Old Joe shoots up a storefront with his gang.

          INT. PARIS APARTMENT - DAY

          Old Joe's future wife yells at him, holding his gun holsters
          accusingly. She throws them across the room.
          LATER - He holds her in bed, both of them troubled.

          INT. CAR - DAY

          Old Joe driving. Deep in thought. His future Wife beside
          him, her hand on his. He hits the brakes.

          EXT. FRENCH BEACH / HIGHWAY - CONTINUOUS

          The car screeches to a halt on a beach side road. Old Joe
          gets out, runs across the beach to the water, pulling his gun
          out of its holster. He fires it out to sea till its empty,
          then throws the gun into the ocean.
          He runs back to his Wife, standing on the beach. They kiss.
          They fall to the sand, and kiss.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          32.

          EXT. FRENCH COUNTRYSIDE - DAY

          A cottage in the country.

          INT. FRENCH COTTAGE BEDROOM - NIGHT

          Old Joe sweats and shudders out his drug addiction. His Wife
          tends to him.

          EXT. FRENCH COTTAGE - SUNSET - YEARS LATER

          Old Joe in his mid 50s, his Wife lying on a hammock with him,
          reading. Hands lazily entwined. A good life.

          INT. FRENCH COTTAGE KITCHEN - MORNING - A WEEK LATER

          The Wife cuts vegetables. Headlines (in French) scroll
          across a small floating screen, against images of
          destruction. âGangland Terror Spreads, Who is The Rainmakerâ
          She turns it off.

          INT. FRENCH BEDROOM - MORNING

          Lazy, dust motes hanging in the sunlight through the windows.
          Old Joe in bed, in his late 50s.
          His Wife walks through, says something inconsequential, puts
          her hand on his foot. Draws it away, fingers sliding off
          gently. And is gone.
          We stay with Old Joe. His deep breath. The sun warming the
          sheets. Running water from the kitchen.
          His eyes focus on his hand. Written in faded ink on the palm
          is a number we do not recognize: 07153902935.
          A long moment.
          With all the violence in the world, the cottage's green front
          door is KICKED OPEN.
          Joe runs out of the bedroom half dressed, and GANGSTERS grab
          him, taking him down with a rifle butt to the head.
          His Wife is dragged from the kitchen screaming.

          EXT. COTTAGE - CONTINUOUS

          Dark cars parked out front. We watch the quiet facade for a
          moment too long, violence that we don't want to think about
          happening inside.
          Then the door BURSTS open and Gangsters drag Joe out, sobbing
          thrashing and bleeding from his head.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          33.

          INT. BASEMENT - DAY

          Concrete, nondescript. The Gangsters carry Joe in, now hog
          tied. Put a sack over his head.
          Lead him towards a machine, an iron monstrosity with a hatch.
          One of the men taps his watch - hurry. Another man pulls a
          large lever, and the machine hums, warming up.
          Joe's face, covered with the sack. Breathing. Remembering:
          flashes of his WIFE, screaming.
          Then Joe LUNGES and somehow his hands are loose, he PUNCHES
          one man, tears off the sack, PUNCHES another man, a flurry
          and then it's over. He stands among a pile of broken men.
          Slowly takes stock. Looks at the exit. Looks at the faded
          number on his blood-smeared hand.
          A million things in his mind. But just one choice. The
          machine hums angrily. Ready.

          INT. TIME MACHINE - CONTINUOUS

          Like an iron coffin. Old Joe climbs inside. Braces himself.
          Closes the hatch behind him.
          Flash and crack and he is sent.

          EXT. CORN FIELD - DAY

          And appears in front of his younger self.
          The scene now plays out as it did the first time. Joe
          hesitates, Old Joe gets the upper hand, knocks him out.
          Old Joe looks around, gets his bearings. Stares at his
          younger self a moment. Then goes to the truck.

          EXT. HIGHWAY - DUSK

          Old Joe drives the truck into the city.

          INT. BODEGA - NIGHT

          Cramped. Old Joe walks in quickly, gets aspirin, wrapped
          sandwiches, bandages, big bottles of water. Removes his torn
          jacket, dumps it.
          At the register, the CLERK bags everything up. Old Joe pulls
          the blunderbuss on the clerk.

                         OLD JOE
          And your jacket.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          34.

          EXT. ALLEYWAY - NIGHT

          Wearing the clerk's jacket, Old Joe takes four aspirin.
          Holds his head a minute, rocking gently.

          EXT. JOE'S APARTMENT - NIGHT

          On the street outside the building. Old Joe approaches,
          watching the window high above. Weighing his options.
          He scans the street. Spots an ARMORED VAN in the alleyway.
          Movement from behind it - Kid Blue and the Tall Gat Man
          loading their bars in the back.

                         OLD JOE
          Shit.
          Old Joe turns to go, but STOPS when his eye catches movement
          between parked cars.
          It's Joe. Young Joe, hid between the cars, looking up at the
          apartment building weighing his options.

          OLD JOE (CONT'D)

                         (SOTTO)
          Don't do it. Idiot. Don't do it.
          After a moment Joe dashes across the street and into the
          building. Old Joe stays still a moment, watching him go.
          Ducks into shadows as Kid Blue and the Tall Gat Man step from
          the alleyway, wiping their hands.

                         KID BLUE
          Two more trips.
          They enter the building.
          Old Joe takes a breath, then casually walks down the
          sidewalk, past the alleyway, scoping the Armored Van. A GAT
          MAN DRIVER in the driver's seat.

          INT. ARMORED VAN

          The Gat Man Driver watches Old Joe disappear from view.
          Suspicious, he uncovers a GAT on the seat beside him.
          When he looks back up Old Joe stands in his headlights,
          blunderbuss raised. BANG! The windshield shatters, the Gat
          Man Driver is torn apart.
          Old Joe runs up, flings open the door, digs through the
          bloody mess frantically, finding the GAT.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          35.

          EXT. JOE'S APARTMENT

          Old Joe dashes out onto the street as gunfire cracks from the
          high apartment window. Sharp eyes will notice that Old Joe's
          right ear is now clipped off, an old wound.
          He dashes towards the apartment door, gun in hand, but stops
          when the window five stories above shatters with gunfire.
          Old Joe backs up, and sees Joe scrambling down the fire
          escape as the TALL GAT MAN fires down at him.
          Old Joe takes expert aim with the gat, and fires three shots
          upwards. The Tall Gat Man's gunfire stops.
          Joe slips on the fire escape, falls two stories and lands on
          the hood of a parked car.
          Old Joe goes to him, checks his pulse.
          Behind them the TALL GAT MAN hits the sidewalk with a SPLAT.
          Old Joe goes to the tall gat man's remains, picks another gat
          out of them, and goes back to Joe's inert body on the car
          hood.

                         OLD JOE
          Stupid little shit.
          He lifts him in his arms.

          EXT. CITY OUTSKIRTS - NIGHT

          Joe wakes slowly, pained. Lying alone in an abandoned lot on
          the outskirts of town.
          Slowly he takes stock of himself. Nothing broken. A tight
          bandage on his ear.
          A mournful train whistle, and he turns. Through a chain link
          fence, the train yard. He was put here for a reason.
          A man and a young boy in rags hop onto an empty cargo car,
          heading out of town. Joe watches the boy, his eyes angry.
          Stands shakily. And walks away from the train yard.
          Something like a HELICOPTER sweeps overhead, a spotlight
          zigzagging the area. Joe ducks into shadows, heading towards
          the city.

          INT. LA BELLE AURORE BACKSTAGE

          A swarm of activity, Gat Men rushing in and out.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          36.

                         ABE (PRE-LAP)
          He ain't dumb like the last, we
          gotta get lucky now. Cover the
          roads out of town. Sweep the
          streets, pull in his social circle,
          pound the pavement.

          INT. ABE'S DEN

          Map spread on a table. Gat men gathered around Abe.

                         GAT MAN 3
          He'll hop a train. Fast and
          untraceable.

                         ABE
          Maybe. Sweep the train yard.
          Every second that passes is bad,
          go.

          INT. ABE'S OFFICE

          Kid Blue slumps in a chair, holding a rag to a wound on his
          head. Eyes wet from crying. Abe storms in.

                         ABE
          Stupid little shit.

                         KID BLUE
          I can't hear you
          Abe leans in next to his ear and shouts

                         ABE
          Well that's what happens when you
          fire a gat in a steel box you
          stupid little shit.

                         KID BLUE
          I can fix this. I can find him.

                         ABE
          Go home and let the grown ups work.
          Kid Blue.

          EXT. CITY STREETS - NIGHT

          More helicopters sweep the streets, searchlights blazing.
          Cars with Gat Men circle slowly, shining spotlights
          themselves.
          Joe leaps from the shadows, ducks behind a dumpster. Barely
          avoiding the light. He won't last long out here.

                         JOE
          Where would I go if I were me.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          37.
          He sprints into an alleyway, but Gat Men are coming down the
          other side with flashlights.
          Goes back the way he came, turns a corner.

          EXT. SETH'S APARTMENT

          Joe finds himself in front of a familiar BRIGHT RED GARAGE.
          Seth's apartment. Three stories up, Seth's darkened window.
          He looks up at it, hesitant but desperate.

          INT. PUBLIC LIBRARY - NIGHT

          A window shatters inward, punched through by a wrapped fist.
          A big reading hall, empty and dark. The broken window opens,
          Old Joe slides in. Weaves his way past the reading tables,
          finds what he's looking for at a desk.
          A suspended sheet of thin plastic turns out to be a computer.
          Checking his hand, he inputs the number. Navigates menus and
          windows, information flashing, searching.

          EXT. LA BELLE AURORE - NIGHT

          Gat Men in cars and helicopters patrol the streets.
          Kid Blue sits on the curb, smoking a cigarette. Seething at
          his bandaged hand. Deep in thought. His eyes lift. An
          idea.

          EXT. SETH'S APARTMENT - NIGHT

          The familiar red garage. And three stories up, Seth's lit
          window.
          Kid Blue pulls a small caliber gun from a holster concealed
          on his boot, enters the building.

          INT. PUBLIC LIBRARY - NIGHT

          Old Joe finishes printing several large documents that look
          like maps. He folds them up, pockets them.
          Dashes to the window, starts to heft himself up - And stops.
          On his hand, a smooth aged scar. Of an arrow. Pointing to
          his wrist.
          Old Joe's breath catches. He pulls down his sleeve,
          revealing âBâ then âEâ
          Then âA then âTâ... He bares his arm, reading the entire
          message.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          38.

          INT. SETH'S APARTMENT - NIGHT

          The peephole screen on the inside of Seth's apartment door.
          Kid Blue manipulating a device, a shower of sparks blows the
          screen out momentarily, and the door swings open.
          Kid Blue storms in, his gun drawn, sweeping through the
          apartment with over-eager purpose.
          Empty. He deflates. Thinks.
          Goes to the peephole screen, touches it and a menu comes up.
          A little manipulating, and the image is rewinding.
          An empty hall, scanning back half an hour. Then: young Joe.
          Kid Blue stops scanning, hits âPLAY'. Joe feels around the
          door jam, retrieves a key, and enters the apartment.
          Kid Blue exhales. Well Joe was here.
          Taps the screen again, it goes back to a live feed, and he's
          about to step away when his eye catches something.
          He pushes a square on the screen, and the view changes. To a
          live feed from a camera in the ceiling of the apartment.
          Excited, Kid rewinds this half an hour.
          On the screen: Joe enters the apartment. Rifles around a
          little, then sits at the table. Head in his hands. Staring
          into space.
          Then goes to a kitchen drawer, opens it, gets something.
          Goes to the front door, takes something off the wall, briskly
          exits.
          Kid Blue stops the screen.
          He goes and sits where Joe sat. Stares where Joe stared.
          The kitchen counter. A blender, sink. Can labeled âCOFFEE.â
          Kid goes to the kitchen drawer Joe opened, pulls it open.
          It's full of knives.
          Kid goes finally to the door, looks at the wall. A small
          rack for keys, several hanging and one empty hook.
          Kid Blue stares into space, trying to put these pieces
          together. Lights a cigarette.

          EXT. CORN FIELD - DAWN - ESTABLISHING

          The sun rises over a flat endless field of corn stalks.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          39.

          EXT. CORN FIELD

          We push forward through the green stalks at a brisk pace.
          They part before us, endless, hypnotic.

          INT. BEDROOM - MORNING - FLASHBACK

          The same from the previous flashback.
          Old Joe in bed, half asleep. A woman's arm under his neck.
          It slips away, and he kisses its wrist. Comfort, warmth.
          The woman, leaving. Her hand touches and slides off his
          foot, moving away.

          EXT. DINER - EARLY MORNING

          Old Joe emerges from the corn fields bordering the sidecar
          roadside diner. Fumbles in his jacket, dry-swallows four
          aspirin. Regains his footing. Walks around the diner
          cautiously.
          Parked in back behind a dumpster, SETH'S SLAT BIKE.

          INT. DINER

          Joe sits at a booth. Old Joe enters, steps up slowly, sits.
          A moment of silence.
          Along with his ear, Joe's hand and arm are now wrapped in
          bloodied bandages. Joe's eyes go to Old Joe's arm. Old Joe
          pulls his sleeve back and shows him the scar spelling

          âBEATRIX.â
          Beatrix the waitress steps up breezily.

                         BEATRIX
          Coffee?

                         OLD JOE
          Please. Black. And water.

                         BEATRIX
          Anything else?

                         OLD JOE

                         (TO JOE)
          Are we eating?

                         JOE
          I ordered something.

                         OLD JOE
          Steak and eggs, rare and scrambled.

                         BEATRIX
          Two steak & eggs coming up.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          40.
          She goes. Another pause.

                         OLD JOE
          We're not going to talk about time
          travel.

                         JOE
          ...ok.

                         OLD JOE
          Must hurt.
          His arm.

                         JOE
          Yeah. Didn't know if you'd

                         REMEMBER HER

                         OLD JOE
          I put it together. Clever.

                         (BEAT)
          Do I get the scar when you're cut,
          or when the knife is on its way
          down and it's inevitable that
          you're going to be cut?

                         JOE
          I'm not cutting myself again to-

                         OLD JOE
          I'm not asking you to.

                         JOE
          It's an interesting question, I've
          just lost a lot of blood today.

                         OLD JOE
          You know there's another girl here
          on weekends.

                         JOE

                         (REALIZES)
          Sue.

                         OLD JOE
          Well. Have fun explaining who
          âBeatrix' is for the next thirty
          years.
          Beatrix sets Old Joe's black coffee next to Joe's white.

          OLD JOE (CONT'D)
          How's the French coming?

                         JOE
          Good.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          41.

                         OLD JOE
          (fast in French,

                         SUBTITLED)
          I know you have a gun between your
          legs.
          Joe's face registers obvious incomprehension.

          OLD JOE (CONT'D)
          No? Well you'll get there
          eventually. Obviously.

                         JOE
          I don't care what you're here for,
          whatever you think you're going to
          get from me. More time or whatever
          you want. I can't let you walk
          away from this diner alive.
          Because the next 30 years of my

                         LIFE-

          OLD JOE JOE
          I'm sorry to cut off - sorry -are mine they're not yours
          to cut off this spiel you've they're not yours anymore you
          been practicing all night, can say anything you want but
          but I need you to need you to you're not walking outta here
          listen. Listen. alive

                         OLD JOE
          You know what the voice of god
          sounds like? See now good you're
          confused now but you're listening.
          I hope the voice of god sounds like
          an old man speaking French. Old
          men speaking French sound like
          primeval trees in a strong wind,
          just irrefutable. Wise, strong,
          gentle, all these things in
          harmony, complimentary. At once.
          Old men speaking French. Young men
          speaking French sound, without
          exception, like weenies. Fact.
          You ever hear a Frenchman under 40
          try to sound threatening? It's
          hilarious. English is a tight t-
          shirt, flatters the young. Rat a
          tat tat. French is a double
          breasted suit. Young man can put
          it on, but it always feels like
          he's putting something on. Some
          things, you just need the years.
          It's my favorite language.

                         JOE
          I've got a life ahead of me that's
          mine and I'm not giving it up for
          you or anybody

                         

                         

                         

                         

          42.

                         OLD JOE
          Well you know what you have to do
          then why don't you take your little
          gun out from between your knees and
          do it. One in the head, two in the
          heart. Boy. It's all âanybodyâ
          and âneverâ and then you show up
          here and think you can talk me into
          dying. Well bullshit we both know
          you're not going to kill me.
          Christ you ordered eggs.
          Old Joe downs two aspirin. Takes a breath.

          OLD JOE (CONT'D)
          I know why you couldn't pull that
          trigger. When you're tasked to do
          the unthinkable, your mind, it'll
          do anything it can to stop you.
          Only way is you gotta know why
          you're doing it, in your bones, so
          you can say it out loud to someone
          without apologizing. Or you gotta
          cut yourself off, go numb. But
          that'll kill you, down the line.

                         (BEAT)
          It's hard to make eye contact with
          you. It's too strange.

                         JOE
          Your face looks backwards.

                         OLD JOE
          Yeah, that helps actually. That
          little twist of unfamiliar.

                         (BEAT)
          You're not winning some pissing
          contest by looking me in the eye,
          you didn't know what I looked like
          until yesterday, it makes sense
          that it's easier for you.

                         JOE
          I wasn't trying to. Do you know
          what's going to happen? Have you
          already done all this, right now,
          as me?

                         OLD JOE
          No not - exactly - I don't want to
          talk about time travel shit,
          because we'll start talking about
          it and then we'll be here all day
          making diagrams with straws. It
          doesn't matter.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          43.

                         JOE
          When I hurt myself now, it changes
          your body. Do my actions change
          your memories?

                         OLD JOE
          It doesn't matter because I don't
          know how it works. Nobody knows
          how it works. Time travel was an
          accident, thirty years from now the
          smartest men in the world know
          exactly one thing about it that you
          don't: they know to be scared to
          death of it.

                         (BEAT)
          My memory is cloudy, there's a
          cloud. It's a, it starts clear
          then gets cloudy as it goes back..
          Goddammit hand me those.
          Straws. Joe passes him two.

          OLD JOE (CONT'D)
          And the salt. No, the pepper. The
          pepper.
          Old Joe sets two straws about a foot apart, parallel, and
          pours pepper between them, thus:

          OLD JOE (CONT'D)
          Ok, the span between the straws is
          a timeline of the next 30 years.

                         THIS
          (the left straw)
          is the present moment, right now.

                         AND THIS
          (the right straw)
          is the moment thirty years from now
          when I was sent back. The machine
          is tuned to a fixed time, you know
          that, 30 some years, it's not
          adjustable.

                         JOE
          What's the pepper?

                         

                         

                         

                         

          44.

                         OLD JOE
          The pepper is a sort of fog. See
          my memories start clear here,
          (at the right straw)
          but as they go back they get
          cloudier, until they're totally
          obscured. It's like a fog.
          Because my memories aren't really
          memories, they're one possible
          eventuality now, and they grow
          clearer or cloudier as they become
          more or less likely. But then they
          get to the present moment
          (the left straw)
          And they're instantly clear again.
          Like a wall of fog moving forward
          with the present moment. I can
          remember what you do after you do
          it.
          He pushes the left straw slowly towards the right, and it
          pushes the pepper with it.

                         JOE
          So you can

                         OLD JOE
          And it hurts.

                         JOE
          So when we're apart you can
          remember what I do. After I do it.

                         OLD JOE
          Uh huh. But
          Beatrix brings their food, two identical plates. Old Joe
          awkwardly clears away the pepper and straws.

          OLD JOE (CONT'D)
          This is a precise description of a
          fuzzy mechanism. Time travel fucks
          everything, my brain and body try
          to catch up. It's messy. That's
          why it's dangerous. And it hurts.
          All I know I know two things for
          sure. I know what's happening in my
          head. And I know that you're still
          going to meet her.

                         JOE
          Who?
          Old Joe takes a worn double of Joe's POCKET WATCH from his
          pocket, clicks it open. We don't see inside it, but he
          stares at it intently.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          45.

          JOE (CONT'D)
          This is a woman, what? I'm going to
          fall in love with?

                         OLD JOE
          She's gonna save your life.
          Old Joe makes eye contact with Joe, for maybe the first time,
          and holds it. Unexpectedly naked on his face is the deepest
          sort of grief. Deep and unrelenting. Joe can't look at it,
          he breaks off his gaze.
          The grief is too much for Old Joe to swallow back down, so he
          turns it into anger.

          OLD JOE (CONT'D)
          For a long time at the beginning
          she thought we'd have a baby. She
          would have been a good mother. She
          wanted that so much. And now I'm
          saying sorry to a picture.

                         JOE
          She's. How is she, you said save
          my life.

                         OLD JOE
          Your life. Let's look. At your
          life. You're a killer and a
          junkie. And a fucking child
          mentality, âMy life,â âwhat's
          mine.â Save your life, you're
          asking how? The question is why.
          Why would someone waste themselves
          on you, give up the good life they
          had, sacrifice a good life to love
          you.

                         JOE
          My life is my own, I don't need it

                         SAVED

                         OLD JOE
          Shut your fucking child mouth.
          She's going to clean you up and
          you're going to take her love like
          a sponge and you're both going to
          pretend that she's saved you,
          you're so self absorbed and stupid.

                         (BEAT)
          Yesterday. Thirty years from now
          is yesterday. And I can remember
          it, it's going to happen. Let me
          tell you what's going to happen to
          this woman who saved your worthless
          life.
          A GREEN DOOR - Kicked in with all the violence in the world.

          INT. FRENCH COTTAGE - MORNING (FLASHBACK)

          His Wife spins, as Gangsters burst into the entryway.
          Old Joe in bed. It plays out again. He leaps to his feet,
          is tackled by the Gangsters. They drag Old Joe from the
          bedroom. Though the hall, Joe sees the woman struggling
          against two Gangsters, her dress torn and bloody. One
          approaches her with the knife.
          Old Joe screams, struggles, but cannot stop them from doing
          what they do to her.

          INT. DINER

          Joe is not sure where to put his eyes.

                         OLD JOE
          Have you heard of the Rainmaker?

                         JOE
          Seth said, that night. A new boss
          in the future, he said.

                         OLD JOE
          The Rainmaker came out of nowhere
          and in the span of six months took
          total control of the five major
          syndicates.

                         JOE
          That would take an army.

                         OLD JOE
          But he didn't have an army. Legend
          is he did it alone. Alone alone.
          Don't know I believe the legend but
          he didn't have an army.

                         JOE
          How did he do it?

                         OLD JOE
          That's the question. And no one
          knows. Not only that, there's no
          pictures of him. It's insane.
          There's stories he has a synthetic
          jaw. Things like that. But word
          spread quick about him through the
          ex-looper grapevine, even before
          his mass executions and vagrant
          purges and reign of terror, because
          the first thing he did was start
          closing loops. All of them.
          Exterminating the whole program.
          Cleaning house.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          47.
          Old Joe pulls the folded papers he printed at the library out
          of his jacket, puts them on the table.

          OLD JOE (CONT'D)
          Do you know what this is? This
          number. This number.
          On the back of his papers he scrawls the number: 07153902935.
          As he writes it, a phone starts ringing, bringing us into:

          INT. OFFICE - DAY - FLASHBACK

          An 8th story office, under siege. Gangsters down in the
          street fire up at the windows with guns. Helicopters pass
          by. The office door is blocked shut with a filing cabinet.
          On the phone - the looper DALE, but in his mid 50s. Battered
          and terrified. Holding a piece of paper, reading off it, on
          the phone with Old Joe.
          The wall with the door in it EXPLODES inward.

          INT. FRENCH LIVING ROOM - CONTINUOUS - FLASHBACK

          The line goes dead. Old Joe hangs up. Looks at his hand,
          with the number. Standing in his cottage, before he was sent
          back. Through the window, his wife working in the garden.
          Old Joe closes his hand.

          OLD JOE (V.O.)
          This is a piece of identifying
          information on the Rainmaker. I
          can use it to find him, now, and
          stop him from killing my wife.

          INT. DINER

          Old Joe showing the number to Joe.

                         JOE
          None of this concerns me. We're
          done we're gonna walk outside now.

                         OLD JOE
          This is going to happen

                         JOE
          It happened to you, it doesn't have
          to happen to me.
          (points: the pocket watch)
          You got her picture in there? Show
          it to me. Show me her picture.
          And when I see her for the first
          time I'll walk away, and she won't
          be with me.

                         (MORE)

                         

                         

                         

                         

          48.

                         JOE (CONT'D)
          I guarantee the instant I look at
          her picture that fog in your brain
          will swallow up the memories of her
          and she'll be gone.

                         OLD JOE
          Gone.

                         JOE
          She'll be safe. And then we can
          all do what we have to do.
          A beat. Old Joe holding the pocket watch, gazing at it.
          Then he snaps it closed in his fist, drawing it back.

                         OLD JOE
          No you don't understand. We don't
          have to give her up. I'm going to
          tell you why I'm here now.
          He puts his hand on the folded papers.

          OLD JOE (CONT'D)
          I'm gonna save her.
          A quick beat. Joe goes for his gun. But Old Joe is fast, he
          jams his foot into Joe's crotch, crushing the hidden gun into
          him. Joe cries out, Old Joe grabs his hair and plants his
          face into the table.
          When Joe's hands go to his face Old Joe grabs them and pulls.
          Foot in his crotch, pulling his arms tight over the table.

          OLD JOE (CONT'D)
          The Rainmaker is alive right now.
          Living here, somewhere in this
          county. And I can find him with
          this. I need you to lay low, stay
          out of my way and not get caught.
          I know how to fix this, I won't
          stop till I finish it. I'm going
          to find him and kill him.
          Joe's face loosens, his eyes on their coffee cups.

                         JOE
          It's been awhile since we've gotten
          a warm-up.
          Old Joe realizes, looks around. The diner is eerily quiet.
          Beatrix and the staff have all quietly left. Fled.
          Old Joe swings out of the booth, still holding Joe by the
          hair, dragging him like a doll. Joe's blunderbuss clatters
          to the ground. Old Joe drags him to the window. They look
          out. Nothing in the parking lot. Too quiet.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          49.

                         OLD JOE
          It's been thirty years for me, so
          it's hard to remember. When you
          stole Seth's bike you stripped out
          the security tracker. Right?
          Joe's fearful face says âno.' Old Joe draws his gat.

          OLD JOE (CONT'D)
          Make it to the field, you can lose
          them in the field. Go east and hop

                         A TRAIN
          Joe punches Old Joe square in the jaw, and he goes down. His
          papers and gun fall. The diner door EXPLODES.

                         JOE
          I've got him! He's here!
          A GAT MAN barrels in, his gat blazing. Joe scrambles but Old
          Joe gets the gat.
          With an expert shot Old Joe puts the Gat Man down, but there
          are two more behind him. Pinned behind a booth, Old Joe
          returns fire, glass breaking and chaos.
          Joe grabs at the papers, Old Joe grabs them first and yanks.
          Leaving Joe with a torn-off top sheet.
          Joe scrambles away, down the length of the diner behind the
          booths, back to their table, as the Gat Men and Old Joe have
          their fire fight. Joe's blunderbuss on the ground beneath
          the table. He scoops it up. Turns, and fires at Old Joe.

                         OLD JOE
          Shit.
          Joe's blunderbuss hacks another shot, and the window behind
          Old Joe explodes. Old Joe makes his break, sprints for the
          broken window, jumps...

          EXT. BACK OF DINER - MORNING

          ...and hits the dusty parking lot running. Towards the corn.

          EXT. FRONT OF DINER

          Kid Blue squats on his haunches with four more Gat Men, their
          guns trained on the diner door. Three Gat Men burst out,
          followed by Joe.

          DINER GAT MAN
          The back, he's running!

                         JOE
          Around back!

                         

                         

                         

                         

          50.
          They all run around back, where Old Joe is halfway to the
          corn but not there yet.
          The seven Gat Men and Kid Blue and Joe fire their guns after
          him while running but they're too far away (and they're
          running) so nothing hits. Joe blasts at the old man blindly,
          sprinting with all his might, eyes streaming tears in the
          dust.
          When Old Joe hits the wall of corn he seems to vanish. Four
          of the Gat Men follow him in, while the remaining pursuers
          slow to a stop, doubled over, panting. Defeated.
          It takes a few seconds for Kid Blue to realize that Joe is
          there with them. It takes another second for Joe to realize
          that the dynamic has changed. He turns and runs back towards
          the diner, Kid Blue and the Gat men in pursuit. One of the
          Gat Men fires.

                         KID BLUE
          Alive! No, alive!
          Joe makes it to the Slat Bike, jumps on, hits the ignition.

          CLICK.

                         JOE
          No fuck no fucking piece of shit
          CLICK CLICK. The Kid and the Gats closing in, and just the
          moment that Kid Blue lays his hands on the back of the bike
          the engine turns over with a ROAR.
          The back of the bike kicks up, heat and air blasts from the
          open slats beneath, blowing Kid Blue back on his ass. The
          bike HOVERS a few feet off the ground.
          Joe roars off into the corn. The Kid is on his feet running
          back to the Gat Men.

                         KID BLUE
          The tracker! Get the tracker!

          EXT. CORN FIELD

          Joe riding at full speed through the thick corn stalks. He
          BAILS, snapping through corn stalks and rolling to a painful
          stop. The bike ZOOMS onward through the stalks, quickly out
          of sight.
          Pained, Joe lies still, breathing hard. Pulls Old Joe's torn
          paper from his pocket. On one side, the number Old Joe
          scribbled: 1027363259 He flips it over. It's a map.
          Mostly of empty farm land, bisected by a bold highway and
          scattered farm houses.
          One of them is CIRCLED IN BLACK.

                         

                         

                         

                         

                         SARA

                         

                         

                         

                         

          51.

          EXT. FIELD - DAWN

          A bare field of churned chocolatey earth. Near its edge juts
          the dead stump of an old tree.
          A YOUNG WOMAN in work clothes named SARA chops away at the
          trunk with a large axe. Over and over, splintering it apart.
          Endless plains of corn surround the field. In the near
          distance, a two story farm house with an adjacent barn.
          Sara focused on her work as the sun rises.

          EXT. CORN FIELD - EARLY MORNING

          Sara fiddles with a garbage can sized DEVICE, and with a
          crackle of mechanic thrusters it floats up and over the corn
          fields, spraying something chemical.

          INT. FARM HOUSE KITCHEN - EARLY MORNING

          Sara makes coffee.

          EXT. FARM HOUSE PORCH - EARLY MORNING

          She sits on a rocking chair, and mimes smoking an invisible
          cigarette.
          Our first good look at her face. Clear and beautiful, but it
          has been here for awhile.
          The morning light changes from steel blue to pale white.
          Rocking gently, fake smoking and drinking coffee. Not going
          anywhere.

          INT. FARM HOUSE BEDROOM - MORNING

          Blinds drawn, dark. A FIGURE lies in bed. Sara steps in,
          puts her hand on the sleeping figure's foot.

                         SARA
          C'mon baby. Time to get up.

          INT. FARM HOUSE KITCHEN - MORNING

          Cooking eggs. The front door bangs. She looks up.

          INT. FARM HOUSE FOYER

          The screen door bangs in the wind. Sara inspects it. The
          latch is broken. She sighs.
          Then freezes.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          52.
          Through the screen door, some fifty yards across the front
          lawn, the dark figure of a MAN stands at the edge of the corn
          fields. Watching her.
          She watches right back for a long moment.
          Then grabs a shotgun mounted above the door and with no
          hesitation at all plows outside.
          The dark figure vanishes into the corn fields.

          EXT. FARMHOUSE FRONT LAWN

          Sara storms down the porch and stalks across the lawn,
          shotgun extended. Not fucking around.
          Does not slow her pace until she is ten yards from the corn
          fields, where she plants herself and shouts:

                         SARA
          Listen up fucker. I have shot and
          buried three vagrants in the past
          year. If you want to know the
          Christ's honest truth I'm starting
          to get a taste for it. So I don't
          care what hobo sob story you've
          got, I get a dozen a week and it
          cuts no cash with me. It's me and
          my husband here, we're broke and
          angry at our lot in this world and
          heavily armed. So take some corn
          and move on, but if you show your
          face again I will cut you the fuck
          in half.
          Silence. Just the wind in the corn. A long beat. Then Sara
          turns, walks briskly back.
          Moments later Joe's face pokes through the corn stalks. He
          takes in the farm. The barn behind it. The fallow field.

                         LATER
          Joe sits in the same spot, a few feet in the corn but with a
          clear sight line at the house.
          His gun on his knee.
          JOE'S FACE - Pale, sweating. Something's wrong. He winces.
          Pinches his eyes. Headache.
          The sun pounds down. He looks at the piece of map.

                         JOE
          C'mon. C'mere. C'mon. C'mon.
          C'mon.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          53.

          EXT. CITY - ESTABLISHING - DAY

          Helicopters sweep by.

          INT. ABE'S OFFICE

          Abe stands fuming, flanked by two Gat Men. Kid Blue sits
          like a kid in detention.

                         ABE
          Well. You found him. And you
          russeled up a posse and went to git
          âem. Like a good little cowboy
          from one of your movie movies.
          Without telling me.

                         KID BLUE
          I can do it again.

                         ABE
          You can fuck up again? Really.
          You know what happens to me if I
          don't get that old bastard? I got
          too much riding, Kid, I can't
          afford a fuck-up playing cowboy.
          Put your gat on the table.
          Fighting tears now, Kid puts his gun on the desk. But he
          doesn't take his hand off it.

                         KID BLUE
          I wanted you to say I did good,
          that's all I wanted. This is all I
          have.
          Abe puts his hand on the gat. Kids' finger still on the
          trigger. A tense moment. Abe pulls the gun away, across the
          table.

          KID BLUE (CONT'D)
          Please just give me one more
          chance, I'll bring him here alive
          and hold him and you can put a
          bullet in his brain yourself-
          Abe grabs the hammer. SLAMS it on Kid's bad hand, crushing
          it. Kid howls, the Gat Men grab him.

          INT. STEEP STAIRS

          Kid is literally dragged up the stairs by a Gat Man.

          INT. BACKSTAGE

          The Gat Man shoves Kid Blue through the twisty maze of
          backstage, past girls and Loopers and men.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          54.
          The Kid blubbers and bleeds. Humiliated. But he pulls
          himself halfway together. Make a show:

                         KID BLUE
          I'm gonna make this good again. I
          will. I'm gonna be back.

          EXT. ALLEYWAY - DAY

          Raining. The Gat Man pushes the Kid out the back entrance
          door, into the alley. The Kid instinctively turns towards
          the street.
          But the Gat Man steers him back, deeper into the alley. The
          Kid realizes what this means. Everything changes.

                         KID BLUE
          Oh no. Oh no no no no
          He fights in vain to break from the Gat Man's grip. Weeps,
          begs, clasps at whatever he can grab.
          The Gat Man turns a corner -- towards the alley's dead end.

          KID BLUE (CONT'D)
          No! No! No no no no!
          Shrieking. Annoyed, the Gat Man throws the Kid hard to the
          concrete. The Gat Man pulls his gun, raises it without
          ceremony.
          BANG. The Gat Man's face explodes. Staggers, his gun FIRES
          into the wall. He drops like a doll.
          Kid Blue lies in the rain, hyperventilating. His pant leg
          hiked up, showing his boot with its holster.
          In his mangled left hand, the small caliber PISTOL he keeps
          stashed. His pinkie on the trigger.

          KID BLUE (CONT'D)
          Oh.
          Cradling his crushed hand, dazed, he scampers off like a
          soaked rat.

          EXT. FARM HOUSE - NIGHT

          Silent and still. Sara comes out onto the front porch. She
          gathers up a few things, turns out the porch light.
          Notices a floodlight still lit on the BARN across the yard.
          She turns the porch light back on.
          The dark corn fields, silent and vaguely threatening. She
          steps back in the house, emerging again with the shotgun.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          55.

          EXT. FRONT LAWN - NIGHT

          Sara stalks towards the barn, shotgun in hand. Shadows loom
          across the yard. All is silent.

          EXT. BARN - CONTINUOUS

          She reaches the barn. A hard pool of light from a mounted
          floodlight falls off to inky darkness.
          Hits a metal switch near the barn door and the light snaps
          off. In its absence the darkness swarms.
          She briskly walks back towards the house, but slows. Stops.
          Turns. In the darkness by the barn, crunch crunch. Crunch.
          And maybe a shape. Deep in the swarming dark.

                         SARA
          Hey. Who's there.
          Sara levels the shotgun at the darkness, and steps back.
          Quiet but definite - crunch crunch. And now, definitely a
          shape. A man. coming towards her.

                         SARA (CONT'D)
          Stop right there. Stop!

          EXT. CORN FIELD - CONTINUOUS

          Joe slumped over unconscious where we left him, in the corn.
          Sara's shout wakes him with a start. Sweating, pasty.
          Disoriented. Something is wrong with him.
          In a flash of panic he parts the corn stalks, sees Sarah
          backing away from the barn. The dark hulking figure of a man
          pursues her slowly but steadily.

                         JOE

                         SHIT
          His hand goes to his holster but his gun has fallen out, he
          scrambles in the dirt for it.

          EXT. FRONT LAWN

          Sara backing up still, shotgun leveled. The man, still in
          darkness, comes towards her.

                         SARA
          You stop right there, you stop!
          She fires her gun in the air. The man pauses, but then
          continues towards her. She trips on a root, FALLS.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          56.

          INT. 2ND STORY BEDROOM - NIGHT

          From a CHILD'S POV - We run across a darkened bedroom to the
          WINDOW. A child's hand smacks the glass, and framed through
          the pane, through the unseen child's eyes, this is what we

                         SEE:
          Sara on the ground, fumbling the gun. In trouble. The DARK
          MAN, advancing towards her menacingly.
          At the last moment, from the corn fields, JOE runs into the
          light and steps directly between them, shouts, his gun raised
          at the Dark Man.
          And the Dark Man STOPS.

          EXT. FRONT LAWN - CONTINUOUS

          Joe's gun leveled, face set. But the porch light on the
          man's face: it is not Old Joe.
          It is a man in his 30s, filthy, with down's syndrome. A
          greasy sign around his neck: âPLEASE HELP MUWTE FOOD $ GOD

                         BLESS YOUÂ
          Joe lowers his gun, face melting.

                         SARA
          Jee sus.
          (to the MUTE VAGRANT)
          Hey, hey. I'm going to get you

                         SOME FOOD-
          But the man scampers off, leaving his sign.

                         SARA (CONT'D)
          ...great.

          EXT. SECOND STORY BEDROOM WINDOW

          The child, in darkness, watching. He recedes into the
          bedroom, his hand slipping off the glass.

          EXT. FRONT LAWN

          Sara stands, picks up the sign, calls after the MUTE.

                         SARA
          Hey you forgot your greasy goddamn
          hobo sign oh for godssakes.
          (turns to Joe)
          Alright, what are you?
          Joe turns away from her quickly, but doubles over, crumpling
          to a heap on the grass. Sara checks his face.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          57.

                         SARA (CONT'D)
          Hey. Look at - hey. The fuck-
          ehh.
          Joe PUKES. She steps away. Takes a moment. Breathes.

          EXT. FRONT PORCH - MOMENTS LATER

          She drags Joe up onto the porch, under the light.

                         SARA
          Hey. Up here, at the light. Hey.
          Sara SLAPS HIM. Hard. His eyes snap open. He sees her face.
          She feels his head. Checks his eyes. Cherry red and veined,
          swollen under the lids.

                         JOE

                         (TOTALLY GONE)
          My head... splitting apart... time
          eventualities, he said-

                         SARA
          How long since you dropped?

                         JOE

                         DROPPED
          Sara mimes an eye dropper.

                         SARA
          Dropped, or what the kids call it.

                         JOE
          A day.

                         SARA
          One day. Wow.
          She leans back on her haunches, looks at him, deep in
          thought. Deciding what to do. Joe lies prone, shaking,
          sweating.

                         JOE
          Thirsty. I can't feel my legs

                         SARA
          You're withdrawing from a synthetic
          barbiturate. It's a quick punch
          but it's this bad a day in, without
          care you might not make it through
          the night.
          Sara looks at his shoes. Beneath the caked mud, fine
          leather. Her eyes linger on his gun. They turn cold.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          58.
          She stands quickly without a word, vanishing into the house.
          Joe lies still, breath shallow. Turns his head, hazy.

                         JOE
          Thirsty. Thirsty.
          Soft footsteps approach. Small bare feet padding towards him
          through the front door. A young boy steps out onto the
          porch, 6 years old, named CID.
          Cid looks Joe over. His eyes linger on Joe's gun. Then he
          kneels, his small hands feeling Joe's sweaty face. Pushes a
          straw to Joe's lips. Joe's hands clasp around a plastic cup
          with a cartoon tiger, and he drinks.

          SARA (O.S.)

                         (SHARP)
          Cid. C'mere monkey.
          Cid goes back into the house, leaving his cup with Joe.

          INT. FARMHOUSE FOYER - CONTINUOUS

          Sara tries to pick Cid up but he dodges, walks up the stairs.

                         CID
          Who's that man?

                         SARA
          Just a vagrant babe.

          INT. FARMHOUSE UPPER HALL

          Sara leads him down the hall and into his bedroom.

                         CID
          No he's not.

                         SARA
          Oh yeah?

                         CID
          His shoes are too shiny.

                         SARA
          Well aren't you a smart monkey.

          INT. CID'S BEDROOM

          He gets in bed.

                         CID
          Is he sick?

                         SARA
          Yup.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          59.

                         CID
          Will he get better?

                         SARA
          Yup.

                         CID
          Promise?

                         SARA
          Go to sleep. Okay. Night baby
          boy.
          Kisses him.

                         CID
          Night Sara.
          Lingers over him in the pale light. Then goes.

          EXT. HIGHWAY - NIGHT

          A darkened highway, the lights of the farm house distant. A
          small STAKE BED TRUCK rumbles up, stops on the soft shoulder.
          Sara at the wheel. Sits a second. Then climbs out.
          Roughly pulls Joe out of the flatbed. He lands in the dirt.
          Sara avoids looking at him, closes up the flatbed.
          Joe weakly grabs her ankle. She pries his hand off, and
          discovers CID'S CUP in the dirt beside him. Takes it
          angrily, strides back to the truck.

          INT. STAKE BED TRUCK - CONTINUOUS

          Sara gets in, drops Cid's cup on the seat beside her. Looks
          in her rear view mirror. Leaving a man to die. Looks down
          at Cid's cup. For a long moment.

                         SARA
          Ssssshhit.

          INT. BARN - NIGHT

          Sara lights a gas lamp. Threads a hose from a tank of water
          around the cot. Joe on a metal cot, covered with blankets.

                         SARA
          Water. Drink it, all night, more
          than you think you want.
          Moves a metal bucket next to the bed. Adjusts the blankets.

                         SARA (CONT'D)
          Aim for the bucket. And don't chew
          your tongue off. In the morning
          we're gonna talk.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          60.
          The last thing she does is handcuff his wrist to the cot and
          take his gun. On her way out she puts it on a bench beside
          the door, and turns out the floodlight.

          EXT. CITY STREETS - MORNING

          Dawn breaks. Exhausted Gat Men dutifully patrol the streets
          with flashlights, stopping every passerby.
          On the outskirts of the city. Vagrant fires burn distant
          orange. A large drainage pipe drips into a brackish creek.

          INT. DRAINAGE TUNNEL

          Underground. We move through it.

          INT. RUNOFF ROOM

          Cavernous space beneath a high street grating, damp and cold.
          Old Joe sits on the ground, methodically cleaning and loading
          his gun. He finishes. Places the gun on top of his folded,
          torn maps. Closes his eyes. Sees:

          EXT. FRONT PORCH - NIGHT (OLD JOE MEMORY)

          A bank of fog clears, revealing Sara's face looking down at
          us. She slaps us hard.

                         SARA
          Hey.

          INT. RUNOFF ROOM

          Old Joe touches his temple. Head aching. Remembering.

                         OLD JOE
          The first time I saw her face.

          EXT. FRONT PORCH - NIGHT (OLD JOE MEMORY)

          Sara's face. SLAP!

                         SARA
          Hey.

          INT. RUNOFF ROOM


                         OLD JOE
          No. No no.
          His POCKET WATCH sits open in front of him. He picks it up.

          EXT. FRONT PORCH - NIGHT (OLD JOE MEMORY)

          Sara's face. SLAP!

                         

                         

                         

                         

          61.

          INT. RUNOFF ROOM

          Old Joe holds his pocket watch tight like a talisman.
          Fingers dug deep in his head.

                         OLD JOE
          No. The first time I saw her face.

          INT. PARIS CLUB - NIGHT

          A fist comes straight at us. SMACK!
          We reel back, revealing: the Paris club, crowded and rowdy.
          A piece of Old Joe's life that we've seen before.
          Joe (mid 40s) lies on the ground, lip bloodied, laughing
          hysterically at a YOUNG PUNK who has just hit him. A bar
          fight blossoms in slow motion all around.
          Joe looks up, sees the woman who will be his Wife for the
          first time. In her green dress. Whisps of fog drift into
          frame.

          INT. RUNOFF ROOM

          Inside Old Joe's pocket watch, a picture. Of his WIFE.
          The sun breaks in through the grate above. Old Joe closes
          the pocket watch, holds in tight. Then he stands and picks
          up the gun and goes.

                         CUT TO:
          A child stands in a massive doorway with blinding white light
          beaming through.
          JOE'S FACE - wrecked, but his eyes flutter. Blink.

          INT. BARN - MORNING

          Joe lies on the cot. Blinks. The barn doors, the morning
          sun rising through. If the child was there, he's gone now.

          INT. FARMHOUSE KITCHEN - MORNING

          Cid draws at the kitchen table. Sara enters.

                         SARA
          Morning monkey.

                         CID
          The man's up.
          Sara stiffens, looks out the window.

                         CID (CONT'D)
          Is he staying here now?

                         

                         

                         

                         

          62.

                         SARA
          No.

          A WALL OF LEAVES
          Fingers part the green, and Old Joe peers through the dense
          foliage.

          EXT. SUBURBAN STREET - MORNING

          Old Joe hides in the trees across the street from a suburban
          track home.
          A young boy in a bright jacket runs out the front door and
          off down the street.
          Old Joe checks the folded map in his trembling hands. On it,
          this house is circled in black, exactly like Sara's farm.
          Stuffing the map in his pocket, he pushes out through the
          trees.

          EXT. BARN - MORNING

          Sara approaches the barn, her shotgun in hand.
          Joe sits on the ground just outside the open barn door, the
          metal cot behind him still handcuffed to his wrist.
          Methodically cleaning and loading his gun.

                         SARA
          Toss it.
          Joe freezes. Then, half annoyed

                         JOE
          I just finished cleaning - alright.
          Tosses it into the dirt. Sara lowers the shotgun slightly.

                         SARA
          How do you feel?

                         JOE
          I'm at thirty percent.

                         SARA
          Take it slow and by the end of the
          week you'll be at fifty. Good.
          She tosses him a key, he unlocks his handcuff.

                         SARA (CONT'D)
          I took you in so you wouldn't die,
          and now you're not going to die.

                         (MORE)

                         

                         

                         

                         

          63.

                         SARA (CONT'D)
          So take the morning to rest, then
          you need to get off my farm.

                         JOE
          I can't do that.

                         SARA
          I'm sorry?

                         JOE
          I need to stay here for a little
          while longer.

                         SARA
          I am not cool with that.

                         JOE
          Well I'm sorry.

                         SARA
          Well I'm sorry too, you just lost
          your take the morning to rest
          privileges, get off my farm.

                         JOE
          No.
          Sara raises the shotgun.

                         SARA
          Get off my farm.

                         JOE
          No. You couldn't scare a retarded
          hobo with that thing. Literally.

                         SARA
          This is a Remington 870, one blast
          could cut you the fuck in half.

                         JOE
          And that's, that's telling. You're
          holding a gun. I say I'm not
          afraid, so you describe the gun to
          me. But it's not the gun I'm not
          afraid of.

                         (BEAT)
          What are you gonna shoot in the
          air? Blow a hole in your barn? To
          scare me? Go ahead. But you
          couldn't let me die, you won't kill
          me.

                         SARA
          So now I saved your life that makes
          me weak?

                         

                         

                         

                         

          64.

                         JOE
          Look I'm not a threat to you or
          your boy. I need to be on your
          property but I'd prefer to not have
          any contact with you at all, I'll
          stay in the fields. There's just
          one thing you need to do for me,
          and you won't have to deal with me
          again.
          He takes the map from his pocket, unfolds it. Tosses it over
          to her.

                         JOE (CONT'D)
          Just, verify for me that's your
          house on the map. So I know I'm in
          the right place.

                         SARA
          What is this?

                         JOE
          A map.

                         SARA
          That's my house. Why is it marked?

                         JOE
          Doesn't matter. Ok. I'll be out
          of the barn in an hour, if you can
          spare it I'll take the water jug
          with me. Does that well have
          water? I'll fill it from there.
          Sara turns the map over. Sees the NUMBER that Old Joe wrote
          on the back. 07153902935.
          And everything changes.

                         SARA
          What is this.
          She shows him the number. She is not asking what the number
          is - she knows. Joe is suddenly not so relaxed.

                         SARA (CONT'D)
          What is this.

                         JOE
          Does that mean something to you?
          For the first time in their conversation, Joe looks in her
          eyes. Sara stares daggers, searching. Very different than
          she was ten seconds ago.
          Joe scoots back

                         

                         

                         

                         

          65.

                         JOE (CONT'D)

                         HEY-
          And without hesitating Sara hefts the shotgun and SHOOTS HIM.
          BLAST! Rips his shirt open bloody, blows him back screaming.

          EXT. PARK

          Old Joe STOPS in his tracks, children running around him.
          His hand goes to his temple.

          EXT. BARN - DAY (OLD JOE MEMORY)

          Fog clears from Sara blasting us with her shotgun.

          EXT. PARK

          Old Joe's hand runs from his temple to his neck. Feels a new
          but old scar, just a little divot behind his ear.

          INT. BARN

          Sara drags Joe in by the foot. She heaves the barn door
          closed. In the lamp lit dark Joe rolls and groans in the
          dirt.

                         SARA
          Who are you?
          She shoves the shotgun barrel in his face, a rush of fury

                         SARA (CONT'D)
          You're right I'm not a killer but I
          am fine with how a blast of rock
          salt to your face won't kill you.
          Who are you and what are you here
          for? Who are you?
          Joe breathes hard, bleeding in the dirt with a shotgun in his
          nose. But he forces calm. A beat. Then he starts talking.

                         JOE
          Time travel hasn't been invented
          yet. But in thirty years it will
          be.

          EXT. PARK - DAY

          A suburban park. On its far end, a birthday party.
          The YOUNG BOY in the bright jacket we saw run out of the
          house earlier sits alone under a tree.
          Old Joe approaches him.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          66.

                         OLD JOE
          Hi. Daniel, right? I'm Chad's
          father. Aren't you going to come
          over? We're doing cake.

                         DANIEL
          It's ice cream cake and I can't eat
          ice cream. Cause of the milk.

                         OLD JOE
          Well you should join the party even
          if you don't have cake. You have a
          birthday coming up?

                         DANIEL
          In July. We were gonna go to the
          lake but I don't think we are now.

                         OLD JOE
          I'm sorry.
          Old Joe leaves, walks across the grass. Having trouble
          breathing.

          INT. BARN

          Sara sits. Joe weakly talks, the end of a long explanation.

                         JOE
          I can't go back to the city and
          find him cause Abe, the boss, all
          his men are going to search the
          streets 24/7 till they turn up me
          or... him. All I have is this map.
          And that he's coming here.
          Sara stands. Paces away. Deep in thought.

                         SARA
          A Looper.

                         JOE
          Yeah. Did you know about Loopers,
          what we do

                         SARA
          I've heard stories. So he's coming
          here to murder me and my son
          because he thinks we might be this
          Rainmaker. And once he kills the
          Rainmaker, what happens?

                         JOE
          I think... he thinks, the instant
          the rainmaker dies, he'll never
          have been sent back, so he'll just
          vanish, and be back with his wife.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          67.

          EXT. SUBURBAN STREET

          The same track home Old Joe studied from the trees earlier.
          Daniel trots towards it, coming home from the birthday party.

          INT. BARN


                         SARA
          Who is he? The guy you let run?
          Just some random guy from the
          future?

                         JOE
          Yeah. Someone. You know what
          these numbers mean.

          EXT. SUBURBAN HOME BACK YARD - DAY

          Well tended by someone who loves growing things. Laurels,
          ivy on trellises, flowers and trees.
          Daniel comes through the side gate. Lifts the back door
          matt, revealing a dusty key.

          INT. BARN

          Sara takes a pen from a workbench. Shows Joe the numbers:

                         07153902935
          She draws lines with the pen, thus:

                         07/15/39[02935]

                         SARA
          This is my son Cid's birthday. And
          this is the hospital he was born
          in.
          Joe's face, taking this in.

          EXT. SUBURBAN HOME BACK YARD

          Old Joe. Sitting in a corner of the yard. Face set hard.
          Daniel stands, key in hand. Drops the matt. Slow motion.
          Turns. Sees Old Joe, standing now.
          Stillness between them. OLD JOE'S FACE. Struggling to be
          stone, and then it is.
          He draws his gun in one fluid motion and FIRES.
          We don't hear the shot. We just hear the garden, the wind
          through the plants.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          68.
          And we just see Old Joe's face. Struggling now to remain
          stone.
          Numb he puts his gun away and exits.

          EXT. PARK

          Old Joe walks across the park. Map in his hand. Children
          play in the distance. Children's voices all around.
          Old Joe spins, his breath up into his head.
          The map falls to the ground. The park around him, green and
          full of children.
          He keels over onto his knees and cries. Grabs the grass,
          holds it in his fingers, thick and green.

          INT. PARIS APARTMENT - AFTERNOON

          The Wife stands at the edge of a bed. 35 and Full of life.
          Old Joe on the bed. Mid 40s.
          She unsnaps her GREEN DRESS and it falls, leaving her naked
          in the sunlight.

                         LATER
          On the bed. Old Joe and the Wife. Faces close. Drifting
          into sleep. From a neighboring apartment, a BABY CRIES.
          Loud and insistent.
          Old Joe opens his eyes, joking-annoyed at the crying baby.
          âGod you have to be kidding me.â
          Then he sees her face. Her smiling eyes, listening to the
          neighbor's baby cry. Like she's listening to music. She
          touches his hand.

          EXT. PARK

          Old Joe. Staring at the grass. On the map beside him:
          three circled houses around the city. And the torn corner.

          INT. BARN

          Sara holds the torn piece of map in her hands. Their house
          circled.

                         SARA
          Would he do this?

                         JOE
          Think about what doing this would
          fix. What he thinks it would fix.
          Sara caught that, and she did not like it.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          69.

                         JOE (CONT'D)
          He'll kill the other kids on that
          map and then come here last. Put
          off facing me.

                         SARA
          If he comes here, can you stop him?
          She turns the paper over in her hands.

          SARA (CONT'D)
          Given this, if I erred on the side
          of caution and believed all of
          this, I'm asking. If I trusted
          you. Will you stop him before he
          gets to my son?

                         JOE
          I've lost my life. I kill this
          man, I get it back. You can trust
          me.

          EXT. FRONT PORCH - LATER

          They sit on the steps, Joe stripped to the waist. Sara picks
          salt chunks from his chest with tweezers and antiseptic.
          Joe surveys the surrounding land, cleaning his gun.

                         JOE
          We're surrounded by the corn, that
          leaves us blind. He can get within
          fifty yards of the house without a
          hawk spotting him.

                         (BEAT)
          What makes sense is, we burn the
          fields, level them.
          Sara realizes he's seriously asking.

                         SARA
          No you cannot burn down my corn
          fields.

                         JOE
          What kind of equipment's in the
          barn?

                         SARA
          Farm equipment.

                         JOE
          Nothing that shoots.

                         SARA
          No farm equipment that shoots. No.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          70.
          Joe finishes assembling his gun. Sara's eyes flick to it.

          SARA (CONT'D)
          You use what you need, set up
          anywhere. But one thing, I don't
          want you talking to Cid. I watch
          my son, you watch the corn. That's
          the deal.

                         JOE
          Good by me.
          He hisses as she applies antiseptic to a gash in his arm.

                         SARA
          Hold still. Easy for things to get
          infected on a farm, start falling
          off.

                         (SOTTO)
          Pussy.
          Caught off guard, Joe almost smiles. Then grimaces.

                         JOE
          If I'm out here and you're in the
          house we're gonna need some way to
          communicate.

                         SARA
          There's a dinner bell down by the
          barn, ring that if someone's
          coming, I'll hear it.

                         JOE
          Dinner bell. We need walkies, or
          buzzers.

                         SARA
          Dunno what we've got but I'll look.
          She spots Cid at the screen door, watching them.

                         SARA (CONT'D)
          Cid.
          She goes to take him inside.

                         JOE
          Got any ammo for that shotgun?
          That isn't a seasoning?

          INT. FARMHOUSE FOYER - CONTINUOUS

          Sara leads Cid back into the house.

                         SARA
          How's the maths coming?

                         

                         

                         

                         

          71.

                         CID
          I wanna help the man.

                         SARA
          Help him what?

                         CID
          I could help him with my toys.

                         SARA
          Baby. Listen. I need you to stay
          away from that man. Okay? Let him-

                         HEY
          Cid squirms out of her grasp, bats her away with a light but
          angry slap. She grabs his arm harder.

          SARA (CONT'D)
          Let him do his thing, but you stay
          with me.

                         CID
          Is he not good?

                         SARA
          Well we're gonna see what he is.
          But you stick with me. Yeah?

          INT. DRAINAGE TUNNEL - EVENING

          Old Joe's little hide-out. He violently washes his hands in
          a trench of water.
          Slumps back, eyes blood red. Streaks of tears down his face.
          Reddish light fading to blue through the grating high above.
          Runs fingers across his forehead, spreading cooling water.
          His eyes close. His breathing shallows.
          In one hand he holds his pocket watch. He places the other
          on the gat. The map beneath it.
          Daniel's map location CROSSED OUT. Two others remaining.
          And the missing corner, edge torn.
          CLOSE ON Old Joe's face. Slipping to sleep.
          Then from nowhere a CHILD'S HAND enters frame and rests on
          his forehead. Old Joe's eyes gasp open with terror

          EXT. PORCH - NIGHT

          but it's Joe who wakes up with a start. Slumped against the
          steps, gun in hand.
          Cid's hand on his forehead. Cid steps back quickly, puts his
          finger to his lips. Shhh.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          72.

          INT. FARMHOUSE FOYER - NIGHT

          Cid leads Joe inside, beckoning him to follow.

          INT. FARM HOUSE KITCHEN

          Dark. Cid leads Joe to the kitchen table. Laid out on it:
          an arrangement of toys.
          With the deliberateness of a man at work Cid clicks on a
          flashlight and sets it on the table.
          Works on several toys, cracking open cases, pulling out
          wires. Hands moving fast. Joe sits, watching Cid.

                         CID
          Hand me that Phillips.
          Joe hands him the screwdriver. Cid keeps working.

                         CID (CONT'D)
          Tell me if you hear her coming.

                         JOE
          What are we doing here?

                         CID
          Commundication.
          He pushes a button on a small plastic box in his hands, and
          an identical one next to Joe lights up.
          The way Joe looks at Cid changes slightly.

                         CID (CONT'D)
          But I need to make it stronger.

                         JOE
          How do you do that?

                         CID
          Bigger battery.
          Joe idly fingers a toy.

                         JOE
          Smart.

                         CID
          Do you kill people?
          Joe half laughs. Cid keeps working, his face in shadows.

                         AFTER AWHILE:

                         JOE
          Let's say I kill people.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          73.

                         CID
          With your gun?

                         JOE
          Uh huh.
          Cid looks at him in the dark. Not scared at all. Then he
          goes back to fitting the backing on a toy.
          A long beat, Joe thinking.
          Broken by a PIERCING NOISE.
          They both jump - the toy truck Joe has idly played with is
          shrieking, sirens blaring.
          Joe fumbles with it, Cid reaches over and switches it off,
          they both freeze.
          And look up at the ceiling.
          Silence in the house.
          With a look of reproach beyond his years, Cid takes the truck
          from Joe and finishes up his work.

          JOE (CONT'D)
          How long have you and your mom been
          on the farm?

                         CID
          She's not my mom. My mom got
          killed when I was a baby. Someone
          bad, bad men killed her.
          Cid sets the two finished BUZZERS on the table.

                         JOE
          I'm sorry.

                         CID
          Sara doesn't think I remember cause
          I was a baby. But I remember my
          mom. I couldn't stop her getting
          killed. I don't remember it all
          but I remember. I was a baby. I
          couldn't do anything. I couldn't
          stop it. Cause I was a baby.
          Cid is crying. Joe has never been more at a loss.

                         JOE
          I'm sorry
          Takes the buzzers. Stands, fumbling. Retreating.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          74.

          JOE (CONT'D)
          You should talk to your mom about
          this.

                         CID
          She's not my mom. She's a liar.
          With one last look back at Cid in the dark, Joe exits.

          SMASH CUT TO:

          EXT. CITY OUTSKIRTS STREET - NIGHT

          Old Joe. Running hard. Sirens, flashlights behind him.
          Being chased.
          Zig zags through an alleyway, a pursuing car smashing up
          behind him.
          Bursts out onto the street, nearly hit by another car.
          Shouts all around, a few shots. Surrounding. He runs.

          INT. ABE'S OFFICE

          A Gat Man briefing Abe, who hasn't gotten much sleep lately.

                         GAT MAN 1
          -spotted him coming out of a sewer

                         RUN

                         ABE
          Every fucking car, every gat, every
          cop - get âem down there! Flood
          that fucker! Take him down!

          EXT. CITY STREETS - SEEN FROM HIGH IN THE AIR

          Cars, motorcycles, cop prowlers, all roar to life and blaze
          through the city streets in one direction.

          INT/EXT. HALF BUILT HIGHRISE

          Kid Blue, squatting in the 10th story of a half finished
          highrise, looks down on the activity in the streets.
          Spread on the floor are maps with notes. He's been searching
          for Old Joe.
          And now his eyes are alight. He bolts for the stairs.

          EXT. CITY OUTSKIRTS STREETS - NIGHT

          A small park on one block. With a playground. Swings, and a
          merry-go-round. Gat men sweep the park.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          75.
          After they pass, Old Joe's face pops up under the merry-go-
          round. He crouches in a shallow space beneath it.
          He sees: Across from the park, a cheap APARTMENT BUILDING.
          He checks his map - the 2nd circled address. Kid number two.
          He waits.

          EXT. FIELD - EARLY MORNING

          Sara chops the dead tree trunk in the field, greatly
          diminished but still formidable. Joe approaches.

                         JOE
          Can't you pull that out with a
          plow?

                         SARA
          Uh huh.
          She keeps chopping.

                         JOE
          I found a, in the barn I found some
          parts, and I made a, thing.
          Joe pushes one of Cid's BUZZERS into her hands, which we now
          see is a colorful plastic frog toy with a light bulb nose.

                         JOE (CONT'D)
          If you see anything, just push
          that, and,
          Joe pushes the button on his buzzer, and Sara's lights up and
          vibrates. She regards the toy, then stares hard and cold at
          Joe.

                         JOE (CONT'D)
          It's important.

                         SARA
          When?

                         JOE
          Last night. He woke me up. Don't
          tell him I told you though, he...
          Sara rolls her eyes, turns away. Starts chopping again. Joe
          doesn't leave.

                         SARA
          What?

                         JOE
          You said you were his mom.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          76.

                         SARA
          Uh huh.

                         JOE
          He told me you're not.
          This hits Sara hard. She resumes chopping to cover it.

                         SARA
          He said that?

                         JOE
          If he's not your son who is he?

                         SARA

                         (SHARP)
          He's my son.

                         (BEAT)
          I had Cid when I was twenty two.
          But I didn't want to give up my
          life. In the city.
          The word âcityâ has weight for her. Implies volumes.

          SARA (CONT'D)
          So I dropped Cid with my mom, here.
          And my sister. And they saw how I
          was living and they took him. My
          sister raised him here, she loved
          him. He called her mom.

                         JOE
          How'd she get killed?
          When Sara's eyes hit him they're daggers.

                         JOE (CONT'D)
          Cid told me. You have to talk to
          him about it.
          Icy silence from Sara, and an odd stare.

                         SARA
          I told you one thing, I told you to
          stay away from my son.

                         JOE
          He asked about my gun. You think
          this is going to go away if you
          don't talk to him about it but it's
          just gonna grow

                         SARA
          Stay out of it. Stay the fuck away
          from my son.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          77.
          She goes back to chopping. Joe lingers, then leaves. She
          hacks away.

          EXT. FRONT PORCH - EARLY MORNING

          Sara sits with coffee, looking out at the fields. Deep in
          thought.
          She takes a drag from her pretend cigarette.

          EXT. CHEAP APARTMENT BUILDING - EARLY MORNING

          A motel style building. Gat Men in cars pass occasionally
          with spotlights and radios, but the activity has calmed.
          Old Joe slips around a corner. Staying hid. Checks the
          address on the map. 12 Talbott Dr, #205.
          Makes a break for stairs leading to the 2nd level. But just
          at that moment a car pulls into the building's lot.
          Old Joe ducks under the stairs. Holding his breath.
          The car parks. Door slams. Footsteps. A WOMAN. Slumping
          exhausted, up the stairs.
          And through the slatted steps Old Joe sees her face flash by.
          It is Suzie, the girl from Abe's brothel. Old Joe's face,
          pure disbelief. He recognizes her instantly. It can't be.
          He gingerly steps half a foot out. Looking up he can see the
          apartment doors above. Suzie walks down the landing.
          Towards apartment 205.
          Jesus it can't be.
          Then she passes it. Keeps walking. Old Joe's eyes,
          relieved.
          She stops at the next door over, knocks. It opens, vaguely
          indistinct conversation between her and the girl that
          answers.

                         SUZIE
          Sorry, I know I promised five, you
          know how it gets.

                         GIRL NEIGHBOR
          Don't worry sugar. She was no
          problem. Gat men searched through
          here, lookin for god knows...
          Suzie disappears into the apartment. Re-emerges, holding a
          sleeping 6 year old girl. She whispers goodbye to the
          neighbor and walks back to APARTMENT 205. She enters.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          78.
          Old Joe, frozen. Gun in his hand. Face numbly: âYou have to
          be shitting me.â
          He climbs the stairs. On the 2nd story landing. To 205.
          Breath held, back against the wall. Peeks in the window.
          On the couch, Suzie holding her daughter. Head in her lap.
          Stroking her hair. Suzie's back is to us, and with her long
          red hair down, she is eerily reminiscent of Old Joe's wife.
          Old Joe watches them for a long time.

          EXT. FARMHOUSE FRONT PORCH - DAY

          Joe sits, watching the corn. It rustles in the wind. Hand
          on his blunderbuss. Beside it, his frog buzzer.
          The tension is constant. And it's a long, long day.

          INT. FARMHOUSE HALLWAY - LATER

          Sara vacuums while Cid plays with toy trucks.

          INT. FARMHOUSE LAUNDRY ROOM - LATER

          In the basement, bare concrete. Sara empties the dryer.

          INT. CID'S BEDROOM - LATE AFTERNOON

          Sara sits on the floor with Cid, putting numbered tiles on a
          plastic multiplication table.

                         SARA
          Where does 56 go? Good. 21.

                         CID
          How long can you not sleep?

                         SARA
          I don't know, awhile. That's a
          good question. Where's it go.
          Good, there. 32.

                          CID
           We should help Joe watch.

                          SARA
          Joe?

                          CID
          Cause he can't stay awake all the
          time.

                         SARA
          He isn't our business.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          79.

                         CID
          He's keeping us safe

                         SARA
          Baby. Let's do this now. You have
          32 there, I know you know this one.

                         CID
          I want to help him.
          Sara is distracted by a distant bell-like DINGING.

                         SARA
          Cid. 32.
          She goes to the window, looks out, nervous.
          But it's just a loose LAUNDRY LINE down in the yard, whipping
          in the wind against its metal pole. In the distance, Joe
          paces the yard.
          Relieved, Sara returns to Cid. He sets the tile, petulant.

                         SARA (CONT'D)
          No. Eight times three is what?

                         CID
          Thirty two.

                         SARA
          Eight times three is what?

                         CID
          Thirty two.

                         SARA
          I want you to count three eights.

                         CID
          Eight. Sixteen. Thirty two.

                         SARA
          Are you telling me you want alone
          time?

                         CID
          No.

                         SARA
          Okay. Why don't you put that where
          it belongs?
          Deliberately, Cid lifts the tile and sets it straight back
          down on the same spot.

                         SARA (CONT'D)
          Alone time.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          80.
          Then like a knife in a fist fight:

                         CID
          He's protecting us cause you can't
          do it.

                         SARA
          Ok. I told you to stay away from

                         HIM

                         CID
          I never did anything

                         SARA
          Do you think I'm stupid?

                         CID
          So?

                         SARA
          I told you already
          Cid is building into a temper tantrum fast.

                         CID
          So?

                         SARA
          You do what I tell you

                         CID
          You can't tell me what to do you're
          not my mom.
          (a deadly beat)
          You're not my mom! You're a liar
          and you're gonna get killed and you
          won't stop lying!
          Cid lunges at her, Sara slaps him back.
          Not hard, but Cid scoots back, eyes furious.

                         SARA

                         CID BABY

                         CID
          You're a liar! Liar! I hate you
          because you're lying! I hate you!
          Liar! You're lying to me!
          Sara scoots back.

                         SARA

                         CID

                         CID
          You're lying!

                         

                         

                         

                         

          81.
          Cid stands, balls his fists, SCREAMING at her. Sara pushes
          back away from him.
          Maybe a cloud passed over the sun. The room darkens.
          And we see it now, in her eyes: Sara is afraid. She bolts
          out of the room.

          EXT. UPSTAIRS HALLWAY

          Sara walks fast down the hall

          INT. SARA'S BEDROOM

          Not slowing, through her bedroom

          INT. SARA'S CLOSET

          Into her walk-in closet, to a huge steel safe tucked in back.
          She opens the safe with trembling hands. And climbs inside.

          INT. SAFE

          Closes the heavy door. Turns on a small LED light.
          And waits. Cid's screams distant but not lessening.

          EXT. BARN - CONTINUOUS

          Cid's screams from the house, clear as day.
          Joe paces in front of the barn. Turns his head back towards
          the house, not sure what to think.
          The screams stop. Joe turns uneasily back to the swaying
          corn.

          INT. CID'S BEDROOM

          The math game scattered, numbered tiles everywhere. Cid lies
          face down on the bed, cried out.
          Sara enters quietly. Sits on the bed beside him. Strokes
          his hair. He folds into her, and they're holding each other
          tight.

          EXT. CITY STREETS - DAY

          A Gat Man named CANADY strolls out of a donut shop, coffee in
          hand, and gets in his car.

          INT. CANADY'S CAR

          Canady starts the car up, starts driving.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          82.
          Somehow not seeing Kid Blue crouched clear as day in the
          passenger side foot-well.

                         KID BLUE
          Hey Can. Can.
          Canady sees him, jumps and yelps.
          The sedan swerves, scrapes to a stop against a parked car.
          Coffee everywhere.

                         CANADY
          Jesus, fuckin Kid Blue what the

                         FUCK

                         KID BLUE
          Pull into that alley.

                         CANADY
          You get the fuck outta

                         KID BLUE
          You don't wanna be seen with me
          Canady, pull in the alley.
          Canady glares at him, but pulls the car into a narrow alley,
          parks it.

                         CANADY
          The fuck are you still doing in
          town, Abe wants you dead man

                         KID BLUE
          All Abe wants right now is the
          looper. Unless he got him last
          night?

                         CANADY
          Jssshhh. No we didn't get him.
          Spotted and lost him. West End,
          near Whore's Alley.

                         KID BLUE
          Whore's Alley?

                         CANADY
          That area, Mott & Talbott, little
          working girl colony.

                         KID BLUE
          (has a thought)
          Whore's Alley..

                         CANADY
          You shoulda left town man.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          83.

                         KID BLUE
          I'm gonna bring him in, get right
          with Abe.

                         CANADY
          Yeah, maybe you bring him the
          looper, but short of that Abe don't
          get right with priced men.

                         KID BLUE
          I got a price?

                         CANADY
          Big one.
          Canady locks the car doors.
          And in that one moment, Kid Blue pulls Canady's gun from his
          holster. Holds it on him. A tense moment.

                         CANADY (CONT'D)
          Course I'd never turn a friend for

                         A PRICE

          EXT. ALLEYWAY

          BANG and the drivers side window explodes outward bloody.
          A moment, then Kid Blue stumbles out, holding his ears in
          pain. Off down the alley and out of sight.

          INT. CID'S BEDROOM

          Sara lies with Cid, both asleep.
          Distant but sharp, a bell ringing. It's unmistakable this
          time. The DINNER BELL. Sara's eyelids flutter. She hears.
          Stiffens.
          The bell stops suddenly. She stands, careful not to wake
          Cid.

          INT. FARMHOUSE FOYER - CONTINUOUS

          Sara rushes quietly down the stairs.
          Through a doorway, she sees the Frog Buzzer sitting on the
          living room coffee table. Lit up and buzzing.
          She goes to the front door, throws it open. And is face to
          face with a tall Gat Man named JESSE. She freezes.

                         JESSE
          Evenin ma'am.

                         SARA
          Evenin. How can I help you?

                         

                         

                         

                         

          84.
          Joe is nowhere in sight.

                         JESSE
          You can start by accepting my
          apologies re the hour, I hope I
          didn't catch you in supper.

                         SARA
          No, that's fine.

                         JESSE
          Yours was the last house on my list
          today, been walking between empty
          farms all day in the hot sun.
          Thought I'd tick this off my list,
          not have to come back tomorrow.

                         SARA
          What's this about?
          Back in the house somewhere, a screen door bangs.

                         JESSE
          You alone here, ma'am?

                         SARA
          My husband should be back from the
          city, any time now.

                         JESSE
          Happy to hear. Could I trouble you
          for some water?

                         SARA
          Course. I'll get some, you can
          take the glass with you.

                         JESSE
          Actually ma'am, my business
          tonight, this ticking off the list
          business, it's gonna require me
          coming in. If that's alright.
          Jesse shifts his weight, and Sara notices his heavy boot is
          now a few inches over the door jam.

                         SARA
          Will you tell me what this is
          about?

                         JESSE
          I will, yes. Can I come in?
          Hanging above the door, just over Sara's head: the shotgun.
          Possibilities whirling through her mind.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          85.

                         JESSE (CONT'D)
          Ma'am?
          Silent decision, and she steps aside to let him enter.

          INT. FARMHOUSE KITCHEN - CONTINUOUS

          Joe slips in through the screen door, gun in hand. Freezes
          in the kitchen, listening.

          JESSE (O.S.)
          I'm a deputized police officer,
          we're looking for an escaped
          criminal, just doing a sweep. Seen
          anyone through here the past two
          days, vagrants?

          SARA (O.S.)
          No, vagrants are always passing but
          nobody near the house.
          Footsteps, as they walk deeper in the house. Joe can't tell
          if they're coming through the living room or hall. He
          hesitates.

          JESSE (O.S.)
          This man, here.

          SARA (O.S.)
          He's young. No.
          Then at the last moment Joe slips out the hallway door, as
          they enter from the living room.
          Sara leads Jesse in, holding a photograph of Joe. She pours
          him some water. Jesse hands her a second photograph.

                         JESSE
          We're looking for his father too,
          similar look and build but late
          50s. May or may not be travelling
          together.
          This one is a print-out from a security camera in the Bodega,
          of Old Joe holding a gun on the checkout clerk.
          Sara's eyes linger on Old Joe's photo, side by side with
          Joe's. Mind spinning. Maybe making the connection, we're
          not sure.

                         SARA
          No.
          She tries to hand the photos back but Jesse doesn't take
          them. He notices the toys on the table.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          86.

                         JESSE
          Keep em. Kids with your husband?

                         SARA
          Yeah. Just one.

                         JESSE
          How old?

                         SARA
          Eight.
          Jesse pokes his head into the hallway, just missing Joe
          slipping through the hall and into the living room.
          He lifts his glass, drinks.

                         JESSE
          Thank you.

                         SARA
          I'll show you round the grounds,
          then the house, then you can be on
          your way.
          Sara holds the screen door open for him.

                         JESSE
          We'll start with the house.
          Jesse strolls into the living room, and we follow him.

          He sits on a couch, taps on a small folding phone. Sara
          follows him.

                         JESSE
          Eight, you said? Boy? And your
          husband. Just gotta, check in.
          With the home office. This goddamn
          thing.

                         SARA
          This man dangerous?

                         JESSE
          Tween you me and a lamppost? No.
          Sweet kid. But he's wanted. My
          boss has half the city's looking
          for him. Half the city and me.
          So. And if you find him, there's a
          helluva price. Think on that if he
          comes by, acting sweet.
          Behind the couch, Joe crouches unseen. He looks up and sees
          Cid in the foyer, standing halfway down the stairs.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          87.
          If Jesse turned his head he would see Cid clear as day.
          Joe motions for Cid to get out. Cid points to Jesse, makes a
          GUN with his hand. Asking Joe.
          Joe shakes his head, sharply motions: get out! Cid silently
          creeps down the stairs.
          He is in full sight of the living room, but Jesse doesn't
          look up from his phone.
          Cid vanishes down the hall. Jesse looks up, stands.

                         JESSE (CONT'D)
          Alright, show me upstairs.
          The screen door in the kitchen creaks and bangs. Jesse looks
          sharply at Sara.

                         SARA
          Drafts, in the house.
          Jesse is already moving fast to the kitchen. The instant
          Jesse exits, Cid appears again in the hallway.
          Opens a small door under the stairway and beckons Joe.

          JESSE (O.S.)
          This door doesn't latch?

          SARA (O.S.)
          It used to, it's busted.
          Joe hesitates, then silently dashes over and in.

          INT. FARMHOUSE FOYER

          Cid follows him in, down steep concrete stairs. Pulls the
          door closed behind them. It CREAKS. Jesse steps out into
          the hallway, gun drawn. Sara behind him.

                         JESSE
          Drafty house.

                         SARA
          Farm house.
          Jesse walks to the thin wooden door. Opens it. Closes it.
          CREAK. He looks at Sara.

                         JESSE
          What's down there?

                         SARA
          Laundry room. Door must've blown
          open.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          88.
          Jesse opens the door, then looks at Sara gravely.

                         JESSE
          Two things. First, I have a family
          of my own back in the city, and I
          want to see them again. Second if
          anything happens to me, and I don't
          report back to my boss people in
          fifteen minutes, they're gonna know
          I disappeared searching this house,
          and inside of another fifteen
          you'll have an army of more me's
          kicking down your door. Ok?

                         SARA
          It's a laundry room.
          Jesse motions - her first.

          INT. FARMHOUSE LAUNDRY ROOM

          Bare concrete basement, starkly lit by a hanging bulb. The
          only things in the basement are a small washer and dryer, and
          a large canvas hamper the size of a fridge.
          No windows. Nowhere else to go. Jesse levels his gun at the
          hamper.

                         JESSE
          You want to call out whoever's
          hiding in that hamper?

                         SARA
          If someone was hiding in the house,
          that's what I'd do. But nobody is
          in the house. Open it up.

                         JESSE
          No I think I'm gonna put a shot
          through it just to be safe.
          He raises his gat. Sara stiffens slightly.

                         JESSE (CONT'D)
          You wanna call him out?
          Sara stays silent. A long beat.
          Then Sara strides over, pulls the hamper open. Empty.
          She throws open the washer and dryer. She takes the bucket
          and shakes it upsidown, dumping out the water, shows him it's
          empty.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          89.

                         SARA
          Now if you promise not to wag your
          gun at my shoe rack I'll show you
          upstairs then show you the fuck
          out.
          She storms up the stairs. A little cowed, Jesse holsters his
          gun and follows her.
          The water from the bucket flows in a small stream across the
          room, and into a drain hole under the hamper.

          INT. TUNNEL

          Dark and earthy. Cid leads Joe with his flashlight.

          EXT. BARN - LATE AFTERNOON

          Just outside the barn, a trap door covered with earth opens
          two inches. Joe and Cid prop it open, and peer out at the
          house.

          INT. CRAWL SPACE - CONTINUOUS

          A deep large hole capped with a wooden trap door. Joe
          squats, Cid stands.

                         CID
          My granddad built it, but he didn't
          tell anyone of us why. Nanna said
          cuz he was nuts.

                         JOE
          Thank you granddad.

                         CID
          That wasn't the man.

                         JOE
          No. I know him, that's what's
          funny. His name's Jesse. I like
          him. He'll go away when he doesn't
          find me, he won't hurt her.
          They watch in silence for awhile. In the distance, Jesse
          leaves the house alone and scopes the grounds before walking
          back towards the highway.

                         JOE (CONT'D)
          My mom gave me up. I was younger
          than you. We were vagrants, and
          she was alone, for a long time I
          thought she was stupid for getting
          on the drug she was on, it was bad
          stuff, it probably ended up killing
          her.

                         (MORE)

                         

                         

                         

                         

          90.

                         JOE (CONT'D)
          But now I see, she was so alone.
          And it was what she had. She sold
          me. To a panhandle gang.
          QUICKLY, SILENTLY WE SEE - FOUR YEAR OLD JOE dragged into
          darkness by rough men, screaming. Then we're back to the
          scene.

                         JOE (CONT'D)
          But I got away. And I ran and I
          ended on a train, sitting in the
          dark in an empty freight, going to
          the city, and I saw myself over and
          over killing those men who bought
          me and who got my mom on what she
          was on. Finding them and tearing
          them apart. Saving my mom.

                         CID
          But you didn't.

                         JOE
          A man in the city found me, put a
          gun in my hand, and gave me some
          things. I didn't have my mom
          anymore. I had my work, my money.
          My plans. For my life. That's
          what I'd kill for. Not something I
          don't have, and can't ever get
          back.

                         (BEAT)
          There's just men figuring out what
          they'd do to keep what's theirs,
          what they got. That's the only
          kind of man there is.

                         CID
          I'm not gonna let Sara get killed.
          Joe looks at him. Wants to put his hand on his shoulder but
          doesn't.

                         JOE
          I think we're clear.
          He opens the trap door, climbs out.

          EXT. BARN

          Joe reaches down to help Cid out. Looking down at Cid in a
          hole with a trap door. Like Seth.
          He grabs Cid's hand and lifts him out.
          Sara comes out, sees Cid and her face breaks with relief.
          Cid runs to her, and in the distance they embrace.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          91.
          Sara and Joe share a look. Joe quickly turns his eyes back
          to the corn fields.

          INT. SECURITY MONITOR ROOM - EVENING

          A tiny, dark concrete room. Kid Blue watches a screen, his
          hand on a toggle wheel. A security cam view of Suzie's
          apartment building upper landing. Playback of last night.
          It scans quickly forward.
          The APARTMENT SUPER leans against the wall behind him,
          counting money.

                         KID BLUE
          All working girls, yeah?

                         SUPER
          Uh huh. This whole block. You
          wanna check those too, I can
          arrange.

                         KID BLUE
          I do.
          On the screen, Suzie comes home. Picks up her daughter from
          next door. Goes into 205. Kid Blue keeps scanning. And an
          instant later, Old Joe climbs the stairs. Kid Blue slows the
          playback.

          KID BLUE (CONT'D)
          âLo Joe.
          Old Joe goes up to the window, his back to the wall. Watches
          Suzie through the window for a long while. Kid watches him
          intently.
          Then very suddenly, without going inside, Old Joe leaves.
          Down the stairs, shoving his gun in his jacket.

                         SUPER
          I'm an arranger, stranger. Huhuha.
          But you don't see what you wanna
          see, no refunds.
          Old Joe vanishes down the street in a swarm of pixels.

          EXT. CHEAP APARTMENT BUILDING - EVENING

          Kid Blue emerges from a passage, into the parking lot. Looks
          up at Suzie's apartment door. Then down the street. A few
          drops of rain fall.

          EXT. FRENCH CAR - DAY (FLASHBACK)

          Driving on a highway along the beach. A few drops of rain on
          the windshield. Old Joe (late 40s) and his Wife in intense
          conversation, her hand on his.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          92.

          OLD JOE (IN FRENCH)
          But I will.

          WIFE (IN FRENCH)
          You want to, I know that. But you
          won't.

          OLD JOE (IN FRENCH)
          I'd do anything for you.

          WIFE (IN FRENCH)
          You'd do. You'd kill for me, you'd
          take life for me. But I don't want
          that. You kill for what you love,
          but someone loves the person you
          kill, and it starts again. I don't
          want that. I can't love a killer.
          What would you give up for me?
          That's yours?

          OLD JOE (IN FRENCH)
          Anything.
          She smiles but does not believe him. Old Joe sees this. A
          moment, in thought.

          EXT. BEACH / HIGHWAY - CONTINUOUS

          The car screeches to a stop, and Old Joe runs to the sea.
          THROWS his gun in the ocean. Above the waters, the sun
          breaks the clouds. Rain falls.
          He runs back to her. Falls on her. Kissing her. He holds
          her face like the most precious thing in the world.

                         OLD JOE
          Anything.

          INT. CHURCH - EVENING

          Rain beats against stained glass. Old Joe kneeling in a pew.
          Fists clenched as if in prayer. He stands, stumbles out.

          EXT. LA BELLE AURORE SIDE ENTRANCE - EVENING

          Oddly quiet. Old Joe walks down the sidewalk towards the
          side entrance to the theater. Face uncovered. In plain
          sight. Not caring. Stops 30 feet shy of the entrance, at a
          street garbage can.
          He draws his gun and leans over to drop it into the can. He
          lets it dangle from his fingers above the trash can.
          His pocket watch, hanging open from its chain. The picture
          of his Wife inside. Spinning. His gun slowly slipping from
          his grasp.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          93.
          With each spin of the watch, the photo of his Wife appears
          cloudier. Blurred. Indistinct.
          Gun on the tips of his fingers, about to fall. Then the
          photo is nearly gone.

          OLD JOE'S EYES.

          INT. PARIS CLUB - NIGHT (FLASHBACK)

          Old Joe staggering to his feet from a fight.
          We've seen this before, it's the IDENTICAL SCENE to the
          previous flashback.
          But when he sees his Wife for the first time, whisps of FOG
          grow, blotting out the scene. Deep in the fog are other
          backgrounds - a street, a house - and unfamiliar faces.
          Other eventualities, clouding this one as it becomes less
          likely Old Joe will meet his wife and have this memory.
          Erasing it.

          OLD JOE'S EYES.

          INT. PARIS APARTMENT - DAY (FLASHBACK)

          Old Joe in bed with his wife. Baby crying outside. Her
          face. Then, whisps of FOG thickens, obscuring them.

          OLD JOE'S EYES.

          EXT. FRENCH BEACH - DAY (FLASHBACK)

          The thrown gun splashes in the sea, and Old Joe turns back to
          the beach. But where his Wife was in the previous memory,
          now there is the FOG.
          A wall of it, massive, reaching to the sky. Old Joe dwarfed
          against it. Caught between the roiling waves and this wall of
          nothingness falling towards him.

          OLD JOE'S EYES.
          The gun on his fingertips. About to fall. A moment of
          decision.

          INT. SARA'S BEDROOM - NIGHT

          Sara lies in bed. Eyes wide open. Still and quiet in the
          dark. Her hand moves over her bare leg. Slides across the
          sheets. Finds the Frog Buzzer lying next to her.
          A moment of hesitation. Then she pushes it.
          Silence. Her eyes go to the window. A long beat. Then
          sound: a door opening in the house below.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          94.
          Quick footsteps approaching. Her eyes follow them. The door
          flies open. Joe, gun in hand, buzzer in the other. His eyes
          adjust to the dark.

                         JOE
          What?
          Closes the door, kisses him. The adrenaline in his head
          doesn't know where to go.

                         SARA
          Don't wake Cid.
          She pulls him to the bed, lifting his shirt off. The rain
          starts to fall against the windows.

                         LATER
          Lying beside each other. Joe still stunned.
          Sara smokes a real cigarette, taking a deep joyful drag. She
          sets the lighter on her palm. It floats about a foot in the
          air, spinning, then drops.

                         JOE
          That's pretty good.

                         SARA
          In the city, young guys would hit
          on me by floating fucking quarters,
          I wouldn't tell âem I was TK but
          I'd keep their quarters down. One
          guy busted a blood vessel in his
          eye trying to get it up.

                         (BEAT)
          He's you. Your loop. You lied to
          me.
          She doesn't seem angry but deeply curious. Joe sits up.

          SARA (CONT'D)
          But you protected Cid. And I know
          you're not lying that you're gonna
          kill this guy, your own self. Even
          though he's protecting your future.

                         JOE
          He's protecting his future. Not
          mine.
          A beat.

                         SARA
          When I came back, after my sister
          died. Cid was sitting on the
          porch, I remember seeing him for
          the first time, in two years.

                         (MORE)

                         

                         

                         

                         

          95.

                         SARA (CONT'D)
          Saw him on the porch. I drove up
          crying and I had been at a party in
          the city when I got the call, I was
          wearing this ridiculous party
          dress. All my ridiculous shit. I
          don't know if he remembered me, but
          he looked at me. I abandoned him.
          I abandoned my baby.

                         (BEAT)
          Maybe I can't be a mother to him,
          is that something I can't get back.
          When he looked at me then, on the
          porch, he was mine again, he was my
          son. I seen so many men in the
          city, who I look in their eyes and
          they're lost. Whether he loves me
          back or not I'm gonna love my son I
          said. And he's never gonna get
          lost.
          Joe sitting up still, Sara lying beside him, maybe crying.
          He touches her hair.

          INT. APARTMENT 205 - EARLY MORNING

          A DOOR FRAME - kicked open with all the violence in the
          world. Old Joe sweeps into the small apartment, gun drawn.
          Suzie cooking in a robe, opens her mouth to scream.

                         OLD JOE
          Don't. Don't wake up your
          daughter.
          Old Joe trains the gun on her. She goes silent.

          OLD JOE (CONT'D)
          Sit down.
          At the kitchen table. Quivering, she does. He keeps the gun
          on her.

          OLD JOE (CONT'D)
          Do you know me?

                         SUZIE
          No. I don't know you. Who are
          you?

                         OLD JOE
          I need to tell you why I'm doing
          this. I gotta say it out loud to
          someone so I know.

                         SUZIE
          Why you're doing what?

                         

                         

                         

                         

          96.

          INT. SARA'S BEDROOM - EARLY MORNING

          Joe sleeping alone in the bed. Sara's voice, distant.

          SARA (O.S.)
          Joe. Joe.
          He wakes. She is calling him from downstairs.

          INT. FARMHOUSE FOYER

          Joe comes down the stairs half dressed.
          Jesse holds Sara at gunpoint in the living room. Staring at
          Joe with a cool lack of malice.

                         JESSE
          Lo' Joe.

                         JOE
          Jesse.

          INT. APARTMENT 205


                         OLD JOE
          I threw my gun away once. To get
          her love. And I was going to do it
          again, now. Because I know she'd
          want me to. I was going to do it.
          And I saw then, I saw her
          vanishing, like how life probably
          goes when you die. That's what she
          was asking me to give up this time.

                         SUZIE
          ...who are you?

                         OLD JOE
          And if I picked up the gun. If I
          made this sacrifice. Life, my
          life. Absolution. Given back to
          me. My love. Given back, just
          like we were, and she wouldn't know
          what I did to get it back.

          INT. FARMHOUSE LIVING ROOM

          Joe steps into the living room, stands facing them.

                         JOE
          I'm unarmed Jesse, you can let her
          go. Sara, Jesse here's the best
          shot with a gat I've ever seen,
          when he lets you go you sit on the
          couch and don't do anything stupid.
          Jesse lets Sara go and trains the gat on Joe.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          97.

                         JOE (CONT'D)
          He's coming here Jess. My Looper,
          is gonna come here.

                         JESSE
          I gotta take you in man.

                         JOE
          I got eighty large in pure gold, I
          take my looper back in and get
          right with Abe, whatever he gives
          me back I'll split it with you.

                         JESSE
          Was that your plan?

                         JOE
          Ok. It's yours, all of it

                         JESSE
          Are you delusional?

          INT. APARTMENT 205


                         OLD JOE
          Everything set right. Everything
          fixed. Through this sacrifice.

                         SUZIE
          What are you gonna do?
          Old Joe stands, walks towards the back hall. Suzie screams

                         SUZIE (CONT'D)
          No!
          And runs at him but he shoves her back hard.

          INT. FARMHOUSE LIVING ROOM


                         JESSE
          I know you got no options you take
          the one you got but Joe, you aint
          gettin right with no one. Looper
          or no, you're beyond saving. As
          long as Abe's got one Gat Man
          standing, he'll be hunting you till
          his dying day.
          Joe's face falling.

          INT. APARTMENT 205

          Old Joe, gun ready, down the darkened hallway towards the
          door at the end with a rainbow on it. He puts his hand on
          the knob.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          98.

          INT. FARMHOUSE LIVING ROOM


                         JESSE
          We're going now. We're gonna go to
          my truck, you're gonna
          CREAK. Cid on the stairs, sleepy eyed. Jesse, purely on
          instinct, spins and draws on Cid.
          Cid's POV - Jesse's gun, snapping like a snake, barrel
          leveled at him. Cid makes a strange shouting noise, falls
          back.
          Everything slows down.

          INT. APARTMENT 205

          Old Joe pushes the door open. Blackness within.

          INT. FARMHOUSE FOYER / LIVING ROOM

          The room darkens. As if the sun passed behind a cloud.
          Jesse realizes it's a kid. Lowers his gun. But Cid is mid-
          scream, falling back, his foot misses the step and he tumbles
          down the stairs.
          Confused, terrified, falling. Joe runs into the foyer, to
          catch Cid. Sara runs behind him.
          The room is very dark now. Knick-knacks around the room
          rattle, then LIFT INTO THE AIR. All of them. Floating.
          Spinning. Sara's LIGHTER, on the coffee table: it RISES
          into the air.

          INT. APARTMENT 205

          Old Joe readies his gun, staring into the blackness. But his
          eyes lower. He touches his temple. Remembering.

          INT. FARMHOUSE FOYER / LIVING ROOM (OLD JOE'S MEMORIES)

          Fog clears - Joe is almost to Cid, who is still tumbling,
          nearly at the bottom of the stairs.

          INT. FARMHOUSE FOYER / LIVING ROOM (NORMAL)

          But just before he reaches him, Sara shoves Joe from behind.
          Shoving him TOWARDS THE FRONT DOOR. He's confused but her
          face is set.
          Cid hits the hardwood floor of the foyer, face contorted with
          rage now, hand raised to Jesse, palm outstretched.
          Screaming. His scream louder than it should be.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          99.
          Bigger things in the living room RISE OFF THE GROUND.
          Chairs. The couch. And Jesse. He rises five feet in the
          air, terrified.
          Sara pulls Joe through the front door, and he looks back and
          sees Jesse suspended in the air and Cid on the ground
          screaming like an animal, and just as they cross the
          threshold, Jesse explodes in a bright red fan of blood.

          INT. APARTMENT 205

          Old Joe's face. Remembering.

          INT. FARMHOUSE FOYER (OLD JOE MEMORY)

          Frozen in a tableau - Cid screaming, raw power. Jesse
          EXPLODING. A bright red fan.

          EXT. FRONT PORCH

          Joe and Sara fall out and down the stairs.
          The front door and windows EXPLODE in a burst of splinters
          and glass.

          INT. APARTMENT 205

          Old Joe's eyes lift. Realizing.

                         OLD JOE
          The Rainmaker.
          A bare bulb hanging from the ceiling turns on.
          A six year old girl's room. But the only person in it is Kid
          Blue. He shoots Old Joe with a blue tazer.
          Old Joe hits the ground, mouth foaming, paralyzed. Knowing
          the answer now, knowing the who and the how but helpless and
          defeated.
          Kid Blue kicks him in the face.

          INT. ABE'S OFFICE

          A Gat Man circles a spot on the map in red ink, Sara's farm.

                         GAT MAN 1
          He's there. Lost his signal five
          minutes ago, right after he sent
          word he had him. Joe.
          Abe slumps in a chair, taking oxygen from a tank.

                         ABE
          Call everyone, every Gat Man in the
          city, call âem here. Gather em all
          up here first. No mistakes this
          time. We're gonna take an army to
          that farm, all at once, and sweep
          it like hellfire. Now.

          EXT. CITY STREETS - MORNING

          From a high vantage point. Cars, bikes, Gat Men on foot, all
          heading towards the club. An army, all meeting at the Belle
          Aurore. Massing to attack.

          EXT. FARMHOUSE FRONT LAWN - MORNING

          Moments after the blast. Joe and Sara lie in the dirt.
          Jesse's TRUCK parked nearby.
          Joe stirs first. Stands shakily. The front door jam is
          splintered. Windows broken. He goes inside. Sara gets up,
          staggers in after him.

                         SARA
          Cid! Cid!

          JOE (O.S.)
          Cid!

          EXT. BACK OF FARMHOUSE

          Joe bursts out of the screen door, holding his Blunderbuss
          and wiping off Jesse's gat.
          Bloody Cid-sized footprints lead out the screen door and
          streak across the lawn, into the corn.
          Sara comes out after Joe, sees him heading for the corn.

                         SARA
          What are you doing with those guns?
          What are you going to do?
          She lunges for him, wild. Wrenches his arm and he spins,
          throwing her to the ground.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          101.

                         JOE
          How did your sister die?
          Sara holds his gaze. Then everything breaks inside her and
          she collapses in sobs. Heaving.

                         JOE (CONT'D)
          That happened to her. Cid.

                         (BEAT)
          Jesus. Jesus he killed her
          This breaks Sara out of her sobs

                         SARA
          No! No he was climbing a
          bookshelf, it fell back on him. He
          has no control, he gets scared, it
          explodes.

                         JOE
          What is it a TK mutation?

                         SARA
          Joe someday he'll learn to control
          it.

                         JOE
          Yeah I know he will. Imagine what
          he could do.

                         SARA
          If he did good with it! If he grew
          up good!

                         JOE
          He doesn't.
          Joe heads to the corn, Sara scampers after him but slips on
          the wet grass, and Joe hits the corn with a head start.

                         SARA
          You stay away from him! Cid! Cid!
          She runs into the corn.

          EXT. CORN FIELD - WITH SARA

          WITH SARA as she stumbles blindly through the tall stalks.

                         SARA
          Cid! Make a noise baby, call to
          me! Cid!
          WITH JOE through the corn, following traces of blood on the
          stalks.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          102.

          SARA (O.S.) (CONT'D)
          You stay away from Joe, you come to
          me! Cid!
          Tries cocking the GAT but it's broken. Tosses it, wields the
          Blunderbuss.

          INT. SMALL CROP CLEARING

          Joe emerges from the corn.
          Cid crouches at one end of the small clearing. He looks at
          Joe. Terrified. Half covered in blood. Hair matted over
          one eye.
          Joe looks back at him. Approaches him, gun not raised, but
          in hand. Cid, like a frightened animal. A long moment.
          And just like that, Joe puts his hand on Cid's head. Cid
          leans against his legs, crying.
          Sara bursts into the clearing, sees this. Runs to Cid and
          embraces him, wiping the blood from his face. Joe steps back.

                         JOE
          Right now two things have happened.
          My looper knows Cid's the kid he's
          looking for, and my gang knows I'm
          here. So in fifteen minutes one or
          both is coming down that highway.
          You pack up the Gat Man's truck,
          whatever you can fit in ten
          minutes, and you drive North away
          from the city.

                         SARA
          Where are you going?
          Joe takes the Frog Buzzer from his pocket, presses it.
          Sara's buzzes in her pocket.

                         JOE
          One buzz means come and get me.
          Two or nothing, don't.
          He vanishes into the stalks, towards the highway.

          INT. ABE'S OFFICE

          Crowded with Gat Men, all preparing.

                         GAT MAN 1
          We got everyone here. All our men.

                         ABE
          Arm âem up, let's go.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          103.
          BUZZZZ. Abe turns, annoyed, and sees the security monitor.
          On the screen - Kid Blue rips the sack off and holds Old
          Joe's bloodied face up to the camera.

          KID BLUE (ON SPEAKER)
          I got him Abe. I got him.

                         ABE
          Well. Shhhhhit.

          INT. COAT CHECK

          The door buzzes open. Kid pushes Old Joe through the long
          entrance hallway, past a dozen Gat Men, who watch him with
          shocked amazement.
          Old Joe's hands bound back. Kid Blue glows. He comes to the
          tiny coat check room, and Big Craig stops him, then sees Old
          Joe.

                         BIG CRAIG
          Hoh. So both we got?

                         KID BLUE
          Just the Looper. I got him. Knew
          he went for whores, so I checked
          every building.

                         BIG CRAIG
          They found Joe too though, in a
          farm on the east side. That's why
          all the Gats are here, the whole
          crew's arming up to make a sweep.

                         KID BLUE
          Joe fuck Joe, save your bullets I
          got the Looper. Not such a fuck up
          huh? I'm taking him up to
          This happens very fast:
          Old Joe uses his legs to kick himself off the wall and back
          into Kid Blue, SLAMMING him against the opposite wall.
          Old Joe grabs (behind his back) Kid Blue's gun, and blasts
          one shot through the chains binding his wrists and into the
          Kid's midsection.
          He whips the gun from behind his back and shoots Big Craig in
          the face. Then blasts the Gat Men in the entrance hallway
          while he reaches into the coat check and pulls an automatic
          rifle.
          He blasts like hell into the hallway. A few shots return but
          mostly the men are trapped. Then it's over. All is smoky
          still for a moment.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          104.
          Old Joe stares at the exit door ajar, down the long hallway
          jammed with bodies. Then at the passage that leads deeper
          into the club.
          A Gat Man runs in, and Old Joe shoots him down.
          He steps into the coat check and loads his pockets with guns
          and grenades. Then launches himself into passageway towards
          the club.

          INT. BACKSTAGE

          Old Joe weaves his way through the backstage area, chucking
          grenades in front of him, then unloading his automatic rifle
          into the smoky aftermath.
          And with a mixture of dumb luck and skill from years of being
          gangland muscle takes out Gat Man after Gat Man.
          The corridors are tight, twisty. Old Joe uses that.
          Throwing grenades. Blasting away. Purging. Killing
          everyone he lays eyes on. Wiping them out. All the bad guys.
          It's horrible. Men maimed, bleeding and crying, dying the way
          people actually die from gunshots. Old Joe forges on, deeper.

          INT. ABE'S OFFICE

          Empty. Old Joe kicks the door open. Takes it in, the
          office. Hammer on the desk. He reloads a gun. Eyes find
          the door to Abe's inner den.

          INT. ABE'S DEN

          Abe and two Gat Men, guns out, crouched behind the table.
          Watching the door. A display screen shows Old Joe on the
          other side.
          Abe, eyes dull. Shouts at the door

                         ABE
          Joe. Guess I put the gun in that
          kid's hand, huh Joe. Guess
          everything comes back around. Like
          your goddamn ties.

          INT. ABE'S OFFICE

          Old Joe. Breathing hard. Reloaded. Closes the gun.

          EXT. HIGHWAY

          Joe breaks out of the corn, panting. He steps out into the
          middle of the highway.
          Storm clouds on the horizon. He cleans and readies his
          Blunderbuss.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          105.

          INT. COAT CHECK - LATER

          Kid Blue's eyes flutter open. He lifts himself painfully.
          Checks his chest. Most of the shot caught his shoulder, his
          chest is grazed.
          The Gat Men in the hall. Big Craig. All dead.

          INT. BACKSTAGE

          Kid Blue wanders the smoky halls. Dead and dying men.

          INT. ABE'S DEN

          Abe, shot once in the head, twice in the chest. Kid Blue
          stands over them. Stunned. Tears well in his eyes.
          Then on the wall, he sees the map. The farm circled in red.

          EXT. FARMHOUSE FRONT LAWN - MORNING

          Clothes and boxes piled in the back of Jesse's truck. Sara
          loads one last bundle. Calls to Cid, in the front seat.

                         SARA
          Ok baby, we're going.

          EXT. HIGHWAY

          Joe waits. Then, a CLOUD OF DUST on the distant highway. He
          tenses. The cloud gets closer. It is a truck. An armored
          truck.
          Joe squints. It's the ARMORED TRUCK that Kid Blue loaded his
          gold bricks into. The front windshield blown in.
          The truck stops fifty feet away, and Old Joe steps out. He
          throws a gold bar, which lands in the dusty highway between
          them.

                         OLD JOE
          Bon jour. You take this truck, you
          take your money, and you go live
          your life. No one's coming after
          you. I fixed it.

                         JOE
          And you go kill the boy. That's
          how you fix it.

                         OLD JOE
          That's how. You got your life
          back, you better think right now
          about what that's worth to you.

                         JOE
          My life? Your life. Becoming you.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          106.
          Joe raises his Blunderbuss and FIRES. Too far away, the shot
          scatters. The old man flinches, backs away.
          Joe walks forward towards Old Joe, stepping over the gold.

                         OLD JOE
          Stupid little shit! You let him
          live, he's gonna take away
          everything that's yours, everything
          that's mine! You seen what the
          boy's gonna become.

                         JOE
          I haven't seen that yet.
          Joe fires again, close enough now to draw blood off Old Joe's
          chest and knock him back.
          Out of nowhere a SLAT BIKE careens around the van, which has
          until now blocked our line of sight down the highway.
          Kid Blue.
          The bike clips Joe's leg, sending him spinning violently to
          the dusty pavement.
          The bike shoots off down the highway, a cloud of dust in its
          wake. It takes a hundred yards for the Kid to pull it to a
          stop and spin it around.
          Joe is hurt bad. He grapples for his blunderbuss.
          Kid Blue guns the engine, gat in hand. Levels it, steady as
          a rock.
          Joe shoots at the Kid, but he's out of range, the gun fires
          scattershot.
          Kid Blue fires, a bullet hits dangerously close to Joe.
          Panicked, Joe begins firing at the pavement around him, round
          after fiery round.
          Kicking up dust. Lots of dust. Raising a cloud.
          KID BLUE'S POV - zooming towards Joe, now obscured in a cloud
          of dust and smoke. He fires his gat into the cloud, tries to
          slow the bike but can't in time.
          In the dust cloud Joe hears the bike roaring down upon him.
          He covers up and when he feels the bike roaring past blindly
          FIRES his buss.
          A moment later the bike emerges from the dust cloud. Without
          a driver. It skids, crashes.
          When the dust clears away Joe lies still, arms over his head.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          107.
          Besides him, the broken remains of Kid Blue.
          Painfully, Joe raises himself. Then realizes:
          Old Joe is gone.

          EXT. FARMHOUSE FRONT LAWN

          Sara starts the truck up.

                         SARA
          Here we go. Give it a wave
          goodbye.

          EXT. DIRT ROAD

          They roll down the dirt road that leads to the highway.
          At the far end of it, at a distance but walking towards them,
          is the dark figure of Old Joe. Gun in hand.
          Sara hesitates a minute, then guns it. Straight for him.

                         CID

                         STOP

                         SARA
          Duck down baby

                         CID
          Stop please he can shoot us

                         SARA
          Just stay down
          Half the distance closed, but he's still far off. A shot
          cracks the front grill, another cracks the windshield.

                         CID
          Stop!
          The truck lurches horribly, and flips straight back in a
          graceful arc, landing upsidown.
          Sara and Cid, dazed, hanging by their seatbelts.

                         SARA
          Are you ok?

                         CID
          I'm sorry
          In the rear view mirror, Sara sees Old Joe getting closer.

                         SARA
          You're ok. C'mon baby we have to
          run now.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          108.
          She unfastens them and they both climb out, and Old Joe stops
          suddenly, taking aim.
          Sara pulls Cid behind the flatbed for cover as two bullets
          glance off the overturned truck.

                         SARA (CONT'D)
          We're going into the fields. I
          want you to run, I'll be right
          behind you, don't look back. Okay?
          Old Joe lowers his gun and runs towards them.

                         SARA (CONT'D)
          Go!
          They both sprint off the road.

          EXT. FIELD - WITH CID & SARA

          The wide bare field. Cid runs ahead towards the corn, Sara
          not far behind. The earth soft, their feet sink in, like a
          nightmare.

          EXT. FIELD - WITH OLD JOE

          Old Joe crosses the road and chases them onto the field,
          firing at them on the run.

          EXT. FIELD - WITH CID & SARA

          Bullets thunk in the earth. Sara stumbles, exhausted. Cid
          turns, about thirty feet ahead of her.

          EXT. FIELD - WITH OLD JOE

          Old Joe stops running and steadies his gun.

          EXT. FIELD - WITH CID & SARA

          A distant gunshot CRACK. A fan of crimson blood sprays from
          Cid's head. His neck twists and he crumples to the ground.

                         SARA

          NO!
          Sara is stopped in her tracks by an invisible force.

                         SARA (CONT'D)
          No Cid no!
          The topsoil of the earth around them RISES in a fine dust.

          EXT. FIELD - WITH OLD JOE

          Old Joe reacts as the topsoil rises, an eerie moment.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          109.

          EXT. FIELD - WITH CID & SARA

          Sara struggles to reach Cid but is still about twenty feet
          behind him.
          Cid raises his head. The bullet grazed his jawline. Not
          severe but lots of blood.
          Cid's eyes locked hateful on Old Joe. Blood soaks his shirt.
          Far behind him, the barn splinters apart as if in a tornado.

                         SARA
          No!
          With a sudden jolt the field ripples out from Cid, like a
          stone thrown in a pond.
          Sara lifts into the air.

          EXT. FIELD - WITH OLD JOE

          Old Joe is hefted off the ground. His gun falls.

          EXT. CORN FIELDS - CONTINUOUS

          Joe struggling through the fields, limping, desperate.
          Something like a furious wind rushes through the stalks.

          EXT. FIELD - WITH CID & SARA

          Cid stands. Intense, eyes dark, in another place.

          EXT. FIELD - WITH OLD JOE

          Old Joe, suspended mid-air, realizes what's about to happen.
          He lifts his hand defensively and SCREAMS

          EXT. FIELD - WITH CID & SARA

          Cid's face straining, about to scream.
          Cid's focus adjusts from Old Joe to Sara. She floats,
          reaching out to him. Frightened. Yelling something he can't
          hear but he can see her eyes.
          Cid's face breaks. He barely mouths the word

                         CID

                         MOM
          And everything FALLS. Sara, Old Joe, the earth. All comes
          crashing down.

          EXT. EDGE OF FIELD - CONTINUOUS

          The corn stalks shiver then are still.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          110.
          Joe breaks out of the stalks and onto the field. Gasping for
          breath. Gets his bearings. In the far distance across the
          field, Old Joe, Sara and Cid.
          Too far.

          EXT. FIELD - WITH CID & SARA

          Cid runs to Sara, who sits up slowly. They embrace.

                         SARA
          You did good, baby. You did so
          good. I love you.
          Behind them, Old Joe struggles to his feet. Sara kisses Cid.

                         SARA (CONT'D)
          Into the fields. Run now baby.
          Go.

                         CID

                         NO

                         SARA

                         GO NOW

                         CID
          No no mom no

                         SARA
          You go!
          She pushes him away and Cid runs. Then she turns. Standing
          her ground. Directly between Old Joe and Cid.
          Old Joe TRIPS in the mud, fumbles his gun. Sees Cid
          approaching the safety of the CORN STALKS. Blocked by Sara.

                         OLD JOE
          Move!

          EXT. FIELD - WITH JOE

          Still too far away, struggling as fast as he can, helpless as
          Old Joe closes in on Sara. He fires his buss at Old Joe, but
          is way out of range.

          EXT. FIELD - WITH OLD JOE & SARA

          Old Joe gets his gun, rises with it. Cid about to hit the
          stalks. Sara between them.

          EXT. FIELD - WITH CID

          Cid nears the corn fields, running. Seconds from safety.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          111.

          EXT. FIELD - WITH OLD JOE & SARA

          Old Joe. Gun raised. Pocket watch wrapped around it. His
          wife's picture in it. Clear as day.
          No time to move around Sara. Now or never.

          EXT. FIELD - WITH JOE

          Joe running, useless gun in hand.

                         JOE
          No!

          EXT. FIELD - WITH OLD JOE & SARA

          Sara, not going anywhere.

                         OLD JOE
          I'm sorry
          He pulls the trigger.

          EXT. FIELD - WITH JOE

          Joe running. Time slows. Watching:

          EXT. FIELD - OLD JOE & SARA

          Everything is a little surreal. Dream-like. Slow.
          Old Joe shoots Sara.
          We hear no gunshot. Just the wind in the corn, and young
          Joe's breathing. She falls, giving him a clear shot at Cid.

          EXT. FIELD - WITH JOE


                         JOE WATCHING:

          EXT. FIELD - WITH CID

          Just as Old Joe gets him in his sights, Cid breaches the corn
          fields and is gone, vanishing in the stalks.
          Old Joe lowers his gun, stunned but still frantic. He
          stumbles towards the corn, still far off, his face breaking.
          Trips, falls in the mud. Corn field vast in front of him.
          Cid is gone. He lost him. He holds his pocket watch. Sobs.
          Lost.

          EXT. FIELD - WITH JOE


                         JOE WATCHING:

                         

                         

                         

                         

          112.

          EXT. CORN FIELDS

          On the horizon, a train.

          EXT. FIELD - WITH JOE


                         JOE WATCHING:

          INT./EXT. FREIGHT TRAIN CAR

          Cid sits in a darkened car, holding a bloody rag to his jaw.

          EXT. FIELD - WITH JOE

          Joe watching, seeing:

          INT./EXT. FREIGHT TRAIN CAR

          Cid's face. Bloody. Dirty. His eyes full of hate. The
          train rumbles towards the dark city.

          EXT. FIELD - WITH JOE

          Joe watches. Sees, in his mind's eye, all of this.
          And through all of this we have only heard the wind. And Joe
          breathing.
          Time hanging, slowed nearly to a stop. A moment of decision.
          Joe turns his blunderbuss back on himself and FIRES.

          EXT. FIELD - WITH OLD JOE & SARA

          Revealing that all we saw was in Joe's head, and we are still
          in the moment where Old Joe is about to shoot Sara.
          But this time, just as he's pulling the trigger, a distant
          shot is heard.
          And Old Joe DISAPPEARS.
          Sara stands shell shocked just for a moment. Then she
          doesn't process any of it, she just turns and yells

                         SARA

          CID!

          EXT. FIELD - WITH CID

          Cid stops just shy of the corn. Turns back to the field.
          There's his mom, Sara, unharmed and smiling. The bad man is
          gone. The field is empty.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          113.

          EXT. FIELD - SEEN FROM JOE'S POV

          We don't see Joe, but far across the field Cid runs to his
          mom, into her arms. Sara lifts him, holds him.

          EXT. FIELD - WITH CID & SARA

          She carries him. Walking fast back towards a far distant
          figure lying still on the edge of the field. Joe.
          Then a faint buzz. The flasher, in her pocket. She pulls it
          out. Two flashes.
          She slows. Stops. Looking at him, far away. Two flashes.

                         CID
          Where's Joe?

                         SARA
          He had to go away, baby.

                         CID
          He took the bad man with him?
          She kisses him.

          EXT. FIELD - FROM JOE'S POV

          In the distance, Sara turns away and carries Cid back towards
          the farmhouse.

          INT. CID'S BATHROOM

          Sara bathes Cid, dresses the wound on his jaw.

          INT. CID'S BEDROOM

          She tucks Cid in, holds him close. Kisses his forehead.

          EXT. FARM HOUSE PORCH - LATE AFTERNOON

          Sara emerges from the ruined front door, crosses the porch.

          EXT. FARMHOUSE FRONT LAWN

          Sara crosses the lawn, and walks across the field.

          EXT. EDGE OF CORN FIELDS

          Joe's body. Sara goes to him, slowly. She kneels beside him.
          His pocket watch in the dirt. Open. No photo inside.
          Ticking away. Around and around.
          She closes it.Touches his hair. The wind through the corn.
          After a long while, the sun breaks through the clouds.

                         In these days of wars and rumors of 
                         wars - haven't you ever dreamed of a 
                         place where there was peace and security, 
                         where living was not a struggle but 
                         a lasting delight?

                         Sometimes he calls it Utopia - sometimes

                         The field is aflare with floodlights 
                         - on one side is an office building 
                         - on the other are hangars. The whole 
                         field is filled with Chinese refugees 
                         running around wildly. An Army transport 
                         is in front of the office building, 
                         motors going.

                         Showing in the distance, probably several 
                         miles away, the effect of a burning 
                         city, which is Baskul. Over the shot 
                         we hear the steady boom-boom of gunfire. 
                         In the f.g., we see the silhouetted 
                         figures of Chinese running away from 
                         Baskul and toward the Camera, their 
                         personal packs on their backs.

                         Toward office building. Conway comes 
                         out of the building, followed by a small 
                         group of white people with frightened 
                         faces. They have to fight their way 
                         through a horde of milling Chinese.

                         As Conway and group finally reach the 
                         plane where Conway forces the white 
                         people in. In this he is aided by his 
                         brother, George, a young and vigorous 
                         Englishman. The pilot sticks his head 
                         out of the cockpit.

                         PILOT
                                     
                         Conway, we can't take more than seven!
 
                                                              
                         Conway pulls a passenger out and gives 
                         the pilot a signal to start.

                         All right. I'm sorry. There will be 
                         another plane in a minute. All right 
                         - go on.

                         Motors roar, and the plane starts to 
                         move, scattering those of the Chinese 
                         who were unfortunately too close to 
                         the ship. Conway and George rush back 
                         into the office building.

                         men, women and several children. They 
                         all lift their panicky faces to Conway 
                         and George as they enter. A barrage 
                         of questions are flung at them.

                         waits for the fuel to spill on the ground,

                         Shooting toward the burning city of 
                         Baskul in the distance. We see the bandits

                         of screaming refugees.

                         Conway emerges, followed by Gloria,

                         When Conway and others approach, George 
                         helps Gloria Stone up, while Conway 
                         faces the mob, punching at those who 
                         try to wedge their way forward. Finally 
                         one of them manages to get his foot 
                         on the step, and Conway pushes him violently.

                         Who staggers back and falls, sprawling. 
                         As he hits the ground, he yells:

                         him off the ground.

                         Glaring off toward Conway, picks up 
                         a board and starts toward Conway.

                         George emerges in time to see the Chinese 
                         lift the board and about to clout Conway 
                         on the head. George moves quickly, puts 
                         out his left hand, wards off the blow 
                         and with his right he punches the Chinese, 
                         who reels out of the scene.

                         A shadowy figure materializes in the 
                         cockpit, and clubs Fenner from behind. 
                         He shoves Fenner aside and takes his 
                         place.

                         Conway pushes George up and starts to 
                         mount himself. He looks off - and what 
                         he sees startles him.

                         Of what Conway sees. Several trucks 
                         loaded with bandits - in makeshift uniforms 
                         - come tearing up the road - come to 
                         a stop. Some fire toward plane - others 
                         are setting up machine guns. Droves 
                         of refugees scramble to cover.

                         Gloria Stone, the prostitute; and Lovett, 
                         whom we saw dressed as a Chinese. Conway 
                         slams the door shut - looks off - then 
                         cries:

                         you, those Chinese were pouncing on 
                         me from every direction. I had to get

                         to escape.

                         Wrapped carefully in absorbent cotton

                         Say, listen - will you go and annoy

                         He shrugs his shoulders and slides back 
                         into his seat.

                         All is silent for a moment. Conway is 
                         writing on a small pad - which he rests 
                         on an uplifted knee. George is rummaging 
                         through a closet - rear of the cabin.

                         Conway still writes, undisturbed. George 
                         reaches into the closet and emerges 
                         with a bottle of whiskey. His face lights 
                         up.
                                      
                         GEORGE
                                     
                         (holds up bottle)
                                     
                         Hello! Look what I found!
                                     
                         He crosses to Conway.
                                     
                         GEORGE
                                     
                         Just what I needed too.

                         You?
                                     
                         GEORGE
                                     
                         Just this once, Bob. I feel like celebrating. 
                         Just think of it, Bob - a cruiser sent 
                         to Shanghai just to take you back to 
                         England. You know what it means.
                                      
                         (hands him cup)
                                     
                         Here you are. Don't bother about those 
                         cables now. I want you to drink with 
                         me.
                                      
                         (holds his cup up)
                                     
                         Gentlemen, I give you Robert Conway 
                         - England's new Foreign Secretary.
 
                                                              
                         Conway watches him, amused. George gulps 
                         down his drink.
                                      
                         CONWAY
                                     
                         (after a slight hesitation - downing 
                         his drink)
                                      
                         Hurray!
                                     
                         GEORGE
                                     
                         How I'm going to bask in reflected glory!

                         People are going to point to me and 
                         say, "There goes George Conway - brother 
                         of the Foreign Secretary."
                                      
                         CONWAY
                                     
                         Don't talk nonsense. Give me the bottle.
 
                                                              
                         Conway takes the bottle from him and 
                         pours himself a second drink.
                                      
                         GEORGE
                                     
                         That's why they're sending for you, 
                         Bob. With all these foreign entanglements, 
                         it was bound to happen. They need you.
 
                                                              
                         Conway, with a poured drink in hand, 
                         laughs.
                                      
                         GEORGE
                                     
                         All right, you can laugh if you want 
                         to. But who else can they get? Who else 
                         is there in all of England half the 
                         fighter, half the diplomat, who
                                      
                         ? 482 ?
                                     
                         has half your knowledge of the foreign 
                         situation? They can't stop you now, 
                         Bob.
                                      
                         Conway moodily pours himself a third. 
                         He downs the drink as we

                         39. CLOSE SHOT OF CONWAY
                                     
                         We find Conway, asleep in his seat, 
                         his head on his hands. George approaches 
                         and tenderly spreads a jacket over his 
                         shoulders. Conway stirs, opens an eye.
 
                                                              
                         CONWAY
                                     
                         (drunkenly)
                                     
                         Hello, Freshie. Did you make that report 
                         out yet?
                                      
                         GEORGE
                                     
                         Yes, Bob.
                                     
                         CONWAY
                                     
                         Did you say we saved ninety white people?
 
                                                              
                         GEORGE
                                     
                         Yes.
                                     
                         CONWAY
                                     
                         Hurray for us. Did you say that we left 
                         ten thousand natives down there to be 
                         annihilated? No, you wouldn't say that. 
                         They don't count.
                                      
                         GEORGE
                                     
                         You'd better try to get some sleep, 
                         Bob.
                                      
                         CONWAY
                                     
                         Just you wait until I'm Foreign Secretary. 
                         Can't you just see me, Freshie, with 
                         all those other shrewd, little Foreign 
                         Secretaries?
                                      
                         (confidentially - screws up face)
                                     
                         You see, the trick is to see who can 
                         out-talk the other. Everybody wants 
                         something for nothing, and if you can't 
                         get it with smooth talk, you send an 
                         army in. I'm going to fool them, Freshie. 
                         I'm not going to have an army. I'm going 
                         to disband mine. I'm going to sink my 
                         battleships - I'm going to destroy every 
                         piece of warcraft. Then when the enemy 
                         approaches we'll say, "Come in, gentlemen 
                         - what can we do for you?" So then the 
                         poor enemy soldiers will stop and think. 
                         And what will they think, Freshie? They'll 
                         think to themselves - "Something's wrong 
                         here. We've been duped. This is not 
                         according to form. These people seem 
                         to be quite friendly, and why should 
                         we shoot them?" Then they'll lay down 
                         their arms. You see how simple the whole 
                         thing is? Centuries of tradition kicked 
                         right in the pants
                                      
                         (pause - drily)
                                     
                         and I'll be slapped straight into the 
                         nearest insane asylum.
                                      
                         He starts to pour himself another drink.

                         GEORGE
                                     
                         You'd better not drink any more, Bob. 
                         You're not talking sense.
                                      
                         Conway downs the drink, and then chuckles 
                         cynically.
                                      
                         CONWAY
                                     
                         Don't worry, George. Nothing's going 
                         to happen. I'll fall right into line. 
                         I'll be the good little boy that everybody 
                         wants me to be. I'll be the best little 
                         Foreign Secretary we ever had, just 
                         because I haven't the nerve to be anything 
                         else.
                                      
                         GEORGE
                                     
                         Do try to sleep, Bob.

                         Huh? Oh, sure, Freshie. Good thing, 
                         sleep.
                                      
                         He grunts and squirms. George tucks 
                         him in.

                         Did you ever notice the sunrise in China, 
                         George? Ah, you should. It's beautiful.
 
                                                              
                         He gets settled. George relaxes and, 
                         leaning back, shuts his eyes.
                                      
                         40. LONG SHOT OF CABIN
                                     
                         It is quiet. All are asleep. CAMERA 
                         MOVES FORWARD SLOWLY until it reaches 
                         the glass panel leading to the cockpit. 
                         The pilot's face turns. Instead of Fenner 
                         we see a strange, Mongolian face - with 
                         sharp, piercing eyes. A half-smile plays 
                         across his mouth.

                         Flying at high speed against a moonlit 
                         sky. We stay on the shot until it vanishes, 
                         a mere speck, over the horizon.

                         The morning sun peeks over a mountain 
                         top. From the same direction, as if 
                         arriving with the sun, the ship looms 
                         up, and comes roaring toward us.

                         All are asleep except Lovett, who fidgets 
                         on his seat. Then Barnard stirs - opens 
                         his eyes - and stretches. As he does 
                         so, he sees that Lovett is awake.

                         Good morning, Lovey.

                         I beg your pardon.

                         Good morning

                         Look here, young man.

                         Eh?
                                     
                         LOVETT
                                     
                         I didn't care for 'sister' last night, 
                         and I don't like 'Lovey' this morning. 
                         My name is Lovett - Alexander, P.

                         I see.
                                     
                         LOVETT
                                     
                         I see.

                         Well, it's a good morning, anyway.
 
                                                              
                         LOVETT
                                     
                         I'm never conversational before I coffee.
 
                                                              
                         Barnard glances out of the window, looks 
                         around outside thoughtfully.
                                      
                         BARNARD
                                     
                         Wait a minute. Is it a good morning? 
                         Say, we're supposed to be travelling 
                         east, aren't we?
                                      
                         LOVETT
                                     
                         Why, of course. Yes.
                                     
                         BARNARD
                                     
                         Well, it looks to me as if we're travelling 
                         west.
                                      
                         LOVETT
                                     
                         That's ridiculous.
                                     
                         BARNARD
                                     
                         Is it?
                                     
                         LOVETT
                                     
                         It certainly is.

                         Look here

                         Any child knows how to tell direction. 
                         Any child. I don't care where the child 
                         is - in the air, on the earth, or in 
                         the sea. If you face the rising sun, 
                         your right hand is the north, and your 
                         left hand is the south
                                      
                         BARNARD
                                     
                         I always get it twisted because I'm 
                         left-handed.

                         Yes.

                         Well, you just reverse it. Your left 
                         hand is
                                      
                         (tries to explain - gets confused and

                         What difference does it make what 'hand' 
                         you are? The north is the north!

                         Uh-huh. All I know is - the sun rises 
                         in the east, and we're going away from 
                         it.

                         As he sulks by himself, looks around 
                         - locates the sun in back of him - smiles 
                         - satisfied he's right, throws a condescending 
                         glance over at Barnard - then suddenly 
                         his face clouds - the whole thing dawns 
                         on him.

                         During this George has been looking 
                         around - he rises.

                         I'll talk to Fenner.

                         He crosses to panel leading to cockpit, 
                         CAMERA FOLLOWING HIM. When he gets there 
                         he knocks on the window.

                         George knocks again. From the cockpit 
                         side - the small shade suddenly snaps 
                         up - and George finds himself staring 
                         into the face of the mysterious pilot. 
                         He takes an instinctive step backward. 
                         The pilot turns his head. CAMERA ANGLE 
                         WIDENS as George keeps backing up until 
                         he gets to Conway. George turns to Conway 
                         and shakes his shoulder.

                         Conway stirs in his sleep, slowly opens 
                         his eyes, yawns and stretches. Throughout 
                         it, George speaks.

                         Conway looks at him, glances off toward 
                         the others, and back at George.

                         The bloke up there looks a Chinese, 
                         or a Mongolian, or something.

                         This interests Conway and he looks out 
                         of the window.

                         Then rising, he crosses to cockpit. 
                         The others watch him expectantly.

                         Conway pounds on the panel. The face 
                         of the pilot appears in sight. Conway 
                         tries to ask him something in Chinese. 
                         The pilot glares at them for a second, 
                         then a gun is shoved out at them. Instinctively 
                         they back away.

                         It might afford you a great deal of 
                         relief.

                         Now gentlemen, I'm going back to sleep. 
                         Oh, and I was having such a peaceful 
                         dream.

                         He shuts his eyes and leans back. The 
                         others watch him for a second - and 
                         wander back to their seats.

                         Gloria is apparently indifferent to 
                         their predicament. As Barnard watches 
                         her, a little bitter smile plays around 
                         her mouth.

                         Conway and nudges him.

                         peers intently.

                         large open space at the foot of the 
                         hills. The plane is headed for it.

                         scantily attired, but bearing bayonets, 
                         running toward the plane.

                         As Conway turns to open the door, he 
                         looks off and is startled by something 
                         he sees. George follows his gaze, and 
                         a bewildered expression comes into his 
                         eyes, too.

                         natives have surrounded the plane and 
                         are closing in.

                         Conway and George both instinctively 
                         wheel around toward the opposite side. 
                         But from that direction too, a horde 
                         of natives dash toward them. Conway 
                         hesitates a second, and like a flash 
                         springs for the door. But he stops again, 
                         as he opens the door.

                         himself staring into the threatening 
                         mouths of half a dozen rifles, and quickly 
                         shuts the door.

                         Barnard, himself feeble and exhausted,

                         on his chest, his mouth ludicrously 
                         open, his eyes popping. George, his 
                         teeth clenched, struggles against a 
                         desire to sob. Conway looks at him feelingly.

                         finally unable to control himself, emits 
                         a sob - and rather ashamed, slaps his 
                         hand over his mouth and turns away.

                         to her ears, rocking in pain. Suddenly 
                         her voice rents the air.

                         She runs to one of the ship's doors 
                         and pounds on it with her fist, then 
                         tries to shove it open. A blast of frigid 
                         air throws her back. George and Conway 
                         manage to pry her off and pull her away. 
                         Sobbing pitifully, she lets Conway steer 
                         her back to her seat, where she bundles 
                         up in torturous pain. For a moment nothing 
                         is heard but her stifled moans.

                         Unexpectedly the cockpit panel opens, 
                         and the pilot tosses something out in

                         The occupants brace themselves for the 
                         jolt. The ship hits and bounces several 
                         times and finally stops. Its nose seems 
                         to bury itself in the ground. The people 
                         are lifted high into the air where they 
                         remain, suspended for a few seconds, 
                         terror-stricken. Then, accompanied by 
                         grinding, crackling sounds, the ship 
                         flops back and falls on its side. For 
                         a moment there is stark silence - while 
                         the people do not stir. A look of relief 
                         spreads over their faces.

                         "Okay - yeah - I think so." Meanwhile, 
                         Conway has opened the door. A swirling 
                         mass of snow greets them, so that they 
                         have to force their way out.

                         from the plane in the blinding snow. 
                         George quickly runs around to the other 
                         side. Conway crosses to the cockpit, 
                         and clambers aboard.

                         His eyes which have been flashing with 
                         determination suddenly sober. CAMERA

                         his chin resting on his chest.

                         George pops into view on the opposite 
                         side, just as Conway has found the pilot's 
                         gun beside him on the seat.
                                      
                         GEORGE
                                     
                         What is it? Has he fainted?

                         It looks like it.
                                     
                         (sniffing)

                         Conway hops up beside the pilot. George 
                         follows suit.

                         Here George, take the gun. Hold the 
                         lights. I'm going to search him before 
                         he comes to.
                                      
                         (while searching)
                                     
                         We might find something interesting.
 
                                                              
                         (finds something)
                                     
                         Hello - what's this? A map!

                         He resumes his search enthusiastically. 
                         Suddenly he stops. The utter limpness 
                         of the pilot's body gives him pause. 
                         He lifts up his chin, stares into his 
                         face - pulls up his eyelid and then 
                         places a hand over his heart. He turns 
                         slowly toward George, who has been watching 
                         his brother intently.

                         George stares unbelievingly.

                         It must have happened the moment he

                         Let's take a look at this map.
                                     
                         Conway holds the map under the dashboard 
                         light. He studies it painstakingly, 
                         and his tense expression changes to 
                         one of deep concern. George's eyes are 
                         glued on him.
                                      
                         GEORGE
                                     
                         What is it?

                         See that spot?
                                     
                         GEORGE
                                     
                         Yes.
                                     
                         CONWAY
                                     
                         That's where we were this morning. He 
                         had it marked. Right on the border of 
                         Tibet. Here's where civilization ends. 
                         We must be a thousand miles beyond it 
                         - just a blank on the map.
                                      
                         GEORGE
                                     
                         (afraid to ask)
                                     
                         What's it mean?
                                     
                         CONWAY
                                     
                         It means we're in unexplored country 
                         - country nobody ever reached.
                                      
                         George stares at him, wide-eyed, the 
                         gravity of their situation slowly penetrating 
                         his terrorized mind. Conway's thoughts 
                         are interrupted by a knock on the panel, 
                         and he looks up.

                         We see the faces of Barnard and the 
                         others. We hear their voices inquiring 
                         - "Hey, Conway, what's happening?" - 
                         "What's up?" - "Where are we?" - "What'd 
                         you find out?"

                         Conway turns to George.
                                     
                         CONWAY
                                     
                         George, our chances of getting out of 
                         this are pretty slim. But it's up to 
                         us.

                         Everything's all right. The pilot won't 
                         trouble us any more. He's - he's dead.
 
                                                              
                         This is met by a series of exclamations.

                         His terror-stricken eyes look dully 
                         before him. He stops in the doorway.

                         The storm will probably die down by

                         Why don't you tell them we're a million 
                         miles from civilization, without a chance 
                         of getting out of here alive? It's slow 
                         starvation - that's what it is. It's 
                         a slow, horrible death!
                                      
                         When the significance of this outburst 
                         finally sinks into the chaotic minds 
                         of his listeners, they turn to Conway 
                         hopefully, certain he will refute it. 
                         But Conway looks beyond them at George. 
                         From his noncommittal silence, they 
                         realize that George's statement is the 
                         truth. They slip into their seats. The 
                         place is heavy with a fatalistic silence. 
                         George slowly crosses to his seat near 
                         Conway, avoiding his accusing eyes. 
                         Suddenly the air is rent with harsh, 
                         bitter laughter from Gloria. They all 
                         look up.

                         She emits another outburst of semi-hysterical 
                         laughter.

                         She flops into her seat and buries her 
                         head in her hands. For quite a while 
                         all we hear are her stifled sobs.

                         Shooting from front of plane, taking 
                         in entire cabin. The only sound that 
                         comes in on the tragic quiet is the 
                         low moaning of the wind outside. A feeling 
                         of doom has descended upon the five 
                         people.

                         Shooting toward the mountains which 
                         seem to imprison the valley below. The 
                         snowstorm, treacherous in its fury, 
                         seems to threaten the valley with complete

                         George and Conway are missing. Lovett 
                         turns from the window.

                         Lovett sees something through the window.

                         George and Conway are seen walking briskly 
                         toward the plane, their few clothes 
                         a scant protection against the biting 
                         wind.

                         The others quickly glance up, just as 
                         Conway and George clamber aboard. Conway 
                         has a serious mien, but George is full 
                         of vigor and enthusiasm.

                         He holds out his hat which he has been 
                         carrying, bottom side up.

                         Well, we found some food.
                                     
                         Barnard and Lovett rush to him.
                                     
                         GEORGE
                                     
                         No chance of our starving now.
                                     
                         When they see the contents of his hat, 
                         their faces fall.
                                      
                         LOVETT
                                     
                         What is it?

                         Mountain grass. It's good, too. Here, 
                         have some. I've read of people lasting 
                         thirty days on this stuff.
                                      
                         They grab handfuls. He goes on:

                         Listen, my brother and I have worked 
                         out a plan. If we use our heads, we 
                         should be able to keep alive for weeks, 
                         until he gets back.

                         He doesn't know. But he's starting out 
                         right away in the direction of India. 
                         Sooner or later he's bound to run into 
                         somebody - a tribe or something.

                         Throughout the previous scene he has 
                         been busily occupied making preparations. 
                         Out of the baggage hold he has brought 
                         some blankets and rope and has been 
                         wrapping his feet in them. As George 
                         speaks, he looks up and smiles.

                         Now here's the idea. We found a cave 
                         over by that small hill. After we bury 
                         the pilot, we're moving in. We can have 
                         a fire there. I shouldn't be surprised 
                         to see Bob back within a week.
                                      
                         Conway's smile dies on his face. We 
                         get a feeling he is attempting a futile 
                         journey, and is fully aware of it. He 
                         resumes the roping of his feet - his 
                         movements mechanical.

                         Barnard peers out the plane window.

                         appearing over the top of a hill, we 
                         see a caravan of natives approaching. 
                         They are not close enough to distinguish 
                         who or what they are, but that they 
                         are human beings is apparent.

                         Conway takes in the unbelievable sight. 
                         We hear the exultant exclamations of 
                         the others. Barnard and Lovett start 
                         out of the plane.

                         a trifle awe-stricken. Conway joins 
                         them. Gloria has stayed inside.

                         The approach of the caravan from the 
                         viewpoint of the group. It comprises 
                         some twenty Tibetans, attired in sheepskins, 
                         fur, hats and boots. Somewhere in the 
                         middle of the single file is Chang, 
                         an elderly Chinese. Chang steps forward 
                         as their leader.

                         the oncoming party. He approaches Chang 
                         and bowing courteously, greets him in 
                         Chinese. Chang turns his head slowly 
                         and speaks in perfect Oxfordian English.

                         he was dead.

                         the abyss below.

                         Close by to Barnard. Gloria's face is 
                         wan and haggard. Every upward move seems 
                         to require a Herculean effort. She stops 
                         and has a fit of coughing.

                         Of the snake-like moving party. They 
                         have reached quite a height although 
                         the peak of the mountain they are ascending 
                         towers high above them. The cutting 
                         wind moans treacherously as it caroms 
                         off the mountainside. A heavy mist envelops 
                         them.

                         As the snake-like line approaches a 
                         narrow, treacherous footbridge and makes 
                         a slow, difficult crossing in heavy

                         Of the group. They round a curve and 
                         come upon a narrow crevice which opens 
                         up into a passageway. One by one they 
                         step through, assisted by the natives. 
                         On the other side, they sigh relievedly. 
                         Oddly, the wind has stopped, the chill 
                         has lessened. They look up to inspect 
                         their surroundings and a startled look 
                         comes into their eyes.

                         What he sees leaves him transfixed. 
                         He stares unbelievingly before him for 
                         a long time.

                         A sight that is both magnificent and 
                         incredible. The eye-filling horizon 
                         before them throws out a softness and 
                         a warmth that is breathless. On the 
                         left is a group of colored pavilions 
                         that seem as if suspended on the mountainside. 
                         Down below, in the hazy distance, is 
                         a valley which gives one the impression 
                         of a huge tapestry, superb in its blending 
                         of soft colors. In every direction, 
                         wherever one might gaze, there is a 
                         feast of strange and heavenly beauty.

                         Conway's group and Chang. Chang smiles 
                         as he watches their astonished faces. 
                         Conway turns from the rare magnificence 
                         of Shangri-La, unhampered by the wind 
                         and storm they had just encountered, 
                         and looks backward, in the direction 
                         from which they came to assure himself 
                         he is the victim of a nightmare. Chang, 
                         watching him, answers him before he 
                         can express his astonishment.

                         You see, we are sheltered by mountains

                         to the pane, are two robed Lamas who

                         It suggests nothing we might expect 
                         to see in this forsaken place. The motif 
                         is neither Oriental nor religious - 
                         but rather a delicately appointed room,

                         room door. He sees two servants who 
                         flank the entrance and steps back hesitantly. 
                         Barnard emerges from a room across the 
                         hall, and Lovett beckons to him. Both 
                         are attired in flowing robes not unlike 
                         the one worn by Chang.

                         to wear.

                         they're going to give them back to us, 
                         Lovey.
                                      
                         They have reached the doorway of the

                         It is in semi-darkness. The moon sends 
                         a stream of light through the windows. 
                         Outside we see the outline of towering 
                         mountains. Spread across the bed - her 
                         clothes unchanged - is the body of Gloria 
                         - her face sunk deep in the pillows.

                         Gloria emits wracking coughs. After 
                         a few moments - she sits up. Her cheeks 
                         are wet - her hair disheveled - her 
                         eyes bloodshot. We get an impression 
                         of someone who has suffered for hours. 
                         Finally, her coughing begins again - 
                         and unable to stand it, she rises and 
                         paces the floor - then she crosses to 
                         the window and looks down, CAMERA PANNING 
                         WITH HER - and into her eyes has come 
                         a grim, determined expression.

                         She is staring at the chasm below her.

                         They all look up as Chang enters. He 
                         is escorted to his place at the head 
                         of the table by two servants who stand 
                         on either side of his chair.

                         Good evening. Good evening, my friends. 
                         Oh no, no, no, please sit down. I hope 
                         you found everything satisfactory.

                         Shooting down the long table toward 
                         Chang. He sits up straight - studying 
                         them - as the others bend over their 
                         food.

                         The meal is over. Conway sips from a 
                         wine glass.

                         I'm glad you like it. It's made right 
                         here in the valley.

                         Now that dinner is over, if you'll excuse 
                         us, we're very anxious to discuss ways 
                         and means of getting back home.
                                      
                         GEORGE
                                     
                         The first thing we want to do is to 
                         cable the Foreign Office. All of England 
                         is waiting to hear about my brother. 
                         There's a cruiser at Shanghai ready 
                         to take him back.
                                      
                         CHANG
                                     
                         Really? Well, as regards cabling, I'm 
                         afraid I can't help. Unfortunately, 
                         we have no wireless here. As a matter 
                         of fact, we have no means of communication 
                         with the outside world.
                                      
                         George stares at him suspiciously - 
                         and then turns to Conway for his reaction 
                         - but Conway is apparently disinterested 
                         in the whole conversation.

                         It's always been a source of deep regret, 
                         but the mountains surrounding us have 
                         made reception almost impossible.

                         In that event, we better make arrangements 
                         to get some porters immediately. Some 
                         means to get us back to civilization.

                         well paid - that is, within reason.

                         But I can assure you, gentlemen, if 
                         there is a prolonged delay, Shangri-La 
                         will endeavor to make your stay as pleasant 
                         as possible.

                         And now if you will excuse me, it is 
                         getting late. I do hope you all sleep 
                         well. Good night.
                                      
                         The servants move his chair back. Before 
                         he goes, however, he turns to Conway.

                         Good night, Mr. Conway.
                                     
                         Conway, a little surprised at the distinction 
                         in his behalf, nods.

                         Chang exits. There is a hushed silence 
                         following Chang's departure.

                         That's what I mean - mysterious. Mr. 
                         Conway, I don't like that man. He's 
                         too vague.

                         We didn't get much information out of 
                         him, did we Bob?
                                      
                         CONWAY
                                     
                         It seems to me we should be grateful. 
                         We were in a bad mess this morning.
 
                                                              
                         (a wave of his hand)
                                     
                         After all, this is quite pleasant. Why 
                         not make ourselves comfortable until 
                         the porters do arrive?
                                      
                         While he was speaking, the muted strains 
                         of a violin float into the room. Conway 
                         rises.

                         That's what I say. What do you say to 
                         a rubber of bridge? I saw some cards 
                         in the other room.

                         He disappears onto the balcony. George 
                         watches him go.

                         As a matter of fact, I'm very good at 
                         double solitaire.

                         Lovett detests the pet names, but follows. 
                         George thinks a moment - and crosses 
                         to balcony.

                         Conway is listening moodily to the soulful 
                         music. George wanders in beside him.

                         hidden away like this - no contact with 
                         civilization. Bob, you don't seem concerned 
                         at all.

                         Conway's point of view, studying George.

                         hill? In any event, I'm not curious. 
                         At the moment, it seems to me we should 
                         be concerned about getting home. I'd 
                         give anything to be in London right 
                         now.

                         out of this place, the thing for you 
                         to do is to take that job with Helen's

                         George, I've been putting things together. 
                         Do you notice the resemblance between 
                         those natives and the pilot? And why 
                         did those clothes materialize so conveniently 
                         when they met us at the plane? Chang 
                         himself just said that they never venture 
                         beyond that point. What brought them 
                         there? Unless it was to meet us?

                         pilot.

                         There must be some connection between 
                         the plane and this place. They must 
                         have deliberately brought us here. Why, 
                         Bob? What reason could they have for 
                         doing a thing like that?

                         George still maintains a serious mien, 
                         as their eyes meet.

                         Conway has just finished browsing through 
                         one of the books.

                         A look of surprise spreads over Conway's

                         our general belief was in moderation. 
                         We preach the virtue of avoiding excesses

                         Why, we have no crime here. What makes 
                         a criminal? Lack, usually. Avariciousness, 
                         envy, the desire to possess something 
                         owned by another. There can be no crime 
                         where there is a sufficiency of everything.

                         not be considered good manners to take 
                         a woman that another man wanted.

                         the last speech, for his attention has 
                         been caught by the playing of a piano. 
                         He stops to listen. Chang has walked 
                         out of scene.

                         Conway locates the direction whence

                         He realizes Conway did not follow him 
                         and turns. When he sees Conway, his

                         Conway watches someone through door

                         room, oddly shaped, and except for a 
                         piano, a harp and several chairs, is 
                         otherwise sparsely furnished. At the

                         sobers - self-consciously.

                         A Belgian priest by the name of Father 
                         Perrault, the first European to find 
                         this place, and a very great man indeed. 
                         He is responsible for everything you 
                         see here. He built Shangri-La, taught 
                         our natives, and began our collection 
                         of art. In fact, Shangri-La is Father 
                         Perrault.

                         Oh, let me see - way back in 1713, I 
                         think it was, that Father Perrault stumbled 
                         into the Valley, half frozen to death. 
                         It was typical of the man that, one 
                         leg being frozen, and of course there 
                         being no doctors here, he amputated 
                         the leg himself.

                         Yes. Oddly enough, later, when he had 
                         learned to understand their language, 
                         the natives told him he could have saved 
                         his leg. It would have healed without 
                         amputation.

                         it too. You see, a perfect body in perfect

                         is quite common here to live to a very

                         in the way we live. In your countries, 
                         on the other hand, how often do you

                         runs into scene.

                         Honey, it's terrific! Terrific! I just 
                         saw something that will make your hair 
                         stand on end. You see those hills over 
                         there? Gold! Gold! Popping right out 
                         of them! Tons of it!
                                      
                         (conspiratorially)
                                     
                         Now look, you keep this under your hat, 
                         because if those other monkeys hear 
                         about it, they'll declare themselves 
                         in. But if I can mine that stuff, I'll 
                         throw a bombshell into Wall Street. 
                         Now look, I've got a plan - and if I
 
                                                              
                         Gloria begins coughing heavily. Barnard 
                         notices how pale and haggard she looks.

                         Aw say, honey, you aren't feeling well, 
                         are you? Look, don't pay too much attention 
                         to what those doctors tell you. I've 
                         seen an awful lot of people fool them, 
                         and I've got a hunch that this place 
                         is going to be good for you. Honest, 
                         I have.

                         Come on now. Come on. You be a good 
                         kid, and snap out of it, and I'll cut 
                         you in on the gold deal. Look, I'm going 
                         up and make a deal with Chang - right 
                         now.

                         Lovett enters warily, sits down at his 
                         desk and begins to write in his journal.

                         He looks up, sees himself in a mirror 
                         and gives a start. Then, chuckling to 
                         himself reassuringly, he looks around 
                         warily and continues to write.

                         It is a bright, cheery morning. Conway 
                         is drinking in the beauty of his surroundings. 
                         He comes into the area where the horses 
                         are stabled. Two men are busily grooming 
                         the horses.

                         Would you like to take a ride, Mr. Conway?

                         Suddenly, Conway is startled by the 
                         sound of hoof-beats and, looking up, 
                         is in time to see 'the girl' of the 
                         previous sequence (Sondra) fly by him 
                         on a horse - screaming delightedly. 
                         As she passes him, she waves.

                         pursuit.

                         but she is lost from sight. He wheels 
                         around several times - and unable to 
                         find her, looks puzzled. Finally, giving 
                         up, he starts slowly back. After a few 
                         moments he is startled by her laughter, 
                         and glances around.

                         see Sondra - waving and laughing. Then 
                         she swings her horse around and disappears.

                         As she swims in a mountain stream, apparently

                         He has caught up to her tethered horse 
                         and is skulking around trying to find 
                         out where she is.

                         A squirrel, near to Sondra, chatters 
                         excitedly.

                         She can apparently understand the squirrel's 
                         warning. She hurries to dive back into 
                         the water and swim to the other side. 
                         She comes up, spots Conway and watches 
                         him from hiding, behind some bushes.

                         Conway has discovered her clothing and 
                         is constructing a kind of scarecrow 
                         on a bush out of them. As a crowning 
                         touch, he adds a flower to the effigy, 
                         his eyes twinkling at his little joke. 
                         With one final glance over his shoulder, 
                         he turns to leave.

                         around digging up a lot of old bones! 
                         You didn't dig yourself out of one of 
                         those holes by any chance, did you?

                         tentative chuckle.

                         Conway is coming down the corridor. 
                         George comes out of door to dining room 
                         and starts forward. Conway walks along 
                         in a cheerful mood, singing as he goes, 
                         a Cockney song.

                         silent, enters and drops in his seat. 
                         At the same moment, Gloria comes into

                         right, he punches him flush on the jaw.

                         awakens with a start.

                         George groans and turns away.

                         wanders over to Conway, who appears 
                         lost in thought.

                         Conway suddenly is aroused from his 
                         reverie by someone he sees off scene. 
                         He looks up alertly.

                         As Chang enters. He bows courteously 
                         to the others, who stand in front of 
                         George's bed. Conway shuts the door 
                         and turns the key. He crosses to a door 
                         leading to another room - and locks 
                         this one, also. Chang watches him curiously. 
                         The others, including George, who is 
                         now alert, are puzzled and somewhat 
                         impressed. Then Conway comes to Chang.

                         Chang sits, his placidity unchanged. 
                         Conway pulls up a chair in front of 
                         him.

                         Mr. Chang, you have been very kind to 
                         us - and we appreciate it. But for some 
                         reason we are being held prisoners here, 
                         and we want to know why.

                         But my brother is not of the same opinion,

                         why we are being kept here, but most 
                         important of all - do we get the porters, 
                         and when?

                         Until we get this information, my dear

                         As the doors swing shut. Conway turns 
                         and realizes Chang is no longer with 
                         him.
                                      
                         213. CLOSE SHOT AT DOOR
                                     
                         Conway stands still, glancing around 
                         the room, which is lit so dimly that 
                         nothing definite is distinguishable.
 
                                                              
                         214. FULL SHOT
                                     
                         To show what Conway sees. For the moment, 
                         practically nothing. As his eyes become 
                         adjusted to the darkness, he begins 
                         to sense the architecture and furnishings 
                         of the room. But as yet no sign of life. 
                         SLOW PAN SHOT reveals it to be a dark-curtained 
                         and low-ceilinged room, furnished rather 
                         simply. Very sombre, indistinct tapestries 
                         drape the back walls. While the CAMERA 
                         FOLLOWS CONWAY'S GAZE, MOVING SLOWLY 
                         AROUND, a voice is heard.
                                      
                         HIGH LAMA'S VOICE
                                     
                         (soft and friendly)
                                     
                         Good evening, Mr. Conway.
                                     
                         CAMERA QUICKLY SWINGS OVER to the nethermost 
                         corner of the room where, scarcely visible, 
                         sits an old man of indeterminate age. 
                         In the gloom only the outlines of his 
                         pale and wrinkled face can be seen. 
                         It yields an effect of a fading antique 
                         portrait.

                         He stares, motionless, at the eerie 
                         vision.

                         Conway comes forward warily until he 
                         stands within a few feet of the old 
                         man, his eyes riveted upon him.

                         Sit here, near me. I am an old man and 
                         can do no one any harm.

                         Are you the High Lama?

                         Yes.

                         As Conway, expressionless, sits down 
                         opposite the High Lama.

                         I trust you have been comfortable at 
                         Shangri-La, since your arrival.

                         Personally, I've enjoyed your community 
                         very much. But my friends do not care 
                         for this mystery. They are determined 
                         to leave as soon as
                                      
                         While he has been speaking, his eyes 
                         have been gradually taking in the details 
                         of the old man. The CAMERA QUICKLY FOLLOWS 
                         HIS GAZE - to crutches leaning against 
                         the man's throne - then, looking down, 
                         to his legs, one of which appears to 
                         have been amputated.

                         It's astonishing - and incredible, but

                         You're the man Chang told me about! 
                         You're the first - who - two hundred 
                         years ago
                                      
                         (reverently)
                                     
                         you're still alive, Father Perrault!

                         Sit down, my son.
                                     
                         (pause)
                                     
                         You may not know it, but I've been an 
                         admirer of yours for a great many years.
 
                                                              
                         Conway evinces surprise.
                                     
                         HIGH LAMA
                                     
                         Oh, not of Conway the empire-builder 
                         and public hero. I wanted to meet the 
                         Conway who in one of his books, said, 
                         "There are moments in every man's life 
                         when he glimpses the eternal."
                                      
                         The quotation captures Conway's interest 
                         - and his eyes widen.

                         That Conway seemed to belong here. In 
                         fact, it was suggested that someone 
                         be sent to bring him here.

                         That I be brought here? Who had that 
                         brilliant idea?

                         Yes. She has read your books and has 
                         a profound admiration for you, as have 
                         we all.

                         Of course I have suspected that our 
                         being here is no accident. Furthermore, 
                         I have a feeling that we're never supposed 
                         to leave. But that, for the moment, 
                         doesn't concern me greatly. I'll meet 
                         that when it comes. What particularly 
                         interests me at present is, why was 
                         I brought here? What possible use can 
                         I be to an already thriving community?
 
                                                              
                         HIGH LAMA
                                     
                         We need men like you here, to be sure 
                         that our community will continue to 
                         thrive. In return for which, Shangri-La 
                         has much to give you. You are still, 
                         by the world's standards, a youngish 
                         man. Yet in the normal course of existence, 
                         you can expect twenty or thirty years 
                         of gradually diminishing activity. Here, 
                         however, in Shangri-La, by our standards 
                         your life has just begun, and may go 
                         on and on.

                         But to be candid, Father, a prolonged 
                         future doesn't excite me. It would have 
                         to have a point. I've sometimes doubted 
                         whether life itself has any. And if 
                         that is so, then long life must be even 
                         more pointless. No, I'd need a much 
                         more definite reason for going on and 
                         on.

                         We have reason. It is the entire meaning 
                         and purpose of Shangri-La. It came to 
                         me in a vision, long, long, ago. I saw 
                         all the nations strengthening, not in 
                         wisdom, but in the vulgar passions and 
                         the will to destroy. I saw their machine 
                         power multiply until a single weaponed 
                         man might match a whole army. I foresaw 
                         a time when man, exulting in the technique 
                         of murder, would rage so hotly over 
                         the world that every book, every treasure, 
                         would be doomed to destruction. This 
                         vision was so vivid and so moving that 
                         I determined to gather together all 
                         the things of beauty and culture that 
                         I could and preserve them here against 
                         the doom toward which the world is rushing.

                         Look at the world today! Is there anything 
                         more pitiful? What madness there is, 
                         what blindness, what unintelligent leadership! 
                         A scurrying mass of bewildered humanity 
                         crashing headlong against each other, 
                         propelled by an orgy of greed and brutality. 
                         The time must come, my friend, when 
                         this orgy will spend itself, when brutality 
                         and the lust for power must perish by 
                         its own sword. Against that time is 
                         why I avoided death and am here, and 
                         why you were brought here. For when 
                         that day comes, the world must begin 
                         to look for a new life. And it is our 
                         hope that they may find it here. For 
                         here we shall be with their books

                         and their music and a way of life based 
                         on one simple rule: Be Kind.

                         When that day comes, it is our hope 
                         that the brotherly love of Shangri-La 
                         will spread throughout the world.

                         Yes, my son, when the strong have devoured 
                         each other, the Christian ethic may 
                         at last be fulfilled, and the meek shall 
                         inherit the earth.
                                      
                         A long silence ensues during which Conway, 
                         so engrossed is he in all he has just 
                         heard, scarcely notices the Lama, who 
                         has risen slowly and now stands before 
                         him. The Lama reaches down and gently 
                         touches him on the shoulder.

                         Conway kisses the High Lama's hand.

                         Conway slowly rises to his feet and 
                         turns to leave scene.

                         Conway comes through. He walks as if

                         continues on his way - bearing an expression

                         at the end of corridor leading to the 
                         garden. Lovett emerges from one of the

                         inside and almost immediately they come 
                         out and start toward Conway.

                         Conway stares at them blankly.

                         As he walks along. He comes to a spot 
                         where a man and a woman are tilling 
                         the soil, and stops to watch them. The 
                         man looks up and, seeing Conway, makes 
                         a friendly bow and doffs his hat. Conway 
                         also bows. The woman curtsies prettily 
                         and smiles. Conway doffs his hat in 
                         acknowledgement.
                                      
                         He is in a cheerful frame of mind and 
                         continues his walk - CAMERA CONTINUING 
                         WITH HIM. He greets several other people. 
                         Upon seeing him, they also bow and doff 
                         their hats. Conway does likewise.

                         Conway is walking along a street in 
                         the valley. It is a quaint thoroughfare, 
                         unlike anything we have ever seen before. 
                         The small, one-story huts along its 
                         very narrow sidewalk are of singularly 
                         varied architecture - giving the impression 
                         of being "homemade." As a result of 
                         this, no two are alike. Only one characteristic 
                         about them is similar - their cleanliness. 
                         Something about the atmosphere is fresh 
                         and wholesome and peaceful. In front 
                         of several of the huts native women 
                         sit - some weaving on a tapestry board, 
                         some nursing babies, some asleep, and 
                         some just sitting. The keynote is contentment.

                         With Conway, walking along. As he passes, 
                         the women smile at him in the most friendly 
                         fashion. From inside these homes, soft 
                         and soothing music emanates. At the 
                         end of the street, Conway finally arrives 
                         at a garden spot. The suddenness of 
                         this is startling, too - because of 
                         its beauty. Sighing contentedly, Conway 
                         throws himself at the foot of an overhanging 
                         tree, and leans against the trunk.

                         He throws his head back, shuts his eyes 
                         - in a restful and contemplative mood. 
                         He remains this way quietly for a few 
                         seconds, when he is attracted by the 
                         singing of a chorus of children's voices. 
                         He glances around.
                                      
                         230. LONG SHOT
                                     
                         From Conway's angle. In the shadow of 
                         a row of overhanging trees which form 
                         an arch, a group of fifteen or twenty 
                         children sing a hymn, or nursery song 
                         - in English. Sondra (the violin girl 
                         of previous scenes) stands in front 
                         of them, a baton in hand, conducting 
                         them.

                         He smiles at the sight - and springing 
                         to his feet starts in their direction.

                         Of Sondra and the children, as Conway 
                         saunters into the scene behind her. 
                         He finds himself a comfortable place 
                         under a tree and sits down. The children, 
                         still singing, have seen his approach 
                         and crane their necks curiously.

                         She waves her baton and sings with the 
                         children. Then she notices they are 
                         being distracted and casually turns 
                         her head. She is somewhat startled at 
                         seeing Conway, but quickly recovers 
                         her composure, and smiles wanly.

                         He smiles also.

                         235. WIDER ANGLE
                                     
                         To include Sondra, Conway and some of 
                         the children. They finish the song, 
                         and Conway applauds. Sondra curtsies 
                         prettily. She turns to the children.

                         In unison the twenty children curtsey.

                         Good morning, Mr. Conway.

                         Conway scrambles to his feet and does 
                         an exaggerated bow. Sondra laughs delightedly.

                         She lifts her baton and the thin, piping 
                         voices fill the air.

                         He lights a cigarette and, leaning against 
                         a tree, studies Sondra's face - impressed 
                         by her beauty.

                         She slyly glances backward, and a self-conscious 
                         smile covers her face.
                                      
                         239. MED. SHOT
                                     
                         As a child from the ranks breaks and 
                         comes to Sondra, who leans down to listen 
                         to the child - who whispers in her ear. 
                         Sondra, murmuring, "Of course, dear" 
                         and still waving her baton is, for the 
                         moment, uncertain what to do. Then turning 
                         to Conway, holds out the baton to him.

                         Conway snaps out of his reverie and 
                         jumps forward.

                         He takes the baton from her.
                                     
                         SONDRA

                         And, taking the child by the hand, she 
                         exits.

                         Conducting the chorus in all seriousness 
                         - albeit a trifle awkwardly. He turns 
                         his head to watch Sondra, and when he 
                         looks forward again, finds himself off-beat. 
                         To cover his embarrassment, he smiles 
                         foolishly.

                         They come to the end of the song, but 
                         Conway, whose eyes are searching for 
                         Sondra, is oblivious of this and continues 
                         to conduct mechanically. The children 
                         break into laughter.

                         With Sondra as she returns with the 
                         child clinging to her. As she turns 
                         a bend, she looks up, surprised.
                                      
                         243. CLOSE SHOT - SONDRA
                                     
                         As she laughs heartily.

                         going to be very busy this afternoon,

                         The children break into squeals and 
                         race off. THE CAMERA FOLLOWS THEM as 
                         they cross a footbridge, gleefully doff 
                         their clothes and with yelps and cries 
                         leap into a stream.

                         He hears curious, fluttering music coming

                         Of a large coop where pigeons are bred 
                         and raised. The pigeons flutter around, 
                         landing on Sondra and Conway, as she 
                         shows him her collection with pride. 
                         She grabs one pigeon and ties one of 
                         the miniature flutes to its legs.

                         You see, this is how we tie them on. 
                         And by varying the size of the flutes, 
                         I can get any notes I wish. The wind 
                         does the rest. Here's a little fellow 
                         who lost his!
                                      
                         She grabs another pigeon, ties a flute 
                         to its legs.

                         full of that. But you were accomplishing 
                         nothing. You were going nowhere, and 
                         you knew it.

                         Do you realize that there is a British 
                         cruiser waiting at Shanghai, smoke pouring

                         waiting to take Mr. Conway back to London?

                         Well, I was almost born here. It took 
                         place in that wild country beyond the 
                         pass. My father and mother were in a 
                         party of explorers who got lost and 
                         wandered around for a year. When Chang 
                         found us, only Father and I were alive. 
                         But he was too weak to climb the pass. 
                         He died on the way. I was brought up 
                         here by Father Perrault himself.

                         to him last night.

                         I'm sorry. I thought I was to be the 
                         light. But why do I confuse you? Am 
                         I so strange?

                         And that in itself is confusing. I have 
                         the same idea about Shangri-La. The 
                         sense that I've been here before, that 
                         I belong here.

                         I can't quite explain it, but everything 
                         is somehow familiar. The very air that 
                         I breathe. The Lamasery, with its feet 
                         rooted in the good earth of this fertile 
                         valley, while its head explores the 
                         eternal. All the beautiful things I 
                         see, these cherry blossoms, you - all 
                         somehow familiar.

                         I've been kidnapped and brought here 
                         against my will. A crime, a great crime, 
                         yet I accept it amiably, with the same 
                         warm amiability one tolerates only from 
                         a very dear and close friend. Why? Can 
                         you tell me why?

                         Perhaps because you've always been a 
                         part of Shangri-La without knowing it.

                         I'm sure of it. Just as I'm sure there's 
                         a wish for Shangri-La in everyone's 
                         heart. I have never seen the outside 
                         world. But I understand there are millions 
                         and millions of people who are supposed 
                         to be mean and greedy. Yet I just know 
                         that secretly they are all hoping to 
                         find a garden spot where there is peace 
                         and security, where there's beauty and 
                         comfort, where they wouldn't have to 
                         be mean and greedy. Oh, I just wish 
                         the whole world might come to this valley.

                         Then it wouldn't be a garden spot for 
                         long.

                         down here. Why, we don't know anything

                         A merry Lovett has had too much to drink. 
                         Now he is entertaining a group of native 
                         children, who are huddled at his feet. 
                         Other natives watch the entertainment. 
                         Bernard, watching from one side, is 
                         losing patience.

                         then the bears came right into the 
                         bedroom and the little baby bear said, 
                         "Oh, somebody's been sleeping in my 
                         bed." And then the mama bear said, "Oh 
                         dear, somebody's been sleeping in my 
                         bed!" And then the big papa bear, he 
                         roared, "And somebody's been sleeping 
                         in my bed!" Well, you have to admit 
                         the poor little bears were in a quandary!

                         confidently and admiringly in the mirror.

                         the sculpted shrubbery and rows of flowers. 
                         There is a sudden pealing of bells. 
                         The two of them look off and pause, 
                         their gaze momentarily captured by picturesque 
                         snowcapped peaks in the distance.

                         catches up with her. He reaches to place

                         followed it. That silly shadow racing 
                         along over mountains and valleys, covering

                         you realize that I never for a moment 
                         believed that ridiculous kidnapping

                         Simply preposterous. Do you know what 
                         I did last night? Last night, Mr. Chang, 
                         I held a sort of a self-inventory. I 
                         said to myself last night, Mr. Chang, 
                         I said, "Lovey"

                         Mr. Lovett! "Mr. Lovett," I said, "you 
                         are an ungrateful fool . . . "

                         waiting for these porters, I would like 
                         to organize classes for those children

                         For I am going to die.
                                     
                         There is a pause during which Conway 
                         cannot conceal his amazement at this 
                         simple statement.

                         I knew my work was done when I first 
                         set eyes upon you.
                                      
                         275. CLOSEUP - CONWAY AND LAMA
                                     
                         Conway is too awed and impressed to 
                         utter a sound. The High Lama finally 
                         resumes.

                         I have waited for you, my son, for a 
                         long time. I have sat in this room and 
                         seen the faces of newcomers. I have 
                         looked into their eyes and heard their 
                         voices - always in hope that I might 
                         find you . My friend, it is not an arduous 
                         task that I bequeath, for our order 
                         knows only silken bonds. To be gentle 
                         and patient, to care for the riches 
                         of the mind, to preside in wisdom, while 
                         the storm rages without.

                         HIGH LAMA
                                     
                         You, my son, will live through the storm. 
                         You will preserve the fragrance of our 
                         history, and add to it a touch of your 
                         own mind. Beyond that, my vision weakens.

                         But I see in the great distance a new 
                         world starting in the ruins - stirring 
                         clumsily - but in hopefulness, seeking 
                         its vast and legendary treasures. And 
                         they will all be here, my son, hidden 
                         behind the mountains in the Valley of 
                         the Blue Moon, preserved as if by a 
                         miracle.
                                      
                         The voice of the Lama, toward the last, 
                         seems to fade out. Conway, thoroughly 
                         engrossed, half-consciously waits for 
                         it to continue. Following a protracted 
                         silence, he slowly turns toward the 
                         Lama. A breeze blows through the room, 
                         ruffling curtains on the window.

                         From whose face the glow has faded. 
                         There is nothing left but a dark-shadowed 
                         mask.

                         He stares, uncertainly, for a long while, 
                         with a slow realization that the High 
                         Lama is dead. Quite unaware that he 
                         is being moved emotionally, tears well 
                         up in his eyes. While still sitting 
                         this way, unable to stir, he becomes 
                         conscious of activity around him.

                         As two servants, unbeckoned, arrive 
                         - only to peer, solemn-faced, at the 
                         Lama. Then, in intervals of seconds, 
                         groups of Lamas, hitherto unseen, enter 
                         softly and silently, and gather around 
                         the High Lama. We hear indistinguishable 
                         murmurs that might or might not be prayers. 
                         Conway is only vaguely aware of their 
                         presence - and after a few moments, 
                         scarcely conscious of what is actuating 
                         his movements, he drifts away from the 
                         murmuring Lamas, and walks in the direction 
                         of the door.

                         Barnard and Gloria are on their knees 
                         on the floor. Before them they have 
                         spread a large map or chart. Barnard 
                         is enthusiastically out - lining his 
                         plans.

                         here, and we connect with the main water 
                         line here.

                         to cast pipes out of clay.

                         get your things together. We're leaving.

                         porters. They're going to take us. We've

                         that Chinaman thought he could stop 
                         me. Come along.

                         Home. Away from here. I've got porters 
                         to take us back.

                         Oh, my dear boy, I'm sorry. That's impossible. 
                         Why, I have my classes all started.

                         I don't care what you've got started. 
                         Do you want to go?

                         Well - no - I think I'd better wait. 
                         Yes, yes. I will. I'll wait.

                         You'll wait till you rot!

                         (glowering after him)
                                     
                         Yes.
                                     
                         (does a double-take)

                         Lovett immediately dismisses George 
                         from his mind and his face brightening, 
                         he starts toward Barnard and Gloria.

                         Barney, I've just finished translating 
                         one of the most interesting old tablets 
                         you can imagine. It told me all about 
                         the origin of the Masonic symbols and

                         That's swell, Lovey. I want to show 
                         you something. Look!
                                      
                         He proudly displays his map.

                         to run pipes all through the village
 
                                                              
                         As all three heads go into a huddle.

                         Conway stands in front of a window - 
                         his arms extended across - peering out 
                         moodily. He is watching a solemn and 
                         slow-moving procession of torchlight-bearers 
                         - the funeral rites of the High Lama 
                         - accompanied by cermonial music and 
                         drum-beating.

                         Shooting over his shoulder.
                                     
                         Getting his view of the magisterial 
                         procession.

                         Conway, as he thoughtfully surveys the 
                         surroundings of which he has just become 
                         master.
                                      
                         286. CLOSE SHOT - AT DOOR
                                     
                         George appears in the doorway. He looks 
                         around and espies Conway. For a moment 
                         he stands uncertainly, and finally enters.

                         (softly)

                         As Conway turns - and seeing him, evinces 
                         no emotion whatsoever.
                                      
                         CONWAY
                                     
                         (a murmur)
                                     
                         Hello, George.
                                     
                         George looks at him peculiarly. Conway's 
                         behavior is odd in view of their strained 
                         relationship.
                                      
                         GEORGE
                                     
                         Well, you can stop worrying about everything 
                         now, Bob. I've made arrangements to 
                         leave. If you'll let me close that window, 
                         I can talk to you. That noise is driving 
                         me crazy.
                                      
                         He closes the window.
                                     
                         GEORGE
                                     
                         I said we're getting out of here. Back 
                         to civilization. I made a deal with 
                         the porters. They brought in a load 
                         of books or something, and they're leaving 
                         tomorrow at dawn. They're waiting for 
                         us five miles outside the valley. Come 
                         on, get your things together. Where's 
                         your top coat?

                         Why not? What's going to stop me?

                         You mustn't. You've got to stay here 
                         now.

                         What's the matter with you, Bob? You've 
                         been acting strangely ever since we 
                         came here.
                                      
                         (no response from Conway)
                                     
                         I've never seen you like this. Why can't 
                         we leave? What's stopping us?
                                      
                         Conway combats an impulse to tell him 
                         the whole story.

                         Something I've been searching for all 
                         my life. The answer to the confusion 
                         and bewilderment of a lifetime. I've 
                         found it, George, and I can't leave 
                         it. You mustn't either.

                         I don't know what you're talking about. 
                         You're carrying around a secret that 
                         seems to be eating you up. If you'll 
                         only tell me about it.

                         I will, George. I want to tell you. 
                         I'll burst with it if I don't. It's 
                         weird and fantastical and sometimes 
                         unbelievable, but so beautiful!

                         Well, as you know, we were kidnapped 
                         and brought here . . .

                         As Conway is concluding his story.

                         He died as peacefully as the passing 
                         of a cloud's shadow. His last words 
                         to me were, "I place in your hands, 
                         my son, the future and destiny of Shangri-La." 
                         Now you know why I can't leave.
                                      
                         George listens to him intently, his 
                         face a mask of apprehension. He stares 
                         at his brother for some time and finally 
                         rises and walks around for a few moments.

                         say. Except that you must be completely 
                         mad.

                         that don't happen today. We're living

                         I think you've been hypnotized by a 
                         lot of loose-brained fanatics. Why, 
                         I wouldn't believe it if I heard it 
                         in an English monastery. Why should 
                         I swallow it here in Tibet? How do you 
                         know the things they told you are true? 
                         Did they show you any proof?

                         I knew there was a reason I hated this 
                         place. I'd give half my life to fly 
                         over it with a load of bombs just for 
                         what they've done to you. How do you 
                         know the things they told you are true? 
                         Did they show you any proof? All this 
                         talk about the Lamas being hundreds 
                         of years old. How do you know? Did you 
                         see their birth certificates?

                         I can't believe it, Bob. A bunch of 
                         decrepit old men sit around and dream 
                         about reforming the world. And you,

                         Conway - want to join them. It's horrible.

                         What else could it mean to me? It's 
                         obviously a lot of bunk.

                         Then you'd better go, George. This is 
                         no place for you.

                         Conway looks his extreme amazement.

                         As he says this he jumps to his feet. 
                         George is startled by his tone and manner.

                         Favoring George. He laughs hollowly. 
                         He runs his hand through his hair. He 
                         stares unbelievingly at Conway.

                         I'm not wrong. She told me so. Besides, 
                         she wouldn't have to tell me. I'd know 
                         anyway.

                         After a few seconds Maria appears in

                         Maria's face collapses.

                         She rushes to George and throws her 
                         arms around him.
                                      
                         MARIA
                                     
                         But you promised me! You promised to

                         Over her shoulder George looks victoriously

                         Suddenly Maria wheels on Conway.

                         I'll die if I have to stay here another 
                         minute! I've waited a long time for 
                         this chance to go, and you're not going 
                         to stop me now. If I have to, I'll go 
                         alone. It was I who bribed the porters. 
                         If it weren't for me, you'd never get 
                         out!

                         I thought the porters had instructions 
                         from the High Lama not to take anyone.

                         The High Lama? Who pays any attention 
                         to him? The porters laugh at the High 
                         Lama. All they want to know is how much 
                         gold he will give them. Well, I gave 
                         them more gold. I've been stealing it 
                         for a year. I'd do anything to get out 
                         of this place. To get away from that 
                         High Lama - the one who calls himself 
                         Father Perrault! Why, he's been insane

                         I thought so! He tells everyone I'm 
                         old. He wants them to stay away from 
                         me. He can't stand it when anyone comes 
                         near. He's punished me for every minute 
                         I've spent with George. If it weren't 
                         for him, I would have been out of here 
                         long ago, but he always stops me. Six 
                         months ago, I tried to escape and he 
                         locked me in a dark room. I nearly went 
                         crazy.

                         Look at me, Mr. Conway, do I look like 
                         an old woman? Is this the skin of an 
                         old woman? Look into my eyes and see 
                         if these are the eyes of an old woman?

                         She was kidnapped and brought here two 
                         years ago just as we were, Bob.

                         it. She's lying.

                         You're lying. You're lying! Every word 
                         you've been saying is a lie! Come on, 
                         say it!
                                      
                         He has backed her into a corner and 
                         is nearly throttling her.

                         No, Mr. Conway, I'm not lying. What 
                         reason could I have for lying? The chances 
                         are that we'll never come out of that 
                         horrible trip alive, but I'd rather 
                         die out there in a snowstorm and be 
                         buried alive, than to stay here one 
                         more minute now.

                         name.

                         He hesitates at the opening, looks back 
                         one more time. His eyes show confusion 
                         and defeat. George, ahead, calls out 
                         to him to hurry.

                         on the other side. She cries and weeps, 
                         calling out Conway's name, but he can 
                         no longer be seen.

                         attempt to put up tents, which proves 
                         futile, as a raging snowstorm rips the

                         a ravine. The wind howls.

                         A mountain pass somewhere with a hailstorm 
                         swiping viciously across their faces. 
                         They edge their way pre-cautiously across 
                         a narrow ledge. Suddenly the girl loses 
                         her bearings - slips - screams - and 
                         is caught by Conway just in time to

                         The porters are off in the distance, 
                         leaving them behind.

                         death.

                         An immense silence comes over them. 
                         Conway and George can only stare, dazed 
                         and frightened. The only sound is Maria, 
                         sobbing.

                         A scene in which Conway carries the 
                         girl on his back. George walks behind. 
                         The wind continues to howl.

                         The only illumination comes from the

                         to be small, withered and aged. She 
                         is dead. The men stare at her intently.

                         the cliff behind him - and his eyes 
                         become alert with an idea. His face 
                         lights up with great determination. 
                         He lets out a piteous howl, and breaks 
                         away, racing out of scene.
                                      
                         Conway turns sharply and is horrified.

                         over, and rolls down the mountainside, 
                         until finally he comes to a stop, mounded 
                         by snow. Slowly, he begins to rise and 
                         start again.

                         from the whiteness, feeling his way

                         and jumped ship during night at Singapore. 
                         Am leaving ship myself to overtake him,

                         Determined! Gentlemen, in the whole 
                         course of my life, I have never encountered 
                         anything so grim. During these last 
                         ten months, that man has done the most 
                         astounding things. He learned how to 
                         fly, stole an army plane and got caught, 
                         put into jail, escaped . . . all in 
                         an amazingly short space of time. But 
                         this was only the beginning of his adventures.

                         He begged, cajoled, fought, always pushing 
                         forward to the Tibetan frontier. Everywhere 
                         I went, I heard the most amazing stories 
                         of the man's adventures. Positively 
                         astounding. Until eventually, I trailed 
                         him to the most extreme outpost in Tibet.

                         memory - ah - his memory will live with 
                         those natives for the rest of their 
                         lives. The Man Who Was Not Human, they 
                         called him. They'll never forget the 
                         devil-eyed stranger who six times tried 
                         to go over a mountain pass where no 
                         other human being dared to travel, and 
                         six times was forced back by the severest 
                         storms. They'll never forget the madman 
                         who stole their food and clothing - 
                         whom they locked up in their barracks 
                         - but who fought six of their guards 
                         to escape.

                         and shuddering at the memory. He led 
                         them the wildest chase through their 
                         own country, and finally he disappeared 
                         over that very mountain pass that they

                         Do you believe it?

CHAPTER 1: Earth 2058
---------------------


FADE IN ON:

EXT.-SPACE

PULL BACK slowly as MARS fills THE FRAME, a sphere of red desert and
fast rushing crimson clouds.

A triangular CARGO SHIP descends from the dark of space.

                      PILOT (OVER)

          Mars mining base, this is Grissom One,
          Request final descent vector.

REVERSE ANGLE

EXT.-MARS

A row of giant red mountains and beneath, on the planet's surface, the
spires of A MINING BASE. Illuminated landing crosshairs alight a
landing pad, beckoning the ship.

                      CONTROLLER (OVER)

          Roger, Grissom One, this is Mars
          Mining, You are cleared to land. Hope
          you got some Partagas in that rust
          bucket, Sal.

EXT.-EDGE OF SPACE

THE CARGO SHIP changes attitude, landing thrusters FIRING as the
vessel begins to penetrate the atmosphere.

                      PILOT

          I brought you the most amazing...

Amazing, what, we'll never know. The CARGO SHIP begins to EXPLODE, the
bubble bridge BLOWING out into space in a ball of fire.

EXT.- MARS

LOW ANGLE from the planet's surface-. Two shapes BLAST through FRAME,
BUBBLE FIGHTERS, single pilot, transparent globes, racing up towards
the sudden star of the cargo ship at impossible speed.

INT.-BUBBLE FIGHTER

POV of the burning Cargo Ship, coming towards us incredibly fast.
Speed, trajectory and tactical readouts flash.

EXT.-CARGO SHIP

The pulse lasers are still hammering the ravaged hull.

WIDER

Two sinister ATTACK SHIPS, their lasers locked onto the Cargo Ship,
FIRE away as they BLAST overhead. The nuclear core of the Cargo Ship
overloads, the craft finally EXPLODING in a storm of fire.

A BUBBLE FIGHTER ROARS through the hurling world of flame. PUSH IN.

INT.-BUBBLE FIGHTER

A lone FIGURE stands in a gyroscopic harness, working a heads-up
holographic display, command controls spinning 360 degrees with the
pilot's Comas the fighter SCREAMS after the fleeing raider.

The harness spins, the pilot coming clearly into view. Handsome,
intense, reckless eyes. MAJOR DON WEST.

                      WEST

          Sino-Jordanian Raiders. They're
          claiming the cargo ship violated
          their air-space.

INT.-SECOND BUBBLE FIGHTER

Another pilot (JEB WALKER) commands an identical craft, ROCKETING
towards the assault craft just below West's.

                      JEB

          This cold war's heating up. Where did
          they come from?

INT.-WEST'S BUBBLE FIGHTER

                      WEST

          Hell. And we're going to send them
          back screaming.

West activates his targeting computer.

                      WEST

          Last one to kill a bad guy buys the
          beer.

TARGETING DISPLAY-CLOSE. The fleeing Attack Ship jogs in and out of
the crosshairs on West's holographic array. West fires.

EXT.-SPACE

The Attack Ship SHOOTS straight up, dodging West's laser BLASTS.

INT.-WEST'S BUBBLE FIGHTER

West closes on the fleeing craft, as Jeb engages the other Attack
Ship, lasers FIRING in the b.g., visible through the transparent
surface of the bubble glass under West's feet.

                      WEST

          What's that sound? must be the fat lady
          warming up.

EXT.-SPACE

The fleeing Attack Ship loops in mid-space, reversing direction,
heading straight towards West's Bubble Fighter. A game of chicken.

INT.-WEST'S BUBBLE FIGHTER

West doesn't flinch. Bears down, FIRING madly, the two space ships
heading straight for each other.

                      WEST

          That's right. Come on, come on, you wanna
          play, I wanna play.

EXT.-SPACE

The two ships are ROCKETING towards each other, locked in collision
vectors, lasers FIRING wildly.              asdasd

INT.-WEST'S FIGHTER

                      WEST

          I can hear her. Oh, yes, oh yes. She's
          gonna sing.

TARGETING:DISPLAY-CLOSE. The Attack Ship flashes, captured in the
targeting hatchmarks. The display expands into a tactical grid.

                      COMPUTER

          Target lock.

EXT.-SPACE

Imminent collision.

INT.-WEST'S FIGHTER

The hull of the Attack Ship fills his bubble glass.

                      WEST

          The lights are dimming. The curtain's
          coming down. Sing you fat, old bag,
          sing!

West hits the firing stud.

EXT.-DEEP SPACE

West's pulse lasers converge on the Attack Ship barely meters ahead,
the ROARING craft EXPLODING directly before him.

INT.-WEST'S BUBBLE FIGHTER

(OVER) WEST SCREAMS as he shoots through the sudden conflagration of
flame and debris, everywhere and then gone, giving way to the
blackness of space and the starfield beyond.

                      WEST

          Show's over.

Below, the second Attack Ship ROARS past, lasers FIRING, locked in a
pinwheel battle with Jeb's Bubble Fighter.

EXT.-SPACE

JEB'S BUBBLE FIGHTER banks, avoiding the high energy volley. Almost. A
laser BURST grazes his Bubble Fighter, the surface of his craft
sparking, suddenly scored with flames.

INT.-JEB'S CRAFT

The Attack ship is right behind him.

                      JEB

          Weapons are off line. Jettisoning main
          drive core.

EXT.-SPACE

The thruster core of Jeb's Bubble Fighter BLOWS off in a bolus of
flame, soaring back into the pursuit craft. The Raider EXPLODES.

INT.-JEB'S CRAFT

Controls are sparking. Displays flicker. (OVER) An ALARM sounds.

                      COMPUTER

          Warning. Failure in redundant drive systems.

JEB-POV. The surface of Mars is rushing up fast.

Jeb's ship is barreling toward the planet.

                      JEB (OVER)

INT.-WEST'S FIGHTER

                      JEB (ON RADIO)

          assistance. Repeat...

          Ranger One this is Grissom Base.
          Rescue craft have been dispatched.

          Impact in 60 seconds.

Mars fills the view screen.


INT.-WEST'S CRAFT

The rescue craft are speeding toward Jeb's fighter below.

                      WEST

          Grissom, this is Eagle One. Those Pugs
          Will never reach him in time.

                      BASE (ON RADIO)

          Eagle one clear this frequency and
          return to base.

DON takes a beat. Then he spins his chair towards Mars, begins working
the controls.

                      WEST

          This is Eagle One. I'm going after
          him.

                      BASE (OVER)

          Negative Eagle one, your craft is not
          equipped

West hits his thrusters.

EXT.-SPACE

West's craft dives toward Jeb's ship and Mars below.

INT.-JEB'S FIGHTER

Mars is coming up fast.

                      JEB

          Don?

                      WEST (OVER)

          It's a yes or no question.

Mars fills the windscreen. Jeb checks his status display.

                      JEB

          Marginal. But in the green.

          What are you doing?

                      WEST (OVER)

          Saving your ass. Read towards the
          canals. Now!

The canal streaked face of the Mars is all Jeb can see. He grabs his
throttle, engages his navigational thrusters and pulls.

EXT.-JEB'S SHIP

A tiny directional thruster FIRES, angling Jeb's craft so that it
scrapes the surface of Mars and dives into a giant canal, rocky walls
rushing up fast.

INT.-WEST'S SHIP

West is accelerating toward Jeb.

                      BASE (OVER)

          Major West, your ship is not equipped
          for rescue. You are not authorized to
          jeopardize this asset. That is
          a direct order. Acknowledge!

West slams a switch, deactivating his radio.

                      WEST

          Never liked that station, anyway.

He BLASTS into the canal, walls rushing up on either side of him.

EXT.-MARTIAN CANAL

Jeb's tiny craft is plunging toward the rocky crater floor below.

Overhead West's fighter appears, under full thrusters, roaring towards
the crater floor faster and at a sharper angle.

INT.-3EB'S FIGHTER

The canal floor is rushing up fast.

                      COMPUTER

          Impact in five seconds.

INT.-WEST'S FIGHTER

Don is blasting toward the canal floor, almost as if trying to beat
Jeb's ship to a fiery impact below.

                      COMPUTER

          Warning. Proximity alert.

                      WEST

          Jeb, I'm going to give you a little
          kiss. Don't take it the wrong way.

EXT.-MARTIAN CANAL

West angles his ship directly under Jeb.

INT.-JEB'S FIGHTER

The expanding surface of Mars, visible beneath his feet, is suddenly
obscured by Don's fighter, swooping under his ship.

                      JEB

          Don, abort. Abort.

INT.-WEST'S FIGHTER

Jeb's fighter is visible overhead.

West going up. Don angles the throttle.

EXT.-MARTIAN CANAL

Don's ship, sandwiched between the surface of Mars and Jeb's fighter,
angles up and, like a cue ball hitting it's target, Knocks Jeb's ship
spinning toward the safety of space beyond. West's ship actually
scrapes the surface of the planet, sending up a plume of Martian dust.

INT.-WEST'S FIGHTER

                      JEB (OVER)

          Does this mean we're going steady?

West pulls his throttle all the way back.

EXT.-MARTIAN CANAL

West shoots up and out towards the dark of space.

                      WEST (OVER)

          You weren't getting out of buying
          those beers that easy.

The rescue craft converge on Jeb's ship as Don heads for base.

PULL BACK TO REVEAL

WILL ROBINSON (10) hides in a small space, watching the commercial on
a jury-rigged, palm-sized computer. He mimics the Naylrator.

                     WILL

          Coke. Saving the world for our
          children.

          (a beat)

          Give me a hi-test break.

WILL-POV. Spying through the open slats of his biding place into...

INT:-LIVING ROOM-AFTERNOON

Basic twenty first century modern. MAUREEN ROBINSON stands, talking
with a PRINCIPAL who in less than happy.

                     PRINCIPAL

          He hacked our main power grid to run
          his experiment. The school was in
          chaos. We didn't even have lights.

The room lights suddenly dim. The Principal flickers, revealed as a
holograph, her head now sitting on Schwartzenegger body.

Maureen LAUGHS, then realizes the Principal has no idea her image is
being distorted. Maureen begins moving about the room, surreptitiously
glancing behind couches, into cabinets.

                     PRINCIPAL (OVER)

          This is no laughing matter, Mrs.
          Robinson. Will is terribly gifted. His
          little time machines, though pure
          fancy, are the products of a truly
          brilliant mind.

The Principal's body has become Twiggy's. Now that of an ape. Maureen
pulls open a closet. Will sits inside. Grins.

                     WILL

          The changing shape of education.

                     MAUREEN

          No more monkey business.

Will shrugs, adjusts his deck. The Principal returns to normal.

                     PRINCIPAL

          The boy is starved for attention. Was
          there no way his father could have
          attended the science fair?

EXT.-HOUSTON - DAY

Probably Austin and Dallas too. Texas has become a giant urban sprawl
spreading into Mexico and beyond. Immense industrial air purifiers
hang in a dark, wet sky.

EXT.-HOUSTON SPACE COMMAND-ESTABLISHING

A giant dome topped pedestal towers ever the skyline.

INT.-SPACE COMMAND-MISSION CONTROL-DAY

A MAN stands before a large viewscreen facing the throng of PRESS.

He's a little uncomfortable with all the media attention. This is
PROFESSOR JOHN ROBINSON.

                     JOHN

          Once we have landed on Alpha Prime our
          on board robot will begin construction
          of a hypergate.

ON SCREEN a hi-tech orbital gate is highlighted and expanded.

                     JOHN

          By then, technicians here on Earth
          will have completed a companion
          hypergate in our planet's orbit.

ON SCREEN an image of an orbital gate now under construction.

                     JOHN

          Once both gates are complete, ships
          will be able to pass instantaneously
          between them. The Jupiter can bring
          the Dimondium back to Earth without
          the ten year delay of a return trip.

                     REPORTER

          Why can't you just use the Jupiter's
          hyperengine to zap straight to Alpha
          Prime?

                     JOHN

          As you know, hyperspace exists beneath
          normal space. If you try to enter
          hyperspace without a gate

ON SCREEN a graphic spaceship appears randomly in the corner of a
turning schematic of the galaxy.

                     JOHN

          Your exit vector is random. There's no
          telling where you'd come out.

                     REPORTER

          Professor, how is Captain Daniels
          recovering from the flu? Will we still
          be able to pilot the mission?

John glances to the doorway where a uniformed GENERAL stands.

                     GENERAL

          Ladies and Gentlemen, you came to get
          a look at the Jupiter One. Don't you
          think you've waited long enough?

John hits a button and the room darkens. A giant monitor reveals...

INT.-LAUNCH DOME

A giant saucer sits connected to its launch pad by loading belts,
steaming fuel tubes and spindled gantries.

                     REPORTER (OVER)

          Professor, how does your family feel
          about leaving the Earth behind....

                     JOHN (OVER)

          They couldn't be more excited.

CHAPTER 3: Goodbye!
-------------------


EXT.-ROBINSON HOUSE-ESTABLISHING

A suburban colonial, the launch dome towering in the distance.

                      PENNY (OVER)

          This whole mission sucks!

INT.-ROBINSON HOME HALLWAY-SUNSET

PENNY ROBINSON (14) furious, turns, looks downstairs at Maureen.

                      PENNY

          I Don't want to stay home for dinner.
          I want to see my friends for the last
          time.

She takes a beat, blinking away the tears. Lifts her wrist and turns
on a video camera watch. She begins down the hall.

VIDEO-POV. Penny's face in the monitor screen.

                      PENNY

          ... On the eve before she is torn from
          her friends, kidnapped, hurled into
          deep space against her will, what
          thoughts fill the mind of the young
          Space Captive....

INT.-WILL'S ROOM-SUNSET

Penny enters a strewn, boy' a world. Will is trying to select items to
place in a single packing canister marked: PERSONAL CARGO.

                      WILL

          Will there be boys on Alpha Centuri?
          What will I wear?

                      PENNY

          When we wake up in ten years the video
          journals of Penny Robinson, Space
          Captive, will be devoured by millions.
          I will be world famous. You on the
          other hand, will have been totally
          forgotten.

Penny shows the camera her arm, covered by strings of ribbons.

                      PENNY

          The Space Captive has decided to wear
          ribbons of support for fellow
          sufferers as she is dragged into deep
          space, green for the ecological
          issues, white for human rights

                      WILL

          You'd probably gag if I described the
          secondary infections loss of
          circulation can cause.

Penny seems about to speak, instead just smiles, goes to his bed and
pulls off the sheets, begins knotting them together.

                      WILL

          What are you grinning at?

                      PENNY

          I just found an upside to this
          mission. The thought of jettisoning
          your body into deep space.

Penny knots the sheets into a rope, ties it to the bed-post. Will
lifts several palm-sized gold-plated stars. Each reads: 1st prize.

                      WILL

          Dad says Don't bring them. Like
          anything I do matters to him.

                      PENNY

          He never showed, huh?

                      WILL


          Maybe if I had actually broken the
          time barrier he would have paid
          attention.

                      PENNY

          Don't let him get to you, kiddo. He
          just gets busy with work is all.

Penny tosses the rope out the window, prepares to climb.

                      WILL

          So, that's a no to family dinner?

                      PENNY

          Let's see, do I spend my last night on
          Earth watching Mom and Dad pretend not
          to be fighting again or get in ten
          years of making-out at the mall ...
          you do the math.

                      WILL

          Mom's gonna go thermal.

                      PENNY

          What's she gonna do. Ground me?

CHAPTER 4: Major West

INT.-SPACE COMMAND-CORRIDOR

John and the General walk the metal passageway.

                      JOHN

          We're lucky they didn't press on
          Daniels, condition.

                      GENERAL

          I figured a chance to look at the ship
          would keep the dogs at bay.

                      JOHN

          Ben, I'm worried about jamming in a
          replacement pilot at the last second.
          My family' a on this mission. I need
          someone who's more than just spit and
          polish.

                      GENERAL

          I've got your man. He just doesn't
          know it yet.

The General palms an access panel. A door hisses open to reveal...

INT.-SPACE COMMAND- CONFERENCE ROOM-CONTINUOUS

A figure stands staring silently out the window. Don West. He offers a
salute. By his eyes, West is clearly agitated.

                      GENERAL

          At ease, Major.

                      WEST

          Sir, why was I pulled off active duty?
          I salvaged my craft and Jeb's. I'll
          fight a court martial, General.

                      GENERAL

          Do you know Professor Robinson?

                      WEST

          By reputation only.

          (to John)

          Your father's battle strategies were
          required reading at the Academy.

                      GENERAL

          How much do you know about the Jupiter
          Mission, Major?

                      WEST

          The Jupiter is fully automated. The
          pilot flies the ship out of the solar
          system and lands on Alpha Prime. It's
          a baby sitting job, sir.

                      GENERAL

          Major, you are aware Earth's resources
          are severely limited.

                      WEST

          Every schoolchild knows our recycling
          technologies will save the
          environment. Sending a family across
          the galaxy is a publicity stunt to
          sell soda to people of all ages.

                      GENERAL

          What I am about to tell you is
          classified. Every schoolchild
          has been lied to. The recycling
          technologies have failed. In
          less than two decades Earth will be
          unable to support human life.

                      GENERAL

          We spun the ad campaign to give the
          mission a friendly face, keep people
          from panicking in the streets. We
          partnered with Coke because the 900
          billion this mission cost would have
          bankrupted the government. The
          SinoJordanian Alliance knows the truth
          as well as we do. They hope to reach
          Alpha Prime first - And if they do,
          I guarantee you, they will not share
          the Dimondium with Western Demons like
          us. our crops will wither. We will be
          left to die.

                      WEST

          ...Captain Daniels doesn't have the
          flu, does he sir?

                      GENERAL

          Daniels was murdered in his apartment
          last night. The flu story is a cover
          we fed the press.

                      WEST

          Dan was a good pilot. A good man.

                      GENERAL

          Your rescue stunt over Mars was
          foolhardy. Explain yourself, Major.

                      WEST

          I had a friend in trouble.

                      GENERAL

          You endangered a one billion dollar
          spacecraft, disobeyed a direct order
          because of a friend?

                      WEST

          Yes sir. And I'd do it again. Sir.

                      JOHN

          He'll do.

          (stepping forward)

                      GENERAL

          Congratulations Major, you're the new
          pilot of the Jupiter mission.

CHAPTER 5: Dr. Smith
--------------------


EXT.-DESERT-DAY

Sun beats hard on a MAN who stands on a windswept sand dune, talking
to a smartly dressed BUSINESSMAN.

                      MAN

          Perhaps a brief jaunt down memory
          lane is required. I was contracted
          to provide Daniels, apartment code.
          My work is done.

                      BUSINESSMAN

          They found a replacement pilot, the
          mission is going ahead on schedule.

                      MAN

          How tragic. For you.

                      BUSINESSMAN

          We require more direct intervention.

                      MAN

          I see. Well, that will cost you. And,
          I'm afraid my price has just become
          ... astronomical.

(OVER) a KNOCK. The man reaches forward and presses a button. The
businessman, the desert disappear, only holographs.

Room lights.

Lights come up to reveal...

INT.-MISSION CONTROL-MEDICAL LABS

The man turns, revealing a face as clever an his eyes are evil. This
is DR. ZACHARY SMITH. He walks to the door, palms a panel, and the
portal hiss open. A TECHNICIAN ENTERS.

                      TECHNICIAN

          Control hasn't received the results
          of your final pre-flight exams,
          Doctor Smith.

The Doctor moves to a circular overhead light board around which are
displayed the faces of the crew of the Jupiter craft. Removes the
micro-files, hands them to the technician.

                      SMITH

          The Robinsons are checked out at one
          hundred percent. They are in perfect
          condition and ready to fly.

He smiles, so sweet you can barely see the malevolence behind it.

                      SMITH

          Wish them good luck for me.

CHAPTER 6: Welcome Aboard!
--------------------------


INT.-SPACE COMMAND-WALKING

Three small figures walk through a gantry towards the ship.

                      GENERAL (OVER)

          The mission protocols are simple.
          Professor Robinson is in command
          unless you encounter a military
          emergency. In that case, Major West,
          you will assume command.

The figures have come to the saucer entry-port.

                      JOHN (OVER)

          Welcome aboard, Major.

INT.-JUPITER BRIDGE - CONTINUOUS

Don, John, and the General ENTER. Don's eyes widen.

West looks like somebody sprung for the full extras package on this
baby.

REVERSE ANGLE

Hi-tech heaven. Two pilots, chairs face a giant windscreen. Don walks
to the consoles that stretch toward the back walls.

                      JOHN

          Some of this technology might be new
          to you. I'll be happy to explain.

                      WEST

          Cold fusion drive

          (off the size consoles)

          Rambler-Krey Life Sciences stations.

Don strides to a pedestal in the center of the bridge. Flicks a switch
and a holographic Jupiter craft appears on the launch pad.

                      WEST

          Holographic navigational interface.

Don points to a row of man-sized glass cylinders on the back wall.

                      WEST

          Cryosleep array. Fully monitored.

He approaches the blast doors that lead off the back of the bridge.

                      WEST

          Sick bay, remote Ops, engineering and
          living quarters are below decks.
          Hyperengine should be in here.

Don hits a wall panel which opens to reveal an immense ENGINE ROOM.

                      JOHN

          If you have to baby sit, it's not
          such a bad nursery, wouldn't you
          agree, Major?

Just then the ELEVATOR rises from the lower decks. On its circular
platform stands a DOCTOR in a lab coat. She walks to the General.

                      DOCTOR

          The cryosleep systems are running at
          ninety five percent.

                      GENERAL

          Doctor Smith approved the specs-

                      DOCTOR

          Doctor Smith is base physician. I am
          responsible once this ship is in
          flight. These tubes have to keep the
          crew in suspended animation for ten
          years. They will be perfect or this
          ship will not launch. Is that clear?

                      GENERAL

          Absolutely, Doctor.

                      JOHN

          Judy, I'd like you to meet Major
          West. He's taking Mike's place.

                      DOCTOR

          He's heavier than Mike. We'll have to
          re-calibrate.

                      WEST

          I'd be more than happy to discuss my
          dimensions perhaps over dinner?

                      DOCTOR

          West - I've read about you. Something
          of a war hero, aren't you?

                      WEST

          (preening )

          Well, yes, actually.

                      DOCTOR

          Those who can't think, fight.

          (a freezing smile)

          Well, nice to have met you.

She heads toward the readouts. West turns to John.

                      WEST

          That's one cold fish I'd love to
          thaw.

                      JUDY

          (turning)

          I'm not going to make it home for
          dinner, Dad.

West turns to John. Dad?

                      WEST

          It's going to be a long flight.

EXT.-ROBINSON HOME-NIGHT

Lights burn in the windows.

INT.-ROBINSON HOME-DINING ROOM-NIGHT

John ENTERS to find the remains of an elegant dinner on the table,
candles never lit, food never eaten.

John crosses to a small scale model sitting on the table. Around it
hangs another gold plated 1st prize star. He smiles.

                      MAUREEN (OVER)

          He won first prize again. He
          practically brought down his entire
          school. But he won first prize.

Maureen descends the steps in a bathrobe. Joins John.

                      JOHN

          A non-working prototype for his time
          machine. Sharp stuff for a midget.

Maureen is silent.

                      JOHN

          I'm sorry about dinner. I had to work
          late. The new pilot-.

                      MAUREEN

          What you had to do was prioritize
          your family over the mission

                      JOHN

          Maureen. This mission is about our
          family. So we can stay together

                      MAUREEN

          The perfect nuclear family. The most
          stable social unit, ideally suited
          for the isolation of a long journey
          into space. It's all just PR, John.
          You're never home. Judy is
          becoming a ghost just like you. Penny
          can't see past her own navel and Will
          has to black out-his school, just to
          get his father's attention. The
          perfect nuclear family in ruin.

John stares at his wife. Then he reaches forward, touches her hair.

                      JOHN

          I know, Maureen. I'm scared too.

A beat. Then she moves to him. And he holds her close.

INT.-ROBINSON HOME-WILL'S ROOM-NIGHT

John stands in the yellow wedge of hall light. He touches something
hanging around his own neck. A pair of metal dog tags.

WIDER

Will lies in his bed, eyes closed. Asleep. A beat. John turns, heading
out into the hall.

EXT.-ROBINSON HOME-NIGHT

The bedroom lights go out, a normal home against the backdrop of the
launch dome towering in the distance.

INT.-SPACE COMMAND-LAUNCH DOME-NIGHT

The Jupiter one stands amidst loading gantries, final supplies rolling
into the
ship on automated conveyer belts and lifts.

CHAPTER 7: Primary Directives
-----------------------------


PAN DOWN

TWO TECHNICIANS stand checking off supplies on a lightpad.

                      LOADING TECHNICIAN

          Anything else?

                      LOADING TECHNICIAN #2

          I'm showing a late shipment from
          Mission Medical. Smith's
          authorization. Here it is now.

HOLD on a canister that reads: BIOLOGICAL MATERIALS: Do Not Open, as
it passes on the loading belt. FOLLOW THE DRUM as it winds along the
conveyer, up a gantry towards the Jupiter One. PUSH IN...

INT. -CARGO DRUM

Smith sits crouched inside, cleaning his nails.

INT.-JUPITER ONE-LOWER DECKS

A giant robot stands attached to its service bay. Still. Silent.

A SERVICE DRAWER slides open and a shadowy infiltrator emerges, his
face visible in the dim service light. Smith.

Smith approaches the docked Robot, places a small keypad device on the
Robot's dormant CPU panel. Smith activates the device.

                      SMITH

          You'll forgive me if I forgo the
          kiss, my sleeping behemoth.

Smith hits a switch on the panel and the Robot's system indicators
light into life. Smith types several keys on the keypad.

                      SMITH

          But the time has come to awake.

                      ROBOT

          Robot is on-line. Reviewing primary
          directives. One, preserve the
          Robinson Family. Two, Maintain ship
          systems. Three

                      SMITH

          Spare me the chatter.

Smith taps the keypad. The Robot is silenced. Smith types again.

                      SMITH

          What noble charges my steely
          centurion. Sadly I fear you have far
          more dire deeds in store for you.

Smith completes his re-programming. Hits a switch.

                      ROBOT

          Robot is on-line. Reviewing primary
          directives. Two hours into mission
          destroy Robinson family. Destroy all
          systems.

Smith smiles. Removes the re-programming module.

                      SMITH

          Now that's more like it. Farewell my
          tin-plated pal. Give my regards to
          oblivion.

Smith climbs into a chute marked WASTE DISPOSAL.

INT.-WASTE DISPOSAL CHUTE

Smith begins crawling down the chute. His tiny reprogramming module
BEEPS. Smith activates a tiny, built in com-link.

From the mic, the familiar visage of the Businessman is projected into
the crawlspace over Smith's face.

                      SMITH

          I told you never to call me here.

                      BUSINESSMAN

          I see you have completed your mission
          on schedule Good work, Doctor. And
          goodbye.

The Businessman smiles. SMITH-CLOSE. Puzzled.

Suddenly the tiny module in his hand OVERLOADS, the flesh on his palm
smoking as Smith is engulfed in an electrical charge. He goes out, his
body perfectly still.

CHAPTER 8: Launch!
------------------


EXT.-SPACE COMMAND-MORNING

The giant dome shines in the early sun.

INT-JUPITER ONE  John and Maureen face will and Penny who stand now in
their freezing tubes. All  wear silver flight suits. Maureen moves
Penny's hair from in front of her face.

                      PENNY

          Don't, mom. Vogue says this will be
          the style in ten years.

                      WILL

          Will she wake up less annoying?

                      PENNY

          Does he have to wake up at all?

                      MAUREEN

          Alright you two, enough.

Maureen kisses her children. John moves to will who reaches to shake
at the same moment John tries to hug him. A beat. Then John tries to a
shake as Will goes for the hug. A total miss. Will backs into his
tube.

                      MAUREEN

          You get a C in paternal expression,
          Professor. But an A for effort.

John kisses his wife, already in her tube.

                      MAUREEN

          You always get an A in that.

                      JUDY

          Don't let me shatter this unbridled
          display of affection, but we are
          running behind.

                      JOHN

          (entering his tube)

          Major, she's all yours.

                      WEST

          I'll try to give you a smooth ride.

Judy walks the row, checking their bio-monitors. Enters her tube.

                      JUDY

          Mission control this is Dr. Robinson.
          We are in the green.

Don walks to Judy's tube.

                      WEST

          One question, Doctor. in there room
          in these tubes for two?

                      JUDY

          Barely enough for you and your ego,
          Major. Drive carefully.

              (touches her com-link)

          initializing cryostasis tubes.

The tubes rotate closed around the Robinsons. Suddenly each crew
member is surrounded by a shimmering blue glow, brightening like a
star and then subsiding. All stand fixed in suspended animation.

Don stares at the family a beat. He goes to the main console. Straps
himself in.

                      WEST

          Mission Control, this is Jupiter One.
          The Robinsons are asleep. We are
          ready to fly.

INT.-SPACE COMMAND-MISSION CONTROL

Welcome to the future. Banks of monitors manned by gum-chewing, pink
haired technicians. A giant monitor shows the Jupiter on the launch
pad. The CONTROLLER (NOAH FREEMAN) pulls in to his console.

EXT. JUPITER ONE

The atomic power source fires a focused BLAST, shooting the Jupiter
through cloud and sky towards the black edge of space.

INT:-MISSION CONTROL

The main screen shows a graphic of the Jupiter's trajectory as the
ship arcs toward the outer edge of the atmosphere.

                      NOAH

CHAPTER 9: Destroy!
-------------------


INT.-JUPITER TWO-WASTE DISPOSAL CHUTE-LATER

Smith lies still. He starts from a nightmare into...-a nightmare

INT.-JUPITER TWO-LOWER DECKS

Smith scrambles out of the chute, stares at his hand, the impression
of the overloaded communicator seared into his palm.

He spins around disoriented. Stumbles to a closed view screen and hits
a stud. The blast shield opens. Space.

SMITH-CLOSE. Shock. No words.

THE ROBOT-CLOSE. In his docking bay. Suddenly the automaton powers up,
lights activating as his CPU comes on line.

                      SMITH

          No.

Smith turns, slaps the burned out programming module on the Robot.

                      SMITH

          Disable program.

No response. The Robot continues to power up.

Smith engage interface. Initiate system shut-down.

                      ROBOT

          Robot is on line. Implementing prime
          command directives.

The Robot disengages from the service bay, begins rolling forward.

                      ROBOT

          Robinson family, destroy.

                      SMITH

          No. Cease. Desist.

The Robot rolls towards the bridge.

                      ROBOT

          All operating Systems, destroy.

Smith grabs a wrench from a tool bracket, leaps for the Robot. The
Robot swings once, sending Smith flying into a flaring console.

                      ROBOT

          Jupiter Two, destroy.

INT.-MISSION CONTROL-NIGHT

Dark. A single Techie (ANNIE) mans the watch, playing holo-games with
a stylus over her desk. SCREENS flicker into life.

                      ANNIE

          What the-?

          (into a mic)

          Somebody wake up the chief.

INT.-JUPITER TWO-BRIDGE

Still. The bridge doors open and the ambient lights come on.

The Robot rolls onto the bridge, faces the cryosleep array. He extends
his arms, an electrical charge arcing between his claws.

                      ROBOT

          Robinson Family, destroy.

He fires, a blast of electricity hitting the cryosleep controls.
(OVER) ALARMS sound as the tubes begin to descend, electricity
sparking across the sleeping Robinsons.

                      SMITH (OVER)

          Mechanical moron. You'll kill us all.

Smith, wrench in hand, rushes the Robot, is again hurled across the
room. The Robot turns towards the navigational computer.

INT.-MISSION CONTROL

Fully lit. All the monitors are manned by sleepy Techies. Noah ENTERS,
taking a coffee from Annie without breaking stride. , ALARMS flash
everywhere.

                      NOAH

          This mission's over. Wake them up.

The Techies begins working the controls.

                      ANNIE

          No response, sir. I'm sorry.

INT.-JUPITER TWO

The Robot is facing the navigational holograph in the center of the
bridge. The electricity arcs between his claws once again.

                      ROBOT

          Operating systems, Destroy.

Smith is slumped against the bulkhead. He shakes off his fall in time
to see the Robot fire at the navigational array, the holograph
disappearing in the flames of the exploding pedestal.

EXT.-JUPITER TWO

The ship begins to veer off course, falling towards the sun.

INT.JUPITER TWO

The Robot is rolling toward the com.

THE FREEZING TUBES are quickly being engulfed in flames. Smith
stumbles toward their control station. Begins typing madly.

                      SMITH

          Wake up, damn you. I can't stop this
          infernal contraption on my own.

He SMASHES a glass panel that reads EMERGENCY DEACTIVATE. The figures
inside the lowering tubes glow. All except Judy.

The Robot is before the Com, electricity arcing between his claws.

                      SMITH

          (off the tubes)

          Hurry up. Hurry up.

The Robot FIRES at the main Com, controls EXPLODING everywhere. The
freezing tubes begin to open, the Robot spinning to face them.

John blinks to life first. Emerges, ducking a BLAST of electrical
energy from the Robot, hitting the deck and rolling.

                      JOHN

          Maureen. The children.

Maureen grabs Will and Penny, pulls them down just as the Robot blows
away their tubes.

John pulls a laser pistol from a wall mount.

                      JOHN

          Disengage safety.

                      GUN

          Voiceprint confirmed.

The Robot spins towards John, FIRES an electrical charge - John dodges
at the last instant, the grazing blast burning his silvery suit,
singeing his side, sending into the wall, his gun flying.

                      WILL

          Dad!

Will ducks under his mother's arm, scrambles across the bridge.

                      MAUREEN

          Will, wait.

The Robot FIRES at the scrambling boy but misses, Will disappearing
down the gunny hatch leading to the lower decks.

DON leaps from his tube atop the Robot's back, trying to grab the
Robot's power source. The mechanical monster electrifies his shell,
sending the Major flying.

The Robot turns to Penny and Maureen. Extends his arms toward them.

Electricity arcing between his claws. The two are done for. Maureen
puts her hand over Penny's eyes.

                      MAUREEN

          Look away, baby.

The Robot is about to fire. Suddenly the Robot freezes, his claws
deactivate, his power lights go to stand-by and he stands immobile.

WIDER. Will stands in the b.g., his tiny hacking deck in his hands.

                      WILL

          Robot. Return to your docking bay and
          power down.

                      ROBOT

          Command accepted.

The Robot turns and begins heading for the elevator. All watch in
amazement. Will grins, a familiar mischievous gleam in his eyes.

                      WILL

          If the family won't come to the
          science fair, bring the science fair
          to the family.

An EXPLOSION rocks the ship.

                      PENNY (OVER)

          Mom, look, it's Doctor Smith.

Penny stands over Smith who lays crumpled in the corner. Maureen grabs
an emergency medi-kit from a wall clamp, tosses it to Penny.

                      MAUREEN

          Pulse, respiration and bleeding-

          NEXT picnic, no robots.

Don moves fast to the helm. The main view screen is still closed,
covered by giant metal blast shields.

                      WEST

          Communications links are down.

Maureen is at the life sciences console.

Penny in working ever Smith, bandaging his head. She runs stimulator
under his nose. Smith begins to stir, COUGHING.

                      PENNY

          I've got life signs.

          (wincing)

          Boy, somebody could use a breath
          mint.

West turns, spots Smith for the first time.

                      WEST

          (to John)

          Try the emergency back-ups.

Don moves to the fallen figure, lifts him up against the bulkhead.

          Smith, what the hell-

                      SMITH

          I was making a last minute check ...
          someone hit me from behind.

Don almost buys it. Then he notices Smith's hand, grabs it.

BURN-CLOSE. The reprogramming module's distinctive, foreign signature
seared into his flesh.

                      WEST

          Sino-Jordanian technology. You're a
          Goddamned spy.

          (realizing)

          You did this.

Don slams him against the bulkhead, begins dragging him towards the
airlock. The pilot hits a switch. The inner hatch opens.

                      SMITH

          Stop. What are you doing?

                      WEST

          get her out. She's dying.

Smith uses the distraction to palm-slam Don in the chin, knocking him
backwards. Don staggers, goes again for Smith.

                      SMITH

          Touch me and the girl dies.

Don freezes in his tracks.

                      SMITH

          Your mission physician is indisposed.
          I can save her life. But only if you
          spare mine.

                      WEST

          I Don't deal with dead men.

                      SMITH

          Kill me, I kill the girl. How much is
          your revenge worth, Major? I will, of
          course, need your word as an officer
          that you will let me live.

Don's decision is lighting fast.

                      WEST

          Help her.

                      JOHN

          I've got a com signal.

Suddenly the radio SQUAWKS into life.

                      RADIO

          ...Is Mission Control. Do you read?
          Jupiter Two this is

                      JOHN

          Emergency power's on line. I think I
          can get these blast shields open.

VIEWSCREEN CLOSE. The blast shields part to reveal a giant fiery orb
in their path. They are heading directly for the sun.

          Uh-oh.

INT.-MISSION CONTROL

Noah stands over the Com. The room is a madhouse.

                      NOAH

          Give me a telemetry projection.

Noah looks up at the main monitor. The graphic of the Jupiter Two is
heading towards the graphic of the sun.

INT.-JUPITER TWO

John and Don stand over the Com.

                      NOAH (OVER)

          You're way off course. We show you in
          the sun's gravitational pull.

          How long do we have?

                      NOAH (OVER)

          We count seven minutes before your

DON straps himself into the pilot's chair.

                      WEST

          I'm going to try for the Mercury
          Mines.

SMITH stands at the freezing tube, Penny and Maureen assisting him.

                      SMITH

          I will need Dr. Robinson's portable
          gurney. I believe it is stored in-

                      PENNY

          I'm on it.

Penny races off. Smith begins working the controls to Judy's freezing
tube.

                      MAUREEN

          We trusted you.

          (sinking in)

          You tried to kill us all.

                      SMITH

          Existence offers us nothing if not
          the opportunity for an endless series
          of betrayals.

          (off her stunned expression)

          There's a world behind the world,
          Professor Robinson. Lie once, cheat
          twice and everything becomes clear.
          Do not mistake my deception for a
          character flaw. It is philosophical
          choice, a profound understanding of
          the universe. It is a way of life.

                      MAUREEN

          You're a monster.

                      SMITH

          Perhaps. But I am also the only one
          who can save your daughter's life.

Penny reappears, a case in hand. She presses a button and the case
unfolds into a hovering, gyroscopicaly-leveled gurney.

                      MAUREEN

          Where's Will?

                      PENNY

          He's futzing with that Robot.

                      SMITH

          Alright, Penny dear, I need you to
          short the power on my command.

                      PENNY

          Does he have to call me dear?

                      SMITH

          Professor, if you will assist me in
          lowering the body.

Smith hands Penny a wrench.

                      SMITH

          Penny, dear. Now.

Maureen nods. Penny SLAMS the wrench into the power circuit. The
freezing field FLARES and deactivates, the tube swinging open.

LIFESIGN MONITOR-CLOSE. Flatline.

                      MAUREEN

          She's dying.

Smith and Maureen lower her onto the gurney.

                      SMITH

          Sickbay. Move.

Penny, Maureen and Smith rush the gurney out the blast doors towards
Sickbay just as the ship tilts madly.

AT THE HELM

WINDSCREEN-CLOSE. The sun is growing ever larger.

                      WEST

          Unable to re-route to Mercury. The

ON SCREEN-THE JUPITER TWO is heading towards the sun.

INT.-JUPITER TWO-SICKBAY

Penny, Smith and Maureen have transferred Judy onto a hi-tech
scanning-bed. A hovering holographic schematic of Judy's physiognomy
appears over her, descends onto her body.

                      SMITH

No cardio-pulmonary or respiratory functions.

          Get her flight suit off.

Penny unzips the silver material as Smith works the console,
highlighting her holographic heart.

                      SMITH

          Clear.

The holographic image of her heart beats once, then is still.

                      SMITH

          Again. Clear.

The lights flicker on the bio-console, the holograph winks out.

                      SMITH

          Power's down.

                      MAUREEN

Smith begins pumping Judy's chest by hand.

                      SMITH

          Come on, child. Fight. Put a little
          heart in it.

Smith steps back, begins precise, staccato blows to Judy's chest.

                      SMITH

Smith stops, presses his ear to her chest - Takes her pulse. Smiles.

                      MAUREEN

          Judy? Baby?

A beat. Then Judy opens her eyes, manages a weak smile.

                      JUDY

          You should try to look less worried.
          It has a tendency to spook the
          patients.

                      MAUREEN

          (to Smith)

          Thank you.

Smith holds her gaze, his eyes almost snake-like.

                      SMITH

          You are a good woman, Maureen. Any man
          could see that. I hope I have proven
          the well-being of your family is of
          great importance to me. Perhaps, if
          you convinced your husband to trust
          me...

Maureen stares at him. A beat. She pulls a laser from the wall. Points
it at his forehead.

                      MAUREEN

          Stabilize her, Smith. Because you only
          breathe as long as she does.

          That's it.

                      WEST

          We can't get away from the sun. So we

John takes Will's hand as West engages the hyperdrive.

West, John and Will, are hurled backwards from the sudden
acceleration, sticking to the walls and ceiling respectively.

INT.-SICKBAY

Maureen and Penny watch as Smith swaddles Judy in thermal blanket.
Suddenly, Maureen, Penny, and Smith fly against the walls. Judy is
held in place by the gurney straps.

          Godspeed.

EXT.-SPACE

The Jupiter Two flies into the mighty ball of the sun. And just as it
reaches the tallest of the gaseous mountains, the ship becomes
translucent, falling through the orb, elongating and then vanishing in
a sudden star of hyperspace.

INT.-JUPITER TWO

THE WINDSCREEN. The sky breaks apart giving way to a starfield.

EXT.-DEEP SPACE

Quiet. Empty. Suddenly space distorts and, in a sudden flash, a ship
appears, hurling into the darkness. The Jupiter Two.

The Jupiter Two comes to rest at the edge of an alien, twin starred
solar system, near a giant crimson planet.

CHAPTER 11: Lost in Space
-------------------------


INT.-JUPITER TWO-INFIRMARY

Maureen kneels before Penny and Will, making sure they're okay. Smith
stands silently in the b.g. Judy's gurney is empty. John ENTERS, his
face wrought with fatherly concern.

                      JOHN

          Is everyone okay?

                      MAUREEN

          All in one piece. Although Major West
          has the most puzzling definition of a
          smooth ride.

                      JOHN

          Judy? Where's Judy?

Just then Judy emerges through a door, zipping up her flight suit.

                      JUDY

          Boy either I cut down on the coffee
          or sew in a flap. It's hell getting
          in and out of this thing.

                      JOHN

          Are you-

                      JUDY

          Vitals are normal. Pulse and
          respiration seem to be-

                      JOHN

          Baby, are you okay?

                      JUDY

          I'm fine Daddy really.

John holds her close, spared a father's worst fear.

                      SMITH

          Will every disaster be an excuse for
          familial sentiment? Please tell me
          now so I may gather up a liberal
          supply of space sickness bags.

Don turns towards Smith. Maureen steps between them.

                      MAUREEN

          What happened, John? Where are we?

INT.-JUPITER TWO-BRIDGE

Don in at the navigational holograph, patching sparking wires. The
rest of the crew emerge onto the bridge.

                      WEST

          You had me worried, Doc. Nice to see
          you thawed.

                      JUDY

          Smart maneuver with the hyper-drive.

                      WEST

          A fighter who thinks, what do you
          know? You're just in time for the
          show.

Don makes a connection. The pedestal powers up, a holograph of the
Jupiter Two appearing over its surface.

                      WEST

          Computer, map our current location.

HOLOGRAPHIC PEDESTAL-CLOSE. The area around the Jupiter Two is now
filled with a holographic representation of the alien solar system.

          See anything familiar?

Don just shakes his head.

Judy wraps her arm around her sister.

                      WEST

          What the hell is that?

VIEWSCREEN- CLOSE. The nearest planet is starting to glow. Suddenly a
distortion field begins to emanate from the alien world. The edges of
space seem to sear away, leaving a glowing portal.

                      JOHN

          Any effect on the ship?

                      WEST

          No.

VIEWSCREEN -CLOSE. All the planets and constellations beyond the
portal appear to be in different places.

                      JOHN

          (off the navigational hologram)

          All the planets have moved.

                      WEST

          And where did that come from?

CHAPTER 12: The Proteus
-----------------------


EXT.-SPACE

Breaking the inner edge of the portal, a long silver space needle
catches the light from the dual suns.

INT.-JUPITER TWO

The crew man their stations. Only Will is absent as they the ship
maneuver around the portal.

VIEWSCREEN -CLOSE. As they, move behind the portal it seems to
disappear, showing only the blackness of space. No ship beyond.

                      WEST

          It's gone.

                      JOHN

          No. Go back in front of it.

EXT.-JUPITER TWO

As the ship moves back in front of the portal, the hole in space is
visible again, the giant probe ship revealed once more within...

                      JOHN

          It's a hole in space. A doorway.

                      WEST

          A doorway to where?

                      JOHN

          If we want to reach that ship, we're
          going to have to find out.

EXT.-SPACE

The Jupiter Two flies through the pulsing hole in space.

INT.-JUPITER TWO

The giant, silver ship looms in the windscreen.

                      MAUREEN

          No apparent effects on the ship.

          response.

                      JOHN

          There are some markings on the
          starboard side. Can you throw some
          light on her?

                      WEST

          Don't know if the exterior spots are
          working.- There we go.

THE WINDSCREEN-CLOSE. Powerful spotlights hit the ship.

WEST AND JOHN-CLOSE. And really surprised.

                      WEST

          If this in all a dream, why can't
          there be more girls?

THE SPACESHIP-CLOSE. Essentially a needle covered with metal scallops.
On its hull, under the legend PROTEUS, an American flag.

                      WEST

          I've never seen a design like this.
          what are those scales on her hull?

                      JOHN

          How could Earth launch a ship this
          massive and neither of us know about
          it? ... It just doesn't make sense.

                      WEST

          These scanners are damaged, I'm
          getting inconsistent life signs but
          they may be sensor ghosts.

                      JOHN

          Maybe her computer's still up. I'm
          trying standard remote access codes.

ON SCREEN-A docking ring on the giant ship comes to life, giant floods
coming to life, the docking aperture rotating open.

EXT.-SPACE

The Jupiter Two heads towards the giant ship.

INT.-JUPITER TWO

                      JOHN

          Can you give me some light on the
          secondary docking ring?

A smaller docking ring is illuminated on the viewscreen.

                      WEST

          What do you make of that?

Attached to the starboard docking ring is another, smaller craft. Its
snaking anthropomorphic lines are not of human design.

                      MAUREEN

          Boys, I think we're having a close
          encounter.

EXT.-SPACE

The Jupiter moves into the docking ring of the giant ship.

INT.-JUPITER TWO

(OVER) a giant THUD as the Jupiter Two docks with the probe.

          Crush.

REVERSE ANGLE. The Robot in rolling in through the doorway, arms
waving wildly before him.

                      ROBOT

          Crush! Kill! Destroy!

Don and John are up fast. But the Robot just rolls to a stop. Will
steps from behind the automaton, his hacker's deck in his hand.

He pulls a tiny mic from his deck. Lifts it to his lips.

                      WILL

          Crush. Kill. Destroy.

                      ROBOT

          Crush! Kill! Destroy!

Will points to several jury-rigged modifications.

                      WILL

          I hacked into his CPU, bypassed his
          main operating system and accessed
          his sub-routines. He's basically
          running on remote control.

All stare at him. Penny finally speaks.

                      PENNY

          Show off.

INT.-JUPITER TWO-CREW QUARTERS-LATER

Penny stands guard, a rifle in her hand, talking into her recorder.

                      PENNY

          And so the Space Captive finds
          herself helping the Robinsons by
          guarding the traitor. And she finds-

Penny's VOICE trails off. Stares out the porthole. Endless space.

                      PENNY

          She finds that out here, in the dark
          and cold, she's scared, and she's
          kind of glad they're all together.

Just then Don approaches, a silver bundle under his arm.

                      PENNY

          Identify yourself, soldier.

                      WEST

          West, Major, United Space Force,
          requesting permission to see the
          prisoner.

Penny steps aside.

                      PENNY

          Proceed Major West.

Don smiles, winks at her, going through the door.

                      PENNY

          Ouch. Could he be cuter? I don't
          think so.

INT.-SMITH'S CELL

Actually a med-lab. Smith turns to face Don an he ENTERS.

                      SMITH

          These quarters are totally
          unacceptable. I demand-

Don tosses his bundle on the seat. A silver flight suit.

                      WEST

          We're going to check out the probe
          ship. Maybe we can figure out how
          they got here. And how to get home.

                      SMITH

          Ta-ta. Have a wonderful trip.

                      WEST

          You're coming with us.

                      SMITH

          Out of the question. I'm a doctor not
          a space explorer. You and-

But Don is in his face in a heartbeat.

                      WEST

          What you are is a murderous saboteur
          and I am not leaving you on this ship
          so you can do more harm than you've
          already caused.

                      SMITH

          I absolutely refuse-

                      WEST

          (closer)

          Give me an excuse to kill you.
          Please.

Smith stares at him a beat. Then he smiles, looks to the flight suit.

                      SMITH

          Silver always was my color.

INT.-JUPITER TWO-LOWER DECKS

Will stands in front of the Robot, polishing a blast mark clean.

                      WILL

          When boarding a mysterious
          spacecraft, it always pays to look
          your best.

John enters, removes a gun from the weapons locker.

                      JOHN

          Deactivate safety.

                      GUN

          Voiceprint confirmed. Rifle is
          active.

GUN-CLOSE. A small light goes from red to green.

                      JOHN

          You did a good job up there son. You
          saved us all.

                      WILL

          Thanks.

An awkward silence hangs between them.

                      JOHN

          I know I haven't around much these
          days.That we haven't had time to-

                      WEST (OVER)

          Professor, we're ready.

John looks at his boy Will in silent.

                      JOHN

          Will, you're the most important thing
          in the world to me. I hope one day
          you'll be able to see that.

With that, John walks out. Will stares after him. Faces the Robot.

                      WILL

          Take care of my dad, okay Robot?

Will works his remote, sending the Robot towards the bridge.

INT.-PROBE SHIP

A long dark corridor. Slowly the ambient lights come up. A door opens
to reveal Smith, John, Don, Judy and the Robot, stepping out of the
docking chamber, the airlock closing in the b.g.

                      JUDY

          The air is stale. Old.

                      SMITH

          That's the smell of ghosts.

Don walks to a computer panel set into the wall. Begins typing.

                      WEST

          I'm interfacing with the on board
          computer... Odd.

                      JOHN

          Not working?

                      WEST

          No, it's just, I don't know, too
          fast. Most of the systems are down.

The Robot rolls deeper into the alien ship. The others follow. More
lights flicker into life, illuminating the long corridor ahead.

                      JUDY

          Motion sensors are still working.

                      WEST (OVER)

          What do you make of this?

Smith, John and Judy join Don at one of the bulkhead walls.

                      JOHN

          Some kind of hieroglyphics.

WALL-CLOSE. A series of hieroglyphics are scrawled on the hull wall.
The sketches tell a story.

HIEROGLYPH-CLOSE. The alien craft docks with the giant ship.

SECOND HIEROGLYPH-CLOSE-A trio of inhuman bipedal stick figures enter
the giant ship.

THIRD HIEROGLYPH-CLOSE. The shape of a sun or a disc, from which juts
many legs. This final hieroglyph is circled in a clotted red
substance. Don touches the stain.

CHAPTER 13: Exploration
-----------------------


                      JUDY

          If I didn't know better I'd say this
          is blood.

                      SMITH

          I know an omen when I see one. I
          suggest a hasty retreat.

                      WEST

          Just imagine we're retreating in the
          opposite direction. Now, move it.

Don shoves Smith forward with the butt of his laser rifle, the group
heading deeper into the quiet ship.

INT.-JUPITER TWO

Will watches through the Robot's POV, toggling to move the automaton
forward. A readout marked AUDIO flashes. Will turns up a volume
control. (OVER) the sound of a slow, steady DRIP.

                      WILL

          Dad, do you....

INT.-PROBE SHIP

                      ROBOT

          ... Hear something?

The Robot turns, begins heading further down the corridor. (OVER) now
DRIPPING can be heard by all.

                      SMITH

          Like the drip, drip, drip of blood..

                      WEST

          You really need to shut up.

                      JOHN

          (pointing)

          Here.

THE CEILING shows a jagged hole, covered with some kind of viscous
membrane, leading to the dark of a service tunnel above. The membrane
DRIPS steadily onto the floor below.

                      JUDY

          That material appears biological.

                      SMITH

          Nothing good will come of this.

                      WEST

          What makes you such an expert?

                      SMITH

          Trust me, Major. Evil knows evil.

                      JOHN

          Let's find the bridge. Maybe we can
          get some answers.

They head off. HOLD on the dripping membrane.

INT.-JUPITER TWO

Maureen is at the main sensor console working an instrument panel.

Penny is hanging upside down in a harness overhead, using a laser
welder on a giant mass of exposed ceiling circuitry.

                      PENNY

          Try it now, Mom.

Maureen throws a switch. The panel lights up, then goes dead.

                      PENNY

          Damn.

INT.-SHIP-WALKING

The boarding party stand at the end of the corridor. Don presses a
wall panel. The giant doors hiss open to REVEAL...

INT.-MAIN BRIDGE

Immense. Empty. And battle torn. Sections of the controls have been
blown away. Blast scoring mars the walls.

                      JUDY

          What the hell happened in here?

                      WEST

          Some kind of fire fight. Look at this
          technology. I've seen some of this
          before. On the drawing boards.

Smith has moved off slightly, wandered over to a STORAGE ALCOVE.
Within, a row of docked Robots, larger and sleeker then ours.

John and Don are powering up the Com, console lights coming on.

                      JOHN

          Can you bring up the Captain's log?

                      WEST

          The data has degraded. I'm going try
          and gather any fragments I can. There
          isn't much, but ... here we go.

MAIN SCREEN-CLOSE. Fills with snow. Then a figure can be seen. It's
Jab. But his hair is grey.

                      WEST

          Jeb.

                      JEB

          The hyperspace tracker seems to be
          functioning...

          (static)

          No sign of the Jupiter Two...

                      JEB

          (static)

          Have exceeded our mission timetable
          by two...

          (static)

          I'm not willing to give up. Don would
          keep looking for me.

                      WEST

          That's it. The rest of the data is
          totally corrupted.

IN THE ALCOVE, Smith frees a power pack from one of the robots. Slips
it into the sleeve cuff of his field suit.

                      WEST

          This doesn't make sense. How could
          they launch a rescue mission for us
          when we've only been lost a day?

Judy stands by the life sciences panel.

                      JUDY

          I've got something here.

A turning holograph appears over the console panel. A degraded image
of a trembling, viscous pouch. Tiny shapes move within.

                      JUDY

          They brought it up from the planet's
          surface. It's seems to be some sort
          of egg sack.

Don notices Smith's standing in the storage alcove.

                      WEST

          Smith, step away from there.

                      SMITH

          Happy to oblige, Major. Although I
          don't think it's me you should be
          worrying about. But rather this.

In the corner of the ceiling, another membrane covered hole.

INT.-JUPITER TWO

Will is at his station, watching Don and John via the Robot's POV.

                      WILL

          I'm detecting motion. Behind you...

INT.-PROBE SHIP BRIDGE

A towering SHADOW shoots past the open doorway.

                      JOHN

          After it. Move.

          (to the Robot)

          Bring Smith.

INT.-PROBE SHIP-CORRIDOR

Don races down the corridor. The walls are matted with flowering
plants. Vines twist into a carpet covering the metallic floor.

THE SCURRYING SHAPE, about the size of a small dog, shoots out from
behind a bulkhead, disappearing into the lush greenery.

Don pushes forward through the ever deepening brush until he comes to
a door. A plaque reads HYDROPONICS LAB. He races inside.

INT.-HYDROPONICS LAB

A jungle. John and Judy arrive behind Don.

                      WEST

          This explains where all the plants
          came from.

                      JUDY

          Growth like this would take decades.

The Robot arrives through the lab door, carrying Smith in one claw.

                      SMITH

          Unhand me, you mechanical moron.

Don's eyes fix behind Smith's head.

                      WEST

          Don't move.

                      SMITH

          I am sick of your terrorism. If you
          are going to kill me, be done with
          it. Otherwise I will insist you treat
          me with the respect and-

                      WEST

          (like steel)

          I said don't move.

Smith is suddenly silent. Don's hand shoots out, just missing Smith's
head, disappearing into the brush behind him, leaves flying, as-he
pulls from its hiding place a small creature.

About the size of a large stuffed bear, spiny skin going from leaf
color to red, shaped like a rhesus monkey but covered with the scales
of a tiny dragon and bright yellow cat's eyes.

INT.-JUPITER TWO

Will is watching through the Robot's eyes.

                      WILL

          Neat.

INT.-PROBE SHIP-HYDROPONICS GARDEN

West stares down at the creature in his hand, now a calmer and more
friendly blue. Judy approaches.

                      JUDY

          Well, who do we have here?

As the beast struggles in Don's hand it changes color, chameleon like,
trying to hide. No luck. Don holds fast.

                      WEST

          Easy there, little buddy. No one's
          going to hurt you.

                      SMITH

          How do you know it won't hurt us?

Don has begun stroking the creature's head. After a beat, the small
beast begins to COO and emit small BLIPPING sounds.

                      JUDY

          Looks like you've made a friend. You
          have a good bedside manner, Major.

                      WEST

          I'm going to let that one go.

                      SMITH

          How charming. Doctor Dolittle of
          outer space.

                      JUDY

          Where do you think it came from?

                      JOHN

          It's possible this is one of the
          creatures represented in the
          hieroglyphs we saw on the wall. It
          must have been their ship attached to
          the other docking ring.

The beast has moved onto Don's shoulder, is now clutching there,
burying its tiny face into his neck. Don can't help but LAUGH.

                      WEST

          It looks like a child.

                      SMITH

          If so, my dear Major, what do you
          suppose happened to its parents?

                      JOHN

          Let's get back to the bridge.

As they leave, a dark shape skitters across the ceiling in the
background. Ominous. Unseen.

CHAPTER 14: Giant Spiders!
--------------------------


INT.-JUPITER TWO

Penny is still hanging overhead.

                      PENNY

          I think I've got it.

The sensor console comes back to life, displays lighting, status
lights going green. Maureen stares at the monitor.

                      MAUREEN

          That's strange.

SCREEN-CLOSE. Revealed in the sensor scan, the scallops pulse with
ambient heat. Penny lands beside her.

                      PENNY

          Those scales are giving off heat.

INT.-PROBE SHIP-BRIDGE

John is at the Com.

                      JOHN

          I've tapped into the internal sensor
          array. Besides us, this ship is
          totally deserted.

                      SMITH

          A ghost ship.

Don is sitting with the tiny creature. He pulls a ration pack from his
pocket. Turns it over in his hand.

                      WEST

          And the flavor of the day is ...
          banana/beef. Who thinks up these
          combinations?

The creature stares at him intently as he tears open the foil lip,
sucks a bit LOUDLY. Judy can't help but smile at him.

                      WEST

          MM. Good.

                      SMITH

          Major West, I highly recommend you
          never breed. That by the way is my
          medical opinion.

Don glares at him, hands the tiny creature the pouch. The creature
looks at it, emits a small BLIP, takes a tentative suck. Its eyes
widen in delight as it begins to suck the ration pack.

                      WEST

          Little thing was hungry.

                      SMITH

          Good Lord, who will - spare us the
          tyranny of the sentimental?

(OVER) a distant, high pitched WHINE.

                      PENNY

          Do you hear something?

Suddenly the creature begins to SCREAM, leaping on Smith's back,
clinging to his neck for dear life.

                      SMITH

          Get this infernal creature off me.

The WHINE is growing louder. it seems to be coming from above.

THE CEILING-CLOSE. There, in the corner, the membrane covering the
hole seems to be trembling.

                      WEST

          This can't be good.

                      SMITH

          You have a remarkably keen sense
          of the obvious.

INT.-JUPITER TWO

Maureen stands with Penny at the main sensor station.

                      MAUREEN

          John, get the hell out of there.

ON SCREEN. The silver disks on the hull of the probe ship are
beginning to move, rising to stand now on spindraled legs.

EXT.-PROBE SHIP

Heads and legs emerging, the disks reveal themselves to be armor
plated spiders. The monsters find viscous holes in the outer hull and
push through, vanishing into the probe ship.

INT.-JUPITER TWO

(OVER) a THUD. The Jupiter Two shakes, as if struck.

                      MAUREEN

          Give me an external view.

Penny works the console.

ON SCREEN. Spiders are leaping from the probe onto the Jupiter Two.

INT.-PROBE SHIP-BRIDGE

The lizard monkey's SCREAMING has reached new heights of hysteria. A
shape begins to push through the viscous bole in the ceiling.

What bursts in is a monster out of nightmare. Nearly half the size of
a human, shiny metallic body from which wet, spider-like limbs extend.
A fang covered vAw opens below ravenous, green eyes.

Don draws his laser and FIRES, but the blast only reflects off the
metallic surface of its torso, forcing the creature to retract its
limbs and eyes, hiding within its protective shell.

                      JOHN

          Evacuate. Now!

The team races for the door as several more spiders drop through the
hole in the ceiling, landing in the bridge and scampering fast towards
our fleeing heros.

INT.-PROBE SHIP-TUNNELS

The boarding party race down the corridor. The spiders are bounding
after them, using walls, floor, and ceiling with equal facility.

INT.-JUPITER TWO

Will is madly working his keyboard, controlling the fleeing Robot.

                      WILL

          This joy stick is too slow. Activate
          holographic interface.

A holographic robot appears on the bridge. Will steps inside, the
image now moving with his body. He spins, facing backwards, firing.

INT.-PROBE SHIP

The Robot is holding up the rear, its torso swiveled backwards so it
can retreat and FIRE simultaneously.

The Robot's plasma BLASTS have more effect than-the lasers, blowing
the spiders into tiny pieces of inhuman flesh and metal.

But more monsters are pouring through the holes in the corridor
ceiling, some giving chasing, others swarming injured comrades.

Judy watches as several spiders devour their fallen brethren.

                      JUDY

          They eat their wounded.

Our heroes race to a nexus, corridors leading off in all directions.
Spiders are dropping from the ceiling around them.

                      JOHN

          Which way?

INT. -JUPITER TWO

WILL-POV. A graphic map flashes within the holograph.

                      WILL

          Turn left.

INT.-PROBE SHIP-CORRIdOR

                      ROBOT

          Now right.

The spiders are swarming, closing fast.

                      JOHN

          Got to seal the bulkhead.

                      WEST

          The door control is at the other and
          of the corridor.

                      JUDY

          The fire sensor.

Judy pulls her gun, FIRES, hitting a ceiling sensor at the end of the
corridor. Blast doors SLAM, sealing out most of the spiders.

DON-CLOSE. Impressed.

BLAST DOORS-CLOSE. Metal teeth begin tearing through the steel.

Our group has made it to the door to the docking bay. They rush in,
the Robot coming through the open doorway last and holding there.

INT.-PROBE SHIP-DOCKING BAY

Don activates the airlock to the Jupiter, the batch slowly opening.

The Robot stands in the doorway to the docking bay, FIRING at the
spiders as they come down the hall, blowing them away. More pour
through the now rending blast doors. There are just too many, rolling
towards them now like a single, shifting mass of death.

                      SMITH

          Open, damn you.

                      WEST

          It's cycling a vacuum check. There is
          no way to speed up the protocols.

                      SMITH

          Fools. I warned you not to come
          aboard this cursed craft. You've
          killed us. You've killed us all.

Judy throws him, hard, into the wall.

                      JUDY

          Shut up.

                      WEST

          Now that's a bedside manner.

The first spiders reach the Robot, leaping onto its metal bull.

INT.-JUPITER TWO

Maureen and Penny are at the Com, powering up the engines. Will is
within the holograph, fighting off the spiders.

                      WILL

          Charge.

INT.-PROBE SHIP-DOCKING BAY

The Robot's shell electrifies, the spiders recoiling.

The airlock has opened enough for our heroes to duck inside.

                      JOHN

          Will, get the Robot in here.

The Robot stands in the open portal, covered by spiders, their fangs
shredding his hull, his electrical charge beginning to SHORT.

INT.-JUPITER TWO

Will is throwing off the monsters, Extending the Robot's antenna
spikes and scanner dishes to skewer spiders that are squeezing by.

                      WILL

          I can't move him without letting the
          spiders into the ship.

INT.-PROBE SHIP-DOCKING BAY

                      JOHN

          Leave him behind.

INT.-JUPITER TWO

                      WILL

          I'm sorry, Robot.

INT.-JUPITER TWO-DOCKING BAY

A spider pushes past the Robot, head slipping around his metallic
body, bent on reaching the airlock and the crew within.

INT.-JUPITER TWO-AIRLOCK

                      JOHN

          Seal it. Now!

Don hits a switch just as a spider breaks free, rushing towards the
dropping airlock door. Smith recoils from the swiping talon.

SMITH'S BACK-CLOSE. A tiny rand and beneath, a razor thin incision.

THE DOOR drops, the spider's arm, still twitching, severed inside the
airlock.

INT.-JUPITER TWO

The inner airlock door Opens. The crew tumble in.

                      JOHN

          Get us out of here.

Don is already powering up the ship's engines as Smith tries
separating himself from the tiny lizard monkey.

                      SMITH

          Get this cloying gargoyle off of me.

He throws the beast hard across the bridge. The creature hits the
wall, SCREECHING, begins racing across consoles.

John has strapped in beside Don.

                      JOHN

          Get me an external view.

A MONITOR shows the hull of the Jupiter Two. More spiders are leaping
onto the ship, attaching themselves to the hull.

                      JOHN

          Prepare to disengage.

THE LIZARD MONKEY skitters up the back of Penny's chair, over her
head, getting tangled in her hair before jumping into her lap.

                      PENNY

          Get it off me. Get it off.

Penny in frantically wiping the hair from her face. The tiny creature
on her lap begins a perfect imitation of Penny.

Don releases the docking ring, glances at the Monitor. The hull of the
ship is now entirely covered with spiders.

                      WEST

          Initiating separation.

LIZARD MONKEY'S EYES widen in terror as the ship SHAKES, burying its
head in Penny's chest. A beat. Then Penny hugs the tiny beast.

                      PENNY

          It's okay. Everything's going to be
          alright.

But she sounds anything but sure.

                      WEST

          We're clear. Everybody hang on.

INT.-JUPITER TWO

The Jupiter Two's engines BLOW, peeling into the endless night.

INT.-JUPITER TWO

(OVER) ALARMS sound.

                      JUDY

          I think those things were using the
          probe ship as a way to trap food.

                      WEST

          That I s probably what happened to
          the monkey's parents. We were going
          to be desert.

                      MAUREEN

          But what happened to the crew?

                      JOHN

          Nothing good.

                      WEST

          We're not out of the woods yet.

ON SCREEN. The hull of the Jupiter Two is covered with the giant
spiders, their teeth cutting through the outer hull.

                      WEST

          Let's see how these monsters like a
          hundred thousand volts.

EXT.-JUPITER TWO

The hull glows with electricity. The spiders fly off into space, their
limbs and heads retracting.

                      WEST

          And the crowd goes wild.

                      SMITH

          Recall your nightmares from
          childhood, Major. Monsters are rarely
          so easily dissuaded.

(OVER) a THUNK. Then another. A third.

ON SCREEN-The spiders shoot webs from their bellies, attaching to the
Jupiter, land on the hull again, re-extending their limbs, starting to
burrow once more.

                      WEST

          Persistent bastards.

                      JOHN

          Can you hit them again?

                      WEST

          Every time I electrify the hull, I'm
          draining our systems. Once or twice
          more and we're going to be dead in
          space.

                      SMITH

          A fate I fear may be inevitable one
          way or another.

Maureen emerges from the airlock holding the spider's severed limb in
metal tongs. Carries it to her life sciences analyzer.

                      JOHN

          That's the same expression you had
          when my mother came to stay with us.

MAUREEN'S MONITOR-CLOSE. A graphic of the severed spider leg. A small
line begins to extrapolate to the rest of the figure. Musculature and
flesh are drawn in on the screen.

                      MAUREEN

          DNA extrapolation - coming up.
          Silicone based. Admantium shell and
          lack of respiratory system suggest an
          ability to live in deep space. Tiny
          front brain implies communal
          relationships. More like bees.

VIEWS CREEN -CLOSE. More and more spider are spiraling from the probe
ship, all heading toward the Jupiter Two.

                      WEST

          There are thousands of those things

Maureen is working the COMPUTER.

                      MAUREEN

          They may be attracted to heat and
          light.

Don begins typing.

                      WEST

          With the right command codes, I can
          light up the probe ship from here.

MONITOR-CLOSE. More spiders are hitting the bull.

                      WEST

          Damn. No response.

                      JOHN

          Command codes are sequenced. Try the next series.

                      WEST

          But they won't work until the next
          fleet of ships are built. That's at
          least two years away.

                      JOHN

          Just do it.

Don begins entering command codes.

The mighty probe ship begins to power up, engines glowing red as they
begin their initial BURN.

                      WEST

          How did you know?

                      JOHN

          Think about it, Don. The ships's
          advanced technology. Your friend
          looking old. What if that ship is
          from our future?

                      COMPUTER

          Warning. Outer hull has been
          compromised.

SCREEN-CLOSE. Spiders are eating through the outer hull.

                      MAUREEN

          It's not working.

                      JOHN

          Can you get the fusion drive on line?

EXT.-SPACE

THE PROBE SHIP'S fusion drives FIRE. A few of the spiders divert back
toward the probe ship. But most still head for the Jupiter.

INT.-JUPITER TWO

                      WEST

          Let's turn up the heat.

Don engages the THRUSTERS, grabs the throttle.

EXT.-SPACE

The Jupiter Two banks toward the probe ship, heading directly for the
wake of the fusion drives.

INT.-JUPITER TWO

                      COMPUTER (OVER)

          Warning. Inner hull breach in twenty
          seconds.

                      JOHN

          Give them a little encouragement.

                      WEST

          Electrifying outer hull ... now.

EXT.-JUPITER TWO

The outer bull flashes with electricity, the spiders jumping off. Don
pilots the craft directly through the wake of the fusion drive.

The spiders jump off, begin attaching themselves to the nacelles of
the giant probe ship.

INT.-JUPITER TWO

ON SCREEN the giant spiral of spiders in now heading back towards the
giant probe ship.

                      JOHN

          Get us out of here. Fast.

Don looks at John a beat, then he begins working the controls.

                      JOHN

          What are you doing?

                      WEST

          Never leave an enemy stronghold
          intact. One of your father's first
          rules of engagement.

Don hits a button. On the remote control console a readout begins to
flash. The message is simple: FUSION DRIVE-OVERLOAD.

                      JOHN

          Don, stop. That's a direct order. We
          might need to salvage-

                      WEST

          This is a military emergency. That
          means I'm in command.

                      JOHN

          Don, no. I'm ordering you-

                      WEST

          I hate spiders.

Don hits a button. The panel light flashes: OVERLOAD.

                      WEST

          Hang on, it I a gonna be a bumpy
          ride.

Don angles the ship away, punching the thrusters as the probe ship's
engines begins to glow.

EXT.-SPACE

The probe ship's nuclear core overloads. The engines begin to glow,
venting plasma and then EXPLODE like a nascent star.

THE BLAST WAVE spreads across space, vaporizing the spiders.

THE BLAST WAVE hits the Jupiter Two.

INT.-JUPITER TWO

The ship is buffeted by the shock wave.

                      WEST

          I can't hold her.

EXT.-JUPITER TWO

The ship is knocked into the atmosphere of the giant planet below.

INT.-JUPITER TWO

Don is struggling to keep control.

                      WEST

          We're going down.

EXT.-JUPITER TWO

The ship is hurling toward the planet's cloud obscured surface.

INT.-JUPITER TWO

The windscreen is filled with a RUSHING BLIZZARD.

                      WEST

          Can't get the stabilizers on line.

                      JOHN

          Pull up. Pull up.

                      WEST

          Really? No kidding? Thanks.

WINDSCREEN- CLOSE. The storm clouds suddenly PART TO REVEAL ... A
GIANT SNOW COVERED MOUNTAIN RANGE.

Don banks the controls.

EXT.-JUPITER TWO

The ship tilts on its side, passing between two snowy peaks, still
plunging towards the planet's wintry surface below.

INT.-JUPITER TWO

                      WEST

          I'm reading a clearing ahead. I'm
          going to try and make it.

EXT.-PLANET'S SURFACE

The Jupiter Two BLOWS over a carpet of snowy treetops, the canopy of
leaves bursting into flames from the friction of the hull.

INT.-JUPITER TWO

The surface is coming up fast.

                      WEST

          Got to slow us down.

EXT.-PLANET'S SURFACE

The Jupiter Two hits the surf ace of the water and skips, once twice,
three times across the alien sea.

INT.-JUPITER TWO

                      WEST

          Brace for impact!

The ship SMASHES into a crater miles long, PLOWING through rock and
vegetation, finally coming to rest near one of the crater walls.

INT.-JUPITER TWO

Still. Automatic fire systems spray gas everywhere. only the dimmest
emergency lights cast any glow.

                      JOHN

          Everybody, by the numbers.

Maureen straightens, rubs her neck.

                      MAUREEN

          Life Sciences, still breathing.

                      JUDY

          Mission medical, I'm alive.

                      WILL

          Me too. Robotics, I mean.

                      PENNY

          Video Mechanics, okay.

                      SMITH

          I'm alive, Major West's poor excuse
          for piloting skills not withstanding.

                      WEST

          Let's take a look.

Don hits a switch, the windshield de-icing, becoming clear.

                      PENNY

          I don't think we're in Kansas
          anymore.

REVERSE ANGLE

Before them lies the crater, snow covered floor spreading out towards
a distant horizon stained red by two hanging crimson suns.

CHAPTER 15: Follow Orders!
--------------------------


EXT. -ALIEN LANDSCAPE-NIGHT

The moonless sky is filled with an utterly alien starfield. The
Jupiter Two sits near the wall of the crater, its tiny lights fighting
the otherworldly darkness.

                      JOHN (OVER)

          You violated a direct order.

INT.-ENGINE ROOM

Cavernous. John and Don stand by the giant drive engines. Don is
holding a cylinder containing a mixture of power chips, some glowing
with radioactive fire, others dull and charred as coal.

                      WEST

          About half the core material is
          burned out. We'll never generate
          enough power to break orbit.

                      JOHN

          I told you not to blow that ship's
          reactors and you did it anyway.

                      WEST

          Come on, Professor, give it a rest. I
          was technically still in command.

                      JOHN

          Don't hand me that. I'm commander of
          this mission.

                      WEST

          Look, no offense, but you're an
          egghead with an honorary rank. No one
          ever intended you to handle combat
          situations. You're spouting some
          nonsense about- time travel while
          those spiders posed a continuing
          threat. I made a judgement call and
          if I have to I'll make it again.
          Hell, you of all people should
          understand that. If your father were
          here-

                      JOHN

          My father is not here. My father is
          dead, killed in one of his combat
          missions you so admire. My family is
          on this ship And you're going to
          follow my orders. Whether you agree
          with them or not. Is that clear,
          Major?

Don's face is right up in John's.

                      WEST

          Save the speeches. I like you. But
          the fate of the Earth is at stake
          here. I'm going to do whatever I
          think it takes to ensure the success
          of this mission. With or without your
          help. Is that clear, Professor?

The two are too close to do anything but kiss or fight. Kissing seems
less than likely.

                      MAUREEN (OVER)

          Am I interrupting something?

WIDER. Maureen stands in the doorway.

                      MAUREEN

          No. Really. I think you two should go
          ahead and slug it out. I mean, here
          we are stranded on an alien world and
          you boys want to get into a pissing
          contest. So please, go for it. I'll
          have Judy down here in a heartbeat to
          declare you both unfit and I'll take
          over this mission. Now I don't want
          to hear another word from you two
          until you can play nice. Is that
          clear?

                      JOHN WEST

          Maureen- Listen-

                      MAUREEN

          Not another word.

          (a beat)

          Better. Now if you've finished hosing
          down the decks with testosterone, I
          suggest you come with me. I may have
          found a way to get us off this
          planet.

Maureen turns on her heal and EXITS. The two men exchange a look.

                      WEST

          Wow.

                      JOHN

          Tell me about it.

They head after her.

          Affirmative.

                      WILL

          I guess sometimes friendship means
          acting with your heart, not your
          head.

                      ROBOT

          Logic error. Friendship does not
          compute.

                      WILL

          Don't worry, Robot. Im going to build
          you a new body. I promise.

Will turns to face a pile of pirated components from various par of
the ship. He lifts a circular bubble of diodes. Smiles.

INT.-BRIDGE

Maureen stands at her life sciences station with John and Don.

                      MAUREEN

          The atmosphere here can sustain human
          life. I've located 500 Rads
          radioactive material a mile north.

                      JOHN

          That's at least what we'd need to get
          the core functioning again.

John looks out the viewscreen at the alien night. Turns to Don.

                      JOHN

          We'll set off at daybreak. it'll be
          safer. Those are my orders, Major.

                      WEST

          I agree with your recommendation,
          Professor.

                      MAUREEN

          Dtente is a beautiful thing.

INT.-SICK BAY

Judy examines the lizard monkey. Penny strokes the tiny creature,
producing a string of BLIPS.

                      PENNY

          What's the diagnosis, Doc? Is it
          cowboy or ballerina on Halloween?

                      JUDY

          Right now she's a girl. But I think
          your little pal here is from a
          self-replicating species. At
          different stages of life she, or he,
          probably alternates sexes.

                      PENNY

          Imagine the savings on dating outfits
          alone.

The tiny creature has begun playing with an aural scanner.

                      PENNY

          Can I keep her?

                      JUDY

          Penny, you've never taken care of a
          thing in your life besides yourself.

                      PENNY

          Please. She's all alone. I promise
          I'll look after her. She needs me.

                      JUDY

          ...The moment you misplace her, or
          forget to feed her, we leave her on
          this planet where she can live in the
          wild. I'm not kidding Penny.

And with that Judy EXITS. Penny sits, stroking the tiny creature.

                      PENNY

          We're both a long way from home,
          aren't we little one?

The creature makes a tiny BLIP.

                      PENNY

          That's what we'll call you. Blip.

Blip reaches out, touches a green ribbon around Penny's wrist.

                      PENNY

          You like that?

Penny takes the ribbon off, ties it around Blip's wrist. Blip looks
up, eyes glowing. Penny caresses the tiny creature's cheek.

                      PENNY

          Nice girl. Pretty girl. Nice.

The creature reaches up, touches Penny's cheek. Her tiny tongue trying
to imitate Penny's words of comfort.

PULL BACK TO REVEAL

Judy stands, just out of sight, watching her sister, smiling.

CHAPTER 16: Alien World
-----------------------


INT.-JUPITER TWO-MED LAB

Don shoves an indignant Smith into the room, adjusts a newly installed
security panel in the wall.

                      SMITH

          Remove that lock this instant. I
          shall not be caged like some animal

                      WEST

          (lethal)

          I gave my word I'd let you live. I
          never said for how long.

                      SMITH

          These quarters will be fine.

Smith stares at him a beat.

                      SMITH

          Tell me, Major West. Are you really
          confident in Robinson's ability to
          guide us? If I were set free, I would
          support your right to command. With
          minimal force, we could take this
          ship and assure this mission
          continues under your leadership.

                      WEST

          ...My God Smith, you're right. How
          could I have been so blind? I'll just
          run and get you a gun so we can
          hijack the ship. Okay?

                      SMITH

          Sarcasm is the recourse of a weak
          mind.

                      WEST

          I'm hiding the pain. Really.

And with that West leaves.

Smith tries the door. Locked. Then, from one cuff of his field suit,
be removes the control belt he stole from the probe ship.

                      SMITH

          I assure you, Major West. Your pain
          has just begun.

Smith moves about the room, lifting small bits of metal, creating an
impromptu set of tools with which to alter the control bolt.

PAN DOWN. HOLD on SMITH'S BACK. Beneath the rend in his suit, the tiny
tear in his flesh is now covered with tiny, alien scales.

INT. -BRIDGE-NIGHT

Judy sits in one of the command chairs over a the remains of a meal,
sipping water, staring out into the alien night.

                      WEST (OVER)

          Star light, star bright...

                      JUDY

          A million strange stars and only one
          wish. I wish we were home.

Don comes and sits in the co-pilot's chair beside her.

                      JUDY

          I never thought a sky could look so
          alien. ...We really are lost.

                      WEST

          When the first sailors circled the
          globe and saw a brand new sky, they
          thought they had sailed off the edge
          of the earth. But they were really
          just around the corner.

                      JUDY

          (smiles)

          We just billow our sails and let the
          wind blow us home, Is that it Major?

                      WEST

          So those sailors found familiar
          shapes in the stars to make the skies
          more friendly, to help them find
          their way.

Don turns on a monitor below the viewscreen. MONITOR-CLOSE. It shows
the star-field above. He lifts a light-tipped stylus.

                      WEST

          That's how constellations were born.

Don begins to draw on the screen, connecting the stars like dots in a
children's book. Slowly, a familiar porcine face takes form.

                      WEST

          Porky the wise and mighty Pig.

Judy LAUGHS. She takes the stylus. Begins to draw.

                      JUDY

          The great bucktoothed Bunny... Bugs.

Don smiles. Judy can't help but smile back. Their faces are close.

                      WEST

          So, my quarters or yours?

                      JUDY

          Excuse me?

                      WEST

          We are the only single man and woman
          of consenting age in the galaxy. How
          much more of a set up do you need?

                      JUDY

          So you figure just dispense with the
          pleasantries, get down to business?

                      WEST

          You have a way with words, Doctor.

                      JUDY

          (provocative)

          Right here? On this console?

Don moves his face to hers, only a breath apart.

                      WEST

          Here would be fine.

Judy smiles sweetly.

DON-CLOSE. Lips parting. Suddenly water begins to pour down over his
head. His eyes open wide. Judy holds her empty glass in hand.

                      JUDY

          Next time, fly slower.

She rises, walks off, leaving Don mopping his brow.

INT.-JOHN & MAUREEN'S QUARTERS

Maureen sits on the edge of her bed brushing her hair as John
activates the automated security systems.

                      JOHN

          What was I thinking, bringing us all
          out here into space?

                      MAUREEN

          The world needed saving. You were the
          right man for the job.

                      JOHN

          But solving the world's problems
          doesn't leave much time for the
          people you love, does it?

                      MAUREEN

          Did you get any time with Will?

                      JOHN

          Now he's decided he can rebuild the
          robot. Wants to show me his designs.
          I've got too much to do-

                      MAUREEN

          Funny creatures, men. You try so hard
          not to be your fathers, end up making
          the same mistakes. Will adores you.
          He needs your attention.

                      JOHN

          We can't get off this planet much
          less back on course. I don't have
          time to...

                      MAUREEN

          John, just listen to him. it doesn't
          matter what he's saying. Just listen.
          Sometimes, at least in the eyes of
          their fathers, little boys have to
          come first.

                      JOHN

          As soon as we get back into space,
          we're going to spend some real time
          together. I promise.

Maureen looks out the window. A long beat. Then she smiles.

                      JOHN

          What?

                      MAUREEN

          It's nice to have our family under
          one roof. Even if we had to go half
          way across the galaxy to manage it.

John presses a button, the blast shield opening to reveal the stacked
orbs of three glowing moons. Maureen smiles.

                      JOHN

          How would you feel about a little
          late night tutorial, Professor?

John moves to her, begins pulling her down, out of FRAME.

                      MAUREEN

          Mm. That's new. What are you doing?

                      JOHN

          Going for extra credit.

EXT.-JUPITER TWO-NIGHT

The ship sits on the alien landscape.

                      MAUREEN (OVER)

          Good night John.

                      JOHN (OVER)

          Good night Maureen.

                      WILL (OVER)

          Good night Judy.

                      PENNY (OVER)

          Good night Will.

                      JUDY (OVER)

          Good night Penny.

                      WEST (OVER)

          You guys have got to be kidding.

CHAPTER 17: The Core
--------------------


INT.-JUPITER TWO-BRIDGE-MORNING

Will comes up on the elevator, rubbing his eyes, first awake in the
morning. He stumbles to the viewscreen.

WILL-CLOSE. His eyes widen with shock.

                      WILL

          Oh man.

REVERSE ANGLE

A giant portal shimmers at snow's edge about 100 yards from the ship.
Beyond it, a sun-stained field of towering plants and trees.

INT.-BRIEFING ROOM

The crew gathers at the table. (OVER) a RUMBLING. The ship shakes.

                      PENNY

          What are those rumblings? They've
          been happening all morning.

                      JUDY

          How can half the landscape have grown
          up overnight?

                      JOHN

          Okay, let's get settled. Maureen?

MAUREEN'S MONITOR-CLOSE. A geothermal analysis shows the giant plates
that make up this world appear mismatched.

                      MAUREEN

          It's impossible. But this planet's
          geothermic plates don't match up.

                      JOHN

          I was afraid of this.

Al1 eyes turn to John.

                      JOHN

          I think these tremors are the result
          of opening and closing doorways.

                      PENNY

          Doorways to where?

                      JOHN

          The future.

                      SMITH

          Perhaps the Professor was hit on the
          head when we landed.

                      JOHN

          Remember the portal that lead us to
          the probe ship? What if we crossed a
          into a time years after Earth sent a
          rescue mission.

                      WEST

          You're not serious? Time travel is
          impossible.

                      WILL

          No it's not. It's just improbable.
          Like hyperdrive was a hundred years
          ago. Nothing's really impossible.

                      JOHN

          This world could be riddled with
          doorways to the future.

                      WILL

          So if we walk into that forest
          outside, we're really just walking
          into this crater years from now.

                      MAUREEN

          Geological plates from different
          times wouldn't fit together. That
          would explain the tectonic mismatch.
          But doorways in time, John?

                      JOHN

          If these portals are opening and
          closing, part of some cascading,
          natural phenomenon, they could be
          tearing this planet apart

                      WILL

          These portals are exactly what I
          predicted my time machine would do.
          What if the doorways aren't natural?
          A machine that bends space, like our
          hyperdrive, could be modified to bend
          time as well. What if someone on this
          world has built a device?

                      JOHN

          Son, I appreciate your input but now
          isn't the time for flights of fancy.

                      WILL

          You never listen to me. Not ever.

And with that Will storms out. John stares after him a beat, sorely
wanting to follow. (OVER) another RUMBLE.

                      JOHN

          There's no telling how long before
          this planet breaks up entirely.

          (rising).

          Don and I are going to locate the
          radioactive material for the core.
          Get the ship ready to go. We may have
          very little time.

INT. -BRIDGE

John, suited up, heads for the open front hatch when he spots Will
sitting alone in the Com chair, tinkering with his deck.

                      JOHN

          Aren't you coming out to say goodbye?

Will just shakes his head.

                      WILL

          You're always leaving. What if...

Will looks away, finally giving voice to his worst fear.

                      WILL

          What if one time you don't come
          home...

John stares at his son, unsure what to say, the boy's anguish so deep
and apparent. He reaches into his shirt, takes off his dog tags.

                      JOHN

          Whenever your grandfather went away
          on a mission, held leave these with
          me. For safe keeping. And when he got
          home I d always be waiting to give
          them back.

He lifts the chain and places it around the boy's neck.

                      JOHN

          I'm coming back Will. I promise.

Will is silent. John touches the boy's hair, then walks out. A beat.
Will looks up after his father, fingering the dog tags.

EXT.-JUPITER TWO

The Robinsons, all except Will, stand-gathered around the front of the
ship. Don has a small tracking device in his hand.

                      WEST

          I've got a fix on the radioactive
          material. It's through the portal.

                      JOHN

          We'll just have to hope the doorways
          remain stable.

                      JUDY

          These crater walls are disabling the
          com-links. You won't be able to
          communicate with the ship.

(OVER) the ground shakes again.

                      Maureen

          Come home to me, Professor.

                      JOHN

          I love you, wife.

John kisses her. Don looks at Judy.

                      JUDY

          I'm going to regret saying this, But
          try to get back in one piece.

                      WEST

          This is kind of a kiss for luck
          occasion, wouldn't you agree, Doc?

                      JUDY

          See. I'm regretting it already.

          (coy)

          Kisses have to be earned. Say
          goodbye, Blip.

Blip reaches up and touches John's face. Then her CHIRPS form a rough
approximation of the words Penny taught her.

                      BLIP

          Nice girl. Pretty girl. Nice.

                      JOHN

          You take care of her, Penny.

          (kisses her head)

          Take care of you too, baby.

Then the two men bead off, towards the portal and forest beyond.

PULL BACK TO REVEAL

Smith stares out the cabin window. PUSH IN as

INT.-SMITH'S CELL

                      SMITH

          Yes, enjoy your moments of trite
          familial bonding.

He turns, heads back to his table, transformed now, into a makeshift
lab, the stolen control bolt in mid-modification.

                      SMITH

          Because they will be your last.

INT.-WILL'S CABIN

The beginnings of Will's home-made robot sits on the table. WILL is in
the f.g. riffling his PERSONAL CARGO container.

Penny ENTERS, an assortment of small electronic devices, hairclips,
and other metal and electronic objects. Dumps them on the table.

                      PENNY

          That's everything even close to
          nonessential. Even my bellybutton
          ring.

                      WILL

          Thanks, Pen.

                      PENNY

          You want to come on a land survey?

But Will just shakes his head, sulky.

                      PENNY

          Look, what does dad know? Maybe
          someone did build a time machine.

She ruffles his hair. Disappears. Will activates a CPU speaker.

                      ROBOT

          Robot is on line.

(OVER) a KNOCKING has begun. WILL looks up, puzzled.

                      WILL

          It sounds like old morse code.


Chapter 18: Danger Will!
------------------------


INT.-CORRIDOR

Will walks down the corridor. (OVER) The KNOCKING continues. Will
follows the SOUND until he comes to the door of Smith's prison.

Smith is visible through the door window, sitting at a table,
hammering out the code with his boot. He beckons Will inside.

Will shakes his head. Smith begins TAPPING again.

                      WILL

          (sounding out the code)

          Danger.

INT.-SMITH'S CELL

The door slides open and Will ENTERS, a laser pistol in hand.

                      WILL

          You said someone is in danger.

                      SMITH

          We all are. You are wise to arm
          yourself.

Smith eyes the weapon, moving towards the boy.

                      WILL

          This gun is set to fire for me only
          so don't try anything funny.

Smith barely misses a beat as he adjusts, passing the child, going
instead to the window and opening the blast shield.

                      SMITH

          William, you misjudge me. I only want
          to help you.

                      WILL

          Help us? You tried to kill us all.

                      SMITH

          But now our fates are intertwined. if
          your father and that idiot West fail,
          I will have no chance of getting
          home. It is in my best interests they
          succeed. And I always follow my best
          interests.

Smith gazes out at the exotic terrain. (OVER) an inhuman WAIL.

                      SMITH

          What monsters roam these alien wilds?
          Fools. To set off blindly across this
          savage land. Much as I hate to admit
          it, it will be harder to manage
          without them.

                      WILL

          What are you talking about? They'll
          be back. They'll be okay.

Smith is silent. A long, lethal beat.

                      WILL

          Someone should go after them.

                      SMITH

          Will, I forbid it. You're a boy. A
          clever one, certainly, but a child
          nonetheless. This planet is likely
          full of predators. Even if you found
          them, what if they're hurt, ravaged,
          dying, what good could you do?

                      WILL

          But you're a doctor.

Smith turns away, hiding his smile.

EXT.-JUPITER TWO-DAY

Judy and Maureen are hanging on repelling lines before the crater
wall, shipping away ore that glitters like diamonds.

                      JUDY

          It's impossible.

                      MAUREEN

          Not really. Geologists have
          speculated that Dimondium might be
          naturally occurring in many older
          worlds. Part of a biosphere's way of
          rejuvenating itself.

                      JUDY

          This one is ten times more powerful
          then that on Alpha Prime. There's
          enough here to save Earth.

Penny stands in the f.g. with Blip on her arm, taking plant samples,
talking into her video recorder.

                      PENNY

          After much deliberation, the Space
          Captive has decided to accept her new
          role as member of the crew. The
          Robinsons, after all, can  obviously
          use her help...

Blip jumps up on Penny's arm, knocking her recorder to the ground.

                      PENNY

          (flaring)

          Now look what you've done. Stop
          hanging all over me.

Blip stares at her, frightened by her tone, begins backing away to the
edge of the forest. She looks at Penny, then disappears into the thick
brush..

                      PENNY

          Blip. Wait. I'm sorry. Damn.

Penny heads after the creature. HOLD on her recorder. Forgotten.


CHAPTER 19: A Different Future
------------------------------


EXT.-PLANET'S SURFACE-DAY

Will and Smith are walking down a forest path. The boy has a radiation
tracker in his hand.

                      WILL

          I've got a fix on Dad's suit beacon.

Dead ahead is a field of beautiful, alien flowers, their purple leaves
moving in the wind like an azure sea.

                      WILL

          Wow, that's Mom's favorite color.

                      SMITH

          How droll.

(OVER) a tremendous RUMBLING. The WIND ROARS. Suddenly, the air in the
distance begins to twist, a rushing distortion sweeping towards them,
flowers growing, landscape aging rapidly within.

                      SMITH

          Run, child, run.

Smith turns, begins to flee, pulling Will with him, away from the
rushing warp. Smith trips, falls, closes his eyes, waiting for the
distortion to overtake him. A beat. He opens his eyes.

SMITH-POV. A glowing, stationary portal shimmers behind him, revealing
beyond a forest ever older, darker, more overgrown.

                      SMITH

          Will? Will?

No sign of the boy. Then, from behind a tree, Will appears.

                      WILL

          Wow!

The field across the portal has is now a mass of giant plants, the
flowers a deep red. Will rushes across the rip in space.

                      SMITH

          William, wait!

                      WILL

          See, over here I'm in the future.

(steps back towards Smith)

          Here I'm in the past. Don't worry.
          If my theories are correct, these
          doorways should remain stable, for
          a while anyway.

                      SMITH

          I can barely contain my glee. Why
          aren't you aging like the plants?

                      WILL

          That's just an effect of the portals
          forming. Once they stabilize you can
          cross from one time to another
          just like stepping between two
          rooms.

          (off his tracker)

          Dad's signal is this way. Come on,
          Doctor Smith.

Will takes Smith's hand, pulls him across the threshold.

SMITH-POV. Where he stands is now lush, the sky overhead a glowing
crimson. Yet behind him, the path in as it originally appeared.
Younger. The sky, bright. Will has run deeper into the brush.

Smith notices something by his feet. He clears away the brush,
revealing shapes beneath the foliage. His expression darkens.

                      WILL (OVER)

          What did you find?

Will has returned.

                      SMITH

          Come, come, son, no time for
          distractions. Let's move on.

Smith shoves Will on, the boy unable to see what Smith saw.

PAN DOWN. Headstones. Each bears a marking, the names still legible.
Maureen, Penny and Judy Robinson.

EXT.-PLANET'S SURFACE-DAY-PRES

John and Don emerge from the brush. They have come to one of the
crater walls. John looks from the rock face to his tracker.

                      JOHN

          Damn.

                      WEST

          Damn? Damn is not good.

                      JOHN

          The radiation signature we've been
          tracking. it's a  ghost. A
          reflection from the Jupiter Two
          bouncing off the ore in these walls.
          There's no core material here.

(OVER) a sudden RUMBLING. The ground shakes. The ROAR of WIND. A time
portal rushes towards them like a glittering maw, the side of the
crater aging and crumbling in it's wake.

John and Don race away from the distortion, ducking falling trees,
roll clear as the portal stabilizes, now a fixed doorway to a darker,
more deserted future.

                      JOHN

          The ship's back that way. we have to
          go through.

EXT.-BRUSH-DAY-PRESENT

Penny is pushing through the forest.

                      PENNY

          Blip? I'm sorry. Blip?

She spots the tiny creature ahead in the distance. Blip SNIFFS the
ground, runs a few steps. SNIFFS again. Looks up. There, before Blip
is another glittering hole in time. The forest beyond is far thicker,
the sky red. Blip steps through the portal.

                      PENNY

          Blip, wait.

Penny goes to the edge of the portal, stares at the monstrously tall
trees beyond. A beat. Then she steps through, following.

EXT.-CRATER CAVES-FUTURE

Penny pushes through dwindling brush to a series of rocky overhangs
and caverns cut into the crater wall.

BLIP is standing over a large circular stone, hopping up and down,
CHIRPING and BLIPPING madly.

                      PENNY

          Blip, you can't run off like that.

(closing on the stone)

          What the-?

THE STONE-CLOSE. A series of hieroglyphs are painted on the giant
rock, their images the same style as those on the probe ship.

HIEROGLYPH ONE-CLOSE. A mighty battle in space is depicted.

                      PENNY (OVER)

          Some kind of fight, in space. It
          almost looks like the probe ship
          Major West blew up.

HIEROGLYPH TWO-CLOSE. A fiery star falls to the planet's surface.

                      PENNY

          That could be the Jupiter Two crash
          landing.

HIEROGLYPH THREE-CLOSE. Here a dark haired beauty holds a single
lizard monkey aloft, her face remarkably like Penny's.

Suddenly BLIP begins to SHRIEK. (OVER) RUSTLING leaves.

SHAPES are moving in the trees, the vague outline of camouflaged forms
dropping to the ground. Five figures suddenly de-camouflage. Lizard
monkeys, two large, two smaller.

Directly in front of Penny, the largest monkey de-camouflages. Fully
grown, the beast is nearly twice Penny's height. Around the creature's
wrist is something odd. An old, tattered green ribbon.

BLIP begins to SCREAM and SHRIEK.

                      PENNY

          Blip, no!

Too late. Blip leaps on the giant creature, grabs the ribbon. The
beast could slap Blip away like a fly. But the creature doesn't
resist, just stares down at Blip with something akin to tenderness.

Blip looks at the ribbon in his hand. Then at the one around her
wrist. Save for their age difference., the ribbons are identical.

The giant monkey moves forward, closing on a petrified Penny, paw
reaching out, touching her face. The beast begins stroking Penny's
cheek in a familiar gesture of comfort.

                      GIANT BLIP

          Nice girl. Pretty girl. Nice.

Penny stares up in stunned wonder.

EXT.-PLANET'S SURFACE-EVENING-FUTURE

Don and John are crossing the brush. The terrain in growing ever more
desolate, desert like. The double suns hang on the horizon.


                      JOHN

          We should be able to see the ship.

Something catches the light on the ground beside them. Don reaches
down and lifts a small metal fragment in his hand.

METAL-CLOSE. On it is the familiar logo of the United Space Agency.

                      WEST

          Could these be from the probe?

                      JOHN

          Corroded. This metal is decades old.

Don finds another piece of wreckage, turns it over in his hand.

                      WEST

          It's not possible.

WRECKAGE-CLOSE. The fragment bears a simple legend: Jupiter Two.

                      WEST

          What kind of nightmare is this?
          Where the hell are we?

                      JOHN

          No, Major, when the hell are we?

Suddenly Don is hit in the chest with a plasma charge, goes flying.
John ducks and rolls, FIRING his laser from behind the cover of a
rocky mound. John goes up to take another SHOT, is bit with a powerful
electrical blast, falling hard. Still.

REVERSE ANGLE

Rolling out from behind him, claws extended in attack Position and
apparently many years old, is a rebuilt Robot.

EXT.-PLANET'S SURFACE-EVENING-FUTURE

Will and Smith are crossing the alien terrain. The plants have given
way to desert. The suns hang low in the crimson sky.

                      WILL

          I feel like we got turned around.

                      SMITH

          Just follow your father's signal,
          young William.

                      WILL

          Oh shit.

                      SMITH

          A boy of your intelligence shouldn't
          swear.

                      WILL

          (pointing)

          Look.

                      SMITH

          Oh. Shit, indeed.

REVERSE ANGLE. At the edge of the crater wall sits the wrecked hull of
the Jupiter Two. The lower sections are gone, the hull scarred, open
to the sun.


                                                               CUT TO:

JOHN-CLOSE. Stirring to consciousness.

WIDER

INT.-JUPITER TWO BRIDGE-FUTURE

Or what is left of it. Dark. The occasional COMPUTER panel flickers
Shattered monitors. An awful history-told in torn metal. John is
slumped in a corner, Don still on the floor beside him.

                      VOICE (OVER)

          Well, well. All things really do
          come to he who waits.

A FIGURE sits in the command chair, visage obscured by shadow.

                      JOHN

          What is this place?

                      FIGURE

          Why Professor, the shock must have
          scrambled your brain. Look around
          you. Don't you recognize the spot?
          You've come home.

                      JOHN

          This can't be...

But even as the words cross his lips, he knows it is.

                      JOHN

          What have you done to the ship.
          ...Where's my family?

                      FIGURE

          Your family is dead. Dead and in the
          ground.

                      JOHN

          No!

                      FIGURE

          What fickle consort in memory. Time
          dims certain images while others
          shine clear and bright as yesterday.

The figure stands, light hitting his face. Late thirties. Long blond
hair, a shaggy beard and moustache. Eerily familiar.

                      FIGURE

          I'll never forget that morning.
          Twenty years ago. What was it you
          said? I'll be back. I promise. But I
          knew better. You never came home.

The figure walks to one of the burned out panels.

                      FIGURE

          Without you, your family never had a
          chance. A few spidersv survived the
          destruction of the probe ship. They
          reached the planet and attacked. I
          can still hear the women scream.

                      JOHN

          Who are you?

The figure walks forward, into the light. Stands there a moment. Then
he lifts something hanging around his neck. Tarnished metal, old but
familiar. John's father's dog tags.

                      FIGURE

          Don't you recognize me, Dad? It's
          me. I'm your son. Will.

EXT.-CRATER CAVES-DAY

Maureen and Judy, lasers drawn, are pushing through the brush.

                      JUDY

          Penny? Penny?

The four lizard monkeys are kneeling in a circle around Penny.

                      MAUREEN

          Penny? Baby, are you alright?

Penny rises, steps forward, carrying Blip. The other beasts hang back,
their faces genuflecting, almost reverential.

                      PENNY

          It's okay, Mom. They're not going to
          hurt us. it's like  they think I'm
          their princess or something.


                                                               CUT TO:

EXT.-CRATER CAVES -EVENING-FLITURE

Judy is examining the palm of the largest beast as Maureen scrutinizes
the images graven into the giant stone.

                      JUDY

          Best as I can tell this whole clan
          was spawned by this single creature.

          (to the beast)

          We've been a busy girl haven't we?
          But...

                      MAUREEN

          Speak, doctor.

                      JUDY

          Each creature seems to have unique
          corpuscular patterns on their palms.
          As individual an fingerprints, no
          two alike. Except...

                      MAUREEN

          Except the prints on this giant
          creature and our little Blip
          match exactly. Don't they?

                      JUDY

          How did you know?

                      MAUREEN

          Because, I think Blip and our friend
          here are actually one and the same.

Penny and Judy stare at her in wonder.

INT.-JUPITER TWO-ENGINE ROOM-FUTURE

The Robot, shoving John with one claw, carrying Don in the other,
follows Older Will into the giant room.

                      OLDER WILL

          Father, I give you ... eternity.

                      WIDER

War torn and pirated. A pit of molten lava bursts through the floor
above which floats a giant ball of silvery liquid held suspended by
the pulsing field of the hyper-drive. Tendrils of fire strain towards
the bubble. As they EXPLODE into the silver liquid, images form within
the sphere, nearly coherent, then gone.

A tracked gantry stretches from the floor, leading out over the
bubble. At the end of the track a crow's-nest of COMPUTERS SHOOTS a
single laser down into the center of the bubble.

                      WEST

          (coming to)

          . . .ouch. Who ordered me that last
          drink? What the hell is going on?

                      JOHN

          I think we crossed into our own
          future. We've come back to the
          Jupiter Two decades after we left.

                      OLDER WILL

          Look father, what my flights of
          fancy have wrought. I used your
          hypergate to build my time machine.

Will moves to a control console at the base of the giant gantry.

                      OLDER WILL

          Over the years I have struggled in
          vain to harness the awesome power of
          time. All my experiments at creating
          a stable doorway have been futile.
          Until now. Today you will witness my
          ultimate triumph.

Will hits a button. A generator opens, revealing a glowing cylinder of
core material incrementally descending into the console.

                      WEST

          The core material. if we could get
          that back to our Jupiter Two...

                      JOHN

          The doorways in time that led us
          here must be a side effect of his
          machine coming on line. Like streams
          running into the ocean....

                      OLDER WILL

          Once this core material in fully
          introduced into the control console,
          I will open a doorway stable enough
          for one person to take one trip
          through time and space as well.
          Today, I will change history.

Will turns a switch on the control console. (OVER) More TREMORS. The
laser beam's intensity grown, and in the corridor cut by the beam into
the bubble images begins to stabilize. Images of Earth.

                      OLDER WILL

          I will return home, to the very day
          you took us on this cursed mission.
          I'll stop us from taking off. I'll
          do what you never could. I'll save
          the family. I'll save us all.

                      JOHN

          Look around. Your machine is ripping           this planet
apart. What if the force
          wave you ride home has the same
          effect on Earth? What if, in getting
          home, you destroy Earth in the
          process?

A beat. Then Will turns away, goes back to work.

                      OLDER WILL

          I'm going home. I'm going to save
          the family.

                      JOHN

          Will, I'm your father. You've got to
          listen to me-.

                      OLDER WILL

          Let me tell you about my father. My
          father was a walking ghost. Never
          there when I needed him. He dragged
          his family into deep dark space and
          lost them there. My father is not
          coming to the rescue.

CHAPTER 20: Spiders Sting
-------------------------


EXT.-ALIEN PLAnet-EVENING-FUTURE

Will and Smith are closing on the battered ship. Smith puts his hand
on the boy's arm, holding him back.

                      WILL

          We've got to go inside.

                      SMITH

          Slow down, now. We can't know what
          waits inside that ravaged craft. But
          we can be confidant it is nothing
          good. And I for one am frightened.

                      WILL

          But Dad's in there.

                      SMITH

          Will, listen to me. I have crossed
          this world with you, found your
          father as promised. But I can't let
          you go in there unarmed.

                      WILL

          But I've got a gun.

                      SMITH

          If we go forward, the barer of that
          weapon must be ready to kill. Murder
          is a skill, one which I have
          developed and, luckily dear boy, you
          have not. Look inside your heart,
          Will. Are you truly capable of
          taking a life? If not, then I ask
          you now, put your faith in me. Give
          me your trust. Give me that gun.

Will stares him. Pulls free the pistol. Thumbs the lock pad.

                      WILL

          Enable gun for all users.


                      GUN

          Voiceprint confirmed.

Will hands Smith the gun.

                      SMITH

          Finally.

Smith grabs Will by the neck, pressing the barrel to his temple.

                      SMITH

          A brief lesson in survival on this
          world or any other. Never trust
          anyone. Remember it into your old
          age, should you have one.

          (shoving him forward)

          Now move!

INT.-JUPITER TWO-ENGINE ROOM-FUTURE

John stands facing older Will. Don is in the b.g., edging towards the
control panel and the descending core material.

                      JOHN

          We can go back across the portals to
          the past, to the functioning Jupiter
          Two, where your mother and sisters
          are still alive. We can use this
          core material to escape together.

                      OLDER WILL

          And then what? All of us lost in
          space. Don't you see? I can do what
          you never could. I can save us all.

Don has edged his way to the descending core material.

                      SMITH (OVER)

          I'm afraid not.

          Through the doorway comes young
          Will, Smith walking behind him, hand
          on his shoulder, gun to his head.

                      SMITH

          Never fear. Smith is here.

                      JOHN

          Will, I. . .

                      SMITH

          Don't move, Professor Robinson or
          this rather peculiar family reunion
          will be tragically brief.

          (off Don)

          I'll ask you to step away from that
          console, Major.

Don stares at him a beat. Then obliges, walking over to join John.
Smith approaches the Robot.

                      SMITH

          Well, well, some of us just don't
          know when to stay dead.

Smith goes into his tunic and removes his modified control bolt.

                      SMITH

          I borrowed this from the probe ship
          in hopes of taking over the helm
          once we were in flight. But I seem
          to have found a better use instead.

Smith slaps the bolt on the Robot's CPU. The automaton's arms go up,
then fall limp. Docile.

                      SMITH

          Let's try this dance again. You are
          the puppet. I am the puppeteer. Do
          get it right this time.

Smith activates the bolt. The Robot powers up once again.

                      SMITH

          Robot, enable electric disrupters.

The Robot's claws begin to glow with electricity. Smith smiles.

                      SMITH

          Now that's a good gargantuan.

Smith walks to Older Will, puts the gun to his head.

                      SMITH

          Say goodbye to your past. You're
          future lies with me. I'm going home
          in your place.

Smith starts to pull Older Will away when Will comes forward, staring
at the time machine, eyes wide with awe.

                      WILL

          You did it. Just like I imagined.
          Re-routed the hypercore. But the
          natural power source, the delivery
          system. I never thought of those.

Older Will's smile is bittersweet as he places his hand on his younger
self. Touches his hair.

                      OLDER WILL

          You will. The future is never what
          it looks like when you're ten.

                      SMITH

          Heartwarming. Nauseatingly
          sentimental but heartwarming.

Smith shoves the boy back to his father, turns to Older Will.

                      SMITH

          We certainly could have aged better,
          I must say Now, show me how your
          little time machine works.

But Will just smiles.

                      SMITH

          An odd moment for mirth, don't you
          think? What are you grinning at?

                      OLDER WILL

          Look around you, Doctor. At this
          hostile world. Do you really think a
          boy could have survived all alone?

SMITH-CLOSE. Puzzled. Unseen, the boulder behind him seems to be
moving, shifting. A VOICE comes, alien, yet terrifyingly familiar.

                      VOICE (OVER)

          Never fear, Smith is here.

The shape behind him unfolds, coming up now, long spindled arms and
legs, ten feet tall, a hybrid monster, half spider, half Smith.

                      SPIDER SMITH

          Hello, Doctor, how nice to see me
          again after all these years.

Smith stands petrified as the creature approaches him on spindled
legs, goes down on its second knee joints, coming eye to eye.

                      SPIDER SMITH

          The spider's sting had some
          unexpected side effects.

Spider Smith flexes his three jointed arm.

                      SPIDER SMITH

          But my unique gifts gave me an
          advantage in this quarrelsome world.

Spider Smith reaches out and caresses Will's cheek. Turns  to John.

                      SPIDER SMITH

          After the women were savaged, I
          became the father Will never had.

He grabs Smith's arms and begins to move him about like a marionette,
engaging in a bizarre dance with himself.

                      SPIDER SMITH

          (bending him)

          But you, Doctor. Your crude ambition
          fills me with self-loathing.

          (twisting him)

          You see I have looked within me and
          what I see is you.

With that Spider Smith lifts Smith over his head and hurls him like
torpedo through a torn hole in the hull, towards the rocks beyond.

                      SPIDER SMITH

          I never liked me, anyway.

Spider Smith turns to face the Robot.

                      SPIDER SMITH

          Kill them all.

                      OLDER WILL

          No.

                      SPIDER SMITH

          But my dear boy, once the doorway in
          time stabilizes, this planet is
          going to come apart at the seams.

Smith throws the back of one hand over his forehead in a parody of a
twenties starlet.

                      SPIDER SMITH

          I am willing to perish here on this
          world for the sake of your most
          noble mission. But your selfish
          father will only try to stop you.

His head comes forward, neck elongating so he faces WILL.

                      SPIDER SMITH

          Once your mission is complete, none
          of this will have happened anyway.
          So why not just dispose of them?

But Will's gaze is impassive. Spider Smith actually SIGHS.

                      SPIDER SMITH

          Very well. Robot, take them inside
          the ship and keep them there. If
          they move, then kill them.

ECT.-CRATER CAVES-FUTURE

Maureen and Judy are examining the heiroglyph stone. The ground
shakes. Birds SCREAM. (OVER) RUMBLING.

                      MAUREEN

          We've got to get to the ship. Penny?

She turns. The clearing is empty. No Blips. No Penny. Blip runs cut
before them, grabs Maureen's hand, trying to pull her forward.

                      MAUREEN

          Where is she, girl?

In Blip's hand, a mass of colored ribbons from Penny's wrists. Blip
waves them in the air, then races off. A beat. The women follow.

INT.-JUPITER TWO-ENGINE ROOM-FUTURE

The pulse laser is increasing its intensity, the corridor of images in
the bubble stabilizing. The TREMORS are increasing in frequency.

PAN DOWN

Spider Smith stands with Will, watching as the Robot shepherds the
crew towards the body of the ship.

                      SPIDER SMITH

          Well, it would seem the time is upon
          us. Off we go, William.

Spider Smith starts climbing the gantry, truly like a spider, up
towards the bridge and crows nest hanging over the bubble.

Will walks to the control console platform, the platform now beginning
to rise on the gantry, towards the bridge above.

JOHN-POV. Something hangs from below the climbing Spider Smith's back.
It's an egg pouch of the kind they saw on the probe ship log.

                      JOHN

          (shouting)

          Will, it's a trick. Smith's carrying
          an egg sack. If he's willing to stay
          on this world and die, why is he
          about to spawn? He's going through
          the portal himself.

The Robot FIRES a charge between its claws.

                      ROBOT

          Proceed to the ship or be destroyed.

ON THE RISING CONTROL PLATFORM.

OLDER WILL-CLOSE. Frowns.

Suddenly, Smith's head drops INTO FRAME. The creature is hanging
upside-down. He smiles.

                      SPIDER SMITH

          Hurry, boy. Time waits for no man.

EXT.-GANTRY SYSTEM-WIDE SHOT

The platform bearing Will reaches the top of the gantry and begins
moving out across the bridge towards the crows-nest.

INT.-JUPITER TWO-ENGINE ROOM CONTROL PLATFORM-FUTURE

Spider Smith drops into place beside Older Will as the control
platform comes to a stop on the crow's-nest.

The core cylinder continues sinking into the console. Smith looks out
over the platform. Beneath them, imagine of infinity flicker.

                      SPIDER SMITH

          It's almost time. I really am a
          word-smith.

                      OLDER WILL

          Once the core cylinder is fully
          injected, the planet will begin to
          come apart and the time doorway will
          stabilize. Then I jump in.

                      SPIDER SMITH

          A leap of faith. How fitting.

TIME BUBBLE-CLOSE. In the circle made by the laser, the images are not
yet stable, but discernable. Earth the day before the launch.

                      OLDER WILL

          Tell me again, old monster, how did
          the girls die?

                      SPIDER SMITH

          We've been over this before, son.
          The spiders attacked the ship

                      OLDER WILL

          In all the years since, the spiders
          have never re-surfaced. Why?

Smith stares at him. Then he smiles. A horrible sight.

                      SPIDER SMITH

          Let's forget the past.

Will turns a switch. The laser generated aperture narrows.

                      SPIDER SMITH

          What are you doing?

                      OLDER WILL

          Focusing the aperture. Remember, the
          energy around the portal will rip a
          man to pieces.

                      SPIDER SMITH

          Isn't the doorway too small?

                      OLDER WILL

          Not for me.

          (a beat)

          But then I'm not going, am I? The
          spiders didn't kill the girls. It
          was you. I just never let myself see
          it. You kept me alive because you
          needed me. Because I could build
          this for you. You killed my family.
          Destroyed this world. And I helped.
          You became mad as the spiders.
          ...And I became you.

                      SPIDER SMITH

          Poor, poor boy. Did you really think
          I would let you go home? Let all
          that I have become vanish? Look at
          me. I am no mere man. I am a God.

Spider Smith opens his pouch, revealing a thousand tiny spiders.

                      SPIDER SMITH

          Your father was right. Within me
          roil the growing needs of a master
          race. We WILL descend upon helpless
          Earth. An entire planet to rule.

His arm whips out, grabbing Will, bringing him close, opens his mouth,
bearing venomous fangs.

                      SPIDER SMITH

          An entire planet on which to feed.

INT.-MODIFIED JUPITER TWO-FUTURE

John and Don talk in the holding area. The Robot stands guard. (OVER)
the TREMORS are increasing in frequency.

                      WEST

          I'll run, draw his fire. You may
          have time to get away with Will.

                      ROBOT (OVER)

          Halt or Robot will destroy.

The men look up. In the b.g., Will has approached the Robot.

                      WILL

          Do you remember what I taught you. A
          long time ago. About friendship?

                      ROBOT

          Friendship means acting with your
          heart not your head.

                      WILL

          That's why I rebuilt you. Because I
          wanted us to be friends.

                      ROBOT

          Logic error. Friendship does not
          compute.

                      WILL

          Forget logic. Act with your heart.

                      ROBOT

          Robot has no heart. Robot is powered
          by a fusion pulse generator

                      WILL

          Every living thing has a heart.

The Robot stares at him a beat.

                      ROBOT

          Any attempts to override command
          protocols may result in fused
          processors in my neural net.

The floor trembles again. The planet is coming apart at the seams.

                      WILL

          Please, Robot, if you don't let us
          go, we're all going to die. I'm
          asking you now, will you help us?
          Will you be my friend?

The Robot stands still a beat. Then he reaches towards Smith's control
bolt attached firmly on his CPU.

                      ROBOT

          Robot attempting to deactivate
          control bolt-commands
          overriddenattempting to
          reroute-dangercircuitry
          overloadattempting to escape-kill
          them, kill them...

The Robot's claws lift into attack position, an electrical charge
building with dangerous intensity. He is about to fire.

At the last minute, the Robot jerks his hand upward, BLOWING away a
piece of the ceiling. He rips off the control bolt.

                      WILL

          You did it.

                      ROBOT

          Robot will save ... I will save Will
          Robinson. I will save my friend.


CHAPTER 21: Time to Die!
------------------------


EXT.-FOREST-DAY-PRESENT

Penny and Maureen chase a frantic Blip through the portal back into
the daylight of the present. Here, too, the world RUMBLES.

                      MAUREEN

          (shouting )

          Penny? Penny?

Penny stands in front of the Jupiter Two, beckoning them urgently.

                      MAUREEN

          Where did you go?

                      PENNY

          I came through the forest. I had a
          promise I had to keep.

Before Maureen can respond the ground RUMBLES, begins crumbling.

                      JUDY

          Inside. Fast.

INT.-JUPITER TWO BRIDGE-FUTURE

Don, John, Will and the Robot stand at the open hatch. Outside, the
ground RUMBLES.

                      JOHN

          You've got find your way back to the
          ship. The portals may still be
          stable. I'll try to meet you there.

                      WEST

          What do you mean?

                      JOHN

          I'm going to get that core material.
          It's our only chance to escape.

                      WEST

          I'll stay. The family needs their
          father

                      JOHN

          The crew needs their pilot. No
          matter what happens, when the planet
          starts to break up you take off.

                      WEST

          Without the core we'll never have
          enough power to make orbit.

                      JOHN

          You've got to try. Promise me, Don.

A beat. Then Don extends his hand.

                      WEST

          Good luck. Commander.

Just then Will and the Robot arrive.

                      JOHN

          Will. Son. I want you to know-

                      WILL

          (fighting tears)

          You'll tell me when you get back to
          the ship. Now there just isn't time.

John bites back a bittersweet smile. (OVER) another RUMBLING.

                      JOHN

          I could use a weapon.

The Robot extends his claw. A panel opens on his arm and he tears out
a hand-made component. A conduit made from Will's golden first prize
medals, joined together to make a jagged star.

                      ROBOT

          Professor, I have a plan.

INT.-JUPITER TWO-ENGINE ROOM CONTROL PLATFORM-FuTURE

Spider Smith has Will against the rail.

                      SPIDER SMITH

          Time to die, son.

                      OLDER WILL

          I'm not your son.

And with that Will SMASHES Spider Smith in the face with two closed
lists. Smith recoils, lifts the boy aver his head.

                      SPIDER SMITH

          Goodbye.

Smith hurls Will over the rail towards the time pool below.

The creature walks to the end of the arm, stares at the forming
aperture into the past below him.

PORTAL-CLOSE. Images of the day before the mission launch swirl in the
laser-generated opening, growing ever more stable.

WIDER

Will is hanging over the time bubble, unconscious and unseen, dangling
from the gantry by a flashing chain around his neck.


CHAPTER 22: Time Travel
-----------------------


EXT:-PLANET'S SURFACE-EVENING-FUTURE

Don and the Robot, Will riding his back, navigate the terrain
alongside the ravaged hull of the Jupiter Two.

                      WILL

          Look.

On the ground, crumpled in a heap, is Smith. Don checks his pulse.

                      WEST

          (disappointed)

          Damn. He's still breathing.

(OVER) the rushing WIND. RUMBLING. A portal opens before them to a far
younger world. Then another portal, to a world far older. A third
portal RIPS across the sky overhead.

                      WILL

          The time machine must be near full
          power. The portals are collapsing.

                      WEST

          Which one leads us home?

More portals are opening around them, others winking shut.

                      WILL

          There.

Through a new rip in time, the intact Jupiter Two can be seen in
relief of the battered future craft. The ground beneath their feet is
beginning to give way.

                      WILL

          We can't just leave him here.

                      WEST

          Sure we can.

          (off WILL's stare)

          Damn it.

          (slapping the Doctor)

          Smith. Wake up. Smith.

                      SMITH

          (coming to)

          Oh, the pain, the pain.

                      ROBOT

          Danger. Will Robinson. Danger.

The PORTAL is beginning to shimmer. The ground starts to fall away.

                      WEST

          Jump!

Don hurls Smith through, Will, the Robot and West darting across the
threshold just as the portal winks closed.

EXT. -FOREST- PRESENT

The trees are bursting into flames an Will, Don, the Robot and Smith
emerge from the woods. Race forwards towards...

PULL BACK TO REVEAL

INT.-JUPITER TWO-BRIDGE-PRESENT

The women are powering up the ship. The men are visible through the
windscreen. Outside, the ground in beginning to crumble.

                      PENNY

          Mom, the forest.

Penny opens the air lock. Maureen holds close her son. Steps back.

                      MAUREEN

          Where's John?

                      WEST

          The portal closed behind us. It was
          his only way back.

MEE GROUND-CLOSE. A geyser of fire BLOWS into the air.

                      WEST

          We've got to try and lift off.

                      MAUREEN

          We've already begun the pre-flight
          countdown. You have the Com.

          (off Don's expression)

          I'm going to save as many lives as I
          can, Major. Now strap in.

INT.-JUPITER TWO-ENGINE ROOM CONTROL PLATFoRm-FUTURE

(OVER) TREMORS. More lava is rushing up towards the mercury, the walls
themselves beginning to crack.

SMITH opens a gate at the end of the crow's-nest and a gang plank
unfolds above the doorway in time.

                      JOHN (OVER)

          Not so fast.

WIDER

John stands on the platform behind Smith, fighting star in hand,
slashes for his face. Smith moves fast, knocking the star to the
gantry bridge with his arm. John leaps on Smith, using his fists.

                      JOHN

          You sabotaged our mission.

          (hook)

          You killed my family

          (jab)

          You stole my son. It's payback time.

Smith's head moves from each impact, but the punches have no effect.
It smiles. Grabs John and hurls him across the platform.

                      SPIDER SMITH

          Spare me the fury of the righteous.

The monster leans down over John. Opens its jaw.

                      SPIDER SMITH

          I think there's time for a snack
          before my trip.

John's hand is reaching towards the fallen fighting star. At the last
moment John grabs the metal weapon from the catwalk, slashes Smith
across the face, silver-red blood pouring down his cheek.

                      SPIDER SMITH

          (sarcastic)

          Oh, the pain. The pain.

                      JOHN

          You ain't seen nothing yet.

John feints towards Smith's head and then slashes low, cutting the
viscous membrane of the monster's egg pouch.

SPIDER SMITH-CLOSE. Surprised.

                      JOHN

          Remember the probe ship? These
          monsters eat their wounded.


SMITH'S EGG SACK-CLOSE. Scores of the tiny spiders are pouring out of
the sack, rushing up towards Smith's face, tiny jaws chomping.

                      SPIDER SMITH

          No. Stop. No!

Spider Smith tumbles backwards, falling against the rail on the side
of the platform. John rises and rushes him, SHOULDER-SLAMMING him,
sending Smith hurling over towards the bubble below.

Spider Smith hits the bubble, missing the doorway formed by the red
laser and is swept up by the tides of time.

                      JOHN

          Take all the time you want to die.


Spider Smith SCREAMS as he disappears and reappears in the various
half-formed images within the bubble before vanishing altogether.

John turns. The core cylinder has descended almost entirely into the
main console. only seconds before it's too late to retrieve it.

EXT.-JUPITER TWO-DAY-PRESENT

The landscape is a sudden inferno.

INT.-JUPITER TWO-PRESENT

Don is at the Com. Maureen strapped into the co-pilot's chair.

                      MAUREEN

          I kept hoping somehow he'd appear.

Maureen stares a beat out the window.

                      MAUREEN

          Let's go, Major.

Don hits the engine switch. The.mighty generators WHINE into life.

                      MAUREEN

          (quiet)

          Goodbye, my love.

CHAPTER 23: Escape Velocity
---------------------------


The ship rocks as land masses on all sides begin to give way.

                      WEST

          Engaging primary thrusters. Now!

EXT. -JUPITER TWO-DAY-PRESENT

The power drive begins to glow, diodes spinning. The landing struts
retract. The Jupiter Two begins to rise.

INT.-JUPITER TWO-ENGINE ROOM-INSERTION ARM-FUTURE

CONTROL CONSOLE-CLOSE. The core material in sinking fast. John moves
towards it when something on the gantry catches his eye.

GANTRY-CLOSE. Wedged into the grill work is a shiny scrap of metal
reflecting the setting sunlight. John's father's dog tags.

John rushes to the rail. There, still unconscious and hanging by the
dog-tag chain is Older Will.

CHAIN-CLOSE. The metal links are pulling apart. Will is seconds away
from falling into the pool.

JOHN-POV. The cylinder has completely sunken into the machine. It's
Will or the core material. No time for both.

John stands a beat, immobile. Then he drops to his knees, reaching
down as the chain breaks, grabbing Will's wrist at the last second.

The dog tags tumble into the pool below as John hoists Older Will up
onto the safety of the gangplank.

                      JOHN

          Come on, son. Wake up.

Will is still. Then, finally, his eyes open.

                      OLDER WILL

          Dad?

                      JOHN

          I thought I lost you.

                      OLDER WILL

          The core.

Will turns in time to see the core cylinder sink into the control
panel, the laser exploding in intensity below them as it drains the
cylinder's radioactive power. The world begins to EXPLODE.

                      OLDER WILL

          You could have taken the core and
          left before it was too late. You
          saved me instead.

John stares at him.

                      JOHN

          There wasn't any choice. I couldn't
          let you fall.You're my boy.


THE LASER-CLOSE. Reaches full power. The image in the time pool
stabilizes, becoming clear.

TIME POOL-CLOSE. Mission Control the day before the launch.

Father and Son stare into the past, eyes filled with wonder.

                      OLDER WILL

          Look. They made it.

PAN UP. Through a torn hole in the hull and a glowing rip in space,
the Jupiter Two is rising into the flame ravaged sky.

INT.JUPITER TWO-PRESENT

The ship is shaking madly.

                      WEST

          We're not getting any altitude.

EXT.-JUPITER TWO-DAY-PRESENT

The fire GEYSERS are legion, giant chunks of the planet's surface now
falling away beneath them. A huge spew of flame rages from the
fire-pocked surface, hitting the bull of the tiny craft.

INT.-JUPITER TWO-PRESENT

Judy is at navigation, frantically enhance the stabilizers.

                      JUDY

          I'm reading a power build up.
          Markers in the red-

Suddenly the panel EXPLODES, sending Judy flying across the bridge.
Penny races to her sister. Kneels. Judy's eyes are wide, still.

                      PENNY

          She's dead.

INT.-JUPITER TWO-PRESENT

The ground is breaking, falling into an endless fiery abyss below.

                      WEST

          Not enough power to make orbit.

EXT.-JUPITER TWO-DAY-PRES ENT

Another firestorm. A flame geyser hits the ship. Then another.

INT.-JUPITER TWO-PRESENT

Control panels all around the ship begin to SLOW. The main screen is
hit by a flying chunk of rock. The giant glass begins to crack.

                      WEST

          (to Maureen)

          I'm sorry.

The windshield EXPLODES, sucking them both out into space.

EXT.-JUPITER TWO-DAY-PRESENT

The ship is hit by another fire geyser. The Jupiter Two EXPLODES.

PULL BACK TO REVEAL

INT.-JUPITER TWO-ENGINE ROOM-FUTURE

John and Will kneel on the crow's nest as the Jupiter Two dodges the
fire geysers in the sky through the torn hull. The ship is struck
once, again, finally EXPLODING in a ROARING ball of fire.

JOHN-CLOSE. A man who has lost everything he ever loved.

                      JOHN

          I couldn't save them.

Will stares at his father and beyond him. There, in the time doorway,
a young Will walks towards the entrance to Mission Control in the
morning sun, innocent with no knowledge of the future.

                      OLDER WILL (OVER)

          So many years ago and I can still
          feel it. Our sun. Our Earth. It's
          all I've thought about. Going home.

Will reaches forward and touches the control console. The images in
the laser generated doorway begin to change.

                      OLDER WILL

          A long time ago, you told a small
          boy that one day he'd understand how
          precious he was, how much his father
          loved him. Today is that day.

TIME BUBBLE-CLOSE. Instead of Earth we now see this planet's surface,
the Jupiter Two rising as it did just moments ago.

                      OLDER WILL

          All I could see was your need to go
          forward at any cost. What you never
          showed me was your love. I lost
          that. Robbed by time. I could never
          see how much you cared. Until now.

TIME BUBBLE-CLOSE. The Jupiter Two tries in vain to dodge the fire
geysers, then EXPLODING all over again. Will enters some commands.

TIME BUBBLE-CLOSE. The image in the portal begins to run backwards,
the Jupiter Two reconstituting from a ball of flame, receding past
diminishing flame geysers, beginning to land again.

                      OLDER WILL

          Father, take my hand.

INT.-CUPITER TWO

We are back in the ship just before take off. DON mans the Cam.
Maureen straps herself into the co-pilot's chair.

                      MAUREEN

          I kept hoping somehow he'd appear.

Maureen stares a beat out the window.

                      MAUREEN

          Let's go, Major.

Don hits the engine switch. The mighty generators WHINE into life.

                      MAUREEN

          (quiet)

          Goodbye my love.

                      PENNY

          Look.

The roof of the hull is beginning to swirl, becoming translucent, like
water. There, standing above them, John and Older WILL.

2NT.-JUPITER TWO-ENGINE ROOM-CROW'S NEST-FUTURE

The bridge of the Jupiter Two is visible in the laser generated
doorway. Older WILL looks to his father.

                      OLDER WILL

          DON'T make me wait another lifetime
          to know how you feel.

And with that he pushes John over the edge, the Professor falling down
through space and into the bubble and the doorway below.

INT.-JUPITER TWO

The ceiling becomes water an John drops into the ship. Maureen cradles
her husband. Then she looks up. Will is still visible through the
watery hull.

                      JOHN

          Come with us.

But the passage through time and space is already breaking up as the
world of the engine room EXPLODES in the b.g.

                      OLDER WILL

          I can't. There was only enough power
          for one person, one trip, remember?

                      MAUREEN

          Will?

                      OLDER WILL

          It's good to see you again, Mom.
          It's good to see you alive.

          (fading)

          Sorry about all the monkey business.

Maureen reaches up towards her son, reaching down, the two hands
almost touching before Will is gone, the portal closed forever.

                      JOHN

          He sacrificed everything for his
          family.

                      MAUREEN

          (fighting tears)

          He had a good example.

Maureen holds him close. A small figure walks up beside them. Will.

                      WILL

          Dad?

A beat, then Will reaches up, hands him his dog tags.

                      WILL

          I'm glad you came back.

                      JOHN

          I just want you to know I love you
          son. I love you very much.

John takes the boy in his arms, father and son finally holding close.
(OVER) more RUMBLING as the ground continues to give way.

                      WEST (OVER)

          The planet is breaking up around us.

John moves fast to the Com.

                      WEST

          Nice of you to drop in.

John smiles a beat, then he's all business.

                      JOHN

          Status?

(OVER) A tremendous CRASH.

EXT.-JUPITER TWO

The land masses are falling away beneath them, plummeting into

giant caverns of fire.

INT.-JUPITER TWO

                      SMITH

          We're doomed. We're doomed.

West turns, hauls off and PUNCHES Smith, knocking him out cold.

                      WEST

          Boy, that felt good.

                      JOHN

          Get us airborne.

Don throws the power switches to full.

EXT.-JUPITER TWO

The landing struts retract. The power drive begins to spin. The
Jupiter Two rises above the ground just as the firmament collapses
upon itself. Fire geysers ERUPT. History in about to repeat itself.

INT.-JUPITER TWO

                      WEST

          I'm going to try to reach escape
          velocity. Maybe we can break the
          gravitational pull.

                      JOHN

          No. We don't have the core material.
          The gravity wells will drag us down.

                      WEST

          We might-

                      JOHN

          We won't make it. Trust me. I know.
          We've got to go down.

                      WEST

          What?

                      JOHN

          Through the planet as she breaks up.

                      WEST

          That's insane.

                      JOHN

          I don't have time to argue. I'm
          giving you a direct order, Major.

Don and John stare at each other a beat. Then Don smiles.

                      WEST

          Yes Sir.

VIEWSCREEN- CLOSE. The world is breaking up beneath them, revealing a
fiery maw. DON GUNS the engines, heading straight for the chasm.

EXT.-JUPITER TWO

The tiny ship flies into the giant expanding crevice.

INT.-JUPITER TWO

DON is flying into the shattering center of the planet. Masses of
continents, some bearing forests, others oceans, all soar past.

EXT.-JUPITER TWO

The tiny ship flies deeper toward the molten center of the planet.

INT.-JUPITER TWO

                      JOHN

          There.

A window out the windscreen a portion of the planet has torn away
revealing the black of space and the starfield beyond.

                      WEST

          I see it.

Don banks the ship toward the opening, flying past exploding fragments
of this shattering world.

EXT.-JUPITER TWO

The ship clears the planet as the world EXPLODES in the b.g.

INT.-JUPITER TWO

DON guides the ship out into space. Judy comes up behind him.

                      JUDY

          Nice work, flyboy.

                      WEST

          So, I earn that kiss yet?

                      JUDY

          (a peck on the cheek)

          You earned that.

DON shrugs, begins to turn away. Judy grabs him.

                      JUDY

          This one is on credit.

She gives him a long, passionate kiss. She lets him go, stunned.

                      JUDY

          Cold fish, huh?

Penny holds Blip in her arms, who has begun to BLIP madly.

                      MAUREEN

          Poor thing. She's lost her whole
          family.

          (off Penny)

          Penny, why are you looking at me
          like that. Penny?

Penny presses a button. Blast doors open on a storage hold.

                      PENNY

          I promised Judy I'd take care of
          her. I couldn't leave her all alone.

(all stare at her)

          Well I am their princess, after all.

          (turning)

          You can come out mow.

Forms in the cargo hold de-camouflage. The other lizard monkeys,
standing amidst glittering canisters of Dimondium.

                      JOHN

          Dimondium. Now if we could only find
          our way back to Earth.

                      ROBOT

          If I may, Professor.

The Robot projects a holographic schematic of the galaxy. The Jupiter
Two is highlighted. Earth blinks at the other and.

          It's a map home.

(OVER) ALARMS. The shattered planet's core is turning bright red, a
sudden ROARING blast wave heading towards the ship.

          The planet's gravity field in
          collapsing.

                      MAUREEN

          We'll be sucked in.

                      JOHN

          There's no way to get clear in time.

                      JUDY

          The hyperdrive.

          Everybody hang on.

                      PENNY

          Here we go again.

          THE WASTELAND. DAY.

          Flurries of dust and sand swirl around us as we move
          through an eerie, barren land. The only sound is the
          howl of a rising wind.

          Ahead something looms out of the storm. As we approach
          we see that it is the rusting remains of a massive oil
          pump.

          The wind drops to be replaced by the voice of a very
          old man. This is the Narrator:

          MAX looks back to the MEN. Several of then, having seen

          The black-oD-black surges around a wide curve,
          revealing only three vehicles still in pursuit.
          The first machine is Wez's big road bike, the
          GOLDEN YOUTH riding pillion. It is followed by a
          bizarre road racer and a strange dune buggy.
          As the black-on-black crests a rise MAX is confronted

          He swerves, slaloms through the wrecks and accelerates
          into a sweeping right hand curve.
          WEZ ramps his bike over the first wreck and corrects,
          avoiding the other wrecks.
          The road racer ramps two wheels over the first wreck

          it spinning, then continues after the black-on-black.

          He curses and flicks a switch, cutting off the
          supercharger.
          The black-on-black slows...
          The DOG whimpers, crawls off its chair and under Max's
          seat.
          WEZ overhauls MAX on the passenger side: He raises his
          forearm, aiming his gauntlet-style crossbow at MAX'S
          head.
          MAX barely has time to glimpse the road racer drawing
          alongside the driver's door.
          The passenger - a GAYBOY BERSERKER - wields a brutal,
          gas-powered 'gun': the heads of six metal arrows
          protrude from a big barrel. This weapon is the
          "porta-pak".
          MAX hits the brakes,
          The road racer and the bike surge past the black car...
          just as the porta-pak fires.
          Two arrows thud into the black car, three go astray
          and one hits WEZ in the arm.
          MAX throws the black car in behind the road racer...
          WEZ, fighting to control the bike, leaves the road...
          MAX changes down and hits the supercharger...
          The black car leaps forward, ramming into the back of
          the road racer, bullying it along.
          Wheels and metal screaming, the two cars approach an
          intersection littered with furniture and other debris.
          A road rig lies abandoned on the roadside.
          MAX eases back for a moment then flattens the

           The road racer slides through a 180 degrees, rolls,
           smashes through a road sign and hits a power pole.
          The pole thuds to the road as MAX throws a handbrake
          "U" turn and skids to a halt in the middle of the
          intersection.
          MAX, carrying a jerry can, gets out of the black car.
          He looks down the highway.

          WEZ is stopped on the crest of the road, looking down
          on the intersection. The arrow is still in his arm.

          he is strikingly beautiful,.

          ruptured tank.
          From inside the wreck we hear the moans of the injured
          driver.
          MAX puts the jerry can under the escaping fuel and
          tearing a bandana from his neck - mops up the gasolene
          lying on the bitumen.
          Suddenly, there is a shrill whistle.
          MAX looks up at the crest of the road.

           WEZ grins as he pulls the arrow slowly out of his
           arm. His eyes never leave MAX.
           He holds up the arrow and mouths the words:

                         WEZ

          guns the motor. He rea.; the front wheel, hangs there

          He reaches up to open the door of the cabin...
          There is an anguished scream, MAX turns.
          The hand of the dying driver emerges from the twisted
          metal of the dune buggy.
          The fingernails score deeply into the paint-work, a
          rush of dark blood pours out of the wreck. Then, silence.
          MAX opens the cabin door...
          A figure drops down, crashing onto his shoulders. As
          MAX struggles from its grasp we see that it is the
          bloated putrifying corpse of the rig's driver. Two
          crossbow bolts are buried in its neck...-
          MAX stoops and picks up a toy hurdy-gurdy which has
          fallen from the dead man's hand.
          As he walks back towards the black-on-black he turns
          the handle, playing the first few notes of "Happy
          Birthday".
          He stops next to the vehicle, in the middle of the
          intersection. He looks from one direction to another.
          undecided... and then sees the smashed road sign.
          He picks up a fragment which reads:

          ONE TREE HILL
          And throws it into the air.
          It lands at h:_s feet, pointing north.
          He gets into the car and drives off in that direction.

          FADE TO BLACK.

          13,

          13. DESERT ROAD, NEXT MORNING.
           The black-on-black travels slowly through the
           shimmering desert. The only sounds are the rumble of
           the engine and the whistle of the wind.

          13. Cont. 13,
           As the car crests a rise MAX looks ahead and sees a
           large kite - in the shape of a man's grinning face -
           hovering above a dune.
          MAX leaves the DOG to guard the car .nd, carrying a
          jerry can and a tyre iron, cautiously makes his way
          across the sand.

          14. ON THE DUNES. DAY. 14.
          From the,top of the dune MAX sees that the kite is
          tethered to an abandoned vehicle: a primitive
          version of a gyrocopter - little more than a motor,
          a seat and a rotor mounted on a chassis.
          A set of footprints leads from the gyrocopter,
          dune and disappears into the distance.
          Slowly MAX approaches the vehicle, skirting around it,
          looking for a trap. Nothing moves except for the
          flurries of sand whirling across the dunes.

          15. THE GYROCOPTER. DAY. 15.
          Carefully, MAX reaches up and taps the gas tank: empty.
          As he straightens up, he hears a low hiss.
          MAX freezes. Only inches away a snake, coiled around
          the vertical shaft of the gyro, is poised to strike..
          They stare at each other.
          The snake strikes... MAX springs... hand flashing...
          catching it by the neck.
          He holds up the snake, grinning, about to kill, it.
          The head and shaft of an arrow emerge from the sand
          behind him. It is followed by the frame of a crossbow
          and a man's face, spitting sand, a length of rubber
          hose clenched in his teeth. This is the GYRO CAPTAIN.

                         GYRO CAPTAIN
          Don't hurt that snake!

          15, Cont. 15,
          MAX turns. The CAPTAIN emerges from his shallow grave,
          motioning with the crossbow.

                         GYRO CAPTAIN
          Put him back... gently!
          MAX lays the snake on the rotor.

                         GYRO CAPTAIN
          Sounded like a big V-8 to me.
          I guess I got myself some
          guzzolene.
          He raises his bow, aiming at MAX'S head, preparing
          to fire.

                         MAX
          The car's booby-trapped.
          Touch those tanks and
          BOOM! You'll blow yourself
          apart.
          The CAPTAIN looks quickly in the direction of the
          black-on-black, and back to MAX. He gestures with
          the crossbow.

                         GYRO CAPTAIN
          Drop the weapons...
          Now back up.
          MAX throws down the tyre iron and unhitches a bolster
          which contains a sawn-off shotgun.
          The CAPTAIN slings the gunbelt over his stoulder.

          1.6. THE DESERT ROAD - MAX'S CAR.DAY. 16.
          MAX walks backwards towards his car. The CAPTAIN
          tense, crossbow trained on MAX, follows him across
          the dune.

          a snake. Never. Reflexes,
          that's what you've got.
          Me? I've got brains.
          He taps his head as they arrive at the black-on-black.

                         GYRO CAPTAIN
          Now, where's this booby-trap?
          MAX reaches under the car. His hand groping for a
          machete clipped to the chassis. His fingers wrap
          around the handle.

                         GYRO CAPTAIN
          A fella - a quick fella - might
           keep a weapon under there.
          He nuzzles,the bow against the back of MAX'S head.

                         GYRO CAPTAIN
          Then I'd have to pin his
          head to the panel.
          MAX slides his hand away, disconnects a series of
          mechanical fuses and shows them to the CAPTAIN. He
          moves to open the driver's door. The CAPTAIN
          reacts quickly, raising his bow, motioning MAX back.

                         MAX
          There's one more.

                         GYRO CAPTAIN
          Oh no! You don't play me the
          fool.
          The CAPTAIN, keeping the crossbow trained on MAX'S
          head, opens the door.
          The DOG flies out, leaping for the CAPTAIN'S throat.
          The crossbow discharges, narrowly missing MAX as he
          hurls himself at the CAPTAIN. The steel arrow buries r
          itself in the car door.
          MAX pins the CAPTAIN to the ground and recovers his
          shotgun.

          MAX is driving the black-on-black while the CAPTAIN

          the shotgun is strapped to the back of his bead and
          the stock fastened to the top of the seat.
          A length of wire runs from the triggers across to the
          DOG sitting in the rear of the car. The end of the
          wire is clasped firmly in its mouth.
          The CAPTAIN, not daring to take his eyes off the DOG
          directs MAX along back roads to an area of high
          country.
          The DOG'S eyes dart out the window. He whimpers, body
          twitching.
          The CAPTAIN stares in horror at a rabbit bounding through
          the scrub.
          MAX smiles t') himself.
          The DOG settles back.
          i8. A CLIFFTOP OVERLOOKING THE COMPOUND. DAY.
          MAX moves towards the cliff edge. A column of smoke
          rises into the sky, accompanied by a garble of distant
          sounds: police sirens; car horns; men screaming;
          war-whoops; and revving motors.
          The GYRO CAPTAIN - manacled and guarded by the DOG -
          hobbles along behind MAX.
          From the top of the cliff MAX looks down On a battle
          raging on the plain below.
          A fortified encampment, surrounded by a wide ditch
          and coils of barbed wire, is under attack by a large
          gang of MARAUDERS: MOHAWK BIKERS, SMEGMA CRAZIES in
          dune buggies, and GAYBOY BERSERKERS in road racers.
          They attack along a road which passes through an area -
          outside the fortifications - which is under cultivation.
          Three wooden work huts, a small barn and a corral
          containing several cows and a horse are dotted around a
          newly-ploughed field.
          As the Marauders' vehicles come within range of the
          compound, they stream around the perimeter, firing
          crossbows at the DEFENDERS ranged along the battlements.

          GYRO CAPTAIN I
          Well.,. I never said it'd
          be easy.
          MAX unhooks an old pair of binoculars from the
          equipment belt around his,waist.

          19, THE COMPOUND. POV BINOCULARS. DAY.
          Through the binoculars MAX sees a weird dune buggy
          charging towards the camp. He recognises the two
          bizarre occupants as members of the gang be
          encountered sacking the farmiet the day before.
          The dune buggy races along a causeway which spans the which blocks
          ditch, heading for a yellowPAschool SSENGERuin buggy
          the gate of the camp.
          fires a string of arrows from a multi-barrel gas-gun.
          A WARRIOR WOMAN on the battlement, armed with a flame-
          thrower, hits the buggy with a stream of liquid fire.
          The blazing vehicle plunges into the ditch. It tumbles - its
          into another wreck which met a similar fate
          tyres still smouldering.
          MAX pans his binoculars to the interior of the compound.
          He sees a large mechanical pump drawing the oil. from
          the ground and a primitive fractionating column used to
          refine it.
          A DEFENDER firing from the refinery tower is struck by
          an arrow. He falls over the guard rail, where a
          dead companion hangs over the edge, suspended by his
          foot.
          The sound of an amplified voice draws MAX'S attention,
          He swings the binoculars around:

          20.

          20. THE HILLSIDE ACROSS FROM TH.E COMPOUND. DAB .
          A huge, muscular man - his face covered by a metal
          mask - sits in a bizarre six-wheeled vehicle. He
          uses a microphone to shout orders to the MARAUDERS,
          directing the course of the battle. This man is
          the HUMUNGUS.
          Beside him, is the Mohawk Biker called WEZ. He sits
          astride his bike, the GOLDEN YOUTH clinging to his
          waist. He speaks with HUMUNGUS, pointing, sweeping
          his hand.

          The MARAUDERS have formed a bridge of car wrecks across
          the ditch near aless defended section of the compound.
          At WETS signal three bikes ride at the bridge of
          wrecks. Two of them are hit almost immediately but the
          third rides over the wrecks and attempts to ramp into
          the compound.
          The bike flies through the air... and bounces into the
          wire. The RIDER sails over the fence into the compound
          where he is set upon by THREE DEFENDERS.

          Tracking close on MAX as he sleeps.
          The DOG sitting next to him is on his feet growling
          at the sound of vehicles from the plain below.
          MAX wakes, alert', looking down.
          Below, three compound vehicles are fanning out across
          the plain.
          The MARAUDERS camped on the rise rouse themselves...
          climbing aboard their vehicles.
          The GYRO CAPTAIN, tethered to the stump, strains at
          his chain but cannot get close enough to the edge to
          see...

                         

                         

                         

                         
          4b, c;Ont.

                         GYRO CAPTAIN
          What's up!!
          MAX ignores him, concentrating on the situation below.
          ' The bulk of the MARAUDERS have split into three groups
          each chasing a camp vehicle off into the wasteland.
          The HUMUNGUS leads one of the groups. Four MARAUDERS,
          camped on a pinnacle, keep watch on the camp,
          Suddenly another vehicle bursts out of the camp and
          speeds across the plain towards MAX'S clifftop. It
          passes out-of sight around the back of the hill,
          MAX hurries from his canopy across the other side of
          the hilltop.

          29. REAR OF CLIFFTOP LOOKOUT. MORNING. 29.
          MAX looks past the black-on-black, to where the lone
          compound vehicle has achieved the bitumen.
          Suddenly, three Mohawk bikes and a tow truck emerge
          from behind a rocky outcrop. Led by WEZ, they fire
          arrows into the tyres and smash the windscreen.
          The compound vehicle leaves the road, rolling...
          As the GYRO CAPTAIN crawls to his side, MAX raises his
          binoculars...

          30. MAX'S POV BINOCULARS. MORNING. 30.
          The bloodied driver is being dragged from the wreck
          by TWO MOHAWKERS. The others cannibalise the vehicle
          and siphon off its fuel. Another occupant emerges
          from the twisted metal and tries to crawl away...
          I t is a YOUNG WOMAN.

          31, REAR OF CLIFFTOP LOOKOUT. MORNING. 31.
          The GYRO CAPTAIN sees her and fumbles urgently for
          something deep in the pockets of his great-coat.
          He produces a large telescope which is attached to
          his waist by a leather cord.

          Through the cracked lens of the telescope we see
          two of the MOHAWIMRS dragging the woman to the
          roadside.

          33. REAR OF CLIFFTOP LOOKOUT. MORNING. 33.
          MAX looks around to see the GYRO CAPTAIN'S telescope
          and grabs it. The GYRO CAPTAIN, protesting, picks up
          the less-powerful binoculars.
          MAX lifts tae telescope.

          34. MAX'S POV. TELESCOPE. MORNING. 34,
          The GOLDEN YOUTH is sitting on one of the bikes. The
          POV whip pans across the wreck where two MOHAWKERS
          have pushed the badly injured driver up to the car
          panel, WEZ fires an arrow into the man's shoulder,
          pinning it to the panel..
          Methodically, he reloads and fires another pin into the
          man's other shoulder.
          MAX pans the telescope to where the three MOHAWKERS
          hold the STRUGGLING WOMAN. At WEZ'S signal they start
          to tear the woman's clothes away...

          35. REAR OF CLIFFTOP LOOKOUT. MORNING. 35,
          Track in as the GYRO CAPTAIN and MAX watch through
          the binoculars and telescope.
          Camera tightens further to the GYRO CAPTAIN. His
          face reacts to the horror below.
          MAX drops his head... his eyes closing momentarily.
          The noise of vehicles starting below breaks the
          moment.
          He lifts the telescope and pans to one side.

          37. REAR OF CLIFFTOP LOOKOUT. MORNING.
          While MAX has the telescope trained on the departing
          vehicles the GYRO CAPTAIN has the binoculars on the

          WOMAN.

                         GYRO CAPTAIN
          Jesus! He's gonna kill her.
          MAX whips his telescope around...

          38. MAX'S POV. TELESCOPE. MORNING.
          The lens finds the remaining MOHAWKER now standing
          back from the prostrate girl. He is loading his
          crossbow...
          The image blurrs...

          MAX has dropped the telescope and is on his feet
          running down to the black-on-black. The DOG is at his
          heels.

                         GYRO CAPTAIN
          Hey! What about me?!!
           The black-on-black roars off...

          40. THE WRECK OF THE COMPOUND VEHICLE. DAY.
          We track low past the dead girl's face towards the back
          of the MOHAWKER. He is sitting on a wheel pulling on
          his trousers,
          Close to his back, the camera stops.
          He turns, looking up.
          MAX, carrying a pair of bolt cutters is hurrying towards
          him.

          The MOHAWKER grabs for his crossbow.
          MAX'S foot stamps down, pinning his wrist...
          Ssswish? the bolt cutters swing down... onto the
          Mohawker's head.
          Tears stream down the COMPOUND MAN'S face.
          As MAX walks up to him we see that he is bleeding
          badly. His name is NATHAN.

                         NATHAN
          Thank you. Thank you...

          I.

                         MAX
          Let's get this straight.
          I'm doing it 'cos I need
          fuel.

                         NATHAN
          As much as you want. Take
          me back... Don't let me die.
          MAX takes the bolt cutters and inserts them between the
          man and the panel. He cuts away the first arrow, then
          the second.

          WIPE,

          The supercharger screams as MAX races towards the
          compound.
          NATHAN is slipping into unconsciousness.
          MAX grabs him by the shoulder, shaking him.

                         MAX

          Angle down on the plain.
          The black-on-black approaches the burnt out huts.
          A GAYBOY BERSERKER stands up into frame in the extreme
          foreground.
          He is joined by TWO OTHER MARAUDERS.
          The GAYBOY BERSERKER grabs a hand-mirror and flashes a
          signal across the wasteland.
          From a far hill, we see the answering flash.

          43. THE PLOUGHED FIELD. DAY. 43.
          Crane down from a high angle on the black-on-black
          as it approaches the camp. As the camera achieves a
          smouldering but we see a small animal-like
          figure stalking the vehicle.
          Tracking closer we see that it is a wild-looking
          child, about 8 years old. He is dressed in dog skins
          and carries a chrome boomerang. On one hand he wears
          what looks like a catcher's mitt: a leather glove
          reinforced with steel plates. This is the FERAL KID.
          Before we get too close the boy scurries into a large
          rabbit warren.

          44. THE CAUSEWAY LEADING TO THE COMPOUND. DAY. 44.
          Long low angle on the compound. Its defenders wait
          on the barricades, the cracking tower and the
          catwalk.
          The black car stops just outside crossbow range - about
          twenty yards short of the compound.
          In extreme foreground, the FERAL BOY'S head pops up
          from another rabbit hole closer to the compound.
          He ducks down out of sight when the car door opens.
          High angle on MAX as he steps out of the car with
          NATHAN across his shoulders.
          MAX carries no weapons and as he steps up to camera,
          he raises his arms high...
          A woman on the barricade begins screaming. Her name
          is BIG REBECCA,

          A man on the catwalk orders the gate to be openeâ¢3..
          MAX hurries along the causeway...
          The FERAL KID comes out of the rabbit warren and
          begins to follow MAX.
          A trail of blood drips from the injured man onto the
          causeway...
          As MAX approaches the camp the old ï¿½ello'.v school bus
          is pulled aside.
          The I A3IRI011 WOMAN emerges, crossbow read., , keeping it
          trained on MAX.
          She is followed by another defender the MECHANIC'S
          ASSISTANT - pulling a strange mechanised crane.
          Suspended from the front of this machine is a paraplegic,
          He is the MECHANIC.

          She turns and looks straight at the camp's leader,
          PAPPAGALLO. He"is standing at the gate, surrounded
          by anxious defenders.

                         BIG REBECCA
          Look at your handiwork!
          They didn't have a chance...
          One of the group at the gate -- a nuggety old man
          called the CURMUDGEON - plays to the crowd, pointing

                         AT PAPPAGALLO:

                         THE CURMUDGEON
          You all heard me, I warned
          him didn't I? Madness, I said.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          45. THE COMPOUNL. DAY. 45.
          As the DEFENDERS part to let MAX through we see the
          group includes: a teenage couple - PISMO and ANGIE
          - holding each other tight; a woman BUTCHER, holding
          a knife and a rabbit; a middle aged man who looks
          like a FARMER; and a LUSTY young girl chewing her
          finger nails.

                         WARRIOR WOMAN

          he said.
          How? I said.
          Get a prime mover, he said...
          He points to NATHAN who is being carried to an old
          bread van. The rear door is open, revealing two
          hospital-style beds, drip stands and shelves of medical
          supplies. An injured camp member occupies one of the
          beds.

                         CURMUDGECN
          .And there's the result!
          Madness I said!
          PAPPAGALLO ignores him, addressing MAX:

                         PAPPAGALLO
          Where did you find him?

                         MAX
          Two, three miles away.,, left
          for dead.,, next to his car.
          We made a deal.
          In the background the FARMER starts to work the first
          arrow out of NATHAN'S chest.
          BIG REBECCA comforts him.

          him in, you'd give me gas.
          There's no time...
          An anxious young man pushes through the crowd, talking
          over MAX. This is the QUIET MAN.

                         QUIET MAN
          There was a woman...
          in the car...
          MAX looks straight at him.

                         MAX
          She's dead.
          The man struggles to keep hold of his emotions.

                         QUIET MAN
          How? What did they do?

                         MAX
          It was quick.
          The QUIET MAN bows his head and turns away.
          NATHAN groans, ANGIE has the clear plastic mask of
          an air viva device over NATHAN'S face, PISMO pumps
          air into his lungs.
          MAX turns to PAPPAGALLO:

                         MAX
          I saw a man in trouble. I
          brought him in. And now I

          Give him nothing.
          There's an ugly murmur of agreement.
          MAX, keeping his temper, talks to PAPPAGALLO:

                         MAX
          We had a contract...
          The FARMER succeeds in removing the first arrow.
          BIG REBECCA relaxes
          NATHAN sputters. Blood sprays into the plastic mask.
          BIG REBECCA screams. The FERAL KID looks on as the
          FARMER feels for a pulse: nothing.
          PAPPAGALLO turns to MAX:

                         PAPPAGALLO
          I don't know who you are,
          or what happened.
          But if you had a contract,
          it was with him. And it
          died with him.
          PAPPAGALLO t'.trns on his heel and walks through the
          crowd, back towards his tent.
          The WARRIOR WOMAN puts a bow to MAX'S temple and
          shoves him towards the gate.

          other men raise their weapons..,.
          The head of a crossbow arrow cuts into MAX'S neck.
          The DOG, MAX and the camp people are frozen, waiting
          for the next move,
          WARRIOR WOMAN, holding the other end of the bow,
          motions him forward,
          Slowly MAX bends and gathers up the DOG.

          His words are lost in the wail of a siren. A guard
          perched in the watch tower shouts a warning.
          The yellow school bus roars across, closing the
          entrance.

          47. THE BATTLEMENTS. DAY, 47.
          The compound people run to their positions on the
          battlements.
          A pair of manacles are locked around MAX'S wrists.
          WARRIOR WOMAN climbs to a big crossbow mounted above
          the causeway.
          The BUTCHER drops her knife and grabs her long bow.
          The rabbit on the chopping block leaps for safety.
          PAPPAGALLO mans the flame thrower. Others draw their
          bows.
          The FERAL KID follows the rabbit down a hole at the
          foot of the battlement.
          As MAX climbs to a position on the battlements near
          WARRIOR WOMAN and PAPPAGALLO he sees that the MARAUDER
          HORDE has gathered in all its glory.

          46. NO MAN'S LAND. DAY. 48,
          The MARAUDERS rumble in formation over the rise:
          At their head' is the Humungus machine surrounded by a
          guard consisting of WEZ and his GOLDEN YOUTH on a
          bike, a tow truck with TWO SKIN HEADS, a road racer
          with THREE GAY BOY BERSERKERS and a dune buggy with

          TWO SMEGMA CRAZIES.
          As the advance guard approaches through the dust and
          heat haze we see that SIX NEAR NAKED AND BLOODIED
          PEOPLE are lashed to the front of the vehicles.
          At the big crossbow, the WARRIOR WOMAN aims at the
          Humungus machine. One of the TWO VICTIMS, tied to the
          front of the Humungus machine, is screaming above the
          awesome rumble of machines and sirens...

          The camp people moan as they recognise the victims.
          PAPPAGALLO holds up his hand, stopping the WARRIOR
          WOMAN from firing.
          â¢ The MECHANIC cranes himself up into view next to MAX:

          Poor mongrels... not one
          got through.
          BIG REBECCA sobs. The QUIET MAN puts a comforting
          hand on her shoulder.
          PISMO and ANGIE huddle closer together.

           The vanguard of 5 vehicles stops on the causeway,
          just out of range.
          MAX and WEZ look across no man's land, recognising
          each other. WEZ grins, a gold tooth flashing.
          The TOADIE, a comically dressed Marauder perched on
          the top of the Humungus vehicle, waves his arms. The
          Marauders cut their motors... Silence.
          The TOADIE announces:

                         TOADIE
          Greetings from the Lord Humungus
          The Warrior of the Wasteland!
          The Ayatollah of Rock and Roller.

          mounted to the roll cage of his vehicle:

          The FERAL KID watches from a rabbit warren near a burnt
          out hut.

          You set out this morning to
          find a vehicle. A vehicle
          strong enough to haul that
          fat tank of gas...
          Suddently, the escaped rabbit runs from a hole in the
          barricade and out into the wasteland. WEZ whirls his
          arm around... thud!... the rabbit falls dead from a
          crossbow bolt.
          The FERAL KID eases back down into his hole.
          The TOADIE bellows:

                         TOADIE
          You see! There is no escape.
          The Humungus rules the

          Don't give them the gas!

          to the KID.
          He reaches up and - clunk! catches it in his steel,
          plated mitten.
          The MARAUDERS roar with laughter.
          The FERAL KID throws the boomerang again...
          WEZ ducks and it buries itself into the head of the

          He hurls it at the FERAL KID.
          The boomerang whistles across the ground... the KID

          WEZ, bellowing with rage, leaps up dnto the

          There's been enough talk.

          vehicle that'd haul that
          tanker.
          All eyes turn to MAX.

                         MAX
          You wanna get out of here.
          You talk to me.

          58, INT. PAPPAGALLO'S TENT, DUSK. 58.

          MAX faces PAPPAGALLO across a desk littered with plans
          and equipment.
          WARRIOR WOMAN, BIG REBECCA, the FARMER and the MECHANIC
          listen in.

                         MAX
          So that's my offer. I
          deliver a prime mover - in
          return you give me my black
          car and as much gas'as I
          can carry.
          All I need right now
          is three jerry cans of diesel
          and five gallons of petroleum.
          They look at him quizzically.
          Think of it as a down payment.

                         WARRIOR WOMAN
          That's the last we'll ever
          see of him.

                         BIG REBECCA
          What have we got to lose?
          PAPPAGALLO nods.

                         WIPE

          59. THE COMPOUND DITCH - THE BRIDGE OF WRECKS. NIGHT. 59,
          From the battlement, PAPPAGALLO watches as MAX,
          accompanied by the DOG, emerges from a hole in the
          wall. MAX has a pole across his shoulders,
          supporting four jerry cans of fuel..
          MAX'S knee brace"squeaks in the stillness.
          The MECHANIC throws him a small can. MAX squirts
          a stream of oil onto the metal and then moves off
          across the bridge of wrecks, built by the Mohawk
          Bikers the day before.
          The FERAL KID watches with other camp people as MAX
          and the DOG move out into the night.

          60, NO MAN'S LAND. NIGHT. 60.
          MAX emerges from the ditch, the heavy load weighing
          him down. Behind him, the searchlight from the
          compound plays over the wilderness. Ahead, he sees
          the glow of the Marauders' campfires.
          He moves forward silently.

                         

                         

                         

                         
          61. NEAR THE MAHAUDL S ' CAM1'k i hLJ . NIGHT. 61,
          Picking his way carefully across rugged ground,
          MAX skirts close to a large campfire.
          Around it, a GROUP OF MARAUDERS are carousing: some
          are laughing loudly at a VICTIM strung up to a beam
          by his wrists. A bottle passes among the MARAUDERS.
          In the shadows, lit by the flickering flame, a MOHAWK
          BIKER fondles TWO CAMP FOLLOWERS.
          Closest to MAX a GAYBOY BERSERKER hones his machete
          on a whetstone.
          MAX skirts round him, not taking his eyes off him.
          Suddenly MAX'S leg gives way, caught in a rabbit hole.
          He pitches forward, the ferry cans thumping together.
          The GAYBOY BERSERKER pivots.., listening.., knife ready.
          MAX is spread-eagled on the ground. The DOG curls its
          lip. The GAYBOY BERSERKER walks towards MAX, his eyes
          searching the darkness...
          There is a loud barking! MAX looks up...
          On a rabbit warren close by, the FERAL KID sits on his
          haunches, howling like a wild dog.
          The GAYBOY BERSERKER takes a rock and throws it, curs-
          ing all howling dogs, and returns to the camp.
          The FERAL KID motions for MAX to follow. Keeping low,
          MAX limps forward.

          62. AN EROSION DITCH. NIGHT. 62.
          The FERAL KID stops at the edge of the gully and
          indicates the direction for MAX to take. He grins at
          MAX and runs off into the night, back the way he came.
          MAX drops down into the gully heading away from the
          Marauders' camp.

          DISSOLVE,

          63. THE CLIFFTOP. FIRST LIGHT. 63.
          MAX climbs up to the spot where he left the GYRO CAPTAIN.
          Gone!... Just the canopy, a dog food can and a freshly-
          dug hole where the tree stump used to be. A clear trail,
          gouged in the dirt, leads back towards the sand dune
          country. The DOG sniffs and lopes off,..

          64..
          MAX and the DOG crest a rise at the edge of the
          pan.
          About a hundred yards ahead, out on the
          clay, is the CAPTAIN, still dragging the tree
          stump behind him.
          T h e DOG growls.
          The CAPTAIN turns to see MAX, He picks up the log
          and tries to run.

          65. THE WASTELAND. DAY.

          65.
          The sun is much higher in the sky, The CAPTAIN has
          been freed from the tree stump and now carries the
          ferry cans, coolie-like, across his shoulders.

          66. THE DUNES. DAY.

          66.
          The three travellers stagger over the dune. Tha
          gyro copter is intact though the kite now rests
          face dawn on the sand, At the crest of the dune
          they sue the body of a lone Marauder. Foot and
          tyre prints tell the story. Crossing the dunes in
          his buggy, he happened across the gyrocopter. He
          left his buggy, walked down to the abandoned
          gyrocopter and fell victim to the snake, He
          staggered around in circles before slumping face
          down in the sand.
          The CAPTAIN lets out a whoop as he and MAX half
          stumble, half run towards the body.

                         CAPTAIN
          I knew it. I knew it'd work.
          Lethal, those snakes. Lethal.
          Born killers. The snake's
          fangs, my brains. Lethal I

                         TELL YA
          The CAPTAIN stops, staring down at the body of the
          snake, its head crushed,
          Quickly he picks it up and begins to skin it,
          muttering,

          Don't think you're gonna get
          any of this. Cos you're not.
          It was my snake. I found it.
          I trained it. And I'm gonna
          eat it.
          Keeping the gun trained on the CAPTAIN, MAX
          rummages through the MARAUDER'S clothes. He finds
          a necklace of spark plugs, bolts, teeth and two old
          shotgun cartridges.
          MAX removes the two cartridges. One crumbles apart.
          The second, although dog-eared, remains intact,
          The GYRO CAPTAIN looks up as MAX cracks open the
          shotgun - both barrels are empty.
          MAX shoves the dog-eared cartridge into the barrel
          and snaps the shotgun shut.
          The GYRO CAPTAIN gasps:

                         CAPTAIN
          You mean? All this time?
          Jesus, that's dishonest!
          MAX nudges the CAPTAIN towards the gyrocopter.
          The CAPTAIN stands fast, eyeing the shotgun...

                         CAPTAIN
          How do we know that one's
          not a dud.

                         MAX
          There's only one way to
          find out.
          He lifts the barrel to the CAPTAIN'S head.
          The CAPTAIN moves off towards the gyrocopter.

          67. SAND DUNES- GYROCOPTER. DAY. 67.
          One jerry can lies discarded by the gyro. MAX,
          with the DOG on his lap, is settled on the chassis,
          the three remaining cans strapped on beside him.
          A flurry of sand whips back from the propellor.
          The gyro, unaccustomed to the extra weight, lumbers
          across the sand and slowly rises into the sky.

          The bloated fly-blown corpse of the driver lies
          next to the abandoned road rig.
          The bonnet of the prime mover is up and MAX is
          working on the engine.
          A chain passes from the bull bar up into the cabin where
          the CAPTAIN sits behind the wheel, muttering into a
          handkerchief.
          The DOG watches him carefully.
          MAX yanks on the chain.
          The GYRO CAPTAIN tests the motor: nothing.
          After two more attempts it splutters to life.

          DISSOLVE.

          69 THE PRIME MOVER. LATER THAT DAY. 69.
          The prime mover, disconnected from the rest of the
          rig, stands in the middle of the road.
          MAX is in the cabin with the DOG, the engine running,
          The GYRO CAPTAIN looks up at him, rattling his chains.

                         GYRO CAPTAIN
          You can't just dump me!
          Think of us as partners.
          MAX tosses him a set of keys, shouting over the
          engire.

                         MAX
          It's up to you. Fly a kite,
          or follow me back. Maybe
          they'll throw some gas your

          The GYRO CAPTAIN, struggling to unlock his manacles,
          yells after him:

          highway, eating up the miles.

          71. HILL CREST NEAR PINNACLES. DAY. 71.
          The'prime mover crests a bill. In the distance MAX
          can see the pinnacles surrounding the camp. He
          checks his shotgun on the seat beside him. MAX
          tramps the accelerator.
          The DOG climbs under the seat. The back wheels burn
          rubber as the prime mover thunders down the road...
          Suddenly the gyrocopter zooms over the rise behind him
          spluttering and coughing like he's running out of
          gas.

          72. SIDE OF ROAD NEAR THE PINNACLES. DAY. 72.
          In the Marauders' camp a MOHAWKER is shaving WEZ'S
          head. At the sound of the approaching prime mover,
          WEZ leaps to his feet, clambers over a tow truck on
          blocks and straddles his bike...
          Other MARAUDERS follow as we track to a SKINHEAD
          lying under the tow truck making noisy repairs.

          MAX burls the prime mover towards the rise above
          the compound.
          A dune buggy comes up alongside the rear passenger
          wheel. The SMEGMA CRAZY riding shotgun fires a
          crossbow arrow into a tyre... which explodes.
          WEZ appears on the road ahead as a road racer rockets
          from out of the scrub in front of the prime mover.
          MAX shunts it back off the road and into the rear of
          the tow truck on blocks.
          The tow truck crashes down, pinning the SKINHEAD
          beneath it.

          The gyrocopter sputters along, staying out of range

          The CAPTAIN is shouting advice and instructions from

           WEZ lifts his feet onto the saddle, steadies himself

           As the vehicle crests the rise, MAX sees the camp
          below. He yanks the air horn lanyard...

          fires,.,
          The gun fizzes and pops - the cartridge was a dud.
          MAX ducks and yanks down hard on the wheel...

          The front of the prime mover bursts with steam and
          hot oil,

          glimpse two startled MARAUDERS in the throes of

          4-pak - fires four bolts into the t y'res. All but one
          tyre on the driver's side blow out.
          As the prime mover charges past, we track with the
          Lone Wolf, who drives a two-engined assault car.
          He yells to other Marauders behind:

          A street car and a dune buggy surge up beside him.

          he kisses them goodbye and hurls them down...

          84. THE APPROACH TO THE CAUSEWAY. DAY. 84.
           .The snakes land in the 4-pak dune buggy - one of
          them between the DRIVER'S legs. Perplexed, he
          reaches down for it... pulling it up to look...
          He screams.., the snake has its fangs in his hand...
          85. THr CAUSEW'.Y. DAY. 85.
          The 4-pak dune buggy swerves out of control... up
           and over the back of the prime mover,., and onto
           the street car. Locked together, both vehicles
           tumble down into the ditch.
           I n th,! cabin of the truck MAX smashes the butt of the shotgun
          into \EZ'S face, again and again. WEZ just grins.

          86. THE COMPOUND GATE. DAY. 86.
          The prime mover thunders through the gate.
          PAPPAGALLO and WARRIOR WOMAN take their positions
          on the battlements...
          As soon as the prime mover clears the gate BIG
          REBECCA plants her foot on the accelerator of the
          school bus/gate. The Lone Wolf vehicle and the
          dune buggy just make it inside.
          The DOG scampers through the rapidly closing gap.
          A road racer slides up to the gate.
          The DRIVER looks up... to see PAPPAGALLO aiming
          the flame thrower down at him... He slams the
          vehicle into reverse...

          PAPPAGALLO sends the torrent of flames down on the
          retreating vehicle... as HUMUNGUS and the OTHER
          MARAUDERS hover at the entrance of the causeway...

          88., INSIDE THE COMPOUND THE CATWALK AREA. DAY. 88.
          The prime mover slides to a halt underneath a
          catwalk. -
          As SEVERAL CAMP PEOPLE run towards him, WEZ swings
          up onto the roof of the prime mover and onto the
          catwalk.
          The two Marauder vehicles stop in the middle of the
          compound.
          MAX jumps out of the prime mover assessing the
          situation. In addition to WEZ there are FOUR
          MARAUDERS inside the compound: the LONE WOLF,
          the LONE WOLF'S PASSENGER and TWO SMEGMA CRAZIES.

          89, THE BATTLEMENTS. DAY. 89.
          Undei the direction of the HUMUNGUS - HALF A DOZEN
          MARAUDERS come surging up the causeway on foot.
          PAPPAGALLO stands up on the very limit of the battle-
          ment and scares them off with a burst of flame.
          A MARAUDER fires an arrow..
          , .PAPPAGALLO is hit high up in the thigh. He
          tumbles backwards, off the parapet and crE.shes to the
          ground below.

          90, INSIDE THE. COMPOUND - THE CRACKING TOWER. DAY 90.
          Up on the catwalk WEZ is shouting at the FOUR

          OTHER INVADERS.

                         WEZ
          The gate! The gate! Move!!
          MAX looks around as the LONE WOLF, the LONE WOLF
          PASSENGER and the TWO SMEGMA CRAZIES start to sprint
          across the compound towards the gate...
          Thud! The LONE WOLF PASSENGER falls dead - an
          arrow in his back...

                         

                         

                         

                         
          9u. Cont. 90.
          WEZ spins around to see the QUIET MAN, standing
          on the cooling tower, reloading his bow.
          WEZ starts running towards him.

          91. INSIDE THE COMPOUND. DAY. 91.
          With the help of the DOG, MAX tackles the-FIRST SMEGMA
          CRAZY who is running towards the gate. They land at
          the foot of the pump. The FERAL BOY, bouncing up and
          down on top of the pump looks down gleefully, as the
          FARMER, the BUTCHER and the CURMUDGEON descend on the

          MARAUDER.
          MAX is on his feet running towards PAPPAGALLO, as the
          second SMEGMA CRAZY is hit by the MECHANIC flying on
          the end of his lattice-arm contraption. ANGIE and
          PISMC, manning the other end, smile with satisfaction.

          92. INSIDE THE COMPOUND - THE CRACKING TOWER. DAY. 92.
          WEZ confronts the QUIET MAN who has his bow drawn,,,
          The QUIET MAN fires - WEZ ducks - missed!
          WEZ grins. The QUIET MAN is paralysed by indecision.
          WEZ is on him.., head-butts him - once, twice, three
          times,
          The QUIET MAN'S face is a torrent of blood as WEZ
          throws him of the cooling platform.
          The QUIET MAIL lands, groaning, badly injured.

          93. FROM INSIDE THE BUS. DAY. 93.
          The LONE WOLF has made it to the gate and smashes his
          way through the window - clawing at BIG REBECCA.
          She shoves a boot in his face as WARRIOR WOMAN drops
          onto him from the battlement above and buries a knife
          blade in his neck.

          MAX has picked up PAPPAGALLO'S flame thrower.
          PAPPAGALLO watches as he climbs the battlements,
          A DOZEN MARAUDERS are charging up the causeway.
          MAX appears above them,,, spraying fire. The
          MARAUDERS retreat...

          95, INSIDE THE COMPOUND. DAY. 95â¢,
          WEZ grabs a cable and swings from the catwalk across
          the cracking tower to Pappagallo's 'dinosaur tent'.
          He slides down the tent, leaps onto some tyres, onto
          a storage tank and then onto the tanker...
          He hesitates a moment looking for some way to get to
          the gate...
          The WHOLE CAMP turns to confront him..-'.:'
          He ducks, the gyrocopter swoops down over his head
          and lands in the centre of the compound...
          An arrow flies past WEZ, then the Feral Kid's boomerang
          , , he decides to call it quits.
          Running along the top of the tanker, be leaps the
          barbed wire fence.

          9G THE L-ITCH. DAY. 96.
          WEZ lands in the ditch.
          He clambers over a wreck out of the ditch and out of
          range.

          97, INSIDE THE COMPOUND. THE TANKER. DAY.
          The GYRO CAPTAIN is up on the tanker, throwing a
          stick and shaking his fist at the MARAUDERS - putting
          on a show for the jubilant compound people.
          Several people shake hands with the GYRO CAPTAIN,
          The FERAL KID watches, puzzled, intrigued by this
          strange ritual.
          Sc. 97. Cont.

                         

                         

                         

                         
          The MECHANIC is already examining the damage to the
          prime mover,
          PAPPAGALLO is propped up against the base of the
          battlement. BIG REBECCA and the WARRIOR WOMAN tend
          his thigh wound.

                         PAPPAGALLO
          OK! OK! Let's go.
          We leave tonight!
          The MECHANIC lifts his head out of the engine:

                         MECHANIC
          We got a hole through the
          radiator - into the
          timing case.
          Gonna take at least 24
          hours.

                         PAPPAGALLO
          You've got twelve.
          The crowd disperses.
          The QUIET MAN is carried to the bread van/medical
          centre; the bodies are removed; camp members load
          vehicles; men are working on the tanker.
          WARRIOR WOMAN climbs onto the battlement.

          98. THE BATTLEMENTS% DAY, 98.
          The MARAUDERS have regrouped on the rise.
          MAX is watching them, the flame thrower in his hands,
          as the WARRIOR WOMAN approaches him:

                         WARRIOR WOMAN
          I want you to know... that was
          a very brave thing you did...
          He doesn't reply - just hands her the flame thrower
          and descends the ladder.

          99. INSIDE THE COMPOUND. DAY. 99.
          BIG REBECCA has just pulled the arrow out of
          PAPPAGALLO'S leg as MAX moves into view.
          PAPPAGALLO watches him walk towards the black-on
          -black - its nose poking out of the pyramid workshop,
          As MAX passes the gyrocopter we see the GYRO CAPTAIN
          in conversation with the CURMUDGEON.

                         CURMUDGEON
          .and tell me, son, this
          machine of yours - it takes
          two , does it?
          The GYRO CAPTAIN glances over the CURMUDGEON'S
          shoulder at LUSTY who is admiring the gyrocopter.

                         GYRO CAPTAIN
          er... possibly.
          The FERAL KID steps forward, holding his hand out
          stiffly to MAX.
          MAX hesitates, then shakes it briefly. The KID
          laughs - be finds this hand shaking-business hilarious.
          As MAX moves on to the pyramid workshop, the FERAL
          KID follows in his footsteps, mimicing his squeaky,
          stiff-legged gait.

          1.00, INT. PYRAMID WORKSHOP. LATE AFTERNOON. 100.

          Through the maze of pipes in the peak of the pyramid,
          we have a high angle down on MAX working on the
          black-on-black below.
          The FERAL KID comes into view in the foreground,
          climbing along the pipes.
          The KID is softly humming a tune - approximating the
          first few notes of "Happy Birthday".
           On the workshop floor a small siphon pump is transfer-
          ring fuel from a 44 gallon drum into the black-on-
          black's fuel tanks.
          MAX is re-arming the booby traps - connecting a
          string of wires and fuses to the gas tank caps. His
          utility belt and jacket are off and he has laid his
          personal. effects on a nearby work bench.
          In the background, through the arched doorway we see
          Sc. 100. Cont.

          the MECHANIC and his TEAM working on the truck with
          arc welders, lights and so on.
          MAX looks up:
          The CURMUDGEON is leading PAPPAGALLO'into the workshop.

                         CURMUDGEON
          See! I told ya. I said he
          was leaving.
          High up in the pyramid the FERAL KID starts to swing
          down the pipes - towards the bench where MAX has laid
          his jacket and utility belt. On the floor, PAPPAGALLO

                         CONFRONTS MAX:

                         PAPPAGALLO
          I don't have time for thanks.
          You know what you did out _
          there and what it means to us.
          Come with us, MAX. Drive the
          tanker.
          MA:. continues to work - muffling the four exhausts
          by plugging them with rags.

                         MAX
          We had a contract. I did
          my job, I got my car and I
          got my gas. End of story.

                         PAPPAGALLO
          It doesn't have to be -
          we'll make a new contract.
          I can offer you a chance to
          rebuild your life, I can
          offer you a future.
          The CURMUDGEON breaks in, excited.

                         CURMUDGEON
          You gotta come. Look!
          He produces a grubby souvenir postcard pack which
          bears the heading:

          GREETINGS FROM THE

                         SUNSHINE COAST

                         

                         

                         

                         
          100. Cont. 100.
          The FERAL KID's arm sneaks across the work bench
          reaching out for the hurdy-gurdy.
          MAX'S hand snaps out and clamps around the KID'S
          wrist. The FERAL KID drops the hurdy-gurdy. As
          MAX releases his grip the KID retreats into the
          shadows.
          The CURMUDGEON unravels the postcard pictures in
          front of MAX'S face. -

                         CURMUDGEON
          This is where we're going.
          Two thousand miles away.
          "Bloody paradise. Fresh
          water... plenty of sunshine...
          nothing to do but breed...
          MAX starts to go back to his work.
          PAPPAGALLO takes him by the shoulder.

                         PAPPAGALLO
          What are you looking for
          out there? How long do
          you expect to survive,
          scavenging day to day?
          You're no different than them.
          He points in the direction of the Marauders.,.
          ..,vultures, maggots.
          Don't you see? There is
          a better way!
          MAX flares at him, angry:

                         MAX
          Yeah. I tried it once!
          Now forget it, 'cos I
          never get involved.
          I'm leaving. I leave
          tonight.
          PAPPAGALLO is about to reply when a scream echoes
          through the camp.
          They all turn to look: the men working on the prime
          mover are running towards the battlement,
          An ominous drumming begins in the Marauders' camp.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          3GI.. INSIDE THE COMPOUND. THE CATWALK. DUSK. 101.
          PAPPAGALLO climbs onto part of the refinery's cat-
          walk which is close to the workshop area.
          SEVERAL OTHER CAMP MEMBERS, including the GYRO
          CAPTAIN, and LUSTY, are already there - looking
          across no-man's land.
          The MARAUDERS are raising two tall poles. TWO OF
          THE CAMP MEMBERS captured that morning are nailed
          to the poles screaming.
          PAPPAGALLO turns to MAX, who is still down at the
          black-on-black.

                         PAPPAGALLO
          You see! That's the
          alternative!
          Men feeding on men.
          MAX goes back to work.
          The GYRO CAPTAIN slips his arm around LUSTY'S
          shoulder.

                         GYRO CAPTAIN
          I know you're afraid darlin'.
          But I'll let you into a
          secret, sweetheart. I'm
          afraid too.
          He squeezes her tight. She caresses his hand.

          DISSOLVE.

          1.02. NO MAN'S LAND. NIGHT, 102.
          Silhouetted against a large fire, near the two
          poles, a group of TWELVE !.MARAUDERS of various
          breeds beat out a tattoo on the panels of their
          cars. The HUMUNGUS watches as two more victims
          are raised on poles. The beat becomes more
          frenzied,

          FADE TO BLACK.

                         

                         

                         

                         
          Pouring with sweat, MAX tears up the first of a
          series of metal plates which form the floor of the
          workshop area.
          He drags it.across the compound, passing the
          MECHANIC'S TEAM working in a shower of sparks on
          the prime mover.
          The MECHANIC looks up:

                         MECHANIC -
          Go on! Go! Just another mercenary!
          He spits.
          MAX ignores him, dragging the plate past Pappagallo's
          tent. It is crowded with CAMP PEOPLE, laying their
          plans for escape.
          They fall silent, turning to watch MAX.

          104, COMPOUND WALL. BRIDGE OF CARS. NIGHT. 104.
          The black-on-black waits next to the fence, near the
          place where the Mohawkers attempted to build the
          "bridge of cars" across the ditch.
          MAX has cut a hole in the barbed wire and is
          manouevrin6 the metal plate on top of the first car
          starting to build a ramp from thw,
          compound, over the top of the cars and onto the far
          side of the ditch.

          DISSOLVE.

          105, INSIDE THE COMPOUND. LATER THAT NIGHT. 105
          The HUMUNGUS has stepped up his theatrics of terror.
          His voice booms across the night - reciting dark
          poetic descriptions of death and hell.
          The CAMP PEOPLE, gathered in Pappagallo's tent, watch
          as the GYRO CAPTAIN walks towards the spot where MAX
          is working. PAPPAGALLO sits at his desk,flicki.ng an

          MAX, who is locking the last metal plate into
          position, looks up at the GYRO CAPTAIN.

                         GYRO CAPTAIN
          I just want you to know that
          I don't agree with them,
          He indicates the people in Pappagallo's tent.

                         GYRO CAPTAIN
          I don't think you're a coward.
          A bit stupid - but not a
          coward,
          Where else you gonna find
          what we 've got here?
          Food... fuel... clean women.
          MAX goes back to work, putting the finishing touches
          to the ramp.

                         GYRO CAPTAIN
          Men, too, if that's your
          inclination.
          Jesus! All we've got to
          do is get away from that
          Humungus. With you driving
          the tanker we can do it.
          I know you can. I saw you
          out there. Stay with us
          Max. Drive the tanker.
          MAX gets up, snaking his head.

                         MAX
          I haven't got time to explain.
          Just believe me - I've got
          everything I want.
          The CAPTAIN starts to interrupt but MAX cuts him
          short.

                         MAX
          Good luck tomorrow.
          I hope you make it.

          him.

                         GYRO CAPTAIN
          Thanks. Thanks a lot.
          The CAPTAIN walks back towards the GROUP watching
          from Pappagallo's tent. He shrugs his shoulders.
          MAX opens the door of the black-on-black.

          107. OUTSIDE THE _OMPOUND. BRIDGE OF CARS. NIGHT. 107.
          MAX eases the black car onto the metal plates.
          The wide wheels rumble slowly across the makeshift
          bridge.
          MAX revs the motor to get over the last hump, the
          plugs in the exhausts muffling the sound of the big
          engine.
          The Humungus's bizarre ravings continue to boom across
          the wasteland.

          108, THE WASTELAND NEAR THE COMPOUND.NIGHT. 108.
          The black-on-black eases away from the compound.
          The DOG is edgy, growling. MAX takes hold of his
          shotgun,
          There is a thump! Something lands on the roof.
          The DOG flies at the window snarling. MAX jams the
          barrel against the roof.
          A face appears, leaning over the windscreen, peering
          in at MAX. It's the FERAL KID,
          He grins and tumbles through the passenger's window.
          He grabs hold of MAX'S hand, shaking it.
          The FERAL KID laughs, settling in to the seat.
          The car continues to roll forward.

          Scat! Go back.
          The FERAL KID looks at him, puzzled, then throws his
          head back, howling.
          MAX stops the car, looking round, nervous.
          The first light of dawn appears on the horizon.
          MAX turns to the FERAL KID:

                         MAX
          You're a fine kid, but you
          can't come. You've gotta
          learn - don't get close to
          people. It can churn you
          up...
          The KID can't understand a word, so just grins.
          MAX thrusts his hand into his back pocket and produces
          the hurdy-gurdy.
          He shoves it into the FERAL KID'S hands, opens the
          door and pushes him out.

          109. THE WASTELAND. DAWN.
          As the FERAL KID gets to his feet the black-on-black
          accelerates away, surging up the rise towards the
          Humungus encampment.
          The rapid burst of power fires the four plugs out of
          the exhausts. The big engine roars.

          110. THE RISE ABOVE THE COMPOUND. DAWN. 110.
          WEZ springs to his feet. His face covered in a
          white war paint. His eyes searching out the
          darkness. He starts running,.. towards the
          Humungus machine.

          A GAYBOY BERSERKER is running with him. As they climb
          into the vehicle, the HUMUNGUS - sitting on a rock near
          the VICTIMS on the poles - gets to his feet,
          He bellows with rage as WEZ drives the vehicle off in
          pursuit of Max. The TWO VICTIMS, still strapped to the
          front, lift their heads.
          i11.. THE HUMUNGUS MACHINE. DAWN.
          From the Humungus machine WEZ sees six other vehicles
          stream across the landscape in pursuit of the black-on
          -black. (One tow truck, two dune buggies, two street
          cars and a bike).
          The TOADIE emerges bewildered from where he has been
          sleeping under the fuel tanks of the Humungus machine.

          112.

          112. A ROAD NEAR THE COMPOUND. DAWN.
          The black-on-black achieves the road...
          The DOG is looking back through the passenger window
          as we see the first of the pursuing vehicles rumble
          onto the road...
          MAX hits the supercharger switch...
          The big engine whines up.
          Once again, the DOG climbs down under the seat.
          The Humungus machine rockets onto the road... and
          begins to overtake the other six Marauder vehicles
          one by one...

          MAX is giving the black-on-black all its got...
          In the Humungus machine WEZ, the GAYBOY BERSERKER
          and the TOADIE have left the rest of the Marauders
          well behind...
          The big machine seems to be encroaching on the black-
          on-black.

          WEZ shouts instructions to the GAYBOY BERSERKER who
          comes to his side.
          The GAYBOY BERSERKER slides behind the wheel as WEZ
          clambers forward onto the front of the vehicle.
          The GAYBOY BERSERKER reaches down. His hand rests on a
          toggle switch next to three gas bottles marked:

                         NITROUS OXIDE
          At the front of the vehicle WEZ grabs a huge exhaust
          pipe jutting into the air. In spite of the heat he tears
          the pipe off the mounting. He signals to the GAYBOY

          BERSERKER.
          The GAYBOY BERSERKER flicks down the toggle switch:
          there is a mighty roar matched by a massive surge of
          power in the Humungus machine...
          The TWO VICTIMS on the front scream... MAX is bewildered
          by the massive acceleration. ._
           The Humungus machine leaps alongside the black-on-black.
           WEZ swings the chrome pipe down through the front
          windscreen -, into MAX'S face.

          114. A CURVE IN THE HIGHWAY. MORNING. 1.14.
           The black-on-black takes out a guide post and leases
           the road... rolling over and over.
           Inside the car MAX - his face bloodied - and the DOG
           are slammed around in the cabin of the black-on-black.
          It continues rolling, over and over again, into a gully.

          115, THE CREEK BED. MORNING. 115.
          What is left of the car comes to rest, upside down,
          among the boulders of a dry creek bed. MAX is slumped,
          dangling in his harness - his face and body bloodied
          and broken. Somthing moves... it's the DOG pulling
          himself out of the wreckage. He licks and paws at
          MAX'S face. One eye flickers open.

                         AN

          WEZ stands looking down into the gully. Another vehicle
          has arrived. TWO GAYBOY BERSERKERS and the TOADIE
          scramble down towards the wreck carrying jerry cans.

                         WE-
          Don't waste him. If he's
          alive I want him.

          117. THE CREEK BED. MORNING. 117.
          By an enormous force of will, MAX frees himself from the
          harness and - as the sound of the Marauders approaches -
          pulls himself through the window of the wreck.
          He falls to the ground, dragging his crippled body into
          the shadow of a large boulder, hiding there.
          The DOG confronts the MARAUDERS, snarling, standing
          between them and the wreck.
          One of the GAYBOY BERSERKERS raises his crossbow...
          MAX watches, grim-faced, as the DOG falls dead.
          The THREE MARAUDERS run to the vehicle.
          While the TOADIE prepares to siphon off the gas, the
          other two peer into the crushed cabin.
          Perplexed, they examine the wreck more closely, looking
          for MAX.. .
          ONE of them sees the drag marks, leading down the
          creek bed.
          He signals to the OTHER MARAUDER... MAX prepares to defend
          himself... the TOADIE prises the cap off the black car's
          fuel tank.
          The booby trap explodes... the petrol ignites... the
          THREE MARAUDERS are engulfed by a giant fireball.
          MAX looks pa3t the flames, staring up at WEZ,
          not taking his eyes off him...

          118, ROADSIDE. MORNING. 118.
          WEZ and the OTHER MARAUDERS watch the great pillar of
          smoke rise up into the sky.
          They return to their vehicles.

          In the background we see the camp vehicles standing
          ready - fully loaded. The Mechanic's TEAM are still
          working on the prime mover.
          As PISMO shows from the tower, the GYRO CAPTAIN looks

          Foot by foot, MAX drags himself alor:g the creekbed -
          heading for the compound. Blood seeps from wounds on
          his head and face. His legs are useless, his hands
          heavily bandaged with strips from his leather jacket.
          Behind him, in the distance, we see the still-
          smouldering wreck of the black-on-black.
          MAX struggles on, the pain growing, the sun climbing,
          the temperature soaring. His mind becomes more feverish:
          the wasteland dissolves into the heat haze; the buzz
          of the flies around his face becomes the steady drone
          of an engine.
          The gyrocopter appears above him.

          121. ON BOARD THE GYROCOPTER. DAY. 121.
          MAX, strapped to the chassis of the gyrocopter, drifts
          back to consciousness.
          He sees the compound surging towards them as they come
          in to land.
          He drifts back into unconsciousness, the images
          distorting, dissolving,..

          122. INSIDE THE COMPOUND. THE BREAD VAN. DAY.- 122.
          MAX'S eyes flicker open to a slow, distorted version of

                         'HAPPY BIRTHDAY"
          As he fights to make sense of his surroundings, we see
          that his wounds have been stitched and dressed.
          He lifts his head, looking through the back door of
          the bread van.

          Then, beyond the KID, coming into clear focus, he sees
          the prime mover attached to the tanker.
          The tanker now sports a 'cow-catcher' on the front,
          armour-plating on the bonnet, steel aprons on the wheels
          and a barbed wire net along each side.
          MAX'S vision clears. He sees PAPPAGALLO-on the catwalk
          addressing the CAMP PEOPLE.
          MAX drops his bead back and looks to one side: a bloated
          faces stares back at him.
          The QUIET MAN, is lying unconscious on a stretcher next
          to him.
          MAX lifts his head urgently and looks around. He realises
          that he is in the bread van. The canopy has been removed
          and his stretcher is supported by a collection of 44 gallon
          drums.

          123. INSIDE THE COMPOUND - THE CATWALK. DAY. 123,
          PAPPAGALLO paces the catwalk as he gives final
          instructions to the CAMP PEOPLE gathered below.

                         PAPPAGALLO
          We're going to use the tanker
          and the two assault vehicles to
          punch our way out of here.
          If I'm right, they'll all go
          after the tanker. That'll give
          the rest of you a chance.
          124. INT. BREAD VAN. DAY. 12â¢x.
          MAX is sitting up, binding his leg tight with
          bandages, clipping on his metal knee brace.

          Split up. Go as hard as you

          there's a bridge. At Powder

          our rendezvous...
          As MAX struggles to haul himself out of the bread van,
          the FERAL KID hands him his equipment belt.

          MAX, grim-faced, starts to walk towards the tanker.
          Blood seeps through the bandage on his leg.
          PAPPAGALLO (v/o)
          But! Only give us 'til sunset.
          If we haven't made it by then,
          keep going!
          PAPPAGALLO swings down off the catwalk, heading for the
          cabin of the tanker.
          The meeting breaks up - the CAMP PEOPLE moving to take
          up their positions on the various vehicles.

                         MAX
          I'll drive the tanker...
          Everybody stops, turning to look at him.
          MAX is staring at PAPPAGALLO, swaying slightly, hands
          clenched,

                         MAX
          Until you're clear of

          The CURMUDGEON breaks in:

          He tosses MAX his sawn-off shotgun and a bandolier
          containing six cartridges.

          The tanker stands at the far end of the compound. Behind
          it, the GYRO CAPTAIN is spinning the rotor of his machine.
          A dune buggy and the Lone Wolf's car - armour-plated
          since being captured by the camp - wait on either side
          of the tanker.
          Beyond the gate the MARAUDERS have formed an arc of

          MAX sits in the tanker, checking out the controls,
          familiarising himself with the machine...
          WARRIOR WOMAN stands on the running board.
          She turns as the MECHANIC clambers on board. He glares
          at her, daring her to stop him:

                         MECHANIC
          I sweated blood on this mother.
          And no bastard's gonna make me
          go in no lousy bread van.
          MAX kicks over the big engine...

          WEZ stands on the back of a tow truck, beyond him
          we see the arc of vehicles, engines gunning, straining
          at the leash...
          The Humungus vehicle eases forward into frame...
          The TWO VICTIMS on the front of his vehicle have
          their heads hooded.

          129.

          129. INSIDE THE COMPOUND. DAY.
          MAX is revving the engine higher and higher.
          WARRIOR WOMAN climbs up to the top of the tanker...
          PAPPAGALLO starts the assault vehicle.
          WARRIOR WOMAN finds the FERAL KI.D crouched down in
          her position behind the protective plate. Holding
          the KID by his arm, she passes him down to MAX who
          passes him down to the ground... PAPPAGALLO yells
          for someone to come and take him...
          The LUSTY GIRL runs forward... the FERAL KID avoids
          her. MAX engages the engine. The tanker rumbles
          forward, gathering speed as it runs the length of the
          compound. BIG REBECCA, at the wheel of the school bus
          draws the vehicle aside - revealing the burnt out
          wreck of the road racer on the causeway and the
          MARAUDERS beyond.

          The HUMUNGUS has opened his gun case and removes the

          The WARRIOR WOMAN and the MECHANIC lie low as the
          tanker roars out the gate, ploughing through the
          burnt out wreck,"knocking it into the ditch.
          The HUMUNGUS, raises his gun, calmly taking aim at the
          oncoming tanker...
          As the tanker accelerates towards him, the gyrocopter
          swoops out of the compound and over the MARAUDERS.
          The GYRO CAPTAIN drops three burning molotov cocktails.
          They fall in and around a road racer at one end of
          the arc... the road racer bursts into flames...
          The GYRO CAPTAIN whoops with delight.

          1.32. THE BREAK OUT. OUTSIDE THE COMPOUND. DAY. 132.
          With the Lone Wolf machine and the dune buggy close
          alongside, MAX steers the tanker towards the burning
          road racer.
          The HUMUNGUS fires... once...
          The bullet dents the protective plate mounted on the
          front of the tanker but does no further damage.
          Twice... three times!
          Two more dents,
          The tanker keeps going crashing through the burning
          wreck... breaking the Marauders' cordon...

          133. ON BOARD THE BYROCOPTER. DAY. 133,
          The GYRO CAPTAIN has banked around and is swooping low.
          Having swung around, the GYRO CAPTAIN, swoops down,
          taking aim on the Humungus machine with another fistful.
          of lighted bottles.
          The HUMUNGUS looks up. He swings the revolver up,
          taking aim at the approaching gyrocopter.
          He fires!
          The bullet hits, piercing the right rudder peddle.
          Dropping his bottles, the GYRO CAPTAIN screams and
          looks down: blood pours from what is left of his
          right foot.

          MAX glances up to see the gyrocopter, flying ezaatically,,
          swoop over and bank away towards the horizon..
          On top of the tanker WARRIOR WOMAN and the MECHANIC
          prepare to fire their weapons.
          Behind them, the HUMUNGUS and his HORDE power over the
          rise, pursuing the tanker.
          Suddenly, three of the Marauder vehicles skid to a halt,
          They start to turn back towards the compound, where the
          remaining camp vehicles are making their bid for freedom.
          The bread van and three other vehicles have followed the
          yellow school bus out onto the causeway.
          They skirt round the back of the compound and head off
          across country.
          The HUMUNGUS screams at his men through the amplifier:

                         HUMUNGUS
          The tanker! All on the tanker!
          As the three Marauder vehicles turn to rejoin the
          tanker chase... whoomp! a massive flash fills the
          sky. The camp erupts in flame, followed by a series
          of rolling explosions.
          The camp people have destroyed what they cannot take ...

          WIPE.

          1.35. DUNE BUGGY INCIDENT. HIGHWAY. DAY. 135,
          As the tanker surges towards us, we see the dune
          buggy, the Lone Wolf' machine and the pursuing
          MARAUDERS, surrounding it.
          MAX grimaces as he changes gears. His leg is bleeding
          freely now...
          He looks to the passenger-side:
          The dune buggy, driven by the BLACKSMITH and manned
          by PISMO, leaps onto the road in front of=the tanker.
          A tow truck, manned by SKINHEADS, converges on it from
          the driver's side.

          On the back of the dune buggy PISMO lifts his crossbow...
          unaware that, behind him, Wez's convertible tow truck
          â¢ is approaching fast.
          The FIRST OF THE TWO SKINHEADS on the back of the tow
          truck fires his crossbow.,,
          The arrow sails past PISMO'S ear. PISMO fires.., He
          hits the FIRST SKINHEAD but the arrow bounces off the
          SKINHEAD'S protective armour. The SKINHEAD grins.
          PISMO hurries to reload...
          The SECOND SKINHEAD raises his bow, aiming at PISMO.
          An arrow hits the SECOND SKINHEAD in the back of the
          head.
          PISMO looks up to see WARRIOR WOMAN reloading her
          longbow.
          PISMO grins at her... behind him, WETS arm reaches
          down and hooks the jib chain around the roll bar of the
          dune buggy...
          The tow truck accelerates... the chain tightens...
          PISMO screams as he is thrown through the air.
          WEZ'S tow truck drags the dune buggy askew...
          It rolls in front of the tanker... MAX has no choice.
          The cow catcher shunts the dune buggy aside, sending it
          tumbling off the road.
          MAX struggles with the wheel,., managing to keep the
          vehicle on the road.,.
          He looks down in the side mirror: two road racers and
          a dune buggy - followed by the Humungus machine - surge
          up behind the tanker.
          From behind protective plates on top of the tanker the
          MECHANIC hurls a molotov cocktail...
          The FARMER, stationed at the rear of the tanker does
          the same...
          The two bottles smash into the first road racer. It
          bursts into flames... swerves in front of the other
          road racer, ramps off the road and plunges into a
          Marauder's dune buggy.
          PAPPAGALLO, who has been forced off the road, narrowly
          avoids the wreck.

          The Skinhead tow truck draws alongside the tanker,
          near Max' s door.
          The SECOND SKINHEAD, twirling a grappling hook, lets
          it fly.
          It trails out towards the tanker cabin,.. flies through
          the driver's window.., and lands virtually in MAX'S lap...
          As the tow truck swerves away from the tanker the cable
          tightens.
          The grappling hook drags across MAX'S arm, tearing away
          part of the sleeve and hooks onto the door...
          The tow truck brakes... Max's door is ripped off its
          hinges...

          137. THE REAR OF THE TANKER INCIDENT. DAY.' 137,
          A SMEGMA CRAZY riding in the cabin of the tow truck
          is encouraged by this success...
          He begins twirling his grappling hook as the vehicle
          approaches the back of the tanker...
          The FARMER pops up from behind a protective plate and
          fires his crossbow...
          The arrow-misses the tow truck, flies through the caged
          window of a road racer armed with a 4-pak and lodges
          in the driver's helmet.
          The DRIVER pulls off his helmet... the arrow has barely
          creased his scalp.
          The S14EGMA CRAZY hurls his grappling hook...
          It caches the FARMER by the leg and hooks on to the
          lip of the back protective plate.
          The cable snaps taut, the FARMER screams.
          MAX feels the sudden tug on the tanker, He changes
          down...
          The tow truck is dragged along, veering out of control.
          The strain pops the rivets off the tanker's back plate.
          it comes away in one piece... carrying away the FARMER
          and the steel aprons protecting the rear wheels...
          The tow truck tumbles and rolls...

           On top of the tanker, the MECHANIC has lit another
          molotov cocktail...
          He swings back to throw...
          The road racer, armed with the 4-pak'swings alongside
          and fires.
          Three arrows rat-a-tat against the protective plates.
          the fourth hits the MECHANIC'S upraised arm...
          The bottle drops... and smashes on top of the tanker...
          spreading flames.
          The HUMUNGUS accelerates hard towards the now-undefended
          rear of the tanker. He pulls a rope, whipping the hoods
          off the heads of the TWO VICTIMS lashed to the front.
          They scream as the back of the tanker looms in front of
          them.

          139. WEZ TAKES OUT THE FIRST TYRE.DAY. 139.
          MAX looks in the passenger-side mirror...
          Wez's convertible tow truck is drawing alongside the
          left rear wheels of the prime mover.
          WEZ fires an arrow into the first tyre...
          It explodes,,. flailing cable and rubber.,.
          As WEZ reloads, another MOHAWKER - wearing two bizarre
          bear claws on his crossbow gauntlets - steadies himself
          on the back of the tow truck... ready to jump aboard
          the tanker.
          Pappagallo's Lone Wolf machine appears in the background.

          140, WARRIOR WOMAN IS SHOT. DAY. 1,40.
          WARRIOR WOMAN turns to see that the MECHANIC is losing
          the battle with the flames. In vain he tries to stop
          his clothes catching alight,..
          Rising to her feet WARRIOR WOMAN fires an arrow at the
          BEAR CLAW BIKER... hitting him in his protective pads
          throwing him off balance.
          As WARRIOR WOMAN scrambles along the top of the tanker
          towards the MECHANIC, TWO MARAUDERS fire at her,

          She is hit, once in the protective plate around her
          kidneys and once in the thigh.,,
          From the Lone Wolf vehicle PAPPAGALLO and the FERAL
          KID watch as she staggers forward,..
          In the tow truck, WEZ has reloaded and fires at WARRIOR
          WOMAN. The arrow hits her in the back... she buckles
          and falls into the barbed wire.
          MAX watches helplessly in the rear vision mirror as
          she struggles in the wire.

          141. CONVERTIBLE TOW TRUCK. DAY. 141.
          As WEZ reloads his crossbow, the Lone Wolf machine
          accelerates alongside the tow truck.
          The KID throws his steel boomerang... Yiitting Wez's
          crossbow gauntlet, preventing him from aiming.
          The MASKED MOHAWKER driving the tow truck turns to see...
          PAPPAGALLO firing his gauntlet crossbow.
          The MASKED MOHAWKER screams as the arrow passes through
          his neck...
          The convertible tow truck swerves in and bounces off the
          tanker.
          WEZ is thrown off balance...
          The BEAR CLAW BIKER grabs the barbed wire on the side
          of the tanker for support...
          The tow truck swerves away, out of control, leaving
          the BEAR CLAW BIKER clinging to the wire,
          WEZ scrambles over into the driver's seat, bringing
          the vehicle back under control.

          142. WARRIOR WOMAN AND THE MECHANIC. DAY. 1.42.
          WARRIOR WOMAN, caught in the wire by her clothing,
          struggles to remain conscious as she slips-closer to
          the tanker's wheels.
          The MECHANIC, who has managed to extinguish the flames,
          crawls towards her. Her clothing tearing... his hand
          reaches out... further... further... and grabs her.
          A road racer draws alongside them.

          fire another arrow into the MECHANIC.
          The MECHANIC shudders, the WARRIOR WOMAN slips - her
          weight dragging them both off the tanker.

          143, MAX ATTACKS. DAY. 143,
          MAX, enraged, tears off the sling which supports his
          wrist. He grabs the shotgun off the seat next to him.
          He swings the gun around then pumps both barrels into
          the road racer: the first blast shatters the windscreen
          the second blows off the bonnet...
          The GAYBOY BERSERKER is unharmed.
          MAX hauls down hard on the wheel...
          The tanker swerves into the road racer, taking it
          through a guide post and into the 'rough'...
          The tanker barrels over the road racer, rolling it,
          tumbling it into another Marauder's vehicle.
          MAX changes down and hurls the tanker back onto the
          highway. The BEAR CLAW BIKER hangs on desperately...
          MAX grabs two of the four remaining cartridges and
          quickly reloads the shotgun.

          143. BOARDING THE TANKER. DAY. 143.
          The Humungus machine draws up behind the undefended
          tanker.
          A GAYBOY BERSERKER clambers to the front of the
          Humungus vehicle - between the TWO VICTIMS - and leaps
          onto the back of the tanker.
          Further along the tanker, a MOHAWK BIKER with PILLION
          RIDER has drawn alongside. The PILLION RIDER helps the
          BEAR CLAW BIKER swing up above the wire...
          Once he is on top, the BEAR CLAW BIKER hauls the PILLION
          RIDER on board.
          The MOHAWK BIKER accelerates alongside the leading set
          of wheels - one of which has already been blown apart.
          He raises his bow taking aim...
          The flying steel belt of the shreaded tyre lashes around
          his arm, dragging him and his bike beneath the rig...

          On its way through the bike has ruptured a small hose
          underneath the tanker. We see something trickling out
          of the tank... streaming down the road.
          It's sand!

          145. THE MARAUDERS ON BOARD. DAY. 145.
          On board the tanker, the GAYBOY BERSERKER scrambles
          towards the cabin, leaping the gap between the tank
          and the prime mover...
          MAX looks up at the 'thump' overhead...
          The GAYBOY BERSERKER braces himself, taking aim through
          the roof... he fires...
          The arrow rips through the metal and buries itself in
          the seat between MAX'S legs...
          The GAYBOY BERSERKER prepares to reload.
          MAX brakes...
          The HUMUNGUS, tailgating him, isn't quick enough. The
          front of his vehicle smacks one corner of the tanker,
          crushing the BROKEN MAN strapped to the front.
          The GAYBOY BERSERKER on the roof pitches forward,
          falling past the windscreen and out of sight over the
          front of the tanker...
          The PILLION RIDER and BEAR CLAW BIKER scramble and
          fall..

          146, THE GYRO CAPTAIN AGAIN. DAY 146.
           On the crest of a hill about 400 yards ahead, MAX
          sees another vehicle.
          The gyrocopter stands in the middle of the road
          facing away from the chase...
          The GYRO CAPTAIN has bandaged his foot and is trying to
          repair the right rudder peddle...
          As the chase looms up behind him he turns... we see
          that the GAYBOY BERSERKER is clinging to the cow-
          catcher on the front of the tanker.
          Furiously, the GYRO CAPTAIN starts spinning the rotor
          by hand, turning over the motor.
          As the tanker bears down on him he takes off - so
          steeply that he almost stalls.
          Once he is airborne he looks down... assessing, cursing.
          Down below we see Pappagallo's Lone Wolf vehicle draw
          alongside Wez's convertible tow truck.

          147. OFF ROAD. THE FERAL KID FALLS. DAY. 147.
          WEZ looks over his shoulder...
          PAPPAGALLO comes alongside... the FERAL KID, standing
          on the back of the machine, hands him a crossobw.
          WEZ wrenches down hard on the wheel... shunting into
          the Lone Wolf vehicle... sending Pappagallo's arrow
          astray...
          The FERAL KID loses his footing, tumbling off the side
          of the vehicle.
          PAPPAGALLO turns in dismay... as WEZ comes in to
          shunt him again...

          148. MAX UNDER SIEGE. DAY. 148.
          A bike with a side car accelerates alongside the tanker.
          The SIDECAR RIDER fires and takes out another tyre...
          The BEAR CLAW BIKER signals, calling for a weapon.
          The SIDE CAR RIDER throws him a large, powerful
          crossbow.
          The BEAR CLAW BIKER catches it and starts to haul himself
          onto the roof of the cabin.

           The SIDE CAR RIDER leaps onto the tanker.
          At the rear of the tanker a SMEGMA CRAZY leaps off
          the front of the Humungus vehicle and ontc the ladder
          which leads to the top of the tanker.

          149, OFF ROAD. THE KID ON HIS FEET. DAY. 149.
          The FERAL KID staggers to his feet as Wez's tow truck
          and Pappagallo's Lone Wolf vehicle continue their
          shunting... the KID turns... a street car and a bike
          are roaring towards him. The KID starts running..,

          150. OFF ROAD. THE EROSION DITCH. DAY. 1,50,
          In the scrub ahead - over WEZ'S shoulder - we see an
          erosion ditch looming up. WEZ brakes and turns the
          wheel...
          The tow truck and the Lone Wolf machine go into a
          slide...
          WEZ manages to avoid the ditch and keep going but the
          Lone Wolf machine's wheels plunge into the ditch,
          bringing the vehicle to an abrupt halt...

          151, MAX STILL UNDER SIEGE. DAY. 151.
          As MAX looks back, a hand comes over the front bull bar
          of the tanker, followed by the GAYBOY BERSERKER'S bead.
          He sees the BEAR CLAW BIKER and signals for the crossbow...
          the BEAR CLAW BIKER throws it...
          The crossbow lands on the bonnet...
          MAX turns, sees him... and raises the shotgun... the
          GAYBOY BERSERKER ducks... MAX waits...
          The BEAR CLAW BIKER works his way to Max's window...
          The SMEGMA CRAZY jumps from the tanker onto the cabin
          roof. =
          MAX looks up as the man's feet thump on t-he metal above
          his head.
          The passenger's window shatters; the SIDE CAR RIDER
          clings there, raising his crossbow...

          On the roof, the SMEGMA CRAZY braces himself,
          preparing to fire a crossbow bolt through the roof..
          MAX raises the shotgun, firing point blank at the
          SIDE CAR RIDER, blowing him away.
          Immediately he fires the second barrel through the
          roo4f. the blast hurls the SMEGMA CRAZY off the back
          of the cabin.
          MAX breaks open the barrel...
          MAX grabs his last two shells as a muscled arm reaches
          through the open door. MAX recoils. It is the BEAR
          CLAW BIKER. The cartridges fall to the floor.
          The BEAR CLAW rips the seat next to MAX'S right shoulder.
          MAX zig-zags the tanker down the highway trying to keep
          the BEAR CLAW off his balance.
          Thud! The BEAR CLAW strikes again - this time - through
          the rear window into Max's shoulder padding,..
          The BEAR CLAW BIKER'S foot slips, MAX screams with pain
          as the claws dig into his left shoulder.
          The BEAR CLAW hangs there unable to move.
          MAX tries desperately to reach the two cartridge shells
          rolling around on the floor,
          On the front of the tanker the GAY BOY BERSERKER pokes
          his head up for another look...

          WEZ streams in behind the MARAUDERS in the bike and
          street car.
          They are bearing down fast,..
          When a rope drops from above, swinging past the KID,
          The KID grabs it and is hauled up just as the

          A GAYBOY BERSERKER in a road racer looks tip to see
          the gyrocopter and the KID...
          He swings a 4-pak around on its axis and fires.
          Three of the four arrows hit the gyrocopter in its
          under-belly...
          The aircraft makes a terrible noise and dips radically,
          dropping down towards the tanker.
          The KID clings desperately to the rope... looking up
          and then down at the rapidly approaching tanker.

          MAX is struggling to pull the bear claw out of his
          shoulder when he sees the FERAL KID fly past the
          missing driver's door.
          MAX throws his arm out as far as it will go... grabbing
          hold of the KID, hauling him into the tanker.
          MAX and the KID look out as the gyrocopter bucks
          wildly and crashes into the ground.

          Up ahead on the left, we see Wez's tow truck drawing
          alongside the tanker.
          Pieces of tyre are flailing everywhere... the tanker is
          down on one side... slowing...

          tanker.

          WEZ, pale with fury, speaks softly:

          I know where there's guzzolene,
          WEZ whirls around and fires his crossbow,,.
          The arrow buries itself in the HUMUNGUS'S mask...
          The big man crumbles to the ground, dead.
          The rest of the HORDE are arriving. As their vehicles
          screech to a halt TWO SMEGMA CRAZIES and TWO GAYBOY
          BERSERKERS leap out, waving their Jerry cans in the air.
          WEZ, the SECOND MOHAWKER and TWO OTHERS, open fire.

          Through the screaming motor we hear Pappagallo laughing,
          almost hysterical.

          The fuel was with the others.
          It's already at Powder River.
          MAX reaches across and cuts the engine... the vehicle
          rolls to a stop...
          MAX g-abs PAPPAGALLO.

                         MAX

          our only chance.
          MAX raises the Bear Claw arm to PAPPAGALLO'S face.
          We see that the crossbow strapped to the forearm is
          still loaded.

          accelerate away from the tanker. Dead bodies litter
          the ground.
          WEZ urges the OTHER THREE on - pursuing the Lone
          Wolf machine.
          As the Humungus machine winds around the bends, we see,
          the Lone Wolf vehicle approaching over a distant hillcrest.

          170. UNDULATING HIGHWAY, DAY. 170.
           MAX guns the vehicle over the rise...
           Over his shoulder we see the Humungus machine, 400 yards
           away, approaching at terrific speed...
           MAX steels himself... 300 yards.
           The two vehicles are on direct collision course... 200
          yards...
           The two victims have been taken from the front of the
           Humungus machine and something else is in their place...
           MAX sees that it is the FERAL KID, lashed there - upside
          down...
          He throws the wheel, sending the vehicle into a slide,
          spinning clear of the Humungus machine.
          The Lone Wolf vehicle spins around... Thud! into the
          bikes of TWO MARAUDERS flanking WEZ.
          The third - a MOHAWK BIKER - follows WEZ,
          As soon as MAX has the Lone Wolf machine under control,
          he guns the two engines un,s is off after WEZ. He hits

                         

                         

                         

                         

          171. HUMUNGUS MACHINE. DAY. 171.
          As the vehicle approaches we see the KID, his head inches
          off the bitumen... WEZ looks back to see MAX overtaking
          the MOHAWK BIKER.

          172. THE LONE WOLF MACHINE.DAY 172.
          As MAX overtakes the MOHAWK BIKER, he twitches the
          wheel... the big car swipes the bike.., sending the
          MOHAWKER sailing off the road.
          The Lone :Wolf surges away, catching up to the Humungus
          machine.
          173. HU1!UNGUS MACHINE. tAY. 173.
           WEZ looks back at the approaching machine. He floors
           the accelerator, "red-lining" the engine...
           As the Humungus machine surges into camera we do a
           track, in zoom, on the FERAL KID'S face, turning the
           camera through 180 degrees.

          174. THE KID'S UPSIDE DOWN POINT OF VIEW. DAY. 174.
          We are upside down as we rocket along the curving,
          undulating, highway, through a flock of birds...
          towards a puddle of water... as the water splashes on
          the lens...

                         CUT TO:
          The Humungus vehicle as it roars through the water,
          passing a startled PAPPAGALLO walking along the road,..
          SAX rockets past moments later.

          175. THE LONE WOLF MACHINE.DAY . 175.
          MAX raises the Bear Claw arm as he closes in on WEZ,
          drawing alongside the Humungus machine ... I.

                         ALL

                         

                         

                         

                         
          I /b . '1.1 HUNIUNU ,a MACHI.NL. DAY . .176,
          WEZ reaches down... to the toggle switch next to the
          nitrous oxide bottles... waiting for the right moment, .
          He flicks the switch...
          He is thrown back by the massive acceleration... the
          Humungus machine surges away from camera...

          177. THE LONE WOLF MACHINE. DAY, 17Z.
          MAX doesn't have time to aim the crossbow still attached
          to the bear claw arm.
          He fires, the arrow disappearing in a blurr...
          The Humungus machine thunders away, rocketing along the
          open highway... eating up the white line...
          Upside down, the FERAL KID is terror-struck: the
          Humungus machine roars straight into a wide curve,
          leaving the road, continuing out into the wasteland.
          The Humungus machine charges through the salt bush..

          178, THE LONE WOLF CAR. DAY. 178.
          Over MAX'S shoulder, we see that the vehicle is
          slowing . .
          MAX follows i- out into the wasteland...
          The vehicle comes to a halt...
          Cautiously, MAX draws alongside: WEZ sits stock still,
          looking out at the desert beyond...
          It is not until MAX is alongside his face that we see
          the tip of the arrow protruding from his left eye...
          On the front of the vehicle the FERAL KID starts to
          sob...

          FADE TO BLACK.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          179. HILLTOP. POWDER RIVER. DUSK. 179.
           MAX stands on a hilltop, overlooking Powder River.
          â¢ Below him, the convoy - led by the yellow school bus
           - moves out across the plain.
          A dust trail appears on the horizon,' racing to
          intercept the convoy.
          MAX lifts his broken binoculars: it's the GYRO CAPTAIN,
          bumping along in the twisted, wreck of the gyrocopter -
          its rotors gone, engine screaming.
          MAX shakes his head and walks back to the Lone Wolf
          machine on the top of the hill.
          Once again we hear the Old Man's voice:
          NARRATOR (v/o)
          That was the last we ever saw
          of him...

          180. INT. SCHOOL BUS. DUSK. 180.

           We see PAPPAGALLO, face set with determination, driving
           the yellow school bus.
          NARRATOR (v/o)
          As for the rest of us...
          Pappagallo led us north...
          to safety - to a place in the
          sun...
          In the tenth year, nurturing
          his vision of a new world,
          he died felling timber.
          The LUSTY GIRL rolls her eyes and sighs as the GYRO
          CAPTAIN draws alongside her window...
          NARRATOR (v/o)
          The Captain and the Girl waged
          war for years... together they
          raised eight children...
          And as for me...

          180. Cont. 180
          The FERAL KID, sitting in the back of the bus, turrs
          to face us. His bright yellow eyes stare directly
          into camera...
          NARRATOR (v/o) '
          in the fullness of time,
          I became the leader - the
          chief of the Great Northern
          Tribe...

          DISSOLVE.

          181. THE NARRATOR'S FACE.

          181,
           For the first time we see the Narrator's eyes - they
           are bright yellow.

                         MARCO'S VOICE

               Approximately sixty four hundred hours
               before Desert Storm, we were on a routine
               recon inside Iraqi-controlled terrain,
               assessing troop strength for what Saddam
               Hussein promised to be the mother of all
               wars ... but turned out to be just a
               little warm up for the whomping he got a
               few years later.

    FADE IN:


2   EXT. DESERT - NIGHT                                           2

    PROWLING ACROSS undulating land dotted with BURNING OIL
    WELLS that give the vague impression of, well, hell. The
    inky sky is awash with stars.

    ON THE CREST OF A DUNE

    A U.S. ARMY BRADLEY FIGHTING VEHICLE and matching HUMMER
    sit, waiting.

                          KUWAIT, 1991

    Muffled THUMP of rap music thrums from the Bradley, and low
    voices stray from the open doors of the Hummer.

                         MARCO (O.S.)

               Why can't we go directly in ...

3   INT./EXT. THE HUMMER - NIGHT                                  3

    A topographical MAP glows on the LCD screen of a laptop
    portable, faintly lighting the faces of CAPT. BEN MARCO and
    his big, gentle, French guide, LAURENT TOKAR.

                         MARCO

                   (pointing)
               ... this way --?

                         LAURENT

               Yes, well -- I see the Captain enjoys the
               road less travelled.
    Marco is seemingly unflappable, completely engaged by life.

                         MARCO

               The Captain enjoys not dragging his ass
               down the highway for every Tom, Dick and
               Qadhafi to take a whack at.
    Laurent swings his finger on the arc of approach.




                                            8/18/03   2.








                    LAURENT

          Well. Of course it is very bad, here.
          And here. And here, here, here, here --

                     MARCO

          Mines?

                      LAURENT

          Tricky.    Swedish-made.

                     MARCO

          Dammit.
He refers to some satellite surveillance maps --

                    MARCO

          Nobody at Command said anything about --

                    LAURENT

          Exxon and Global Petroleum hired private
          contractors to do the work in '86, as
          part of their asset security program.
              (beat)
          Hired an Iraqi firm, in fact, who, now,
          well -- only they know where the little
          Nordic fuckers are planted.

                    MARCO

              (turns away)
          Sgt. Shaw!
No response.
And we RUSH TOWARD: A SOLDIER IN A LAWN CHAIR, face lifted
to the heavens, sitting directly between the two armored
vehicles. This is SGT. RAYMOND PRENTISS SHAW, late
twenties, haunted and aloof.

                    MARCO

              (suddenly behind him)
          Sergeant.

                     RAYMOND

          Sir.

                    MARCO

          Rolling in two minutes.

                     RAYMOND

          Yes sir.
Beat.

                    MARCO

          Everything okay?




                                                  8/18/03   3.








                         RAYMOND

               Yes, Captain. Everything's fine.   Here.
                   (standing up)
               I'll "rally" the troops.

4   INT. THE BRADLEY FIGHTING VEHICLE - NIGHT                     4

    MUSIC blares around eight soldiers, including wiseguy PFC.
    ED MAVOLE, crowded into space designed for four --

                         MAVOLE

               Yo Melvin. You gonna play that hand, or
               hatch it?
    -- CPL. AL MELVIN grunts, then they all look up, almost in
    unison, at Raymond when he swings open the back door. PFC.
    BOBBY BAKER, a slender man, barely eighteen, a driver,
    ejects a CD from the onboard stereo. Silence.

                         RAYMOND

               We're moving out.
    Beat.   He shuts the door again.

5   EXT. THE BRADLEY - NIGHT                                      5

    Raymond waits. Another beat.     Then some LAUGHTER from
    inside the vehicle.
    He shifts his shoulders, walks back into the darkness.

8   INT. HUMMER - NIGHT - TRAVELLING                              8

    Marco, bug-like in night goggles, drives the infamous
    Highway of Death -- a macabre landscape of abandoned cars,
    trucks, minivans, shopping baskets, broken wooden pushcarts
    and festering fires; pots and pans and clothes and personal
    belongings are scattered out into the desert on either side
    of the road. Laurent rides shotgun. Raymond is in the
    back, facing forward, rifle at ease.

                           RAYMOND

               Captain?

                           MARCO

               Sergeant?

                         RAYMOND

               Why don't I ever ride in the Bradley with
               the other enlisted personnel?




                                                       8/18/03   4.








                         MARCO

                   (hesitates)
               Maybe I enjoy your company, Sergeant.

                         RAYMOND

               Sir, I don't want to be singled out for
               special treatment because of my mother's
               position --

                         MARCO

               Too late for that, Shaw. As a charter
               member of the Lucky Sperm Club your
               benefits include unlimited suck-up from
               High-ranking Officers hoping to curry
               Congressional favor for their future
               career moves. But. If you want to ride
               in the Bradley, hey, I got no objections.

                         RAYMOND

                   (worried)
               Trust me, sir, I don't wish to ride in
               the Bradley with the others, I'm just ...
                   (beat)
               The men don't care for me very much.

                         MARCO

               No, they don't. But. On the plus side,
               you don't really like them, either.

                         RAYMOND

               That's absolutely correct, Captain.

                            MARCO

               So.   See?    It, you know.   Balances out.

                            LAURENT

               -- Uh-oh.
     Marco follows Laurent's gaze out the side window --

9    NIGHT VISION GOGGLES: JUST OVER A DUNE                           9

     SOLDIERS ON CAMELS slip along like ghosts, pacing the
     Hummer, parallel at maybe fifty yards --

                                                         WHIP PAN

     Through the driver's side window: more of the CAMEL CAVALRY
     tracks with them --

                             MARCO

               Camels.      You gotta be kidding me.

10   BACK TO - HUMMER - MARCO                                         10

     glancing to his rear-view mirror --




                                                 8/18/03    5.








11   IN THE MIRROR - ON THE ROAD BEHIND THEM:                       11

     Two dark trucks converge suddenly out of the darkness, on
     either side of the Bradley Fighting Vehicle --
     They SLAM together in a pincer-wedge just in front of it,
     and the Bradley CRASHES into them -- climbs over them, off-
     balance, and SMASHES DOWN onto the roof of one of the trucks
     and is effectively low-bridged -- tracks spinning, unable to
     move -- DARK FIGURES scurry from the trucks.
12   THE HUMMER -- skids around in a tight 180, stops, facing       12
     back at the helpless Bradley. Automatic weapons fire in
     bursts, bright, and ricochet harmlessly away --
     IN THE HUMMER -- MARCO scrambles up out of his seat, pops
     the roof hatch and screams at Raymond --

                         MARCO

               Take the wheel, Sergeant!

13   EXT. HUMMER - NIGHT                                            13

     machine gun -- drops his NVGs back over his eyes and FIRES
     at the dispersing enemy figures around the Bradley --

14   INT. BRADLEY FIGHTING VEHICLE - NIGHT                          14

     Marco's cover fire RATTLES insanely off the armor --

                         MELVIN

               Quarter million dollars of U.S. Army
               hardware rat-fucked by a coupla used
               Toyotas.
     He grabs a fire extinguisher and aims it at flames flaring
     from a console of instruments.

     TRACER BULLETS. A lone enemy SOLDIER runs forward lugging a
     personal rocket launcher -- disappears behind a dune --
18   MARCO -- coming off the machine gun, grabbing Raymond's        18
     rifle and rolling toward the back of the Hummer -- as he
     kicks out of the rear door --

     Rocket Launcher man does a face-plant in the sand.
21   THE BRADLEY -- its rear door HEAVES OPEN and our guys spill        21
     out, coughing, hacking, guns ready.
22   THE HUMMER - SAME TIME -- careens suddenly away, exposing a        22
     surprised Marco -- Raymond has lost control, fishtails into
     a deep trough -- the Hummer lurches onto its side, engine
     racing -- wheels spinning uselessly in air -- stalling --

                         MARCO

               Oh shit, Shaw --
23   ANOTHER ENEMY WITH A ROCKET LAUNCHER -- slides around an           23
     overturned trailer and FIRES:

25   THE ROCKET hits the Bradley Fighting Vehicle at a slant into       25
     its exposed belly, and the truck EXPLODES -- Marco's team
     scattering, pressing themselves into the sand, covering
     their heads --

     behind a podium, in his crisp dress uniform.    His current
     self: older, tired. Lost for a moment.

               Scared?

               You don't really have time to be scared.
     Uneasy rustling of an o.s. audience. Somebody coughs.         An
     air-conditioner KICKS IN, rumbling, becoming --

27   EXT. THE KUWAITI HIGHWAY - NIGHT - MARCO                        27

     raises his head.   SEES:
     -- the Bradley, in flames.
     -- the Hummer, on its side in the ditch, headlights aglow --
     -- shadows of enemy soldiers, retreating across the dunes.
     -- MILITARY HELICOPTERS materializing out of the smoke and
     darkness ... circling ... NO SOUND --

                         MARCO (V.O.)

               I couldn't hear anything, as I was
               temporarily deaf from the explosion of
               the Bradley ...
     -- SOLDIERS WITH GAS MASKS lean out of the open doors of the
     helicopters and drop GAS CANISTERS down on Marco's team.

                                             IN SLOWING MOTION:

28   MARCO'S SQUAD -- the effect of the gas is immediate: Mavole     28
     collapses in his tracks. Melvin points a gun skyward and
     FIRES a burst that goes harmlessly wide of a helicopter.
     Then he falls on his back. HEAVY, LUMINOUS, YELLOW-ORANGE
     VAPOR swirls across the battle --
     WITH MARCO -- his shirt pulled up over his mouth and nose,
     he wheels to get away from the drifting gas, feet unsteady.
     Grabs a dazed Bobby Baker by the collar --

                         MARCO

               I got your back, Baker.   I got ...
     -- and tries to pull him to safety ... knees buckling ... he
     looks up:
29   MARCO'S P.O.V. - THE HUMMER -- is no   longer stalled on its    29
     side in the ditch, but improbably is   righted again, back on
     four wheels and attacking. A vision    of Raymond behind the
     machine gun, firing at the advancing   enemy --
     WITH MARCO -- trying to process this.    Coughing.   Fading.

     A Boy Scout luncheon banquet.

                         WASHINGTON D.C., NOW

     A full chicken buffet table, banners, flags, and over one
     hundred SCOUTS, LEADERS and DADS, all looking somewhat
     attentively up at the guest speaker, U.S. Army Major Ben
     Marco.

                         MARCO

               Like Edmonds in Korea, Holderman in Viet
               Nam, Raymond Shaw was awarded the
               Congressional Medal of Honor. I signed
               the recommendation myself.
     A hand shoots up.    Marco nods toward it.

       He blinks.

                 concussion -- lost focus -- Sgt. Shaw
                 took command --
       A disheveled man comes into the back of the room noisily,
       as:

                           SCOUT DAD

                 Did your unit sustain any casualties?

                            MARCO

                 Yes.   Two. Two of my people were killed.
       Silence. No more questions. The disheveled man (MELVIN)
       coughs. Marco pointedly ignores him.

                           MARCO

                 The Medal of Honor is the highest award
                 to which any soldier can aspire. From
                 the jungles of Iwo Jima to the desert of
                 Kuwait, what these brave men I've talked
                 about today did will never be forgotten.
                 Since 1917, only 827 medals have been
                 given to a total of more than 30 million
                 Americans in arms. Only three have been
                 awarded in the last 40 years. Who knows?
                 Maybe someday one of you fine boys will
                 earn one yourself in defense of this
                 great nation.
       A SCOUTMASTER, thin, bearded, stands up:

                           SCOUTMASTER

                 Major Marco, on behalf of Troops 484 and
                 488 -- just like to thank you, for coming
                 to talk to us, about the Medal of Honor,
                 and your interesting experiences in the
                 Armed Services.




                                                   8/18/03   10.








                          MARCO

               Thanks for listening. My family has
               claimed the Army as a trade ever since a
               young gunnery officer who grew up with
               Hernando De Soto left Spain for a look at
               the upper Mississippi.
                   (beat)
               My life is in service to my country.

                         MELVIN

               You ever wish it'd been you?

                         MARCO

               Excuse me?

                         MELVIN

               Won the medal. Been the hero.
     Something causes Marco to hesitate.   Then, as if he'd
     rehearsed it:

                         MARCO

               No, I'm just proud to have been there.
     He sits down.   Spattering of polite applause.

37   INT. H.S. AUDITORIUM ENTRANCE - LATER                          37

     The luncheon is breaking up. A couple of scouts chase each
     other through the clusters of men. Marco's leaving. Men
     stop him to shake his hand and thank him for coming.

                         MELVIN

               Major Marco.
     Marco turns, stares blankly into the eyes of the bedraggled-
     looking man, who half-salutes.

                         MELVIN

               It's Al Melvin, Sir. Corporal Melvin.
               From your unit. Desert Storm.
     Marco stares hard. Melvin looks like a homeless guy, his
     clothes rumpled, his fingernails stained and broken, his
     eyes wild with fatigue and paranoia.

                          MARCO

               Melvin.   Jesus -- how are you --

                         MELVIN

                   (intense)
               I have these dreams, Major.

                          MARCO

               Dreams.




                                               8/18/03   11.








                     MELVIN

           Yeah. Kuwait. You and me. Mavole, and
           Baker. Raymond Shaw.
               (beat)
           See, I remember it happened the way you
           just said. And then I don't.

                     MARCO

           Well, we had a pretty rough time over
           there, Al, it was hairy, and -- it was a
           long time ago, now. Memories shift.

                     MELVIN

           Do you have dreams, sir?

                     MARCO

           Everybody has dreams, Corporal --

                     MELVIN

           Not these.
Beat.   Marco stares at him.

                     MARCO

           No I don't.
Melvin's face falls, disappointed. Fumbling in his clothes,
he finds a SPIRAL NOTEBOOK, dog-eared, and fat with
newspaper clippings -- tries to press it into Marco's hands.

                     MELVIN

           It's bad, sir. It's making me crazy. I
           write it down, every night, after I wake
           up, I try to get it all -- it doesn't
           always go together -- all of what I can
           remember, and --

                     MARCO

               (gentle)
           -- Al, you know, maybe you should be
           going to the VA and talking to a doctor,
           I mean if these dreams are really --

                     MELVIN

           -- I've been to doctors!
The notebook DROPS BETWEEN THEM, and PAGES SCATTER on the
floor. Both men go down to collect them --

                     MELVIN

           I'm so stuck, sir. I mean -- I remember
           Shaw saving us, but it does not make
           sense -- it should have been you. And
           Shaw, he --




                                                 8/18/03   12.








                         MARCO

               Well, that's -- it's over and done.
               We've got to move on --
     -- Marco rocks back on his heels as he stares down at a
     SKETCHY PORTRAIT OF AN ARABIC WOMAN whose face is covered
     with intricate designs -- Marco stares curiously, as if he
     recognizes her --

                         MELVIN

               I can't get my hand around it. I thought
               maybe, if you had the dreams ...

                         MARCO

                   (shaken)
               You need money --?

                          MELVIN

               No.   No sir.
     Self-conscious (people are staring) Melvin shoves the
     notebook back inside his jacket.

                         MARCO

               -- here --
     Marco already digging for a crumpled twenty.    Melvin waves
     it off, backing away, suddenly pissed.

                         MELVIN

               I don't need your money.

                          MARCO

               Okay.   Okay. Well, look, Al, I gotta --

                          MELVIN

               Go.

                         MARCO

               -- run, yeah. But.
                   (awkward)
               It was great seeing you.   And good luck
               to you.
     Melvin just scowls sadly at Marco. Flash of glass, a door
     opens and closes, and Marco is gone.

38   EXT. H.S. PARKING LOT - DAY                                    38

     Marco is motionless in his car, head resting against the
     steering wheel. He straightens up, with a thousand-yard
     stare. His hands are trembling. Slowly, he grips the
     steering wheel ... tighter and tighter ... until the
     trembling stops.




                                                    8/18/03   13.








39     INT. SUPERMARKET - CHECK-OUT COUNTER - NIGHT                      39

       A pretty CASHIER (ROSIE) empties Marco's basket: bottled
       water, three romance novels, a bottle of No-Doz, a bag of
       tomatoes and two dozen boxes of instant noodles.

40     INT. APARTMENT BUILDING - CORRIDOR - NIGHT                        40

       Marco comes up the stairs with his groceries. An ELDERLY
       WOMAN sticks her head out from her apartment door:

                             WOMAN

                   -- Thirty seven.
       Marco stops, looks at her blankly.

                             WOMAN

                   From the landing. Every week it gets
                   longer. I'm worried about you.
       He takes the romance novels out of his grocery bag and hands
       them to her.

                             MARCO

                   From the landing. Every week it gets
                   longer. I'm worried about you.
       He takes the romance novels out of his grocery bag and hands
       them to her.

                             MARCO

                   None of these involve slave traders or
                   sheiks, Abby. I checked.

                             WOMAN

                       (blushes)
                   What do I owe you?

                               MARCO

                 -- with public anxiety rekindled by the
                 events of Bloody Friday, with the war on
                 terror marching into yet another year, no
                 end in sight --

       his grocery bag for the No Doz and shakes out half a dozen.

                 -- the American people are looking for a
                 new agenda -- but because this party
                 remains deeply divided on so many issues,
                 the choice of a vice presidential nominee
                 may be the key unifying factor for the
                 delegates of this convention in much the
                 way Johnson helped Kennedy in 1960 ...
       Then he's up on his feet, moving to the kitchen through the

       Raymond Shaw's suit is expensive and crisp, his hair

       KNOCKING on his door -- it opens, and Secret Service AGENT
       EVAN ANDERSON removes his key while SEN. ELEANOR SHAW,
       pretty and ageless, sweeps in -- closing the door on her
       aide (GILLESPIE) --

                           ELLIE

                 Raymond? Darling, what were you going to
                 do, make me stand out there like room
                 service?
       -- soft curves conceal razor claws and titanium backbone --
       she kisses her son on the lips, straightens his collar, his
       tie, lets her hands smooth his shirt to his chest for a
       little too long, and never stops talking:

                           ELLIE

                 I asked downstairs and Miss Freeman, your
                 'wrangler' -- helpful Ms. Freeman -- said
                 you were up here practicing your speech.
                 Honestly, I don't understand why you
                 insist upon isolating yourself, people
                 adore you, Raymond, they crave your
                 company and yet here you are, holed up,
                 as if you were some kind of emotionally
                 challenged individual like your father
                 instead of Raymond Prentiss Shaw, a
                 handsome, intelligent, people-loving war
                 hero with a great deal to offer to his
                 party and his country.

                           RAYMOND

                 No.

                           ELLIE

                 No what? Baby, I haven't even asked you
                 a question. Your hair is too flat. And
                 that tie. The tie is wrong.




                                           8/18/03    16.








                    RAYMOND

          No to the question you're going to ask.
          No to all the questions you pretend to
          want to ask --

                    ELLIE

              (the tie)
          Something a little less busy.

                    RAYMOND

          -- and no you may not engage in your
          usual back-door political thuggery to
          shovel me onto the presidential ticket.

                    ELLIE

          Oh. You're not interested? I thought
          you were. Did I miss my cue?

                    RAYMOND

          Of course I'm interested -- I wouldn't be
          here if I wasn't -- but not if it means
          attacking the reputation of a statesman
          like Thomas Jordan, which I'm sure was
          your plan. Let democracy run its course,
          mother. Let the people decide.
Now Ellie stares at him, mouth agape.

                      RAYMOND

          What.

                    ELLIE

          I'm sorry, for a second there I thought
          it was your father speaking -- that
          dreaded Shaw blood rising -- and the
          stink of defeat made me nauseous.

                      RAYMOND

          Mother --

                    ELLIE

          And excuse me, when have I ever attacked
          the honorable Mr. Jordan, despite the
          shameful way his daughter misled you that
          summer at the shore.

                    RAYMOND

          Mother, you chased her away --

                    ELLIE

          If that's how you want to remember it.

                    RAYMOND

          -- you ruined everything.




                                                   8/18/03   17.








                           ELLIE

                 Honey, you're oversimplifying things
                 somewhat -- but, yes, okay -- I promise,
                 promise I will stay out of it. You have
                 my word.
       Raymond stares at her.

                           ELLIE

                 After all, you're young and you have
                 plenty of party conventions ahead of you
                 in which to discover, as your father did,
                 that democracy is an elusive and
                 imperfect science, and the meek do not
                 happily inherit the earth, but simply get
                 eaten by the alpha dogs, chewed up,
                 digested and deposited on the carefully
                 mown parkways of American politics.
       Raymond rolls his eyes.   She ruffles his hair again, heads
       into the bedroom.

                           ELLIE (O.S.)

                 One day, you will, I'm sure, tearfully
                 memorialize me in your acceptance speech.
                 Don't you have a different tie in here?
                 Your grandfather always let me pick his
                 ties.
       Raymond smooths his hair back down.

                           RAYMOND

                 I'm wearing the one I have on.
       No response.

                 ... and some of you no doubt remember my
                 father ... the late Senator John Shaw.
                     (he seems to want to say
                      more, but doesn't)
                 I've been honored to serve my two terms
                 in Congress. But I also grew up on the
                 Hill. I've seen how the game is played
                 by professionals --
       Marco reaches for his steaming cup of coffee, his eyes never
       leaving the screen -- he just doesn't get this at all --

                 -- how deals are struck, committees
                 bullied, agendas bought and sold -- and,
                 with apologies to my mother, I wish to
                 remain an amateur. I believe democracy
                 is not negotiable. We need to secure
                 tomorrow, today.
       Ellie shakes her head fondly, and begins to move away as

       TRACKING with Ellie and Gillespie and his two aides, and a
       posse of three other FORMIDABLE-LOOKING POLITICIANS through
       a hallway crowded with NETWORK CAMERA CREWS, STRAY
       DELEGATES, HIGH SCHOOL MARCHING BAND members and a complete
       DRILL TEAM in red-white-and-blue sequined leotards, as:

                             ELLIE

                 Bluffing?

                           GILLESPIE

                 That was the inference.
       Raymond's speech echoes incoherently through the corridor.

                           ELLIE

                 They should be down on their fat white
                 knees thanking me for saving this party
                 from committing political seppuku.

               You gave them every opportunity to do the
               right thing, Senator.

                   (glances at him)
               No. I gave them one opportunity. And
               that was unusually generous of me.
     She pushes through a door, and into --

48   INT. CONVENTION BACK ROOM - CONTINUOUS                       48

     Raymond's speech plays, low, on a television, and half a
     dozen DELEGATES and POWER PLAYERS with "Arthur For
     President" buttons grimly watch Ellie breeze in. Party
     Chairman VAUGHN UTLY anticipates her:

                         UTLY

               The decision is final, Senator. Tom
               Jordan is on the ticket. We don't need
               your blessing, but we'd like it.

                         ELLIE

                   (smiling:)
               Before we get started, I'm dying to know:
               which genius here hatched the scheme of
               pairing a Sound Bite from Nebraska with a
               relic who thinks keeping suicide bombers
               off our busses is unconstitutional?

                         UTLY

               All the research indicates that an Arthur-
               Jordan ticket sits quite well with the
               American public and --

                         ELLIE

               'Sits quite well' translates into how
               many votes?

                         SENATOR WELLS

               Your son is largely unknown outside of
               New York. His public service, his
               Congressional record, while commendable,
               is --

                         ELLIE

               My son is a war hero.

                         CONGRESSMAN FLORES

                   (cheerful)
               Governor Arthur has agreed to consider
               Raymond for a cabinet post.
     A cold silence.   Ellie stands --




                                           8/18/03    20.








                    ELLIE

          We didn't come here to have a discussion.

          UTLY                            ELLIE

Senator --                          (to her posse)
                                Did we come here to have a
                                discussion?

                    SENATOR WELLS

          Ellie, you don't have the votes to block
          this, or even push the nomination to a
          second ballot.

                    ELLIE

              (ignores him)
          Even running against this cut-and-fold
          vice president, with his party's record
          of abysmal failure at home and abroad,
          Arthur is still unelectable without help.
              (cold, hard logic:)
          Consider. The Governor is a corn-belt
          candidate who -- scratch and sniff --
          looks and smells alot like the kind of
          liberal-labor-intellectual Dukakis was,
          but without, thank God, the helmet.
              (beat)
          Assume our intrepid Arthur can carry the
          Northeast, plus his home ground, and
          California. We're still dead in the
          South, and Southwest, where they win by
          landslides. The mid-central is a toss-
          up. Tom Jordan actually becomes a
          liability in Florida because of his
          Castro-appeasement profile, and in the
          Carolinas, where he fumbles the military
          vote over his "terrorism isn't a war it's
          a social disease" nonsense.
The room is surreally silent. Ellie spins and moves like a
televangelist, preaching to the frightened faithful.

                    ELLIE

          You know this. Your own polls and
          surveys back me up.
              (beat)
          You're counting on Jordan to help you get
          the black vote, women, college kids -- my
          gut instinct says he won't -- and Arthur
          holding the center -- where he's soft at

          again, and the campaign off the front

               America is facing the greatest test of
               its history, gentlemen. Not just from
               terrorist organizations both outside and
               within our borders, but from covert
               alliances of disaffected nations so
               terrified of winding up on our shit list
               they believe the only way to protect
               themselves is to hit us with everything
               they can find before we get around to
               them. Am I the only one in this room
               paying attention to the NSA reports? We
               are on the brink of nuclear cataclysm, on
               our own soil, while our policies remain
               shackled by Jordan-style One Worlders who
               insist that human beings are essentially
               Good ... and that Power is something
               shameful, and Evil.
                   (then)
               Make no mistake, the people of this great
               country are frightened. They know what's
               coming. They can feel it. And we can
               shovel them the same old shit and call it
               sugar, or arm them, with a young,
               vibrant, populist congressman, a war hero
               with heart -- forged by enemy fire, in
               the desert, in the dark, when American
               lives hung in the balance.

      Marco with LT. COL. HOWARD, a kindly but pedantic Army staff
      psychiatrist, referring to notes:

                           MARCO (O.S.)

                 Yes sir.
                     (beat)
                 No sir.
      Beat.   Howard looks up at Marco.

                           MARCO

                 The meds make me ... spongy.   I float.
                 I'm not sharp --

                           LT. COL. HOWARD

                 The meds help you sleep.

                           MARCO

                 When I sleep, I dream.   I don't want to
                 dream, sir.

                           LT. COL. HOWARD

                 You're off your meds, sleep-deprived, you
                 have an unexpected encounter with a
                 member of your Gulf War recon team, Al
                 Melvin, who mentions some dreams he's
                 been having --

                           MARCO

                 Dreams like mine.

                           LT. COL. HOWARD

                     (ignores)
                 -- and suddenly your own bad dreams come
                 charging back. Made worse by your
                 chronic fear of them. Add in all the
                 recent campaign news about Congressman
                 Shaw, which is obviously rekindling your
                 feelings of guilt and jealousy --

                           MARCO

                 -- I'm not jealous of Raymond Shaw, sir.

                           LT. COL. HOWARD

                 Okay. How did you feel when you heard
                 the news from the convention?
      Marco shrugs.




                                                 8/18/03   29.








                    LT. COL. HOWARD

          A shrug isn't a feeling.

                    MARCO

          I felt ... fine.     No big deal.

                      LT. COL. HOWARD

          Fine.

                    MARCO

          Yes.
              (almost angry)
          Glad for him. He deserves it. Raymond
          Shaw is probably the kindest, bravest,
          warmest --

          MARCO                              LT. COL. HOWARD

-- most selfless human being       -- most selfless human being
I've ever ...                      you've ever known.
Half a beat --

                    LT. COL. HOWARD

          You're fucking with me, Major.

                       MARCO

          No sir.     I wouldn't do that, sir.

                    LT. COL. HOWARD

          What other conclusion can I draw?
Marco says nothing.    Holding back what he's thinking.

                    LT. COL. HOWARD

          Look, we've been over this a million
          times. Until you forgive yourself for
          what happened that night in Kuwait, the
          loss of your men -- for what you did, for
          what you didn't do ...
No reaction from Marco.    The Lt. Colonel sighs.

                    LT. COL. HOWARD

          How's Public Affairs?

                    MARCO

          It sucks, sir. I want to get back to
          Intelligence.

                    LT. COL. HOWARD

          Then for God's sake, Ben, go back on your
          meds. And stay on them, this time. Get
          some sleep. I'll see you in two weeks.

                      MARCO

          Yes sir.    Same time, same station.




                                                  8/18/03   30.







     Marco starts to get up --

                         LT. COL. HOWARD

               And stay the hell away from television.

63   INT./EXT. D.C. BOTANICAL GARDENS - DAY                        63

     Festive champagne brunch. Lush indoor foliage. The Capitol
     Dome visible in the b.g. Huge, graphic banners declaim the
     campaign slogan: SECURE TOMORROW and the ticket: ARTHUR-

     SHAW.

     An elegant ALL-WOMAN HARP ORCHESTRA plays new-age patriotic
     music, and a thick crowd of WEALTHY PARTY INNER CIRCLE
     members jostle between elegant food stations, or cue up for
     thirty seconds with presidential-hopeful Robert Arthur.

     MOVING WITH - MARCO

     who has two retired, old bastard Generals in his company,
     stars gleaming on their shoulders. Marco's eyes scan the
     room; he's a man on a mission:

                         GENERAL SLOAN

               No offense, Major, but it chaps my ass we
               gotta have a babysitter.

                         MARCO

               Sir, I'm just here to keep you from
               getting into fist-fights with the Navy
               guys.
     The old generals laugh, appreciate this.    Marco stops --
     eureka -- he's found his target:

     MARCO'S P.O.V. - ACROSS THE HUGE ROOM - RAYMOND

     holding side-show vice-presidential court for some enamored
     young women and their banker husbands. SECRET SERVICE
     agents, including his everpresent Anderson, maintaining a
     careful perimeter.

                         GENERAL WILSON (O.S.)

               Major Marco --

     MARCO AND THE GENERALS

     Marco forced to pull his gaze away from Raymond:

                         GENERAL WILSON

               -- this Army of Two's gonna do some recon
               on the no host bar.




                                             8/18/03    31.








                      MARCO

            Right behind you, sirs.
Whereupon

SENATOR ELEANOR SHAW

powers through with Gillespie and a couple of our media
FLAKS, giving them an earful:

                      ELLIE

            -- billions of dollars, thousands of
            troops, sacrificed on behalf of a
            disastrous foreign policy which has only
            served to galvanize our enemies --

          ELLIE                             MARCO

Excuse us please --               Whoa --
FOR AN INSTANT Ellie and Marco lock eyes -- then the crowd
swallows her again --

                      GENERAL WILSON

            They oughta put up a crossing guard.

                      GENERAL SLOAN

            Or rig her with an air horn.

WITH RAYMOND

-- distractedly staring at a pretty young woman (JOCELYN
JORDAN) near the entrance.

                      RAYMOND

                (to the bankers and wives)
            I mean -- that's supposed to be the whole
            point of this great country, isn't it?
            That everybody matters. Not just the
            people at this party -- no offense -- but
            the people who can't afford to be here.

                      ELLIE

                (arriving:)
            Raymond --
                (to the couples)
            -- sorry to interrupt --
But she's not.   Slipping her arm through his and steering
him away...

                      ELLIE

            You must learn not to let yourself get
            cornered by the bottom-feeders.

                      RAYMOND

            Including you?




                                             8/18/03   32.








                    ELLIE

          I devour everything in my path, darling,
          top or bottom, you know that.
...to join a lively group of corporate heavyweights. DAVID
DONOVAN is a man possessed of a commanding presence,
radiating charm, brilliance and stealth. J.B. (JAY)
JOHNSTON is younger than the others, a three-sport letterman
who graduated with distinction from Princeton and happily
works until there's no one left in the office to give
instructions to. MARK WHITING is gracious and warm.

                    ELLIE

          Hello Mark.
Ellie greets Whiting with a fondness she reserves for old
friends -- as a former Tyler Prentiss protégé, he now stands
comfortably at the fertile crossroads where big industry
meets big government, and profits soar.

                    WHITING

          Eleanor! Congratulations, Raymond. Your
          grandad would be so goddamn proud of you.

                    RAYMOND

          Nice to see you Mark.   Thanks.
The following flows, overlapping, easy:

                    ELLIE

          -- Raymond, this is J.B. Johnston, from
          Manchurian Global --

                    RAYMOND

          Yes, hi --

                    ELLIE

          -- and David Donovan, their Managing
          Director.

                    RAYMOND

          -- and co-chair of the U.S. International
          Policy Caucus.

          DONOVAN                           ELLIE

One and the same.                     (teasing)
                                  They're desperate to be of
                                  service to you, Raymond.

                    RAYMOND

          Go away, mother. You've earned your fee.
Raymond flashes a dazzling Kennedyesque smile, as the men
chuckle appreciatively.

                    ELLIE

          The plucky idealist.




                                              8/18/03   33.







Ellie glides off, unfazed.    The men banter on:

                    RAYMOND

          Gentlemen, how's business?

                    WHITING

          Good, Raymond. Business is good.

                    JOHNSTON

          Could always be better.

                    RAYMOND

          Careful. Any better, you'll be a
          monopoly.

                    DONOVAN

          There's the challenge. Maximizing the
          market share and potential of a company.

                    WHITING

          Or a country.
Off their shared, collegial laughter --

ACROSS THE ROOM - MARCO - MONETS LATER

watches Raymond take his leave from the Manchurian Global
guys -- while, at the bar, the generals have established
their beachhead of Bloody Marys with a couple of younger men
in NAVY WHITES:

                    REAR ADMIRAL GLICK

          Every great civilization has been
          anchored by a great Navy.

                    GENERAL SLOAN

          Bullshit. You guys are sea chum, ripe
          for some raghead with a rocket launcher
          to put a hole in your bucket.
Marco laughs deliberately, trying to diffuse the tension.

                    MARCO

              (low)
          If you can't behave yourselves, Generals,
          we're gonna spend the rest of the day
          watching the Orioles game back at the
          hotel.
Whereupon Raymond parades past, with his Secret Service
handlers, oblivious to Ben until he calls out.

                    MARCO

          Congressman -- Sergeant Shaw --
Raymond turning, but not stopping --




                                                   8/18/03   34.








                          MARCO

                Ben Marco.

                          RAYMOND

                I know.
                    (strange, dreamy)
                Hello Captain.

               MARCO                              RAYMOND

     It's Major, and --                     (as if it surprises
                                             him:)
                                        I need to talk to you.
     But he keeps walking --

                           MARCO

                -- okay.
     -- Marco frowns, watches Raymond weave through the crowd
     towards Jocie, at the entrance. Marco follows, passing:

     ELLIE AND JORDAN

     locked in fierce, low battle, off to one side, voices hard,
     rising out of the din:

                          JORDAN

                -- the political extortion you committed
                in order to destroy my vice presidential
                bid so that --

                           ELLIE

                Tom.

                          JORDAN

                -- so that you might vicariously bask in
                reflected limelight from your son --

                          ELLIE

                    (overlapping)
                Tom, please, just because the party felt
                a younger, more dynamic man could help
                the ticket, I don't think it's fair for
                you to single me out and --

                          JORDAN

                You know, I have such contempt for you,
                Eleanor, that when I think of you, I
                actually fear for this country. Raymond
                is nothing. A riddle. A wild card at
                worst. But you, you are the smiler who
                wraps her dagger in the cloak of the flag
                and waits for her chance to strike.
                Which I pray will never come.
He wheels away --

     overhearing Raymond's earnest and intense conversation with

     Jocie starts to say something, is at a loss for words --

                         RAYMOND

               ... I guess I've never stopped -- feeling
               -- wondering -- how it might have turned
               out, you know, between us, if --

               Jocie, I haven't even been with another
               girl since we ... stopped seeing each
               other -- doesn't that say something to
               you?

                         JOCELYN

               That you must be just about the loneliest
               person on earth, and it breaks my heart.
     Raymond is staggered -- doesn't know what to say --

                         JOCELYN

               I've got to go -- good luck with the
               campaign.

     -- Raymond still wants to say something, he wants to stop
     her, but --

           I want to talk to you too.

                     MARCO

           Okay -- sorry -- but -- Melvin, he's
           extremely disturbed about what happened
           to us, on the recon patrol, back in
           Kuwait --

                     RAYMOND

           Don't ever touch me.
Beat.   Marco's eyebrows go up.

                     MARCO

           Sorry.
Raymond's secret service agent, ANDERSON slips himself
between him, smiling politely, easing Marco away:

                         COLONEL GARRET

               What were you hoping he'd say?
     We are:

66   INT. PENTAGON - CONFERENCE ROOM - MARCO                     66

     is in a more formal setting -- Lt. Col. Howard is with
     COLONEL GARRET and an enlisted soldier, a WOMAN, taking
     notes --

                         MARCO

               I don't know, sir.
                   (cautious, now)
               It isn't so much what he said, or didn't
               say -- but his demeanor, his attitude.
               Sir, I overheard an exchange he --

                         COLONEL GARRET

                   (talks over this)
               I think you hoped Congressman Shaw would
               say, "yes, Major, I've had those same
               dreams. Tomatoes and sandstorms. You're
               not nuts, there's some crazy shit going
               down here."
     Marco says nothing.

                         COLONEL GARRET

               Major, we've been down this road with you
               before, yes?

                         MARCO

               No, sir, not this road, sir. But I hear
               what you're saying, and I want to do this
               through the proper channels.

                         LT. COL. HOWARD

               Are you back on your meds?

                         MARCO

               Lt. Colonel Howard -- with respect --
               I've had a dozen years of experts telling
               me I've got Gulf War Syndrome, or a
               stress disorder. Twelve years being a
               good soldier, denying what every nerve
               ending in my body tells me is more real
               than not. One dream, over and over. Not
               variations on a dream, the same one,
               night after night after night --

                         LT. COL. HOWARD

               -- Your guilt and your jealousy require
               you to construct this ... elaborate
               fiction, so that you --




                                            8/18/03    38.








           MARCO                           LT. COL. HOWARD

No --                            -- can avoid the truth.

                     MARCO

           -- No sir. Something happened to us, in
           the desert, ten years ago. Not what we
           thought it was. And it happened on my
           watch.
Beat.

                     COLONEL GARRET

           Have you contacted any other members of
           the unit besides Shaw and Melvin? Asked
           them about the dreams?

                     MARCO

               (from notes he's made)
           Owens died of cancer in '97. Villalobos,
           a car crash. Atkins committed suicide.
           Jamison was at the Pentagon, 9-11, body
           never recovered. Wilson I'm still trying
           to track down.
Garret and Howard trade looks.

                     MARCO

           Sir, I know I can't ask you to talk to
           Congressman Shaw, not yet, but Al Melvin,
           it's a phone call, a quick q&a -- look at
           his notebooks, hear what he's been
           dreaming -- and either he will support
           the credibility of what I'm saying, or he
           won't. And I'll shut up.

                     COLONEL GARRET

           And what is it you are saying, exactly,
           Major? That you misrepresented --
           falsified -- what happened In Kuwait?
           About the Medal of Honor? In effect,
           committed perjury.

                     MARCO

           If you just talk to Melvin --

                     COLONEL GARRET

               (ignores)
           -- No, no, I'm sorry -- you're saying an
           entire squad of U.S. Army soldiers was
           hypnotized into believing that Raymond
           Shaw deserved the Medal of Honor. And
           somehow you're the only one who knows the
           truth.
Silence.   Marco looks down at his hands.




                                                   8/18/03    39.








                            COLONEL GARRET

                  Major Marco. You will stay clear of
                  Congressman Shaw.

                             MARCO

                  Yes sir.

                            LT. COL. HOWARD

                  And you will resume your meds, Major.
                  That is an order.

                             MARCO

                  Yes sir.
       Beat.   Marco stands up, to leave, but --

                            COLONEL GARRET

                  Major, do you ever take a step back and
                  consider why you've remained at rank for
                  all these years? Missed Bosnia,
                  Afghanistan, Iraqi Freedom. While men of
                  lesser promise and inferior talent have
                  enjoyed the fruits of those campaigns and
                  moved beyond you?

                            MARCO

                  Every day, sir.

     At the far end of a long and gloomy hallway, we can see
     Marco arrive at the door to Melvin's room. He hesitates,
     then knocks --

                          MARCO

               Al?   Al Melvin, it's Marco ...
     Nothing. He looks at his watch, turns, walks back down the
     narrow, high-ceilinged corridor -- haunting sounds of radios
     and televisions and broken conversations -- he disappears
     down the stairs --

73   INT. FANCY HOTEL CORRIDOR - NIGHT                              73

     Raymond comes down the brightly-lit, elegant hallway, tired,
     trailing Anderson and his SECRET SERVICE entourage.

                         RAYMOND

               ... The enemy is among us. The wolf is
               at the door ... the fox is in the
               henhouse ... the weasel is ... the weasel
               is ...
     They take his room keycard from him, open the door --

74   INT. RAYMOND'S HOTEL SUITE - NIGHT                             74

     Anderson and another AGENT move through the suite, securing
     it -- Raymond losing steam:

               The weasel is a weasel.    Frog and Toad
               Are Friends.
     -- returning to the door and handing Raymond his keycard.
     The PHONE BEGINS TO RING --

               Sir, we'll be right outside.

                          RAYMOND

               I know.   Good night.
     He closes the door after them. Breathes out.    Glances at
     his watch. Then crosses to answer the phone:

                 I'm calling to compliment you, Mr.
                 Grumpy. I thought you were magnificent
                 tonight. So do all the network campaign
                 experts. "Presidential" was a word they

                 This compassionate vigilance thing is
                 working quite well for you. I might have
                 to convert.

                 I happen to believe in it.

punches the line, lifts the receiver --

CLOSE on RAYMOND'S EAR --

                    VOICE ON THE PHONE

          Sergeant Raymond Shaw?
Beat. Raymond's puzzled. Cocks his head, eyes searching
the corners of the room. SOUND: a distant desert wind,
building. Then:

                     RAYMOND

          Yes ...?
CLOSE on RAYMOND'S EYE --

                    VOICE ON THE PHONE

          Raymond Prentiss Shaw?
-- Raymond's senses appear to QUICKEN NOW, as the LIGHTING
in the room changes, morphing somehow -- even as SOUNDS of
steady percussion, and the zaghareet -- the wailing cry of
the Arab women -- rise out of the wind --

                    RAYMOND

              (eyes alight)
          Yes.
-- everything is brighter, sharper, more luminous -- more
etched than it was just moments ago --

          Listen:
              (then)
          Enter the bathroom, and go to the closet
          there.

Raymond moves with tremendous assurance across the living
room and down the hallway and into the bathroom --

     A THICK PANEL in the back wall just being unmoored -- the
     RUSHING ROAR of a sandstorm and --

     A MAN IN BLACK

     steps through, gloves and soft-soled shoes. Raymond just
     watching as he places a small clam-shell video screen open
     on the counter -- we can SEE a B&W surveillance view of the
     CORRIDOR OUTSIDE RAYMOND'S ROOM, with Anderson sitting the
     night watch, reading.
     The man gestures Raymond through the closet passageway --

80   INT. A HUGE ROOM BESIDE RAYMOND'S SUITE - CONTINUOUS          80

     -- where Raymond is met by TECHNICIANS in sterile gear,
     surgical gloves.
     He's entered some kind of portable, surreal operating
     theater, filled with monitoring device and computers ... a
     one-way video-conference camera is aimed at a big
     examination chair in one corner, surrounded by I.V. racks
     and more techno-medical equipment.
     The man who is obviously in charge here, starts a digital
     timer and turns to face Raymond. It's NOYLE.

                           NOYLE

                 Hello Raymond. Do you remember me?

                           RAYMOND

                 No sir.

                           NOYLE

                 Brilliant.
                     (to his group)
                 We have twenty minutes for our little
                 check up from the neck up.

81   EXT. PAY PHONE - NIGHT                                        81

     Marco on a public phone, across the street from Melvin's
     residential hotel. Shaken.




                                                 8/18/03    45.








                          MARCO

                My God. I'm sorry to hear that. When
                did it ...
                    (listens)
                Yeah, I know. I know.
                    (deep breath)
                Listen, Mrs. Wilson -- can you tell me if
                Nathan was ever -- preoccupied -- with
                his experience in Kuwait? Did he ever
                mention dreams or nightmares ... about
                what happened ... the firefight,
                afterward ...
                    (beat)
                -- uh-huh. Sure. No, I understand.
                    (beat)
                Thank you for --
      Dial tone.   He hangs up.   Exhales.

                                                          BLINK.

82    Marco listening to the phone on the other end of his call      82
      ring, and ring and ring. Dull HISS of the city.

                                                          BLINK.

83    Another call.                                                   83

                          MARCO (O.S.)

                ... no, Mr. Villalobos, I'm just --
                Army's got me running statistics on
                stress disorders, I'm trying to gather
                information on my old squad members ...
                yes sir --

A84   INT. NOYLE'S HIDDEN HOTEL ROOM - NIGHT                         A84

      Raymond sits in a chair, rigged up with wires and tubes
      (much like he was ten years ago) -- a TRANSLUCENT BOX around
      his face overlaid with a METRIC GRID, his head held
      motionless by a semi-circular BRACE, curved calibration
      offering precise positioning for a MICRO-DRILL that Noyle
      moves into place -- and then a long, tiny drill bit WHIRS
      DOWN through STERILE LATEX stretched very tight across
      Raymond's head --
      -- and plunges precisely and effortlessly through Raymond's
      skull, then STOPS -- he has no reaction, feels nothing --
      LCD screens -- show a VIRTUAL MAP OF RAYMOND'S BRAIN, in a
      full range of primary colors -- sections morphing as
      thoughts and memories race through his mind, as
      MINISCULE, INTERWOVEN WIRES -- are threaded down through the
      HOLLOW core of the surgical drill, deep into Raymond's
      brain. Noyle plays to one of the cameras:




                                                  8/18/03   46.








                         NOYLE

               No decay, no slippage. Everything
               appears to be in flawless working
               condition.
                   (then)
               Raymond can you remember the deaths of
               Mavole and Baker?

                         RAYMOND

               Yes.
     The LCD SCREENS show activity in areas of Raymond's brain.

                         NOYLE

               Describe it.

84   INT. SKID ROW RESIDENTIAL HOTEL - NIGHT                           84

     Marco knocking at Melvin's door again.

                          MARCO

               ... Al?   You in there?
     Still nothing. He checks the hallway, takes an Army utility
     knife from his pocket and forces the lock --

85   INT. MELVIN'S APARTMENT - NIGHT                                   85

     The light switch doesn't work. Click, click. Eerie shudder
     of neon from the sign on the building, shapes crowd the
     room, claustrophobic ...
     ... Marco has a PENLIGHT -- he turns it on, sweeps in front
     of him with its weak beam:
     THE ROOM -- stacked floor to ceiling with old newspapers,
     magazines, and HUNDREDS AND HUNDREDS OF NOTEBOOKS, covering
     nearly every available surface.
     Marco picks up a notebook.    Moves to a desk and sits.   Opens
     the book --

86   OMITTED                                                           86

88   BEAM OF THE PENLIGHT aimed down at pages filled with CRUDE        88
     DRAWINGS OF BRAINS/TOMATOES -- number-gibberish (cross-
     sections, size and weight parameters, and growth sequences)

     -- AMERICAN FLAGS --

     -- in the margins, many attempts to capture likenesses of
     DR. NOYLE AND THE MYSTERIOUS ARABIC WOMAN, repeatedly
     crossed out, never right.

       Noyle turning toward us, eyes bright --

       RESUME - MARCO

       -- under the headline WHAT HAPPENED, extremely small,
       cramped handwriting that goes on for pages --
                    "The recon ends without incident, and we are
                    heading back to forward command..."




                           RAYMOND (V.O.)

                 ... we're heading back to forward
                 command. The night is clear. Stars but
                 no moon --
       Marco closes the book, opens another journal. Same
       drawings. Same title page. Same cramped writing, that
       begins exactly the same way --

89     TIGHT - RAYMOND (STREAMING VIDEO)                                  89

       Marco reading these same words, which Melvin has scrawled in
       his journals:

       Marco's whole squad, staring at a digital screen animation
       of Raymond's one-man military fire-fight -- a CGI Hummer
       with a flaming tire, Raymond heroically spewing machine gun
       fire at the enemy, exactly as we've seen it in Marco's
       retelling:

FB90A SHOCK CUT: REFLECTED IN A MIRROR - MARCO                      FB90A

       Strapped to a chair back in the dreamscape, head back, his
       mouth pried open and a hypodermic needle plunged deep up
       into his palette -- thin electrode wires splayed across his
       face and neck -- Noyle's just behind him --

       flips compulsively ahead through the notebook, lit by the
       harsh beam of the penlight. Endless, repetitive writing.
       FEVERISHLY RENDERED IMPRESSIONS of the dreamscape, medical
       apparatus, choppers, guns -- MORE and MORE images of Raymond
       Shaw -- of Raymond strangling Mavole --
       -- and A DRAWING OF A MAN WHO MIGHT BE MARCO, unfinished,
       uncertain except for the eyes -- Marco with a GUN in his
       hand --

       AWAY -- with a look of astonishment on his face -- blood
       just beginning to seep from the wound --

       THE BARE, OVERHEAD LIGHTBULB IN THE ROOM

       shudders to life -- dies -- glows again -- brighter -- AND

       NOW MARCO SEES:


       THE WALLS OF MELVIN'S APARTMENT

       are COVERED with DRAWINGS and SCRAWLINGS and newspaper
       clippings and patterns made with paper plates and empty
       Noodle containers -- the crazy patterns of the tiles from
       Noyle's dream lab -- it's as if Marco has entered the mind
       of a mad man -- everything from the notebooks, and more,

       much more -- dominated by tormented, repeated images of
       Raymond Shaw --
       -- Marco is stunned --
       PUSHING IN -- as a painstakingly rendered DRAWING OF RAYMOND
       SHAW fills the screen: wild-eyed with SNAKES writhing out of
       his head, Medusa-like, EVOKING THE WIRES AND TUBES FROM

       MARCO'S NIGHTMARE DREAMSCAPE --

       Marco sits at a window, eyes closed, head pressed to the
       glass, the world just a blur beyond him. He opens his eyes,

       SEES:


       LAURENT TOKAR

       sitting down across from him.   Smiling.

                           LAURENT

                     (French accent)
                 Is this seat taken?

       Marco opens his eyes -- head pressed to a window, the world
       a blur beyond him -- SEES:
       Nothing. An empty seat opposite him. Laurent was a dream.
       Marco looks around, self-conscious, and --

       THROUGH THE SEATS - A WOMAN'S FACE

       staring back at him. Not enough to tell much more than
       she's pretty. Marco looks away, out the window. Then back.
       She's gone. Another dream?

                           WOMAN'S VOICE (ROSIE)

                 Maryland's a beautiful state.
       Marco jumps -- looks. The pretty woman is sitting down
       opposite him, folding and pushing aside a newspaper with the
       headline: WHITE HOUSE INSISTS WAR ON TERROR IS STILL

       WINNABLE. COST OF PERUVIAN CAMPAIGN HITS $100 BILLION.

          This is Delaware.

          I know. But, Maryland, it's a beautiful
          state anyway.
He's staring at her, trying to figure out --

                    ROSIE

          Paper or plastic.

                      MARCO

          What?

                    ROSIE

          From the grocery store. You were
          wondering where, we, you know -- and
          right at the check-out stand, "paper or
          plastic," that's me. I see you all the
          time. Bennett Marco. Checks from the
          First National Bank, and you always put
          your spare change into the March of Dimes
          thing.
              (beat)
          Romance novels, instant noodles, No-Doz
          and tomatoes.
              (Marco frowns)
          Anyway, I'm on vacation, holiday in the
          City and so forth, I saw you sitting here
          ... I thought, okay, girl -- it's now or
          never.
Beat.

                    ROSIE

          You headed to New York City?

                      MARCO

          Yeah.

                      ROSIE

          Business?

                    MARCO

          No. Guy I knew ... in the Army. He's in
          politics now. We've kinda lost touch.
              (awkward beat, then)
          What's your name?

                      ROSIE

          Eugenie.

                    MARCO

          'Scuse me?

                             ROSIE

                  Yeah.   Crazy French pronunciation and
                  all.

                            MARCO

                  It's pretty.

                             ROSIE

                  Thanks.

                            MARCO

                  I guess your friends call you Jenny.

                            ROSIE

                  Not yet they haven't, thank God.   But you
                  can call me Jenny.

                            MARCO

                  What do your friends call you?

                            ROSIE

                  Rosie. My full name is Eugenie Rose.
                  I've always liked the Rosie part better.
                  Eugenie is, well, fragile.

                            MARCO

                  Still. When I asked you your name, you
                  said it was Eugenie.

                           ROSIE

                  Yeah. Well. Maybe 'cause I was feeling
                  fragile. At the time.
       Beat.   Their eyes lock.   Marco blinks --
FB94   FLASH: PFC. BOBBY BAKER -- stares back at him from where   FB94
       Rosie was sitting. Bullet hole in his forehead and a small,
       lost smile. Reaching out to him --

       ROSIE -- as before.    Slight look of puzzlement, because --
       MARCO -- is on his feet, rattled, moving out to the aisle --

                            MARCO

                  Excuse me.
       -- and LURCHING toward the back of the train, nearly losing
       his balance as he goes through the sliding doors.

       -- Marco catches himself, hands against the bulkhead wall
       near the bathroom. Another PASSENGER squeezes past him,
       headed in the opposite direction. Marco tries the bathroom
       door. Locked. OCCUPIED.

Marco reaches into his pocket for a plastic vial of
medicine. Tries to shake one of the TINY PILLS OUT, but --
A BURLY PASSENGER in the bathroom emerges and the door
SMACKS Marco hard across the back --
-- THE PILLS scatter onto the floor --

         BIG MAN                               MARCO

Sorry. I didn't know you          It's okay.     It's okay.
were --
-- Marco's DOWN ON HIS KNEES, struggling to gather the pills
together and put them back in the plastic vial. The big man
goes.

ROSIE

sinks down next to him.   Calm.   Deftly plucking the pills
from the floor.

                    ROSIE

          My mother would tell you to wash these.
Marco looks up at her blankly.    She takes the vial, caps it,
gives it back.

                    ROSIE

          I didn't mean to upset you.

                    MARCO

          It's not you, it's me. I'm not -- my
          head --
              (gestures uselessly)
          -- nothing's ...
              (stares at her)
          I wish I smoked.

                    ROSIE

          It's way overrated.
They stare at each other.   Then:

                    MARCO

          Rosie, I'm gonna go in here, wash my
          face, take my pill, and get myself
          together.
Marco ducks into the bathroom and shuts the door.




                                                    8/18/03   53.








96    INT. TRAIN MEN'S ROOM - DAY                                      96

      Marco cups water in his hands and smears it on his face,
      wiping it away with a paper towel. He comes up looking in
      the mirror, avoiding his own gaze as --

      IN THE MIRROR: THE DOOR OPENS

      and a man comes partway in -- now it's Dr. Noyle.
      Marco pivots -- no Noyle. The door is shut, locked.      He's
      all alone. Losing his mind.

97    INT. TRAIN CORRIDOR - ROSIE                                      97

      Lost in thought. Faint smile. She puts her hand flat
      against the door, then turns and heads back to her seat.

98    INT. TRAIN MEN'S ROOM - MARCO                                    98

      Turns to the mirror again ... and again SEES Dr. Noyle
      behind him, smiling:

                          NOYLE

                Hello Captain. Do you remember me?
      KNOCKING at the door, a pass-key rattling in it --

99    INT. TRAIN CORRIDOR - MARCO                                      99

      emerges from the bathroom to find an irritated CONDUCTOR now
      awkwardly trying to extract his key from the door, and Rosie
      waiting.

                CONDUCTOR                         ROSIE

      Are you okay, sir?                Ben?

                            MARCO

                ... Yeah.

                         ROSIE

                Jesus. You've been in here twenty
                minutes. I thought you'd fallen off.
      Marco stares at Rosie.    Twenty minutes?   The train SHUDDERS
      to a halt --

100   INT. PENN STATION - DAY                                          100

      Marco comes up the escalator, into a SEA OF COMMUTERS.
      Momentarily lost. Rosie is behind him, a moment later with
      her bag, and --

                          ROSIE

                I'm gonna get a cab, you want me to drop
                you somewhere?




                                                   8/18/03   54.








                           MARCO

                No.   I'm okay, thanks.

                          ROSIE

                Your friend gonna meet you here?

                           MARCO

                No.
      Beat.

                          ROSIE

                El Dorado 59970.
                    (off Marco's frown)
                My cell phone, in case you -- you know.
                I like to say it the old way -- can you
                remember the number, or should I write it
                on your chest with a sharpie?

                          MARCO

                    (small smile)
                I'll remember.
      Beat.

                          ROSIE

                You're sweating.

                           MARCO

                What?
      Marco feels his shirt -- soaked. Long beat. She reaches
      out and feels his forehead. No fever. Sizing him up.

                          ROSIE

                Listen. You got a place to go and get
                freshened up?

101   INT. ROSIE'S COUSIN'S APARTMENT - NIGHT                        101

      Rosie lets Marco in. It's incredibly cramped, everything in
      one room, window facing a brick wall, lots of play posters.

                          ROSIE

                -- It's my cousin's apartment. She's in
                Cleveland with the road company of 'Mamma
                Mia.' There's ... a view of the park ...
                if you go out on the fire escape and
                kinda ... tilt your head ...
      Marco puts down the suitcases and waits in the middle of the
      room while Rosie takes off her coat, turns on some lights.

                          ROSIE

                I'm nervous. I'm sorry.   I yak when I
                get nervous.




                                                     8/18/03   55.








                           MARCO

                 Me, I get quiet.
      Another awkward beat.    She stands there.   Studying him.

                             ROSIE

                 You okay?

                           MARCO

                 Dreams, I've been having these --
      Catches himself.   That's just how Melvin said it.

                           ROSIE

                 Is that what happened on the train?

                             MARCO

                 Sort of.
      Beat.

                           MARCO

                 I could be dreaming you.

                           ROSIE

                 What if you are?

                           MARCO

                 You'd be the best dream I've had in a
                 long time, Rosie.
      Beat.   Rosie smiles at him.

                           ROSIE

                 If that's a line, Ben Marco, it kinda
                 worked.

102   INT. BATHROOM - SHOWER - MARCO                                     102

      The water cascades down on him. He    feels around   on his back
      where the door on the train whacked   him -- feels   something
      on his shoulder -- a bump -- CAMERA   CURLS around   as he
      twists, contorts, can't see it, but   feels it and   --

FB102 OMITTED                                                        FB102


                           ROSIE'S VOICE

                     (distant)
                 Ben?

      TIGHT - MARCO'S HAND

      turning off the shower, hard --




                                                   8/18/03    56.








103   RESUME - ROSIE'S COUSIN'S APARTMENT                               103

      She's sitting, watching the closed bathroom door.      No noise
      from the shower.

                          ROSIE

                Earth to Ben -- how're you doing in
                there?

104   INT. BATHROOM - MARCO                                             104

      hyper, rummaging through the vanity, searching for -- pair
      of cuticle scissors, tweezers, anything sharp -- a little
      basket of sample perfumes CRASHES into the sink --

                          ROSIE (O.S.)

                    (KNOCKING loudly)
                Ben, what's going on -- are you okay --?
      Marco finds a razor blade -- twisting it clumsily in his
      fingers to reach the slight bump on his back he can only
      barely see in the mirror --

105   INTERCUT - ROSIE - OUTSIDE THE DOOR                               105

      -- Rosie's KNOCKING HARDER, NOW.

                          ROSIE

                Ben, I need you to open this door.    Okay?
                Just for a sec.
                    (beat)
                You're scaring me. Ben --?

106   INT. BATHROOM - MARCO                                             106

      He SLASHES at the lump.   Blood blossoms.   SLASHES again,
      oblivious to pain.

                          ROSIE


                BEN MARCO!?

      PUSH IN as Ben presses the blade sharply down into his skin
      ... cutting a slit through which the blunt edge of

      AN EXTREMELY TINY OBLONG THING

      appears, like a grain of rice.   It slides out into Ben's
      bloody fingers.
107   Rosie's PUSHING against the door, trying to force it open.        107

108   MARCO                                                             108

      puts his trembling hand under the faucet, grips the thing
      between two fingers, turns on the water --




                                                 8/18/03   57.








109   THE DOOR - ROSIE                                               109

      breaks in -- sees the BLOOD smeared down Marco's back --

                            ROSIE

                Oh Jesus.
      -- and the razor in his hand -- she pushes him away --

      MARCO

      -- loses his grip on the oblong thing before he can even get
      a good look at it, and it goes into the sink --

                            MARCO

                SHIT.    Oh no NO ...
      -- and down the drain -- Marco twists the faucet off, and

                                                     DIVES TO


      FLOOR LEVEL - UNDER THE SINK

      where he puts both hands on the fittings of the u-joint trap
      and struggles to get them loose -- succeeding finally, water
      spewing everywhere --
      -- the trap falls to the floor, disgorging soap chips, slimy
      hairballs and pipe corrosion and water ... but not the thing
      he wants. It's --

                            MARCO

                -- Gone.    Shit.
      MARCO -- rests his head on the cool tile, eyes far away.
      Defeated. Rosie crouches next to him. A little scared.
      She blots the blood from his back with the towel, and then
      presses her ice pack against it.

                          MARCO

                Tell me you saw that.
      Rosie just stares at him.

                          MARCO

                    (hollow)
                You didn't. You didn't see it.

                            ROSIE

                See what?
      Marco closes his eyes.

                            MARCO

                Proof.




                                                   8/18/03   58.








                           ROSIE

                Of what?

                          MARCO

                My sanity.

110   EXT. ISOLATED WAREHOUSE - ON THE HUDSON RIVER - DAY            110

      Stark building with a huge parking lot and only one car
      parked in it. A CAB pulls through the open gate, stops.
      Marco gets out.

                          DELP (V.O.)

                Implant delusions. Number three on the
                paranoid top ten list.

111   INT. WAREHOUSE STAIRWAY - DAY                                  111

      Ben and RICHARD DELP ascend at a good clip. Delp wears a
      lab coat, trappings of a medical researcher:

                          MARCO

                This wasn't a delusion.

                          DELP

                That's what they all say, Marco.
                    (then)
                Some wicked shit got sprayed on you guys
                during Desert Storm. Besides all the
                depleted uranium, I mean ...
      He stops, unlocks a door, and they go --

112   INT. DELP'S RESEARCH LAB - SKY BOOTH - DAY                     112

      A narrow, glassed-in space with a cluster of monitoring
      equipment against the wall of darkened windows. Fluorescent
      lights flicker on, revealing a CAVERNOUS SPACE BELOW, in
      which an intricate MAZE of CAGES contains unhappy, SCREAMING
      research MONKEYS with Orwellian stainless-steel hardware and
      antennae bolted to their bisected skulls. Strange SOUNDS
      and various LIGHTING EFFECTS emerge from the different
      sections.

                          DELP

                ... I personally know of a coupla Rangers
                who swear that they see only in tertiary
                colors now --

                           MARCO

                -- Delp.

                          DELP

                -- and can pick up sports talk radio in
                their cortical block if they get too
                close to a Con-Ed transformer.




                                              8/18/03    59.








                     MARCO

          -- Delp.   It's not GWS.
Delp has known Marco too long, and too well, not to take him
seriously.

                    DELP

          A dozen years ago, the Army did this tiny
          implantable I.D. thing -- you could imbed
          it under the skin, then scan it like a
          bar code for medical emergency
          information, blood-type, DNA. Pentagon
          ordered up half a million, and stuck
          about five thousand experimentally into
          high-risk soldiers and infantry. But the
          scanners proved skittish and field
          hospitals hated 'em, so the whole deal
          got eighty-sixed and forgotten.

                    MARCO

          The Army never put one in me.

                    DELP

          That you know of, man.     That you know of.
              (then)
          How'd you find me?

                    MARCO (V.O.)

          I looked under Mad Scientists in the
          yellow pages -- there was a full page ad.

                     DELP

          Ha ha.
Marco stares down into a big pit. Among the racks of
equipment are two primate-sized stainless-steel beds with
restraints and I.V. trees waiting.

                    DELP

          You seriously believe somebody's messed
          with your mother board.

                    MARCO

          What are you studying here, Delp?

                     DELP

          Fear.

                    MARCO

          For the Agency?

                    DELP

          Nah, CIA cut me loose in '97 during the
          Macedonian debacle. Now I got this
          little grant from Wal-Mart.




                                                 8/18/03    60.







      Wal-Mart? Fear? Marco looks at the monkeys. Doesn't want
      to know any more. He shifts his gaze back to Delp. Studies
      him. Then:

                          MARCO

                Look, Delp. My experiences during the
                war, in Kuwait ... feel dreamlike to me.
                And my dreams? About what happened?
                Feel as real as you and me, here, right
                now.
      Delp just waits.

                          MARCO

                It's like ... I feel like somewhere along
                the line, I've been ... brainwashed. Or
                something. You know? All scrambled up.

                We've all been brainwashed, Marco.
                Religion, advertising, television.
                Politics. We accept what's normal
                because we're told it's normal and we
                crave normalcy. Hell, look at the
                Germans under Hitler. Disco, in the
                seventies.
                    (beat)
                And if you're really worried about
                somebody imbedding electric probes and
                computer chips in your brain to make you
                do things -- it's horseshit, man. Turns
                out Pavlov had it right from the getgo.
                Dogs and all. A little ECT and sleep
                deprivation will do the trick for a
                fraction of the price. Ask the Uzbeks.
                And you would remember it.

                          MARCO

                What about my dreams?

                    (shrugs)
                What if all this is the fucking dream and
                you're still back in Kuwait?

                          MARCO

                You're not helping me.

                          DELP

                I am. You're not helping yourself.
                Reality is consensual, man. You just
                gotta prove it up. Or play it out.

115   NEWS FOOTAGE - AIRPORT ARRIVAL (VIDEO)                         115

TV115 Raymond emerges from a private jet, waves to a crowd of     TV115
      supporters behind a chain link fence --

116   EXT. TETERBORO AIRPORT - TARMAC - CHARTER ARRIVALS - DAY       116

      Same. Raymond, his handlers, his Secret Service escort walk
      a gauntlet of news cameras, REPORTERS lob questions from
      behind a barrier:

                          REPORTER #2

                Congressman Shaw! Why do you and Gov.
                Arthur oppose deploying troops in
                Indonesia?

                          RAYMOND

                We can't clean up the world with dirty
                hands.

      MOVING WITH - MARCO

      as he keeps pace with Raymond, walking, moving behind the
      reporters, weaving through the crowd.

                REPORTER #2                     REPORTER #3

      What about your mother's        Is your mother helping or
      allegation that a nuclear       hurting your campaign?
      attack on this country from
      a secret alliance of rogue
      states is certain within two
      years?

                          RAYMOND

                Guys, I gave up a long time ago trying to
                second guess my mother. I'm just
                surprised the rest of you haven't.

                          MARCO

                Do you ever dream about Kuwait?
      Heads turning to find Marco, folder under his arm -- strange
      looks -- Secret Service poised to react, but Raymond slows,
      looks -- sees Marco. A cloud passing over his features:

                          RAYMOND

                I can never remember my dreams.
      MORE QUESTIONS lobbed out, overlapping, but Raymond ignores
      them. Marco pushes through as Raymond assures Anderson:

                          RAYMOND

                -- it's okay. I know him, it's okay.

117   INT. LIMOUSINE - DAY                                            117

      Raymond and Marco in the back seat facing forward. Anderson
      and campaign handler MIRELLA FREEMAN sit facing them,
      talking low, on a cell phone, as:

                           RAYMOND

                 I saw Mavole's Mom and Dad in St. Louis.
                 I still visit them -- and Baker's mom --
                 when I can. Do you keep up with anybody
                 from the unit besides Al Melvin?

                           MARCO

                 I don't keep up with Al Melvin.     He found
                 me.

                           RAYMOND

                 Why did you ask me about Kuwait?

                           MARCO

                     (pleasantly:)
                 I didn't. I asked you about your dreams.
                 At the fundraiser -- why did you say you
                 needed to talk to me?

                           MIRELLA

                     (covers the phone)
                 Mr. Shaw, excuse me -- they want to know
                 if you'll do an interview with Larry King
                 at six.

                             RAYMOND

                 No.
                     (to Marco)
                 What do you want from me, Captain?

                            MARCO

                 Major.   Forty minutes of your time.

                           MIRELLA

                 No to the interview, or no to six?

                           RAYMOND

                 He wants to talk about my mother.     No.
      He looks at Marco --

                           MARCO

                 Private time.

                           RAYMOND

                 Well, we've got about five minutes, right
                 now. And this is as private as it gets
                 for me anymore, so ...
      Beat.   He waits.   Anderson staring at Marco.




                                                 8/18/03    63.








                          MARCO

                There are these dreams that ... some of
                the men in our unit have been having.

                          RAYMOND

                Including you?

                          MARCO

                It's a question of what actually happened
                the night our patrol was attacked --

                          RAYMOND

                That's easy.
                    (almost automatic)
                RPG incoming. Mortar fire, we're
                ambushed. Total chaos. I can't locate
                Baker or Mavole. You're knocked
                unconscious -- I find you and pull you to
                safety and then --

                          MARCO

                    (cuts him off)
                -- Yeah, that's how I remember it, too.
                    (beat)
                But I dream something else.
      The limo pulls to a curb --

118   EXT. ARTHUR/SHAW N.Y. CAMPAIGN OFFICE - LATE AFTERNOON      118

      Through the windows SEE a crowded clutter of desks, phone
      volunteers, stacks of pamphlets. A giant SECURE TOMORROW
      logo looms above, flanked by beaming likenesses of Robert
      Arthur and Raymond Shaw. Anderson comes out and opens the
      limo door for Raymond. Marco struggles out behind him:

                          RAYMOND

                Am I in your dreams?

                          MARCO

                Yeah.

                          RAYMOND

                Doing what?

                          MARCO

                    (evasive)
                -- You know.
      Raymond steps just outside the entrance to his office.

                          RAYMOND

                Saving everybody?
      PEDESTRIANS pass between them on the crowded sidewalk.




                                             8/18/03   64.








                    MARCO

          It's more complicated than that.
Marco reaches into his folder, pulls out one of Melvin's
notebooks --

                    MARCO

          People just don't have the same dreams
          accidentally --
              (holds out the notebook)
          -- Melvin made drawings, he wrote down
          what he dreamed, this is one of his
          notebooks -- it's all in here.
-- and Raymond's staring at the notebook without taking it,
the way Marco once did with Melvin. Anderson and Mirella --
the staffers in the office -- are all staring at Marco the
same way the Boy Scouts once stared at Melvin.

                    RAYMOND

          I don't have dreams, Captain.
              (then, gently:)
          Maybe you should ... see somebody -- talk
          to somebody who specializes in this kind
          of thing --

                    MARCO

          I've been to doctors.
... which is exactly what Melvin said to him.

                     MARCO

          Okay.   Okay, I'm sorry.
Marco nods again, numb, makes a vague resigned gesture.

                    MARCO

          I'm not crazy, Shaw.
He jams the notebook back into his folder, starts to walk
away.

                    RAYMOND

              (calls after)
          Captain --
              (then)
          -- Major.
              (then)
          Ben.
Marco stops, turns.

                    RAYMOND

          Are you hungry?




                                                 8/18/03    65.








119   INT. RAYMOND'S PRIVATE OFFICE - CAMPAIGN HQ - DUSK             119

      Huge posters featuring Raymond's face, emblazoned with
      SECURE TOMORROW, stacked against the wall. A desk covered
      with papers and enough take-out Chinese food for ten people,
      and Raymond sits behind it, nursing a glass of wine, and
      pointedly ignoring Melvin's notebook, while:

                          RAYMOND

                I kill Mavole?

                          MARCO

                It's a dream --

                           RAYMOND

                No.

                          MARCO

                -- could mean something else.

                           RAYMOND

                No.

                          MARCO

                -- could be I'm just supposed to think
                you did.

                          RAYMOND

                -- I killed the enemy. I didn't know
                them, either. So it was okay. And,
                anyway, I remember what we did in Kuwait,
                I remember it perfectly. But now that
                you mention it, I don't remember doing it
                ... exactly.

                          MARCO

                Maybe you didn't.

                           RAYMOND

                NO.   What a thought.
      Now he picks up the dream book. Marco watches. Raymond
      flips through the pages for a moment, dismissively. Then
      stops at something Melvin has drawn. Frowns. Raises his
      eyebrows. Closes it, sets it down:

                          RAYMOND

                Life is so bizarre, isn't it? This
                absurd campaign, the sordid world of
                politics, my whole public life and
                persona -- sometimes, occasionally, for
                an instant, the fog clears and I look and
                I think, what am I doing? I mean, what
                the fuck am I doing? Posing and grinning
                like a goddamn sock puppet, shaking hands
                with total strangers who must be blind if

                          (MORE)





                                            8/18/03    66.








                    RAYMOND (CONT'D)

          they can't see what I am, at the core.
          What my mother has made me.
Raymond looks steadily at Marco ... who nods, interested:

                    RAYMOND

          A Prentiss. Ferociously, a Prentiss --
          but not a Shaw, God forbid -- I was
          molded by cold hard hands, every detail
          of my existence preordained. Can you
          even imagine, Ben, how it would feel
          never to have a say in what your life
          would be? I was twenty years old before
          I had a friend -- no, worse, a girlfriend
          -- well, almost -- but, yes, a friend, or
          I thought so -- outside my mother's
          circle of approved encounters -- and it
          didn't -- she wouldn't -- precipitating
          my one act of rebellion, storming off and
          enlisting --
              (grimaces)
          -- in the Army. Which, ironically, only
          served ultimately to pad my gilded
          Prentiss resume. You know: "fluent in
          five languages, Phi Beta Kappa,
          Congressional Medal of Honor, blah blah
          blah."
              (beat)
          And after the war I came back to her.
          And the family legacy. This. Mother
          calls it, "fulfilling my Manifest
          Prentiss Destiny."

                    MARCO

          Why did you come back, Raymond?   What
          happened?

                    RAYMOND

          What?
Seeming startled, Raymond's reverie is broken.     His eyes
harden as he refocuses on Marco.

                    RAYMOND

          Weren't you listening? Mother happened.
              (then)
          You know, the truth is, I hate it. I've
          always despised it.

                    MARCO

              (lost)
          Which?

                    RAYMOND

          The medal. The cloying adulation of the
          little people. Your pitiful jealousy --




                                 8/18/03    67.








          MARCO

Who said I was jealous?

          RAYMOND

I don't have the dreams, Ben.

          MARCO

How can you not remember saving the unit?

           RAYMOND

I do.   I said I did.

          MARCO

You said you don't remember doing it.

          RAYMOND

Ha ha, don't mix me up, I'm tired, and --
Fine. It's like this. It's as if I know
what will happen, Ben, but I never get to
the part where I feel that it actually
did happen. But I think that's probably
perfectly normal.

          MARCO

Did you ever talk to anybody about this
little discrepancy?

          RAYMOND

What? No. Who would I ask? My old Army
"buddies," who love and adore me for
saving their pathetically unimportant --
present company excluded -- asses?

          MARCO

No.  You ask Army Intelligence.
    (getting excited)
Look, we can go together, tomorrow. You
tell them what you just told me,
everything you do remember, what you
don't "exactly" remember, about Kuwait,
let 'em run some tests on you --

          RAYMOND

I'm sure the press would have a field day
with that.

          MARCO

Raymond. They put an implant in me. I
found it yesterday. Maybe they put one
in you.

          RAYMOND

    (horrified)
Nobody's put anything in me.




                                             8/18/03   68.








                    MARCO

          Great. Let's prove it. We can go get an
          x-ray -- we can check it right now --
Marco moves toward him, Raymond backs away --

                    RAYMOND

          I want to be supportive of you, Ben, I
          do, but --

                    MARCO

          Just check your back, Raymond --

                    RAYMOND

          -- this can wait until after the
          election.

                    MARCO

          What are you afraid of?   See if there's a
          bump.

                    RAYMOND

          You should leave.   This is not, this is
          not --

                    MARCO

          -- just check --

                    RAYMOND

              (without checking)
          There's nothing there!
Marco LUNGES at Raymond -- they fall, together, over the
desk, onto the floor -- Chinese food scattering.

                    MARCO

          Somebody was in your head, with big steel-
          toe boots, a couple of cable cutters and
          a chainsaw, and they went to town!
          Neurons got wasted, circuits rewired,
          brain cells obliterated --
KNOCKING at the door:

                    ANDERSON (O.S.)

          Congressman Shaw?

                    MARCO

          -- you don't even know what they did!
          You don't -- you can't CONCEIVE what they
          did to you -- and you're worried about
          some lame-ass reporters!?
-- where Marco (stronger, better-trained) wraps Raymond in a
headlock, RIPS Raymond's shirt from the shoulder --

                 If I'm wrong they can put me the fuck
                 away --

                           ANDERSON (O.S.)

                 -- are you okay?

                           RAYMOND

                 Ben --

                           MARCO

                 -- there -- there's -- something --
       INSISTENT KNOCKING at the door. Marco CLAWS AT THE SKIN on
       RAYMOND'S BACK -- sinks his teeth in --
       -- Raymond shakes him off, and MARCO slams into the wall.
       The office door BANGS open --
       Anderson and other agents SWARM Marco -- there's blood
       smeared on Marco's mouth, his jaws are clenched --

                           ANDERSON

                     (disbelief)
                 He bit him.
                     (at Raymond)
                 Sir, did he bite you?

                           RAYMOND

                 No.
       MARCO -- shoved to the floor -- twisted -- handcuffed --
       blood SMEARING across the carpet -- his eyes wild with
       adrenaline and fear --
       RAYMOND -- his hand goes to his back -- his eyes LOCK with
       Marco's for an instant -- then Marco is hustled out the
       door.

                           ANDERSON

                 Sir --

                           RAYMOND


                 NOTHING HAPPENED!

       Horrified campaign workers crane necks to see inside. Mute
       with shock, Raymond pulls his hand away from his back.
       Hides the blood.

                          ELLIE (V.O.)

                You want to help him?

121   INT. ELEGANT MANHATTAN RESTAURANT - PRIVATE ROOM - DAY       121

      Raymond and Ellie. Through the wavy glass we see a crowded
      dining room, the ever-present Secret Service.

                          RAYMOND

                No. That'd be political suicide. Of
                course not. I want you to help him.

                          ELLIE

                I can't even imagine why.

                          RAYMOND

                Because I feel sorry for him.   Because I
                said I would.

                          ELLIE

                What should we do?   Make him a General?

                          RAYMOND

                Mother. Look. My campaign people are
                getting a restraining order, he's going
                on all the security watch-lists -- but I
                won't lock him up. I'm not pressing
                charges.

                          ELLIE

                What?

                          RAYMOND

                It's complicated -- I don't know. It's
                just complicated and I don't want to talk
                about it, I want to get back to the
                campaign and focus on --

                          ELLIE

                You don't actually believe his story?

                          RAYMOND

                No. But he does. And he's a fine
                soldier and ... my friend. And if his
                slim hold on sanity requires that I
                tolerate his delusions until he can get
                help, I'll do it. It doesn't diminish
                me. And I'm not afraid of him.

                          ELLIE

                This is why voters love you. Your
                humanity and everything. I've never
                projected humanity.

                          RAYMOND

                Yes I think telling people you want to

                    (laughs)
                That was a joke, you dreadful boy.
      A BUSBOY delivers Ellie her meal: a thick steak stuffed with
      viscous grey -- off Raymond's disgust:

                          ELLIE

                Carpetbag steak.

                           RAYMOND

                Stuffed.   With oysters?
      She starts to cut meat into child-like, bite-sized pieces
      and put them on a side plate, for Raymond.

                          ELLIE

                The steak part is mostly for you.
                Doesn't it look yummy?

                          RAYMOND

                My God. In the world's literature of
                food could there possibly be a more
                vulgar dish?

                          ELLIE

                And eating it is an absolute sexual
                experience. Try some.

                          RAYMOND

                Promise me that you'll help him.
      Ellie stops, sighs, puts her fork down and reaches for the
      oversized-satchel that doubles as her briefcase and purse.

                          ELLIE

                Oh, Raymond, how much do you really know
                about your friend?
      Ellie finds two thick files and plops them down, as
      punctuation, in front of Raymond.

      PHOTOGRAPHS - SCENE PHOTOS - AL MELVIN'S DEAD BODY

      being pulled from the chilly waters of the Potomac.     Some
      clinical AUTOPSY glossies.

                          MARCO (V.O.)

                Al Melvin ...




                                                  8/18/03   72.








123   INT. FEDERAL BUILDING - CONFERENCE ROOM - DAY                 123

      Marco stares, troubled and sad, at bleak photographs of Al
      Melvin's bloated, waterlogged corpse.

                          MARCO

                I went to talk to him.   But he wasn't
                there.
      Across from him are three impatient FBI AGENTS (RAMIREZ,
      GOLDRING and JONAS). Ramirez has the notebook Marco took
      from Melvin's. Goldring pushes a tiny digital tape recorder
      closer to Marco:

                          AGENT GOLDRING

                Talk about what?
      Marco hesitates -- looks to Lt. Col. Howard, who sits
      grimly, off the one side, with Col. Garret.

                          AGENT GOLDRING

                Dreams?
      A lone woman, SPECIAL AGENT VOLK, sits in a distant corner
      on a folding chair. She's implacable, staring intently at
      Marco. Ramirez holds up the notebook -- a page of crazy
      drawings and text.

                          MARCO

                Yeah, there are hundreds more of those in
                his apartment. Did your people check out
                his place --?

                          AGENT JONAS

                Colonel Garret kindly showed us the file
                on you, Marco, you're the shit: Special
                Forces. Rangers. Delta.

                          MARCO

                I wanted to talk to Corporal Melvin about
                some unanswered questions involving our
                reconnaissance mission in Kuwait, back in

                '91 --


                          AGENT JONAS

                    (talks over him)
                And he wasn't there, so, what -- you
                thought it'd be okay to break in and wait
                for him?
      Marco carefully, respectfully stacks the photographs of
      Melvin and turns them over. Exchanges a glance with the
      female agent.




                                               8/18/03   73.








                     MARCO

               (at Howard)
           I know this game. Will you explain to
           them that I know this game?

                     AGENT RAMIREZ

           Oh right. Army Intelligence.   Isn't that
           an oxymoron?

                      MARCO

           Yeah.   Kinda like 'special agent.'

                     COLONEL GARRET

           Cut it out, Major.

                     AGENT GOLDRING

           What's your obsession with Raymond Shaw?

                     AGENT RAMIREZ

           Man of his dreams.

                     MARCO

           Listen, you might want to advise your ME
           to check for an implant in Corporal
           Melvin's back -- under the skin, just shy
           of the scapula, left side ... if he's not
           looking for it, he won't find it.
Implant.   The Feds just stare at him.   Like he's nuts.

                     MARCO

           I didn't have anything to do with
           Corporal Melvin's death.

                     AGENT JONAS

           Yeah, well, that's your opinion, but
           judging from your file here, apparently
           you don't know your shit from your
           oatmeal, my friend --
Marco snaps, spins out of his chair and lunges at Jonas --
Lt. Col. Howard and the other agents step between the two
men -- pull them apart --

                     LT. COL. HOWARD

               (re: Jonas)
           Get this man out of here.

                     AGENT JONAS

               (taunting Marco)
           Go ahead, nutball. Try it.
Marco PUNCHES the agent so hard it knocks him down to the
floor between the other two.

                     AGENT JONAS

           -- He hit me! Fuck!




                                                  8/18/03   74.








                          MARCO

                He said I could.
      Colonel Garret shoves Marco back into a chair, stays in the
      middle of the fracas, while --

                          LT. COL. HOWARD

                Okay, OKAY --! That's enough.
                Gentlemen, I need a moment with Major
                Marco. Now.
      The Federal Agents retreat with their bloodied-nose, cold-
      cocked colleague, door slamming behind them.

                          ELLIE (V.O.)

                Evidently this has been going on for
                years ...
      Only Agent Volk remains, unmoved by what just occurred.
      CLOSE ON - MARCO, catching his breath.

                          ELLIE (V.O.)

                ... Sad little Tin Soldier.

124   INT. ELEGANT RESTAURANT - PRIVATE ROOM - DAY                  124

      Ellie eats, while Raymond flips through Marco's extensive
      file: cross-agency surveillance, Army psychological
      profiling, FBI updates. Repeated buzzwords like: "mentally
      unstable," "obsessed with Raymond Shaw," "delusional,"
      "borderline functional," "acute stress disorder ..."

                          ELLIE

                Isn't it disgraceful the way troubled
                individuals are allowed to simply walk
                around with the rest of us until
                something horrible happens? Another
                failure of the HMOs. I'm thinking of
                sponsoring a bill, with Senator Friedman
                of Rhode Island --

                          RAYMOND

                -- I don't care.

                          ELLIE

                Well, imagine how terrified your people
                were yesterday when Major Marco showed up
                at the airport and you invited him -- my
                God, invited him -- to tag along.
                Knowing what they knew.

                          RAYMOND

                I know him. I served under him.   He was
                a good man.




                                                     8/18/03   75.








                          ELLIE

                That's what the neighbors always say
                about serial killers.
      Raymond stares at an old PHOTOGRAPH OF MARCO: curled up in a
      fetal position, on a V.A. hospital bed.

                          ELLIE

                    (sighs)
                Perhaps we could arrange a promotion to a
                less stressful posting. Somewhere
                tropical.

125   INT. FEDERAL BUILDING - CONFERENCE ROOM - DAY                  125

      Marco with Howard, who's visibly upset. He likes Marco, it
      breaks his heart to watch him unravelling like this. Agent
      Volk remains in her chair, on the other side of the room:
      The door opens, and Col. Garret comes in, with Agent
      Goldring, who gives Marco back his personal effects, and:

                          AGENT GOLDRING

                Goodbye.
                    (to Marco)
                Get out of here.

                          LT. COL. HOWARD

                He's free to go?

                          AGENT GOLDRING

                Shaw won't press charges, and he's got
                juice with important friends. It's
                today's daily double.
      Agent Volk closes her notebook and moves past Goldring as he
      picks up the tape recorder. She glances at Howard, and
      leaves the room.

                          COLONEL GARRET

                Someone from Senator Eleanor Shaw's
                office called and intervened on your
                behalf.
      A beat.   Marco, trying to process all this:

                          COLONEL GARRET

                Major, you have reached the terminal end
                of the Army's patience. You're relieved
                of duty, effective immediately.

                          LT. COL. HOWARD

                There's a young neurologist at Walter
                Reed. Zahn. He's had considerable
                success with GWS -- I want you to get
                your affairs in order and report to him

                          (MORE)





                                                    8/18/03   76.








                          LT. COL. HOWARD (CONT'D)

                for evaluation and treatment first thing
                Monday morning.

                          MARCO

                Sir, I know all about Dr. Zahn.
                Remember? He's that guy who --
                    (catches himself)
                Sir. Yes sir.
                    (beat)
                I'm sorry.

                Me too, Ben.

      micro-circuitry, neat as a pin --

                          DELP'S VOICE

                I thought you said you lost this.

      TIGHT - THROUGH A STEREOSCOPIC MICROSCOPE - THE IMPLANT

      falls into focus, smooth and etched with integrated circuits
      as intricate and beautiful as a henna tattoo ...

                          MARCO'S VOICE

                I found it again.

128   INT. DELP'S LAB - SKYBOOTH - NIGHT                             128

      Delp looks up from the microscope, at Marco.

                          DELP

                These are not supposed to exist, man.
                These are only theoretical.
      -- leaves the statement hanging --

129   INT. DELP'S LAB - MAIN FLOOR - MOMENTS LATER                   129

      Delp freaked and hyper, gathering wires and whatnot from
      shelves -- a veritable armload, as:

                          DELP

                You sure you want to do this man?

                          MARCO

                Yes.

                          DELP

                -- because I don't.

                          MARCO

                I'll owe you one.




                                             8/18/03   77.







Delp rounds a corner -- monkeys scrambling around their
cages as he comes to the clearing where

MARCO

sits on one of the experimental gurneys, using a pen to
write on his arm.

                    DELP

          No. I'll still owe you for getting my
          sorry ass out of Albania.

                    MARCO

          -- Talk to me about the implant.

                    DELP

          Manchurian Global. Heard of 'em?
              (off Marco:)
          Private equity fund, specializes in
          military support services and weapons
          research ... including a certain Army
          implant project that went belly-up in the
          early 90s.

                    MARCO

          You said the Army implants were for
          medical emergency data.

                    DELP

          The ones they publicized were. But, oh
          man, there was a parallel project of all
          kinds of scary implantable shit the
          Clinton watchdogs finally freaked out
          over, and closed down.

                    MARCO

          How do you know all this?

                    DELP

          Cuz they funded me to make some of their
          scary shit.

                    MARCO

          What does it do?

                    DELP

          I don't know. I don't want to know. You
          don't want to know -- shit -- it's out of
          you, and you're still alive. That's the
          good news.
              (off his arm)
          What are you doing?

INTERCUT - MARCO'S FOREARM

He's scrawling words on his palm, with a ballpoint pen:

ROSIE. RAYMOND SHAW. MANCHURIAN-GLOBAL ...





                                           8/18/03     78.








                    MARCO

          Back-up in case this makes me forget some
          stuff I want to remember.

DELP

eases Marco back on the gurney, deftly puts some I.V. taps
into his arms. Marco's legs hang over the edge.

                    DELP

          These are built for monkeys, so bear
          with me, man.

SERIES OF SHOTS

He's putting thread-thin electrodes INTO Marco's head, just
beneath the skin.

                    DELP

          I'm putting you on a cocktail of
          methohexitol to take the edge off.

                    MARCO

          Edge off what?

                    DELP

          'Getting clarity.' Or whatever you want
          to call it -- ECT not being the precise
          science that, say, leeching is.
Wires snake across the floor to the ECT [Electro-Convulsive
Therapy] unit.

                    MARCO

          You don't think this is going to work.

                    DELP

          It's the desperation move, man. But,
          hey. There is a school of thought, says
          a victim of induced abreaction -- or
          ultra-paradoxical brain activity, if
          you're at all correct about what happened
          to you -- can have it effectively
          dispersed by electroshock. Unscrambled.

                    MARCO

          -- But?

                    DELP

          But the legions of naysayers will tell
          you that if the initial work's done
          correctly -- if the brain's been not just
          washed, but dry-cleaned --
Takes out a bite-guard and puts it in Marco's mouth:




                                                 8/18/03   79.








                          DELP

                -- fuhgetaboutit. No sale.
                    (then)
                Try to relax, okay?
      He throws the switch, sending electric current through
      Marco's head --
      -- Marco's body ARCHES off the table and he goes into
      seizure --

      angry sun ...
      ... the SCREEN BLOOMS WHITE, and completely empty -- like an
      Arabian desert --

130   EXT. CENTRAL PARK - DAY                                          130

      Marco opens his eyes to the glare of a crisp autumn sun,
      surreal colors: blue sky, shimmering green, the skyline.
      His head is in Rosie's lap, he lies curled in the grass.
      A banana-yellow motorized model plane buzzes in tight
      circles overhead.




                                                      8/18/03   80.







        Rosie's talking, but Ben can't hear her.    Just the buzzing.
        She stops, looks at him.

                             ROSIE

                   Blank again?
        Marco tries to say something, his mouth is dry.

                             ROSIE

                   He said this would happen.
        Marco stares, trying to orient himself. His arm comes up to
        shade his eyes -- nothing written on it.

                               MARCO

                   Who?

                             ROSIE

                   Your friend.

                             MARCO

                   I don't remember a friend.
        Nothing.

                             ROSIE

                   Kind of like a computer system crash --
                   your brain goes down, then you boot up
                   again, but you lose all your RAM.
                       (hesitates)
                   Do you remember me?

                             MARCO

                       (after a beat)
                   Eugenie Rose.
        Rosie smiles.     Marco closes his eyes again and --

                                                SCREEN GOES BLACK.

        Silence.   Two beats.
        Then the SOUND OF A TELEVISION fades up:

132     INT. ROSIE'S COUSIN'S APARTMENT - NIGHT                       132

        Marco wakes up, still in a bed. Alone. The room bathed in
        blue light from the small television where the news drones.

TV132 OMITTED                                                       TV132

        Rosie comes out of the bathroom, wearing a long New York
        Rangers jersey, bare-legged, barefoot, hair wet from a
        shower. Beautiful.

                            MARCO

                  It's Wednesday.

                            ROSIE

                  Yes.

                            MARCO

                  Central Park was Monday.   I came home
                  Friday.

                            ROSIE

                      (smiles)
                  That's right.
        A long beat. Marco stares at the t.v. as she sits on the
        edge of the bed, rubs her hair with a towel.

                            MARCO

                  How did I get here?

                            ROSIE

                  You called me.

                            MARCO

                  El Dorado 59970.
                      (beat)
                  I remembered.
                      (beat)
                  I remember, and I didn't dream.

                            ROSIE

                  It's been weird, talking to you. Knowing
                  that you could fall asleep with your eyes
                  open and wake up and have forgotten the
                  whole conversation. I hope to God that
                  part's over.

                            MARCO

                  What'd we talk about?




                                                   8/18/03   82.








                           ROSIE

                     (vague)
                 Stuff.
                     (then)
                 You said you "loved" me. Not to scare
                 you. Out of nowhere, but more than once.

                           MARCO

                 I remember that.
      Beat.   She smiles.   She leans in, kisses him lightly.

                             ROSIE

                 Liar.

                           MARCO

                 What else did we talk about?
      Rosie opens her mouth --

                                             SCREEN GOES BLACK.

      Two beats of silence, then --

133   INT. ROSIE'S COUSIN'S APARTMENT - BEDROOM - DAWN               133

      Marco wakes up. Clear headed. Calm. Rosie is asleep
      beside him on the bed. The television is off.

134   INT. BATHROOM - DAWN                                           134

      Marco drinks water from the faucet, wipes his mouth. Stares
      at himself in the mirror -- he looks like death warmed over.
      Starts to smile ...
      ... but his eyes stray up to the half-open mirror of the
      vanity -- reflecting, behind him, the bathroom wall: towel
      racks, wall paper, a high VENT ... with a FAINT RED LED
      glowing INSIDE.

      JUMP CUT: MARCO

      Standing on the edge of the tub, stretched out, face pressed
      up to the vent, trying to see inside --

      SUBJECTIVE: MARCO (B&W) - THROUGH THE VENT

      Looking back at Marco, peering in.   Slightly warped by the
      lens. Freaking out.

      RESUME - MARCO

      He can just make out the shadow of a TINY VIDEO CAMERA,
      wires snaking back into the ducting, micro-lens adjusting
      automatically to focus.




                                                 8/18/03   83.







      He slips off the tub, nearly falls, catches himself --

135   INT. ROSIE'S COUSIN'S APARTMENT - DAWN                        135

      Marco taping newspapers over all the heating vents --

      INT. ROSIE'S COUSIN'S APARTMENT - DAWN

      Marco going through cupboard, drawers, closets, looking for
      ... what, exactly?
      He doesn't know. His world is caving in.   He pivots, looks
      at Rosie, still sleeping.

      INT. ROSIE'S COUSIN'S APARTMENT - DAWN

      Rosie's purse is dumped out on the table, and now Marco's
      going through her suitcase.
      He's dressed, now, even has his coat on.
      Pulling out her clothing, discovering, at the bottom:

      FILE FOLDERS, NOTES, REPORTS

      Much of the same material that Eleanor Shaw showed Raymond.
      Incriminating stuff about Marco, timetables, surveillance
      photographs, psychiatric evaluations and

      AUDIO TAPES

      Microcassettes, neatly labelled with dates and hours ...

      INTERCUT - SUBJECTIVE: SAME (B&W) - SURVEILLANCE


                           ROSIE

                Ben?
      Rosie, rolling off the bed, sleepy, crossing to where Marco
      is gathering the files --

                          ROSIE

                What are you ... oh God.
      Sees the hard look on Marco's face. Newspapers over all the
      vents. Opens her mouth to explain but Marco SWINGS HARD,
      and hits her -- she partially blocks it with her forearm --
      backhands her onto the floor --

                          MARCO

                You're part of it.
      -- then he's moving, out the door --

                           ROSIE

                Don't --




                                                    8/18/03   84.







      She leaps at him -- SHOVES him hard into the wall, and when
      he whirls to shake her off, slips down and uses his weight
      and momentum to toss Marco crashing halfway back across the
      room.
      Now she's between him and the door.

                          ROSIE

                Don't do this, Ben.    It's not what you
                think.

      He tries to get past her again --

      THEY FIGHT

      Rosie can't beat him, but she's extremely skilled -- Marco
      gets stung twice by hard rights -- but whirls, all-defense,
      an improvised rope-a-dope that gives him the opening he
      needs --
      -- he SMACKS Rosie sharply, stunning her -- and as she rocks
      backward he flies out the door --

      A CARETAKER rattling keys impatiently behind him, Marco
      stands looking down into the pit of the abandoned lab.
      Delp and the monkeys are gone. Empty cages and unplugged
      equipment are all that remain of Delp and his fear project.
      The utter quiet is deafening.

      could be part of this.
      PRELAP sound of a tape fast-forwarding and:

      Marco deep in research, at a small table covered with books
      and paper -- a crazy man's kind of chaos.
      The file he stole from Rosie's is disemboweled across the
      desktop. A library tape machine plays one of the
      surveillance tapes he's stolen from Rosie's:

                I called the Pentagon.   They told me he's
                on medical leave.
      The calling card is Marco's, from Army Intelligence. Jordan
      flips it over. Marco has scrawled "DO YOU STILL WANT TO BE

      VICE PRESIDENT?"


                          AIDE

                Secret Service, they've got him on a
                couple of their watch and observe lists.
      Through a gap in the doorway, Jordan can SEE Marco sitting
      in his outer office, bag of evidence at his feet, hunched
      forward, staring at the floor.

                I guess there's been some trouble with
                this guy, involving Congressman Shaw.
      At the mention of the Shaw name, Jordan looks up --

      Jordan sits behind the table, all of Marco's documents and
      evidence arranged tidily in front of him in meager piles,
      Marco pacing, watching as Jordan finishes examining a thick
      Atticus Noyle computer print out.

                          JORDAN

                Nobody will believe this.

                          MARCO

                Nobody believed Watergate.
      He sits down, opposite Jordan.

                Or Oklahoma City, or the World Trade
                Center. You wouldn't have believed
                Oswald before Kennedy got shot.

                On the advisory board of Manchurian-

                which they won't -- you would find former
                Presidents, deposed Kings, retired Prime
                Ministers, Ayatollahs, African War-Lords,
                fallen Communist Dictators and an
                assortment of the Fucking Rich, who are
                distinguished from the merely Filthy Rich
                by factors of billions.
      He puts the Noyle file down, pushes everything away.

                          JORDAN

                You bring me rumors and conjecture.

       Jordan nods again, slightly.    Lost in thought.

                ELLIE                           JORDAN

                                      -- brainwashed you --
      -- In his dreams.

                          RAYMOND

                Sir, Ben Marco is sick.   Delusional.




                                              8/18/03   92.








                     JORDAN

           Nevertheless he's pulled from his mad hat
           some remarkably lucid connections between
           his dreams of your exploits in Kuwait,
           and this Dr. Noyle, and the private
           equity fund Manchurian Global --
Raymond frowns, looks from Jordan to Ellie.

                     JORDAN

           -- your mother's primary political
           benefactor for the past fifteen years.

                     ELLIE

           Christ, Tom. They contribute to half the
           Senate, for God's sake.
Silence.

                     RAYMOND

           I don't understand.

                     JORDAN

           At the time of Desert Storm, Dr. Atticus
           Noyle was working under a research grant
           from Manchurian Global. Your mother's
           friend.
The color suddenly drains out of Ellie's face.

                     RAYMOND

           What?

                     JORDAN

           Rogue scientists. Mind control.
           Manchurian Global. Your mother. You.
           Connect the dots, Raymond. Possibly,
           your mother's blind to them, because they
           pay their way --

                     ELLIE

           Possibly the Senator's motives are
           colored by his desperation to get himself
           back on the presidential ticket now that
           the heavy lifting is done --

                     RAYMOND

               (unraveling)
           I don't -- I don't --

                     JORDAN

           It's not about me. As far as I'm
           concerned, this should never come out --
           it would shred what little remains of the
           fabric of our public trust -- think of
           the nation --




                                            8/18/03    93.








                     RAYMOND

           I don't have the dreams.

                     ELLIE

           He can't prove anything.

                     JORDAN

           Everything you stand for is upside down!
           If this were to come out, true or no, it
           would be catastrophic for the campaign.
               (beat, a threat?)
           And it will come out.

                     RAYMOND

           What are you saying?
Silence.   The question hangs there.

                     RAYMOND

           What do I do?

                     JORDAN

           You withdraw. You bow out gracefully.
           Personal reasons. An obscure illness.
           Yield your spot on the ticket, go into
           seclusion ...
He glances coolly at Ellie --

                     JORDAN

           ... and then surrender yourself to
           federal authorities who can help you
           address the damage that may have been
           inflicted on you.
-- and walks out. Raymond and Eleanor have hardly moved.
Sound of the front door opening, closing.

                     RAYMOND

           I feel sick. Christ.   What have you done
           to me?

                     ELLIE

           Raymond, remember when --

                     RAYMOND

           NO, never mind -- don't bother. Don't
           lie. Don't say anything. No more lies.
There are actual tears in Ellie's eyes.   Raymond just stares
at her, coldly.

                     RAYMOND

           I can promise you that whatever you've
           done, I will undo it.




                                                    8/18/03   94.








                          ELLIE

                I know -- I know, baby --

                          RAYMOND

                I never want to see you or speak to you
                again --

                          ELLIE

                Raymond --

                          RAYMOND

                -- I mean it this time.
      Raymond heads for the door --

                          ELLIE

                Sergeant Shaw --
      Raymond slows -- curious to be addressed like this -- sound
      of the desert wind rises --

                          ELLIE

                -- Sergeant Raymond Shaw --
      He's turning -- the room coming alive -- light shifting,
      intensifying -- that terrible vividness -- and the wall of
      the zaghareet ...

      EXTREMELY CLOSE ON - ELLIE


                          ELLIE

                Raymond Prentiss Shaw --
                    (sad)
                Listen:

                                                          CRASH:


155   INT. UNION STATION - WASHINGTON D.C. - DAWN                    155

      Marco jolts awake, as if from a bad dream, startled --
      cramped on a bench, just another rumpled, weary traveler --
      early morning commuters gliding past him like a fog.

156   EXT. CHESAPEAKE BAY - JORDAN'S HOUSE - DAWN                    156

      A lacy fog rising from the reeds on the shoreline as the
      Senator drags his kayak from under the pilings of a
      pristine, clapboard cottage to the edge of the water.

157   INT. JORDAN'S HOUSE - DAWN                                     157

      The house is beautiful, everything perfect. FLOAT through
      FINDING Jocie in a back bedroom, waking slowly in a huge
      bed, rolling to look out the window and watch her father, in
      his kayak, paddling away ...




                                                    8/18/03   95.








158   INT. UNION STATION - WASHINGTON D.C. - DAWN                       158

      Marco grabs a coffee from off a Starbucks counter, picks up
      his bag and heads toward the New York City line platform, to
      catch his train --

159   EXT. CHESAPEAKE BAY - JORDAN'S KAYAK - DAY                        159

      The Senator rows with confidence, his bow cuts the glassy
      surface of the bay, fog ripples away from him, dreamy.
      Up ahead, he can see the ghost of his house.      And a figure
      on the shoreline.

                          JORDAN

                Who's that?

                          RAYMOND

                It's me, sir.

      JORDAN

      stops paddling, and lets the kayak drift in.      He's breaking
      hard, sweat glistening on his face.

      RAYMOND

      sloshes down into the water, wades out waist-deep --

                           JORDAN

                Wait.   Oh, don't do that, I can --

                          RAYMOND

                I came to apologize, sir.

                          JORDAN

                -- the water must be freezing. What are
                you doing? Raymond. Don't bother, I
                can --
      Raymond catches the bow of the kayak, turns it.

                          RAYMOND

                I'm sorry.

                            JORDAN

                I am too.    But, your mother must --
      With one motion, Raymond RIPS the two-blade paddle out of
      Jordan's hand, and FLIPS the boat over --

                          RAYMOND

                I'm sorry, sir.
      -- Jordan goes under, legs trapped in the kayak --




                                                  8/18/03    96.








160   UNDER THE WATER - JORDAN                                       160

      flailing -- trying to get out of the kayak, incapacitated by
      the cold water --

161   INT. JORDAN'S HOUSE - DAWN                                     161

      Jocie wanders, sleepy, into the main room, pulling on a
      hooded sweatshirt -- and SEES, THROUGH THE BAY WINDOWS:
      -- her father's upended kayak.
      -- a figure in the water, as if trying to save him --

162   EXT. JORDAN'S HOUSE - DAWN                                     162

      Jocie sprints down toward the water, screaming --

                          JOCELYN


                DADDY!

      -- Raymond turns and sees her running toward him. For a
      moment time stands still -- Jocie trying to process Raymond
      Shaw in the water with her father, and Raymond trying to
      process, through the curtain of his fractured consciousness,
      Jocelyn Jordan.

      JOCELYN

      leaps into the water, thinking she'll help with a rescue.
      The cold hits her like a sledgehammer -- followed by the
      realization Raymond's trying to drown her father --

                          JOCELYN

                Raymond, what are you doing?!   No!   Stop
                it! Stop --!
      She tries to shove Raymond away from the boat, but

      RAYMOND

      turns, grabs her by the hood of her sweatshirt --
      -- and whipsaws her out into the deeper water, shoving her
      under it.
      Jocelyn's hands claw at him, but he's stronger, and the
      water has no effect on him.
      She thrashes wildly ... and he looks down at her through the
      water, hair flowing, utterly beautiful ... as if in a dream.

                          RAYMOND

                    (far away)
                Shhhhhhhh.




                                                   8/18/03    97.







        Jocelyn weakens ... succumbs ... her body floats away.

                  front-runner for his party's vice
                  presidential nomination -- appears to
                  have accidentally drowned when his kayak
                  overturned near his Chesapeake Bay home.
                  Police say his daughter, Jocelyn, 35, may
                  have been trying to rescue Jordan when
                  she was, herself, overcome by the icy

                  Horrible, horrible thing. Senator Jordan
                  was a statesman of the highest integrity.
                      (fighting emotions)
                  Tom Jordan was a friend. A damn fine
                  man. A great American.

        a gauntlet of reporters shouting questions: about policy,
        about Jordan. Expressionless, he just keeps walking, but
        his lips move --
        -- "tragedy" -- "senseless" -- "great loss" --

                  You trusted us to bring your son back to
                  you, and we deliver. We trusted you with
                  our technology -- and now you turn him
                  into a common hit man.

                          DONOVAN

                You didn't even ask us.   You needed to
                ask.

                          ELLIE

                Tom Jordan was going to destroy
                everything we've worked toward, and every
                one of us along with it, and you want me
                to call a meeting?

                David, if Jordan had gone public --

                In any endeavor, there are key players
                and role players, and Raymond -- or you,
                or me, for that matter -- I'm sorry -- we
                are role players, with fixed values and
                fixed agendas, that get weighed against
                other factors.
      Ellie stops, looks at him.

                          ELLIE

                Bullshit.
                    (then)
                You can tell yourself that as you go to
                bed tonight, David, and I hope it helps
                you wake up tomorrow with a clean
                conscience -- but we are talking about my
                son and the future of this country.
                    (beat)

168   INT. ROSIE'S COUSIN'S APARTMENT - NIGHT                         168

      Rosie asleep. PUSH IN RAPIDLY ... then a HAND comes down
      hard and efficiently against her throat --
      -- she wakes up, fighting for air --

                          MARCO

                    (a whisper)
                How does the President die?
      He sits on top of her, pinning her arms down.   She struggles
      to say something. Marco shakes his head.

          When.   Where. How.
He releases her throat, and she gasps for air --

                    MARCO

          I'm gonna stop this. We'll go to the
          Feds. You and me. And tell them a
          story.

                    ROSIE

          Who'll -- believe --

                    MARCO

          I don't know. I don't care any more.
          It's all I have.
Rosie bucks -- gets a hand free -- SLUGS, Marco, and they
tumble off the bed in a tangle of blankets and limbs --

ROSIE

comes up holding a 9 mm revolver to Marco's forehead.

                    ROSIE

          I am the Feds.
She coughs.   Marco stares at her, dumbfounded.

                    ROSIE

          We've been watching you, trying to sort
          this out. I mean, it's either you're
          telling it straight and we've all got
          something big-time to worry about, or
          you're crazy and dangerous -- either way
          we've had to keep you on a short leash,
          'cuz if we lock you up we'll never know.
              (beat)
          And we can't tell anybody because we
          don't know how deep this river runs.

          If there is a river.
              (off his expression)
          You got away from me.

          Oh Ben. The thing is? I want to believe
          you. God help me, Ben, I do.

                           MARCO

                 I am clearer on this than I've ever been.
                 It's rich guys, funding bad science, to
                 put a sleeper in the White House --

                           ROSIE

                 Listen to yourself. You're a poster boy
                 for paranoid fantasies.
      Beat.   Silence, broken only by their breathing.

                           MARCO

                 I screwed up. Jordan was my trump card,
                 and I screwed it up.
                     (then)
                 Either help me, or shoot me, Rosie.
                 There's no middle ground anymore.
      He gets up -- Rosie's not going to shoot him --

                                                 SMASH CUT TO:


169   NOYLE                                                         169

      frowning --

                           NOYLE

                 Raymond -- Raymond --

                                                           TURN:


      DREAMSCAPE - AS BEFORE

      Raymond hands a service revolver past Noyle, to
      MARCO -- who primes it, aims --

                           NOYLE (O.S.)

                 Captain Marco, would you please shoot
                 Private Baker so we can move on?

170   INT. LIMOUSINE - MORNING                                      170


                           RAYMOND

                 Aaaahhhhhhh --!
      Raymond awakens with a startled about, face flushed,
      sweating. Terrified --




                                                8/18/03     101.








                          MIRELLA/ANDERSON

                Aaaahhhhhh --!
      -- Raymond finds himself in the back seat of his limo, his
      campaign aide Mirella, her assistant, and Anderson, all
      startled and shouting too --

                            MIRELLA

                You okay?

                            RAYMOND

                Yeah.    Yes. Bad dream.

                          ANDERSON

                We've arrived, Congressman.
      Raymond sits up.

                            RAYMOND

                Okay.

171   EXT. P.S. 16 - WESTCHESTER - DAY                               171

      Raymond emerges to cameras and fanfare -- it's election day,
      and he's going to vote.
      Anderson and other agents clear a path up the steps into the
      ELEMENTARY SCHOOL VOTING SITE. Reporters shout questions
      that Raymond just answers with his professional smile.

172   INT. P.S. 16 - GYMNASIUM - DAY                                 172

      A temporary polling place. Flags, tables, not too crowded.
      VOTERS stepping out of the way. POLL VOLUNTEERS pressing in
      to shake hands and wish Raymond Shaw good luck. And

      ROSIE

      on the edge. She badges Anderson, and talks to him. He
      nods, moves over and talks quietly to Raymond as Raymond
      signs his name in the voter registration log.
      Then lets Rosie guide him to a booth on the end --

173   INT. VOTING BOOTH - RAYMOND                                    173

      pulls the giant lever, the curtains close, finds --
      A NOTE -- folded, taped to the machine.
      RAYMOND -- opens it, reads it.




                                                8/18/03     102.








      VOTING BOOTH - MOMENTS LATER

      the curtain opens and Raymond steps out, smiling again.
      Cameras flash, video crews wave boom mikes, expecting a
      sound bite:

                          RAYMOND

                I was on the fence when I walked in there
                ... but then I saw my name on the ballot
                and I knew what I had to do.
      Laughter. He whispers to a poll volunteer, and she points
      him down a hallway --

174   INT. P.S. 16 - CORRIDOR                                       174

      Raymond, Rosie and his Secret Service detail -- Rosie leads
      them to a doorway, holds it open for Raymond, but puts her
      hand lightly on Anderson's chest when he starts to go in to
      sweep the room --

                          ROSIE

                It's clean.

175   INT. P.S. 16 - SPECIAL ED. ROOM - DAY                         175

      Small, and private. Raymond turns on the light. Marco is
      in the corner, waiting. His Noyle File in one hand.

                          MARCO

                How's your back?

                            RAYMOND

                It hurts.

                          MARCO

                I'm sorry.
      Raymond locks the door, turns, takes in the room: tiny
      chairs and tables, walls covered with kids' drawings, and
      nearly every object in the room named and labelled with 3x5
      cards.

                          RAYMOND

                I've been having the dreams, Ben.

                          MARCO

                That's good.

                          RAYMOND

                Good? They're inside my head. They got
                inside, the way you said they would --

                          MARCO

                We'll get 'em out.




                                                    8/18/03   103.








                          RAYMOND

                They're all ... twisted together -- and I
                dream things, terrible things, that can't
                possibly have happened. I'm gone, Ben --
                I'm losing it --

                          MARCO

                No -- you could have had me locked up --
                and you didn't. That's a sign.

                           RAYMOND

                Of what?

                          MARCO

                That they don't control everything. We
                can fight it. I mean -- I'm still out
                here because you decided I should be --
                which means there's a part they can't get
                to, deep inside -- the part where the
                truth is, and they can't touch us there.
                That's what we need to tap into, Raymond,
                that's the part where, you and me, we're
                gonna take them out.

                          RAYMOND

                Jocie's dead.

                           MARCO

                I know.

                          RAYMOND

                -- and the Senator.

                           MARCO

                Yeah.
      Beat.

                          RAYMOND

                Did I do it?

                          MARCO

                I think so, yeah.

                          RAYMOND

                I don't remember.     I don't remember it.
      Raymond looks up at Ben.     Emotionless.   Uncomprehending.

176   INTERCUT - CORRIDOR - ROSIE AND ANDERSON                       176

      down the hallway, standing sentinel. Anderson checks his
      watch, glances uncomfortably back at the door -- then at
      Rosie, who just stares him down.




                                                  8/18/03    104.








177   RESUME - SPECIAL ED. ROOM - RAYMOND                           177

      Tears run down his face, but his voice is normal, he stays
      expressionless. He rubs his eyes with the heel of his hand.

                          RAYMOND

                I'm all inside-out.
      KNOCKING on the door.

                            ANDERSON (O.S.)

                Mr. Shaw?

                          RAYMOND

                Just a minute.
      Raymond's cell phone RINGS.

                          RAYMOND

                All I've ever done is what I was supposed
                to do. What I was told to do --

                          MARCO

                Raymond -- focus --

                          RAYMOND

                -- What others want me to do.

                          MARCO

                Did they tell you what they want you to
                do, Ray? We gotta know what's gonna
                happen, we gotta know when's it gonna
                happen -- you can help me do this --

                          RAYMOND

                You don't think they saw this coming?
                You don't think they factored you in?
                    (matter of fact)
                I need to die, Ben.

                          MARCO

                What? No -- no, man, they've got big
                plans for you --

                          RAYMOND

                I'm the enemy, Major Marco, and the only
                way to stop me is to kill me. I thought
                you were smarter than this.

                          MARCO

                I can get the Feds, the police.   Come on,
                Ray -- fight it --

                          RAYMOND

                Are we friends?




                                                   8/18/03   105.








                          MARCO

                Raymond, you gotta work with me here --
      Raymond takes the ringing phone from his inside pocket, and
      checks the number of who's calling.

                          RAYMOND

                I want to believe we're friends.

                          MARCO

                Raymond, stay focused. The irrefutable
                fact is that Jocie was a mistake, and
                we're gonna make 'em pay for it.

                          RAYMOND

                I dream you, Ben. You kill Private
                Baker.
                    (into the phone, pleasant:)
                Hello?

                          MARCO

                What are you talking about?

                          RAYMOND

                    (into the phone)
                Yes mother.
      A class BELL RINGS --

178   INTERCUT - CORRIDOR - DAY                                      178

      Rosie and Anderson, heading toward the special ed room --

                Hang up.

                          RAYMOND

                    (into the phone)
                Yes, he's right here.
      Raymond extends the phone to Marco.

                          RAYMOND

                She wants you.
      Marco hesitates.   Me?   But takes the receiver --

                          MARCO

      The happy chaos of screaming kids. Raymond emerges,
      smiling. Surrounded immediately by Anderson and his secret
      service detail, and escorted out of the building.

      ROSIE

      fights through the throng of students --

      KICKS it open --

          paranoid, lone gunman -- is trying to
          kill you.

                    RAYMOND

          The Major is an excellent marksman.
She touches his bare shoulder, leaves her hand there.

                    RAYMOND

          But what will happen to him?

                    ELLIE

              (gentle)
          The assassin always dies, baby. It's
          necessary for the national healing.
She takes his shirt off a hanger, he stands up, and she
starts to dress him --

                    ELLIE

          I'm sure you will never entirely
          comprehend this, darling, and I know, the
          way you are right now, this is like
          trying to have a whimpered conversation
          with someone on a distant star ... but it
          must be said, Raymond -- I did this for
          you -- so that you could have what I
          could not, what your father didn't want --
          what your grandfather dared to dream
          possible --
She runs her hands through his hair.   Tears fill her eyes.

                    ELLIE

          -- when you ran away to join the Army,
          after that girl, after Jocie -- when you
          swore you'd never speak to me again, I
          felt your father's shadow pass across us,
          and I couldn't let him run you the way
          he ruined himself.
              (beat)
          That's when Mark Whiting came to me with
          talk of extraordinary scientific
          breakthroughs ... Attitude adjustment ...
          Reconciliation ... Greatness. So I let
          them take you, and change you. Not too
          much. Not so much that you'd notice.
          Just enough to bring you back to me.

                    RAYMOND

          Yes, mother.

                    ELLIE

          And look what you have, now! Look how
          far we've come! It's working, darling --
          they think they own you, but they are
          very, very wrong. You're not something
          they can buy and sell, Raymond, not for

                          ELLIE (CONT'D)

                any price -- we're one, and there'll be
                no stopping us now, will there? We're
                going to save this country in the hour of
                its greatest need.
      Raymond is dazzled by Eddie's radiance.

                          RAYMOND

                Yes, mother.
      She straightens his tie.   Her hands caress her son's
      shoulders.

                          ELLIE

                How much you look like my father, now --
                you have his hands, and you hold your
                head in the same proud way. And when you
                smile it's like I'm a little girl again,
                and --
                    (impulsively kisses him)
                When you smile -- when you smile --

      it neatly and puts it on the floor. FOLLOW HIM as he stoops
      to find a HIGH-TECH METAL CASE hidden in the air vent ...
      ... he opens it, revealing a disassembled SNIPER RIFLE,

      A figure behind the grid.    Marco?   She's sure of it --

       celebration, lights flaring, side walls alive with iconic
       American images --
       The raucous crowd starting to CLAP in rhythm -- people
       CROONING along with the song's chorus, as --

       ON STAGE - A JUBILATION TABLEAU

       people waving, hugging dancing -- more super-insiders
       joining the throng onstage, shaking hands, high-fiving --

       RAYMOND PRENTISS SHAW

       waving, staring up into the lights ... searching.    Finds the
       spot he's been looking for --

A236   PROJECTION BOOTH - MARCO                                      A236

B236   RESUME - STAGE - RAYMOND                                      B236

       INTERCUT - VARIOUS MONITORS - SAME TIME

       -- Ellie, stunned -- painfully aware that the eyes of the
       world are on her -- and Raymond moving, taking his mother's
       hands -- inviting her to dance.

C236   PROJECTION BOOTH - MARCO                                      C236

236    INT. SERVICE HALLWAY - SAME TIME                               236

       Rosie and the Feds sprint toward Marco's projection booth --

237    ON STAGE - RAYMOND AND ELLIE                                   237

       as Ellie surrenders to the moment, and enters Raymond's arms
       -- what else can she do? -- this is her son, her dream is
       halfway there ... and the President can die another day.
       They swirl off to the music --

238    THROUGH MARCO'S SCOPE - ARTHUR                                 238

       perfectly centered in Marco's sights, but then --
       -- Raymond and Ellie glide in front of Marco's target --
       lingering in Marco's eyeline, Raymond stares up into the
       scope -- eyes trusting, urging, as if he's saying: now --
       -- then ARTHUR IS ALONE AGAIN, in the center of the
       crosshairs, waving and grinning at the ROARING CROWD like a
       man who's just been elected President, but --
       -- MARCO's crosshairs SWING OVER, finding RAYMOND AND ELLIE
       again --

239    STAGE - ON ELLIE - SAME TIME                                   239

       dazzling glare of the stage lights -- first shadow of doubt
       crawling across her --

240    THROUGH THE SCOPE - ELLIE AND RAYMOND                          240

       Pulls the trigger.   BAM BAM BAM.
       Raymond and his mother are kicked back into the horrified
       celebrants on the stage --
       -- the same bullets ripping through both of them --
       -- toppling together, dead before they hit the ground --

       BALLOONS cascade down on a nearly black-and-white tableau of
       pandemonium and chaos, against the soaring wall-to-wall
       images of America's greatness displayed on the IMAX screens.
       Screaming and shouting. President-elect Arthur vanishing in
       a phalanx of Secret Service. VIDEO CREWS pressing in on the
       stage, morbidly curious ...
       ... and a strange clearing around the bodies of Raymond and
       Eleanor Shaw, crumpled and bloody ...
       ... still locked in their embrace.

                  member of the armed forces.

                  The tragic deaths of the incumbent vice
                  president and his Senator mother mark the
                  end of a family dynasty that has
                  dominated American politics for more than
                  fifty years. The mother and the son,
                  polar opposites on myriad issues,
                  nevertheless managed to promise a "one
                  plus one equals ten" kind of equation to
                  many Americans; the hopeful, heady notion
                  that these two somehow comprised a united
                  vision of stunning, almost revolutionary
                  breadth and depth ... a combined

        azure water, toward crumbled ruins of a long-abandoned

        remnants of an ancient caravansary:

crumbling ruins ...

                    MARCO

          You don't develop a technology like that
          and waste it on two guys.
He looks to Rosie, who stands in an archway. There are
SOLDIERS here, with weapons -- could be here to guard Marco.
Could be here to protect him.

                    ROSIE

          We know that.
Marco looks past her, to the water, which stretches out from
here, as if to forever.

                    MARCO

          I remember running.
His arm is in a simple sling. He moves like a man who's
been shot, and not quite recovered -- moves past Rosie, out
of the broken-down ruins ...

                    MARCO

          I had to get out where the sky was.
... Rosie motions the soldiers to stay back, follows him by
herself ...

                    MARCO

          I had to get to the water.
PULL BACK as they walk down the beach to the sea. A few
tumble-down buildings are all that remains of an ancient
seaside town.

                    MARCO

          I thought: if I can just get to the
          water, everything will be okay.
Marco approaches the water's edge, staring out at the
uncertain horizon.
Nothing but water as far as the eye can see.
PULL BACK.   And back.   And back ...

                                                         April 8, 1999

FADE IN ON:

Dark clouds below the inky remnants of the scorched sky. We hear  wind
as we sail, like a glider, over the black atmosphere.

We DIVE DOWN into the murkiness, through the clouds, into the   darker
world of  the dead  surface of  Earth, the  desert of  the real.   The
rotted skeleton of a massive city is sprawled everywhere. We  approach
a fissure in the Earth's crust, and as we do, we hear the   increasing
buzz of multiple hovercraft  engines. Blue flashes grow  in  intensity
from the fissure. Radio voices,  indistinct at first, grow louder   as
we approach the fissure.

                             WOMAN (V.O.)

           "Six o'clock, 300 meters. We can't outrun 'em."

                              MAN (V.O.)

    "I know. Can't tow this crate fast enough! We gotta ditch it!"

We hear the voices as though we're listening to cops through a  police
scanner. The woman is NIOBE, the captain of the lead ship, Sephora.

                             NIOBE (V.O.)

     "Can't, the core is still good. And they've got 'The One.'"

                              MAN (V.O.)

             "Oooh, our savior. Hed better be worth it."

                             NIOBE (V.O.)

                "Shut up and make the exit. Hold on!"

The azure glow  from the  fissure  is suddenly overwhelming.  A  tight
convoy  of  three  HOVERCRAFT  explode  from  the  fissure,  traveling
nearly straight up, like a   trio of massive locomotives flying   into
the sky in tight formation,  linked together by tow cables.  The  blue
glow has  been emanating  from  the  overworked flare  drives of   the
first and third hovercrafts.  Between them, suspended by  tow  cables,
is the dark, scorched,  and sliced NEBACHANEZZER. They  rocket upward,
slowing as they reach the top of the arc.

                             NIOBE (V.O.)

                             "Woo-hoooh!"

The rush to the ground, pulling up at the last second. The NEB  flails
wildly between them.

                              MAN (V.O.)

                        "They're still on us!"

More vehicles fly from the fissure. A massive army of SQUIDDIES  pours
up onto the surface.


INT. NEBACHANEZZER COCKPIT

The NEB is slung between the two HOVERCRAFT, with the cockpit   facing
backwards.  TRINITY,  MORPHEUS,  TANK,  and  NEO,  the  former  Thomas
Anderson, crowd the cockpit. Helpless, the landscape speeds away  from
them, while a wall of red-eyed SQUIDDIES speeds to them.

It's been a mere TWO DAYS  since the realization of NEOS POWERS   and
the defeat of AGENT SMITH. The slipstream whistles violently into  the
interior  of the  ship, and  the crew  is cold,  tired, haggard,   and
stressed beyond  belief as  they can  only watch  the action in  their
knocked-out ship.

                      MORPHEUS is on a headset.

                               MORPHEUS

                      "Niobe, theyre closing."

                                NIOBE

                             "How many?"

                               MORPHEUS

              "Just a few. Maybe two or three. Hundred."


INT. SEPHORA COCKPIT

NIOBE, as regal as she is beautiful, sits at the controls of her  ship
with her co-pilot, a younger female. All visible dials are redlined as
they streak over the dark surface.

                                NIOBE

               "Youve got a gift for understatement."


INT. FREEDOM COCKPIT

THE  FREEDOMS CAPTAIN,  a silhouette  in a  dark cockpit,  is flying
blind. His cockpit is awash in the blue flares from NIOBES ship.

His lieutenant, a shadowy female figure, reaches for the radar screen.
As she does, we see her  bare shoulder fall into view, a  WHITE RABBIT
tattoo is conspicuous.

They switch their screens to the radar, squiddies right on their ass.

                                 MAN

       "Oh shit, were screwed. We gotta set down and EMP em."

                             NIOBE (V.O.)

                             "Too many!"


EXT. FREEDOM HULL

A racing SQUIDDIES  reaches the hull  and latches on,  striking up its
cutting laser and ripping into the hull.


INT. SEPHORA COCKPIT

                              MAN (V.O.)

                 "Theyre on me! Shit! Losing power!"

NIOBES Lieutenant, a muscular Asian woman, Circa, notes something  on
a console.

                                CIRCA

                      "Multiple bogies closing!"

                                NIOBE

                              "No shit."

                                CIRCA

                          "From the front!"

Niobe is grim faced as she peers into the sky ahead. Several  objects
are closing in fast.

                                CIRCA

                            "Are they - "

She doesn't have time to finish the question, as the oncoming fighters
launch a massive  volley of missiles.  From afar, they  look like dark
irises  surrounded by  a corona  of flame.  At first,  we can't   tell
exactly what they  are, until their  fiery trails rip  straight at the
SEPHORA cockpit.

CIRCA DUCKS as the missiles harmlessly streak by.


INT. NEB COCKPIT

A massive  swarm off  missiles blasts  by the  cockpit. The individual
warheads  swerve  at  the last  second,  blowing  SQUIDDIES apart,  or
casting them to the ground aflame.


INT. SEPHORA COCKPIT

Niobe breathes a sigh of relief. Her lieutenant looks back up to see a
wing of HOVER FIGHTERS - 'DEFENDERS' fly past their ship. Sleek,  with
huge blue flares from their engines, they're gunship fighters armed to
the teeth with missiles and laser turrets studding the fuselage.

                                NIOBE

                           "They're ours."

                         DEFENDER ONE (V.O.)

          "Hold on, folks, you're in for a little cleaning."


EXT. THE SURFACE

The wing  of DEFENDERS  makes short  work of  the squiddies.  The half
dozen clinging to FREEDOM'S hull  are picked off by well-placed  laser
shots  that  turn  the  squiddies into  curdling  balls  of  slag. The
squiddies that survive turn tail and run.


INT. NEB COCKPIT

The crew of the Neb breathe a collective sigh of relief as they  leave
the scene of aerial carnage behind them.

NEO has been gripping an oh-shit handle on the edge of the cockpit. He
relaxes his grip as their escape is clear. Their ship suddenly  enters
a cave, and starts  to descend. The blue  wash of the ship  shows rock
walls and pipes. The ships are slowing down as they descend back  into
the earth.

TANK'S shoulders drop, and he leans back into his chair.

                                 TANK

                            "We're home."

                               TRINITY

          "Well, not yet, but we're in the defense screen."

                                 NEO

                            "What's that?"

                               MORPHEUS

 "A concentric ring of defenses that shields Zion. The fighters that
              just saved us constitute the first ring."

                             NIOBE (V.O.)

                    "Neb crew, you can relax now."

                               MORPHEUS

       "For the moment, perhaps. Its still a long drive home."

                                                              FADE OUT

and

FADE INTO:

TRINITY'S  CABIN.  At  first  we  see  only  stars  twinkling, faraway
diamonds on a black velvet background. The camera descends through the
darkness, to a sunset, dark blue, as if just after sunset. The artwork
terminates in the metal ring going  around her room. It's a much  more
hospitable place than the rest of the dreary hovercraft. The  articles
she's collected during  her time in  the resistance dot  the cabin. An
unfinished sweatshirt sits on a loom. There are charcoal portraits  of
loved ones.

Softly lit, the cabin sways slightly. The NEB is still in tow. NEO  is
sitting against the wall on Trin's bed, with her curled up beside  him
with her head on his lap.

Neo cant sleep. He stares at the wall opposite him. There's a   photo
of the crew of the NEB, sans Trin, in better days. Smiling,   laughing
as they are  seated around the  table. Morpeus, Tank,  Dozer,  Switch,
Epoch, Mouse. Neo stops on the image of a smiling CYPHER. There's   an
unknown Asian man in the photo, looking withdrawn and a bit lonely.

Gently,  placing  Trinity's head  down,  NEO stands  and  examines the
photo.

                             She awakens.

                               TRINITY

           "I'll have to take that one down now. Cypher..."

                                 NEO

                          "Who is this guy?"

                               TRINITY

                                "Who?"

                    NEO points to the mystery man.

                               TRINITY

                  "That was... I... forgot his name."

                                 NEO

                       "What happened to him?"

                          TRINITY is sullen.

                         "He didnt make it."

  NEO returns to the bed and sits down, disturbed. Trinity sits up,
                              awakening.

                                 NEO

                          "Was he like me?"

                            TRINITY nods.

                               TRINITY

      "Not you, though. Like you. There have been others, Neo."

                         "Aren't you tired?"

                                 NEO

                 "No. I've never been a big sleeper."

                               TRINITY

   "I know. I used to watch you hacking without sleeping for days."

               He turns to her, questions in his eyes.

                                 NEO

                  "How many 'ones' have there been?"

                               TRINITY

                       "That's not the point."

                        NEO may not think so.



                               TRINITY

                     "You are him. Youre mine."

                                 NEO

               "But what does it mean, to be The One?"

                               TRINITY

          "I don't know, Neo. Our mission was to find you."

                                 NEO

                           "So, now what?"

                               TRINITY

               "Now, Zion will give us a new mission."

              The hatch swings open. MORPHEUS peers in.

                               MORPHEUS

       "We're almost home. We'll need a detail. Five minutes."

                 HE closes the hatch and disappears.

                                 NEO

                        "Does he ever knock?"

                               TRINITY

                          "Not on his ship."

                                                               CUT TO:

INT. MAIN DECK, NEB

The crew grips the bulkhead and fixtures as the swaying ship comes  to
a rest. Outside, the sounds of hover engines fade away. Tank   unlocks
the main hatch, then jumps as it drops, unpowered, slamming into   the
tarmac with a resounding smash.

                                                               CUT TO:

EXT. ZION TARMAC

The tarmac  is a  busy, crowded  military airport,  with hovercraft of
different  sizes  spread  across  the  lot.  Its  housed  poorly  lit,
houses in a cave so huge  the ceiling is out of site.  Crewpersons run
around,  servicing  battle-damaged   vehicles.  Munitions  are  carted
across the tarmac on   robot rolling racks. No  one  pays the NEB  and
its battered crew any mind.

Nearby, the SEPHORA and FREEDOM  are parked. Their engines shut  down,
and their powered hatches are open. The crewmembers are spilling out.

NIOBE hurries to MORPHEUS' side, and he steps toward her, smiling, but
their  military manner  is quickly  restored, though  they can  barely
contain their grins.

                               MORPHEUS

                              "Niobe..."

              SHE shakes his hand, the shake slows down.

                                 "M."

                               MORPHEUS

                       "Thanks for the rescue."

   THEY close for a kiss, when the FREEDOM'S captain suddenly jumps
                            between them.

    It's CHOI - the NEO's supposed neighbor and hacking financier.
    Exhuberant and oblivious, he joyfully gets in MORPHEUS' face.

                                 CHOI

 "Brough, you us your asses! We saved you so hard core you don't even
                                know!"

   NIOBE smiles at Morpheus and fades back as BOOTH shouts his own
           praises. Morpheus turns to his less-mature peer.

                                 CHOI

     "So, you think you finally found The One, huh? Another One?"

  DUJOUR, CHOI'S LIEUTENANT, pushes into their conversation, looking
                              offscreen.

                                DUJOUR

          "Idiot, we helped him find him. Hello, Morpheus."

                                 CHOI

                                "Huh?"

      He looks at what she's seeing. His gaze halts on NEO. He's
  concentrating on TANK and his apparent girlfriend, who seems to be
 consoling him. He turns to see CHOI and DUJOUR, does a double-take,
                       and his jaw drops open.

                                 NEO

                                "You?"

                  CHOI is quick to resume his cool.

                                 CHOI

                     "In the flesh, so to speak."

                                DUJOUR

       "Welcome to the real world, Neo. I'm glad you're here."

                                 CHOI

       "What do you think, Dujour? Should we take him with us?"

                                DUJOUR

                            "Definitely."

                                 CHOI

                             "Morpheus?"

 MORPHEUS turns from Niobe and  a Zion officer. He addresses  Trinity,
 glancing at the others.

                               MORPHEUS

"Go on ship's liberty. Meet me in the Dead Duck at 21:00 hours, drunk
                              or sober."


EXT. ZION STREET

It's like a  valley floor running  between two gigantic  walls of rock
that are  nearly vertical,  coming together  in an  elongated archway.
Carved into the street level  are innumerable stores and shops,  above
them,  apartments and  balconies that  rise to  the top  of the  arch.
People  flow  through the  street.  Their clothes  are  homespun wool,
denim, and leather. Dyes and  color are absent. Carved into  the solid
granite  walls,  between  homes  and  around  windows  and  doors, are
intricate and beautiful carvings.

NEO is lead down  the street by CHOI,  DUJOUR, and TRINITY, and  a few
other rebels. The push through a mult-culti crowd of people,  humanity
melting into one race.

                                 CHOI

"See, man? This is home. This is the main street. One of em, anyway.
       Almost everyone is a fighter. Sometimes, even the kids.

 THEY pass an outdoor workshop where youngsters are assembling small
                              machines.

                                 CHOI

 "Our energy as a people is directed toward liberation. Check it out,
                      here are some newcomers."

  A group of frail, buzz-cut androgonites pass by them. They look at
          NEO, recognizing him as one of them, a new comer.

                                 NEO

                     "Where did they come from?"

                                 CHOI

     "Energy plant we raided on our last mission. There were some
                             survivors."

                                 NEO

             "How are their minds freed from the Matrix?"

                               TRINITY

                          "With difficulty."

                                DUJOUR

                             "If at all."

They step into a club, Dead  Duck. Its a sailor joint. Lots  of wood,
beer on tap, and rum. Crewmembers of other ships recognize the rebels,
greeting them, as they eye Neo.  They take a booth in the  corner. The
waitress arrives.

                               WAITRESS

        "Welcome home, brothers and sisters. First day back?"

                                 CHOI

                            "Yes, lovely."

                               WAITRESS

                   "On the house, then. Four rums?"

                               TRINITY

                           "Make it eight."

        The waitress smirks and leaves. TRINITY turns to CHOI.

                               TRINITY

                          "Any casualties?"

                   CHOI lights up and takes a drag.

                                 CHOI

                  "Two. Sidewinder and Left-right."

                                DUJOUR

              "I cant believe Cypher turned. Bastard."



                                 CHOI

                        "He who loses faith..."

                                DUJOUR

  "Neo, we monitored your fight. Did you really gain enlightenment?"

                             NEO shrugs.

                                 NEO

                "All I know is I kicked Smiths ass."

                                 CHOI

"Fuckin finally, Jesus Christ. Its about time we iced that bastard."

                                DUJOUR

               "Yeah, we finally won against an agent?"

                                 CHOI

             "I guess 1 n 298 isnt a bed record, huh?"

               The drinks arrive. Tall glasses of rum.

    CHOI holds his glass aloft. They raise their glasses to toast.

                                 CHOI

                         "Live free or die."

                            ALL (save NEO)

                             "Live free."

They slam the rum back, and  slam empty glasses on the table.  NEO can
barely manage to sip his.

                                 NEO

                      "God, how do you do that?"

                               TRINITY

                     "Youve never drank before."

                                DUJOUR

                           "Not for real."

                                 CHOI

             "You want to know what being The One means?"

                                 NEO

                               "What?"

                                 CHOI

                    "One drink and youre toast."

                                DUJOUR


             "Neo, you know what else youve never done?"

She glances at  Trinity, who falls  back against the  seat, turning to
suppress a smile. Choi cracks up.

                                 NEO

                               "Yeah."

                                DUJOUR

                    "Yeah, youve never done it."

                                 CHOI

       "And virtual doesnt count, man, doesnt fucking count."

                                 NEO

                     "Well. Ill drink to that."

                                 CHOI

                            "Here, here."

This time, NEO follows the others and slams back the entire glass.  He
coughs and sputters as his friends and bar patrons cheer him on."


EXT. MAIN STREET, ZION

The lights are dim, and only a few late night revelers stagger through
the  streets  on their  way  back home.  Walking  straight and  calmly
through the stragglers are MORPHEUS and NIOBE.

                               MORPHEUS

            "So, how do you like having your own command?"

                                NIOBE

             "Its good. But trying. The responsibility..."

           THEY stop before the entrance to the DEAD DUCK.

                               MORPHEUS

          "You must be both mother and father to your crew."

NIOBE nods, and looks into the bar. Inside, the crews are raging drunk
and loud.

                                NIOBE

          "Who will you be now? The mother, or the father?"

              MORPHEUS peers in on the scene and grins.

                               MORPHEUS

   "As long as they dont get out of line, Ill just be a brother."


INT. DEAD DUCK

NEO is out of it, while the others are merely comfortably in the  bag.
Hes acting like a kid who broke into his fathers liquor cabinet.

                                 CHOI

        "So, you went back in, and you two pulled him out?"

TRINITY nods,  herself in  disbelief. NEO  picks his  head up  off the
table.

                                 NEO

                    "Kicked... kicked Smiths ass."

           CHOI eyes MORPHES and NIOBE coming toward them.

                                 CHOI

     "Hey, did you kick anybody elses ass, Neo? Like Morpheus?"

                                 NEO

             "Morpheus? Yeah, I smacked him around, too."

MORPHEUS arrives just  in time to  hear the last  part. He stands  and
grins down at NEO.

                               MORPHEUS

                 "So, you can smack me around, Neo?"

                                 NEO

                         "Oh yeah. Anytime."

MORPHEUS taps him on the forehead. NEO blinks and falls back into  the
booth. He stands before them.

                               TRINITY

                            "Hows Tank?"

                               MORPHEUS

 "Hes on bereavement leave with his mother. Dozer was the second son
                       shes lost in this war."

                    His comments set a sober tone.

                               MORPHEUS

  "The Nebechanezzer is out of commission for at least a month. But,
                    thats not giving us a rest."

                               TRINITY

         "Let me guess. Weve been ordered back out anyway."

                               MORPHEUS

 "Yes. This is another special op. Im in command, Niobe and Trinity
             are team leaders. Neo is our secret weapon."

     FLASH TO: NEO, passed out with his mouth open on the couch.

                               MORPHEUS

 "We dont know exactly what hes capable of. He may be just tapping
his potential, or he may have already reached it. We are to learn from
                      him, as he does from us."

                                 CHOI

"Why are we always getting screwed? Not only do I have to go straight
           back into the shit, but I lose my command, too?"

                               MORPHEUS

"Youve been assigned to this mission because youre the best, Choi."

                                DUJOUR

 "Yeah, and headquarters thinks you might be able to whine the agents
                              to death."

                                 CHOI

 "Oh my God thats so funny. My point is, dont we need some r-and-r?
Unwind a little? We lost two crew on the last one, you lost like five,
   right? Shit. Im glad we found Mr. Invincible, here, but Jesus..."

                               MORPHEUS

            "You dont have to go, Choi. Volunteers only."

                               TRINITY

        "Hes got a point, M. I have faith, but why so quick?"

                               MORPHEUS

 "We have a chance, here, but the window of opportunity is brief. Our
 ships say the Matrix is already upgrading and re-coding to block our
                          entry. And Neos."

                                 CHOI

"Fuck. Every fucking time we get another one, this is what they do."

                               MORPHEUS

                         "He is the One."

                                DUJOUR

             "You havent lost the faith, have you Choi?"

        CHOI grabs a half-filled rum glass and swigs it down.

                                 CHOI

 "Well, these are the times that try mens souls. Heres to victory."


EXT. TUNNEL

The FREEDOM hovers  slowly, silently, like  a submarine as  it cruises
through  the murky  depths. It  suddenly comes  to a  quiet stop,  and
descends. The engines fade out, and the vessel rests, darkened, on the
cave.

A quartet of  SQUIDDIES slips by.  We follow as  they worm their  ways
through  the  twisted passageway,  watching  as they  pass  the bubble
cockpit by mere feet.

FREEZE on the cockpit. Within the shadows we see Morpheus and Choi  at
the controls.


INT. FREEDOM COCKPIT

           They watch the SQUIDDIES fade into the distance.

                               MORPHEUS

                       "Power up. Sleep mode."

                                 CHOI

                         "Aye aye, capitano."

MINIMAL cockpit displays turn on, and the cabin remains dark.


INT. MAIN DECK

The ships OPERATOR, a lean Asian  kid with a gaze like a  laser scan,
sits behind  NEO, whos  sitting at  the operators  console with  his
hands on the abbreviated keyboard. Trinity sits with them, her feet up
as she observes.

NEO  stares  at  the  screen. Its  a  huge  syllabus  of Matrix  code
characters. He struggles to learn the complex code.

                                 NEO

          "Ka equals 9. But reverse Ka is point-nine, right?

                             RAZOR nods.

                                RAZOR

                      "You catch on quick, man."

                                 NEO

"I know these symbols from the hacking trainer. But how come its so
                 hard to find them on the keyboard?"

                               TRINITY

"Your brain knows what to do. But it has to associate characters with
                             your body."

                                RAZOR

"Its muscle memory, Neo. Think of the space bar and your thumbs nail
it. Because your thumbs have hit the space bar millions of times. But
think about reverse ka, and your fingers dont hit automatically hit
            the reverse key and the ka key in one shot."

                                 NEO

             "Where did these symbols come from, anyway?"

                                RAZOR

"Most of it is from the old Japanese. Its Katakana. See, the machines
 arent binary. No zero and one. Theyre quantum-based, so instead of
   an open-close base of zero or one, open or closed, they use all
                    numbers between zero and one."

                                 NEO

"All numbers between zero and one. That could be an infinite number of
                              numbers."

                                RAZOR

                        "Not could be, it is."

                          NEO is astounded.

                                 NEO

            "Holy shit. How many calculations per second?"

                                RAZOR

"How many CPS? Well, thats kind of hard to estimate. Put it this way:
 picture all the particles in the known universe. Not just atoms, but
              sub-atomic particles that compose atoms."

                                 NEO

"OK. At last count that was what, a gazillion, right? Two gazillion?"

                   RAZOR barely smiles at the joke.

                                RAZOR

  "Well, its up there. In any case, the number of calculations per
second the Matrix can perform is greater than the estimated number of
                  particles in the known universe."

                                 NEO

                               "Woah."

                               TRINITY

  "Thats how they have the operating power to create entire worlds
                          within their PCs."

                                 NEO

 "OK. Thats why it looks like reality. They have the computing power
                      to create entire worlds."

                                RAZOR

                               "Right."

                                 NEO

  "So, if we hack into the Matrix, why cant we just change the code
                         while were at it?"

                                RAZOR

 "No, no. See, its not that simple. The machines, the programs that
 code, create, and maintain the Matrix, the agents, they are code.
    There are different types of agents, many work unseen with no
interaction in the matrix. Then, there are the enforcers, the ones we
                         know all too well."

                                 NEO

                               "Right."

                                RAZOR

 "Well, my point is, the machines code and recode the Matrix by pure
will. Interaction with the Matrix, the physical act of being there,
 by default, allows people to change their environment - the Matrix.
            They move objects, make sound, affect cause."

                                 NEO

                           "Like reality."

                               TRINITY

  "Almost. Reality is unalterable. But the fabric of reality in the
   Matrix can be rewoven. Some can reach beyond normal cause. Their
 affects on the Matrix are deeper than average. They have learned to
change it according to their needs. But they dont have total control.
Thats why we need operators like Razor here. But you, you go further
                         than any of us can."

                                 NEO


                                "How?"

RAZOR stands  and taps  Neos skull.  He stretches,  grabs a  Japanese
style  wooden  sword, and,  out  of boredom,  starts  performing slow,
precise Kendo moves around the main deck as he talks.

                                RAZOR

"The equipment you carry up here. Youre a freak. A good freak. Youre
  neural kinetics blast past those of average humans. This, combined
   with your ability to suspend disbelief, allow you to change the
                       reality of the Matrix."

                                 NEO

                   "How did I end up as... a freak?"

             RAZOR practices the same strike a few times.

                                RAZOR

  "Good question. The Machines create people through cloning, since,
obviously, no coppertops have physical sex. Theoretically, all clones
  in the Matrix are exactly the same as when the first clones. They
         shouldnt be any different from normal, homegrowns."

                                 NEO

                   "OK, so how do you explain me?"

                               TRINITY

      "Not just you. Morpheus, myself. We were all born inside.

                                 NEO

                "Well, what separates us from others?"

                               TRINITY

"For the past 50 years or so, something has been happening to children
 in the Matrix. Theyve been mutating, changing in ways the machines
   never predicted. Some seem to gain faster reflexes and strength.
                 Others seem to have psychic powers."

RAZOR looks up to see MORPHEUS,  hanging back as he listens. He  comes
forward.

                               MORPHEUS

  "And others are able to change the reality of the Matrix itself."

                          HE points to Neo.

                               MORPHEUS

                    "Discussing history, are we?"

                        RAZOR shakes his head.

                                RAZOR

 "Im trying to teach this fool some programming, man. Hes stuck in
     the 20^th century. Hes got no skills, man. Without us, hes
                              helpless."

                               MORPHEUS

            "In the Matrix, without him, were helpless."

                               TRINITY

         "Morpheus, can you tell us what the mission is now?"

                               MORPHEUS

  "Not until we reach broadcast depth. Its slow going out there. I
guess they know were coming back, so theyre patrolling. We have time
                         to rest and ready."


EXT. MOUNTAIN TOP, LATE DAY (CONSTRUCT)

TRINITY sits alone on the tip of an impossibly high finger of rock. It
looks like it sits on the rooftop of the world. All around her, as far
as the eye can see, lie mountains. Their snow-capped peaks are pink in
the sunset light.

She looks into the sunset. Heavy thoughts weigh on her mind.

A hand appears on her shoulder. Its NEO. How he got on the finger  of
rock is anyones guess.

                                 NEO

                                "Boo."

TRINITY grins slightly and pulls on his arm. There is only enough room
for one on the end of the rock, so he sits down behind her.

                               TRINITY

                      "Dont lose your balance."

                                 NEO

                     "It doesnt matter if I do."

                               TRINITY

                          "So, you can fly."

                                 NEO

                                "Yes."

                               TRINITY

                        "Do you think I can?"

                                 NEO

       "I think you can do anything you want, if you believe."

                               TRINITY

                             "Like you?"

                                 NEO

         "I dont know. I dont know exactly what I can do."

                         TRINITY half turns.

                               TRINITY

                     "Will you teach me to fly?"

                                 NEO

                       "I dont know if I can."

                               TRINITY

                      "Free your mind of doubt."

NEO stands, and steps in front of TRINITY. Hes on the very, very edge
of the rock.  He extends his  hand down to  her. She grabs  it, and he
hauls her up. Her eyes dart to the ground, thousands of feet below the
finger.

                               TRINITY

          "In this construct program, the ground can kill."

                                 NEO

                    "I wont let you fall. Ever."

THEY look  into each  others eyes.  Despite the  trauma theyve  been
through, and not even truly knowing one another, theres a connection.

NEO suddenly backs away. He walks on the air with perfect traction, as
though hes on an invisible plane of glass. He leaves TRINITY standing
precariously on  the edge,  wobbling a  bit as  she maintains  balance
against  nerves.  She  breathes  deep,  and  looks  back  up  at  NEO,
maintaining her cool even as she eyes the spectacle.

NEO stands a few  feet away from her,  completely at ease as  the high
altitude winds ruffle his hair.

NEO extends a hand to her.

                                 NEO

"Its not real, Trinity. Youre not standing there. Step out. I can do
                          it. You can, too."


With one last  glance at the  infinite drop, she  steadies herself and
stares straight into his eyes. Blue meet brown. Breathless, she  steps
straight out.

She takes one step in the  air. For a breathless second, as  she steps
off the edge,  she is stable.  When she takes  her foot off  the edge,
though, she sways,  and her foot  slips, as though  shes on a  greasy
surface bobbing up and down. She corrects herself, tries another step,
sags further.

                               TRINITY

                               "Shit."

SHE glances down, then locks eyes with NEO. Then drops like an anvil.



                                 NEO

                              "Whoops."

HE  dives down,  shooting like  a missile.  TRINITY is  calm, falling
backwards, watching NEO  come for her.  The rocky ground  looms behind
her. She makes no effort to reach for NEO as he draws close to her. HE
reaches for her with all his might.

                                 NEO

                              "Grab me!"

TRINITY makes no effort to save herself, even as collision is  seconds
away. She stares at him intently.

                                 NEO

                           "Grab on to me!"

SEEING she is doing  nothing, he goes beneath  her and scoops her  up,
Superman  style.  He  barely accomplishes  this  before  he slows  and
settles onto the rocky ground.

They are in a twilight glade shaded by the mountains.

                                 NEO

                   "What the hell were you doing?"

         TRINITY smiles slightly. Her madness has a purpose.

                               TRINITY

                         "Showing you, Neo."

                                 NEO

        "Showing me what? You nearly gave me a heart attack."

                               TRINITY

          "I want you to know how much faith I have in you."

                                 NEO

              "Oh. And this requires acts of insanity?"

TRINITY smiles. She looks him up and down. She moves intimately close.

                    "So, you really are Superman."

                                 NEO

                     "Only when Im plugged in."

 TRINITY steps away. NEO grabs her shoulder and turns her to him. He
                              attempts a

     kiss, but she turns her face, letting it land on her cheek.

                                 NEO

                               "What?"

              TRINITY looks at him, then up at the sky.

                               TRINITY

                   "Its not you. Just, not here."

           NEO doesnt understand. TRINITY rolls her eyes.

                               TRINITY

  "Theyre watching us, you big dope. Do you know how horny computer
                             geeks get?"


INT. MAIN BRIDGE

CHOI,  RAZOR,  DUJOUR, and  CIRCA  are sitting  around  the operators
console, feet up, eating. On the screens are patchy images of  TRINITY
and NEO standing together in  the GLADE. Its like theyre  watching a
soap opera.

TRINITY and NEO are looking in their direction.

ON THE interface chairs, the bodies of TRINITY and NEO lay supine.


EXT. GLADE (CONSTRUCT)

                    TRINITY grabs NEO by the arm.

                               TRINITY

                             "Over here."

                   SHE leads him into the shadows.


INT. MAIN BRIDGE

THE VOYEURISTIC crewmembers collectively groan as the lovers disappear
off the screen and into the darkness.

RAZOR puts his hand on CIRCAS shoulder and sighs.

                                RAZOR

                            "So romantic."

CIRCA calmly pats his hand and removes it, holding it in front of him.

                                CIRCA

    "Im sure Mary Palmer will appreciate your mood more than I."


EXT. GLADE (CONSTRUCT)

IN the blue twilight shade, NEO and TRINITY kiss tentatively,  slowly,
then quicker as  they give in  to their feelings  for one another.  WE
move around them slowly, then pan into the shadows, a natural fadeout.


INT. OFFICE (MATRIX)

AGENTS  JONES and  BROWN sit  across from  each other,  a steel  table
between them.  They stare  at each  other for  what seems  like a long
time. There is a speaker phone in the middle of the table amidst  neat
stacks of file folders.

                             AGENT JONES

                      "Our defeat is worrisome."

                             AGENT BROWN

                  "As is the loss of our colleague."

  THEY ARE BOTH seething with anger. AGENT JONES grinds his molars.

                                JONES

            "We cant defeat them. You saw what happened."

                                JONES

              "We have a backup copy of Agent Smith..."

 JONES stands and walks toward the massive panoramic window. The city
                         spreads before him.

                                JONES

"A backup is not good enough. We need to upgrade ourselves to meet the
                             new threat."

                   BROWN opens a large file folder.

                                BROWN

   "Hes being rebuilt. But I have an alternate plan. Why fight the
             humans, when we can let them fight for us?"

                                JONES

 "The terrorists have learned to bend our reality in ways we cannot.
                  This was the cause of our defeat."

                                BROWN

 "Mr. Thomas J. Anderson is not unique. Over the decades, many humans
 have developed... techniques for manipulating the Matrix. Techniques
     too primitive for us to understand. Most never realize their
potential, but all the ones weve noticed exhibiting these talents are
                           recorded here."

ANGLE ON the book as BROWN flips through. Street shots of people  from
all walks of life. Young rebels, corporate suits, junkies, housewives.

                     JONES turns on AGENT BROWN.

                                JONES

                    "Do you have anyone in mind?"

ANGLE ON the book. It stops  on a page dedicated to someone  who looks
like NEO, but with long hair and an extremely bad attitude. There  are
photos of him on  a motorcycle with a  blonde, photos of him  drinking
with his gang friends.

                                BROWN

  "Gregory Lowfield. He exhibits the traits we saw in Mr. Anderson."

                          MANS VOICE (O.S.)

  "Mr. Anderson no longer exists. Our enemy now is the one called...
                               NEO."

                          ANGLE ON: THE DOOR

AGENT SMITH walks in, grinning. There  is a new swag to his  walk, and
his hair is longer, tied back.

                                BROWN

                       "Youve been recreated."

SMITH flexes his arm, examines his hands, and feels his hair.

                                JONES

                      "And you have more hair."

SMITH turns to him, examines the photos on the table. They lock  eyes.
On  the same  wavelength, they  transfer knowledge  without speaking.
SMITH looks at the photo on the table.

                                SMITH

    "I know what youre thinking. What we need is our own Neo..."

                                JONES

                         "If its possible."

                                SMITH

                       "Ill make it possible."

WE ZOOM in on the grainy photo of NEOs doppledanger. Quiet at  first,
growing  louder as  it grows  dark, we  here the  rumble and  roar of
motorcycles.


EXT. DESERT HIGHWAY (NIGHT)

FAR OFF  in the  distance, the  glow of  motorcycle headlights  racing
toward us. As we zoom out and focus in, they are already too close  to
avoid.  They  rip  by  us, thundering  explosions  and  men  and women
cheering.

THE pack of about ten bikers and their women dont wear helmets.  They
fly down the highway using both lanes, drinking and driving with total
abandon.


ANGLE ON the lead  motorcycle, a massive, custom-made  Harley. GREGORY
LOWFIELD, Thomas J. Anderson without  a desk job, without cares,  revs
his bike and locks  the accelerator. He hands  his beer to the  blonde
who rides behind him, then, in one swift motion, jumps up on his seat,
leaning into the slipstream.

                       The feat is IMPOSSIBLE.

HIS GIRLFRIEND,  CHANDRA, screams  at him  as she  grasps the seat and
lowers herself to the bike.

                               CHANDRA

                    "Greg, are you fucking crazy?"

                                 GREG

                       "Yes. But dont worry."

She clings to  his legs as  they barrel down  the highway. They  blast
pass a darkened cruiser.


INT. CRUISER

The cop sets his paper down just long enough to catch a glimpse of the
pack exploding down the highway, with GREGORY surfing his bike.

ANGLE ON: the radar gun. Its flashing 125 MPH

                                 COP

                    "Holy shit. Drunk ass punks."


EXT. HIGHWAY

GREGORY is facing us as he  drops back into his seat, taking  his beer
on cue from CHANDRA. Behind them, the cops lights flare up.

                               GREGORY

              "Oh boy. Stop, stop, lets have some fun."


INT. COP CAR

WE look  through the  windshield as  the cop  drives down the highway,
calling in his  stop-vehicle report. He  suddenly sees something  that
makes him slam on the brakes.

                                 COP

                             "Holy shit!"

ANGLE THROUGH the  cops windshield. The  ten bikers, with  GREGORY at
their center, are  parked in the  middle of the  road, looking at  him
casually."


EXT. ROAD

THE cruiser comes to  a stop mere inches  from GREGORYS leg. The  COP
bursts out of the door.

                                 COP

                    "What the hell are you doing?"

                               GREGORY

 "Well tell you when to stop, little man. Not the other way around."

                                 COP

                               "Fuck."

HE DIVES back into his cruiser, reaching for the radio. GREGORY  pulls
a huge silver .44 from his jacket and FIRES. The cruisers antenna  is
blown off at the  base, and the nine-foot  whip flips onto the  ground
with a metallic clang.


INT. CRUISER

The COP is  lying half-on the  seat, taking cover.  The handset relays
only static. He reaches for his gun, but is frozen by Gregorys voice.

                               GREGORY

  "Dont try anything stupid, man. I gotta bead on your donut-eating
                                ass."


EXT. CRUISER

                 The cop comes out with his hands up.

                                 COP

                       "Whaddya want with me?"

                               GREGORY

"I dont know. I just thought Id find out what you wanted without you
                shooting at me. So, what do you want?"

THE COP is a tough one. Far taller than GREGORY, muscular and serious.

                                 COP

                      "Youre all under arrest."

THE PACK explodes with laughter. GREGORY walks up to the policeman and
circles him, keeping the gun pointed in the business direction.

                               GREGORY

 "This is your lucky day, officer. Were gonna give you a night off."

CHANDRA walks up to him. Seductively, she hands him the bottle of hard
liquour.

                               CHANDRA

                               "Drink."

WHEN  he  pauses,   GREGORY  places  the   gun  against  his   temple.
Reluctantly, the big cop starts to gulp down the alcohol.

GREGORY lowers the gun. He and CHANDRA return to their motorcycle.

                               GREGORY

                    "You never even saw us, man."

                               CHANDRA

                          "Keep the bottle."

THEY start their bikes and are gone, like ghosts, into the shadows  of
the road.

                                                               CUT TO:


EXT. BEACH

A CAMPFIRE blazes only a few  feet away from the high tide.  A billion
stars shine overhead as GREGORY and his biker gang, including the cop,
sit or  lie around  the fire.  A few  people are  still awake, and one
picks drunkenly at a guitar.

GREGORY stands,  throws a  blanket over  his shoulder,  and scoops  up
CHANDRA. They make their way into the dunes.


EXT. DUNES

GREGORY  and  CHANDRA  lie  on  the  blanket,  staring  at  the   sky.
Inexplicably, GREGROY holds a hand toward the sky.

                               GREGORY

                       "Which one do you want?"

                               CHANDRA

                    "Any one. It doesnt matter."

WITH his hand pointed lazily at the sky, a single star starts  glowing
stronger  and stronger.  It vibrates,  then fades  suddenly and  comes
loose from the sky, and becomes a meteorite, burning across the sky.

        CHANDRA draws closer to him, enraptured by his power.

                               CHANDRA

                     "How do you do it, Gregory?"

                               GREGORY

   "I dont know. Sometimes it feels like... Im reaching beyond the
                               world."

HIS hand drops and his head turns. He sits up, startled by something.

                               CHANDRA

                            "What is it?"

            GREGORY holds up a hand for her to be silent.

                               GREGORY

                 "They found us. Cant you hear it?"

                               CHANDRA

                    "What? I dont hear anything."

                               GREGORY

  "We can only rebel so long. We can only push until they will hit
                                back."

                               CHANDRA

                     "They? The Men in Black?"

CU on GREGORY. In the distance, the faintest sound of a helicopter can
                      be heard, growing louder.

                               GREGORY

                      "Fuck! Get to the bikes."


EXT. CAMPFIRE

GREGORY bursts over the hill, holding hands with CHANDRA as they  run.
Hes only had  time to through  on his boots  and boxers and  grab his
.44. Chandra is  dressed only in  her underwear and  Gregorys leather
jacket.

                               GREGORY

            "Wake up! Get on your bikes and fucking ride!"

HIS gang burst to their feet. They scramble through the dunes, heading
for their bikes.

A HELICOPTER, seen only by its massively strong search lamp, and  the
wind from its  rotors blowing sand  everywhere, flies up  and over the
dunes, buzzing the running pack, blowing some off their feet.

GREGORY mounts his bike and CHANDRA jumps on back. WITH A WAVE OF  HIS
HAND, all  the bikes,  his included,  drop into  neutral and  rev into
start. Their  headlights blaze  as the  helicopter returns,  joined by
another.

                         CHOPPER LOUDSPEAKER

       "THIS IS THE POLICE, STOP YOUR VEHICLES AND SURRENDER!"

SUDDENLY, automatic fire sparks from the unseen helicopters. A  bullet
trail stitches its way  across a pair of  bikers, sending them to  the
ground as the helicopters fly overhead.

GREGORY cranks down on the throttle and his bike explodes ahead.


EXT. HIGHWAY

THE pack splits  up in two  directions as the  distant choppers circle
back. GREGORY cuts the lights on  his bike and follows the highway  by
starlight.


INT. HELICOPTER COCKPIT

TINNY RADIO chatter fills the  red-lit cockpit over the steady  hum of
the  engines. The  nose of  the chopper  points to  the ground  as  it
focuses on GREGORY and CHANDRA, who are ripping down the highway.

CU on the cockpit instruments, centered on the airspeed indicator. The
needle is pushing to the max, going through 150 knots.

                             PILOT (V.O.)

                   "Holy shit, hes outrunning us."

                                                               CUT TO:


EXT. HIGHWAY

GREGORY is pasted down to the  tank of his bike with CHANDRA  gripping
him for her life. The slipstream pulls his lips open and tears  streak
from his eyes as his bike redlines in fifth gear. The helicopters grow
smaller behind them. They break chase.

CHANDRA looks back and sees the lights turn away. She screams over the
wind and the roar.

                               CHANDRA

                           "Theyre gone!"

               GREGORY is staring down a dark highway.

                               GREGORY

                          "Cant see shit."

HE turns the headlights  back on, just in  time to see a  ROADBLOCK of
heavy duty military trucks. In front  of the trucks is a sandbag  wall
manned by soldiers. The trucks are flanked by police cars. And if  one
looks closely enough, they  can see a pair  of AGENTS standing to  the
side.

THE stunned soldiers have time to fire off a couple shots as they  run
frantically to get  out of the  way of the  bike, 800 pounds  of metal
flying at 150 miles per hour.

GREGORY  plows  into the  sandbag  wall, directly  between  two parked
trucks. The wall parts in  an explosion of sand and  sandbags. THEYRE
THROUGH, but the bike scissors  uncontrollably, until it rolls and  we
drop into bullet-time.

AS the bike goes  over, we watch from  the side as GREGORY  dismounts,
grabbing CHANDRA as he  steps over onto the  safe side of the  bike. A

massive shower of sparks bursts and trails the bike. It tumbles like a
bullet  falling  through syrup,  and  GREGORY keeps  walking  over the
rotating surface, using  the bike to  protect him and  CHANDRA against
the flesh-ripping concrete.

THE bike is coming apart  as its bashed against the  concrete. Pieces
rise slowly into the air -  the front wheel, the forks, the  mufflers,
and a million flakes  of metal, until the  body bounces into the  air,
carrying GREGORY  and CHANDRA  up. Holding  her to  him - shes barely
conscious of the lightning-fast  crash, GREGORY rides the  flying body
with one hand on the frame. It comes crashing down and back into  real
time.


THE  bikes body  streaks along  the highway.  The sparks  fade as  it
slows, and pieces of metal come clanging and banging down around them.
They  stop,  crouching  atop the  body,  with  GREGORY crouching  over
CHANDRA. The disembodied front wheel rolls past them.

STUNNED,  not quite  understanding how  or what  he just  did, he  and
CHANDRA stand and start running. BEHIND  them is a blurry wall of  red
and blue lights. POLICE SIRENS grow louder.

THEY start running down the  highway, then GREGORY yanks CHANDRA  to a
stop.

                               GREGORY

                   "Split up, into the desert, go!"

                             THEY split.

CU on CHANDRA. In bare feet, she sprints for the side of the road. The
highway is  littered with  pieces of  the bike,  and she  stomps on  a
twisted piece of metal  that impales her bare  foot. She falls to  the
asphalt with a scream.

GREGORY turns  and rushes  back to  her, even  as a  police cruiser is
bearing down on them, its V-8 roaring and the siren IMPOSSIBLY LOUD.

GREGORY drops  to her  side, only  to look  up into  the blinding high
beams. He  drops over  CHANDRA, ducks  his head  and extends  his hand
toward the oncoming cruiser and we drop back into BULLET TIME.

THE CRUISER  runs into  his hand  and stops  as though  it hit a steel
post. The hood crumples  in the center, pushing  the grill in even  as
the front quarter  panels of the  unibody continue around  GREGORY and
CHANDRA.


INT. CRUISER

THE ENGINE smashes in through  the console, pushing the cops  apart as
the glass windshield explodes and  their seats slide forward into  the
console, smashing them like jelly.


CU: GREGORY AND CHANDRA

WITH  HIS  HAND  still  on  the  grille,  CHANDRA  AND  GREGORY remain
untouched, even as the entire police cruiser rips around them. WE drop
back into REAL  time and see  the cruisers body  rip over and  around
them. The grille and engine block and part of the mangled transmission
remain still against  GREGORYS HAND. The  cruiser was gutted,  like a
banana shot down the center from top to bottom. It speeds beyond them,
silent now, flips and explodes.

THE ENGINE block is suspended a few  feet in the air. It drops to  the
ground with a thud.

GREGORY and CHANDRA get to their  feet and run into the early  morning
desert.


CU: GUTTED CRUISER

UNBELIEVABLY, the driver is still alive... barely. The steering  wheel
is smashed deep  into his mouth,  splitting his jaw  open. Wet, broken
chokes emanate from his blood-filled mouth. His eyes flicker, and just
before they close forever, his body is seized by pain as he MORPHS.


EXT. GUTTED CRUISER

THE CRUMPLED DOOR is knocked out  of the frame. WE SEE a  black loafer
step from the vehicle and a man in an immaculate black suit steps  out
slowly.

WE rise  up from  the loafer.  As the  other cruisers  catch up to the
scene of the accident, AGENT BROWN watches. He looks into the desert.

                A POLICE lieutenant approaches BROWN.

                              LIEUTENANT

                       "Sir, should we pursue?"

                             AGENT BROWN

 "Withdraw your men and pursue the others. We have our own plans for
                              this one."


INT. MAIN BRIDGE (NIGHT)

The ship is  quiet. RAZOR sits  at the operator  console, smashing the
keyboard as he forces Tetris pieces into place.


INT. COCKPIT

CHOI is sipping coffee as he nudges the ship to a stop. He speaks into
his headphones.

                                 CHOI

                          "OK, try it here."


INT. MAIN BRIDGE

RAZOR halts his video game playing and flashes to a different  screen.
Lines of code come pouring down the screen as he types, then hits  the
ENTER key with a flourish. The screen flashes, and the familiar scroll
of the MATRIX cascades down the screens.

                                RAZOR

                             "Holy shit."

                             RAZOR (V.O.)

      "No fucking shit I got signal. Dude, theyre changing it."

                           CHOI is annoyed.

                                 CHOI

                "Are you using the right pulse wave?"

                                                               CUT TO:

THE  MATRIX  scroll  pours  down  at  a  streaking  pace.  Its almost
impossible to make out the individual characters.

                      CHOI comes up behind RAZOR

                                 CHOI

                    "Oh my God. What are they - "

                    "Theyre changing the Matrix."

ITS dark, but  quiet classical music  can be heard.  Hes not in  bed
alone. NIOBES shaded form can be made out behind him.

MORPHEUS sounds awake,  but looks anything  but. He grabs  the buzzing
handset only an arms length from him.

                               MORPHEUS

                             "Im here."

                                RAZOR

                   "Sir, you gotta get down here."

MORPHEUS starts  dressing as  he talks.  He puts  a reasurring hand on
NIOBES shoulder.

                               MORPHEUS

                          "Proximity alarm?"

                                RAZOR

             "The Matrix, sir. The coding is going nuts."

                               MORPHEUS

                          "Be right there."

MORPHEUS hangs  up the  phone and  jumps into  his boots.  He turns to
NIOBE as he works.

                               MORPHEUS

    "It sounds bad. Theyre readjusting quicker than we thought."

                 NIOBE jumps up and dresses quickly.

                                NIOBE

                              "Already?"

                               MORPHEUS

          "It appears that they are learning their lessons."

                        NIOBE shakes her head.

           "Morpheus, how much are you going to tell him?"

                           MORPHEUS pauses.

                               MORPHEUS

            "Tell Neo? About his predecessors, I suppose?"

                        NIOBE, dressed, nods.

                               MORPHEUS

                           "He is the -"

                   NIOBE puts a finger to his lips.

                                NIOBE

                   "Six came before him, Morpheus."

                   MORPHEUS shakes his head slowly.

                               MORPHEUS

"To me, none came before him. The Oracle told me I would find the one.
          It is prophecy. You havent seen what he can do."

                                NIOBE

       "What if they toughen the Matrix code, like last time?"

                               MORPHEUS

 "There are lots of ifs. How about this one: What if we lose faith in
                             our cause?"

  HE disappears through the door, leaving Niobe standing in the dim
                                light.


INT. MAIN BRIDGE

                 MORPHEUS leans over RAZOR and CHOI.

                               MORPHEUS

                            "Talk to me."

                                RAZOR

         "Not good, boss, I gotta compile a new descrambler."



                            MORPHEUS nods.

                               MORPHEUS

                  "Do it. Were at broadcast depth?"

                                 CHOI

                              "Yes sir."

                               MORPHEUS

"We have to download our mission specs. Move aside, I have to log into
                           the mainframe."

MORPHEUS  takes  over  RAZORS  seat.  The  scrolling  code disappears,
replaced by the small words: ZION.dtr1.mnfr4m3 LOGON.

MORPHEUS pushes  the keyboard  under the  console so  its hidden  from
view. He taps at the  keyboard. Hidden password appears on  the screen
in the form of: XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX.

              SCREEN: LOGON ACCEPTED. WELCOME, MORPHEUS.

                     MISSION SPECS DOWNLOADING...

                              DOWNLOADED

                           LOGOUT COMPLETE

               MISSION TYPE: INFILTRATION / DESTRUCTION

                       TARGET: MATRIX MAINFRAME

MORPHEUS eyes open slightly when he reads the screen, but he  regains
his  composure  quickly. RAZORS  mouth  drops open,  and  CHOI starts
cracking up.

                                 CHOI

"The mainframe? Haha. Its a joke, right Morpheus? Is today April 1^st
                                  ?"

                      NIOBE appears behind them.

                                NIOBE

        "Its not a joke. We have The One. We must do it now."

                                RAZOR

  "But theyre altering the code already. I cant even read it yet."

                    MORPHEUS turns and faces them.

                               MORPHEUS

 "We have our mission, but its up to us to interperate how well do
                                 it."

                                RAZOR

 "Morpheus, theres more ice in front of that mainframe than there is
           in Antarctica. Well never cut through it all."

                               MORPHEUS

                "You havent seen The One in action."

            RAZOR looks dubious, and turns to the screens.

                               MORPHEUS

                          "Can you hack in?"

RAZOR pounds the keys. The Matrix disappears, replaced by his program.

                                RAZOR

   "Getting you in is no problem. Maintaining the input/output and
helping you is the problem. Thats how they killed savior number four,
 if I remember right. They cut the signal and trapped him in there."

MORPHEUS spins the chair, then stops it. Their faces are inches apart.

                               MORPHEUS

                    "We dont speak of the past."

                                RAZOR


          "Excuse me for dragging up painful memories, sir."

HE turns the chair back to the screen and continues coding.


CUT TO: NEO

Hes standing at  the edge of  some equipment on  the Main Deck.  Hes
heard every word. He rounds the corner. The others catch sight of him.
The same thought is on everyone's mind: How much had he heard.

                               MORPHEUS

"Morning. Niobe, wake the rest of the crew. Razor, whats the ETA for
                        getting us in there?"

                        RAZOR shakes his head.

                                RAZOR

 "I dunno. Just gimme an hour, Ill probably have caught up to them."

                      MORPHEUS walks up to NEO.

                               MORPHEUS

                           "Come with me."


                                                               CUT TO:

EXT. DESERT (DAY)

FROM FAR AWAY, we see GREGORY and CHANDRA hiding under the only bit of
shade available for miles, a tiny outcropping of rock. We sail in  and
cut to a panning shot, scanning over the harsh ground, onto  CHANDRAS
feet, clad in Gregorys boots, up her sun-scorched and scratched legs.
Shes collapsed onto Gregory. Hes in equally bad shape. Gregory leans
with his back against the rock, eyes opening and closing as he  drifts
in and out of sleep.

                             GREGORY POV

He  stars at  the horizon  and the  mirages of  water reflecting  the
jaundiced yellow sky. In the  shimmering distance, a man appears,  but
Gregorys lids  shut and  we see  darkness. When  he reopens them, the
figure is more clear. Its a man, dressed in a black suit. Even in the
distance we can recognize him. We want it to be him.


EXT. DESERT ROCK

GREGORY  can  barely come  to  his senses  as  the figure  approaches.
CHANDRA doesnt even wake.


EXT. DESERT

We follow the figure at waist heigh as it approaches GREGORY. It comes
to a stop just in front of him.


EXT. DESERT ROCK

GREGORY is fully  awake, but he  thinks hes dreaming.  He reaches out
and pokes the black-clad leg of the immaculate man standing before him
- a man who doesnt sweat even in the sauna heat. He looks up, but the
glaring sun obscures the face.

           GREGORYs voice is raspy as he starts to speak.

                               GREGORY

                     "Oh my God. Its... The Man."

                             MAN IN BLACK

      "Ive been searching for you for a long time, my friend."

                       GREGORY lowers his head.

                             MAN IN BLACK

                       "We need you, Gregory."

                               GREGORY

                             "What for?"

                             MAN IN BLACK

                         "To save our world."

GREGORYS FACE  RAISES, THE  MAN IN  BLACK eclipses  the sun  with his
head, making a hallo of hazy sunlight around an all-too familiar face:
AGENT SMITH.

GREGORYS head drops back down. He strokes CHANDRAS hair.

                               GREGORY

                     "Its too late. Were dead."

                             AGENT SMITH

                        "Do you want to live?"

                               GREGORY

                             "What for?"

                             AGENT SMITH

   "A better life for all. Life for her. And for you, a chance for
                              revenge."

                       GREGORY raises his head.



AGENT SMITH grins. He turns away, and the desert landscape before them
turns into a soothing, cool,  crystal forest lake. Smith takes  a step
toward it, then turns and extends his hand.

                             AGENT SMITH

                            "Interested?"

GREGORY  is  mystified.  Speechless, he  drags  himself  to his  feet,
hoisting Chandra, and steps toward the lake.

                               GREGORY

                        "This cant be real."

           HE steps forward, only to have the image recede.

                             AGENT SMITH

                        "You this, dont you?"

                               GREGORY

                                "Yes."

                             AGENT SMITH

                         "Will you help us?"

                               GREGORY

                             "Anything."

CU:  SMITH  extends his  hand.  GREGORY grasps  it.  He lets  go,  and
collapses into the cool shallow waters of the lake edge.


EXT. LAKE SHORE

THE  DESERT  is  gone,  replaced by  forest,  though  still  under the
poisoned sky of the Matrix.

GREGORY laps  the water  up, and  pulls CHANDRA  in, rubbing the water
over her face. Calmly, AGENT SMITH stands on the lake shore.

CU:  AGENT SMITH.  The humans  are reflected  in his  perfectly still
glasses.

CHANDRA  stirs and  awakens, though  she doesnt  seem to  see  SMITH.
GREGORY,  revitalized, looks  around at  the miracle,  and up  at the
mystery man.

                               GREGORY

                       "Who the fuck are you?"

                       SMITH grins devilishly.

                             AGENT SMITH

  "Im nobody. A Smith. Whats more important, is you. We need you,
                              Gregory."

GREGORY stares. He pulls CHANDRA ashore and stands to look AGENT SMITH
in the eyes.

                               GREGORY

             "First you try to kill me. Now you need me."

                             AGENT SMITH

   "Two years ago, Gregory, your parents were killed in a terrorist
                  attack in the heart of the city."

             THE words spark something nasty in GREGORY.

                               GREGORY

                              "So what?"

                             AGENT SMITH

          "The terrorists were led by a certain individual."

                               GREGORY

                         "I know who it was."

                             AGENT SMITH

                      "We need you to kill him."

GREGORY laughs he turns to CHANDRA  to check on her. Shes passed  out
on the smooth grass.

                               GREGORY

"What a bunch of bullshit. The whole government cant kill him, so how
                               can I?"

                             AGENT SMITH

           "No one in the government can do what you can."

                               GREGORY

                             "Fuck you."

                             AGENT SMITH

                     "I believe we have a deal."

           GREGORY stands and puts his face next to SMITHS

 "You know, Ive always wanted to fuck the devil on a deal. And this
     looks like a once-in-a lifetime opportunity. So, FUCK YOU!"

SMITH frowns. GREGORY looks him up and down. Hes got a few inches and
pounds on the smaller agent.

                               GREGORY

  "What are you gonna do, little man? You looking for a trip to the
fucking hospital? Fuck with me and youll be looking for some plastic
                           surgery, you - "

SMITH delivers a  chest punch that  sends GREGORY sailing  back twenty
feet. He tumbles to a stop, coughs, and stares in disbelief at  SMITH,
standing calmly at what seems like an impossible distance away.

CU: SMITH. HE removes his glasses calmly.

CU: GREGORY. He was stunned, but hes  not out of the fight. Not by  a
long shot.

                               GREGORY

                        "No man can beat me."

                                SMITH

                        "Bring it on, pussy."

                    Pull back as he CHARGES SMITH

SMITH is ready to deflect the  blow, but GREGORY dodges and bowls  him
over, barroom style.  With SMITH pinned  below him, he  slams his palm
downward. SMITHS head dodges the blow that pummels the ground.

GREGORY is  screaming as  he smashes  downward with  the palms  of his
heels. Every blow misses the mark.

                               GREGORY

                   "Mother fucker, what the fu -?"

SMITH bucks up, throwing GREGORY into the air. He flips onto his  back
as GREGORY returns. The  sheer force of his  street-forged roundhouses
knock SMITH around  as he blocks.  Growing irritated at  the untrained
attack, SMITH turns a block into a palm-heel that hits GREGORY in  the
forehead with  the force  of a  cannon blast.  Momentarily stunned, he
steps back enough for SMITH to perform a roundhouse kick. Its like  a
helicopter blade, smashing into GREGORYS head and sending him to  the
ground in a heap.

                                SMITH

                     "Ready to change your mind?"

CU: GREGORY

HE cant  respond very  well. Blood  fills his  mouth and  his face is
mashed. A huge welt grows under  the loafer mark left by SMITH  on the
right side of his face.

                    SMITH crouches down by GREGORY

                                SMITH

               "I can teach you to beat me, you know."

                       THIS interests GREGORY.

                                SMITH

       "Help us, and both you and her will be free afterward."

GREGORY  stares  at the  ground,  then gazes  past  SMITH at  CHANDRA.
Finally, he starts to rise. SMITH offers a hand, and GREGORY takes it.

                                SMITH

"You know it, dont you? That theres more to your world than what you
              can see, what you can rationally explain?"

                               GREGORY

                               "Yeah."

                                SMITH

"Im going to teach you how to use the powers you cant even imagine.
               But first, you need to learn to fight."

SMITH puts his hand to his earpiece. GREGORYS eyes close and his body
SPASMS. He falls to the ground, breathless, and when his eyes open, he
stares up at SMITH.

                               GREGORY

                       "Holy shit. What the -"

HE stares at his hands. He sits up, and watches his hands, amazed,  as
he goes through a series of  block-punches. He stops and stares up  at
SMITH.

                               GREGORY

                           I know Kung-Fu."

                             SMITH grins.


INT. COCKPIT (NIGHT)

MORPHEUS and  NEO sit  together. The  cockpit lights  are dimmed down,
only the EMP pulse button glows.  Outside the ship, in the dark  mists
of the underworld,  patches of eerie  phosphorescent moss glow  on the
walls. Occasionally, a squiddie will pass over the darkened ship.

           The two of them watch the deadly outside world.

                               MORPHEUS

                   "Were deep in their territory."

                                 NEO

                            "I see that."

 MORPHEUS stares out at the night, deep in thought. He turns to NEO.

                               MORPHEUS

                          "Are you rested?"

                                 NEO

                                "Yes."

                               MORPHEUS

              "You know now, that you had predecessors."

                                 NEO

                      "Yes. Ive heard things."

                               MORPHEUS

                       "What types of things?"

                                 NEO

  "That there were others, like me, who you thought were going to be
                  special. But they ended up dead."

                        MORPHEUS nods slowly.

                               MORPHEUS

   "Its true. There were others. And I didnt tell you right away.
                     Because you were not ready."

                              NEO nods.

                               MORPHEUS

                        "Does this anger you?"

                                 NEO

 "I dont know yet. So much has happened so fast, that I cant decide
 whether or not Im angry, or dissappointed, or even if I should be."

                               MORPHEUS

  "You shouldnt be, Neo. You are the key in the Oracles prophecy.
     Everything forseen to come to pass, has, except one thing."

                                 NEO

                               "What?"

                               MORPHEUS

                   "The destruction of The Matrix."

                MORPHEUS looks out into the darkness.

                               MORPHEUS

 "Your coming was heralded, and it is my destiny to prepare the world
  for you, and to baptize you by fire. But from here on out, no one
                               knows."

                                 NEO

                       "Can we ask The Oracle."

                               MORPHEUS

                         "Not in this life."

                           NEO is confused.

                               MORPHEUS

  "No one has heard from her or her priestesses since the day Cypher
                            turned on us."

                         NEO is taken aback.

                                 NEO

           "But she must have known, if they came to her."

                               MORPHEUS

                          "Perhaps she did."

                         NEO shakes his head.

                                 NEO

"I cant believe it. I dont know, Morpheus, if Im prepared for this
        war. Im not a soldier. How, how are we going to win?"

                               MORPHUES

   "For decades, we have fought force-on-force, in the real world,
 without a conclusion. Now, after nearly a century of war, were at a
standstill. The only way that we can see to win is by destroying their
source of energy. We have to pull the plug on them. We must crash the
                               Matrix."

                        MORPHEUS grins slyly.

                               MORPHEUS

  "Remember, when I told you, that Ill show you how deep the rabbit
                             hole goes?"

                                 NEO

                                "Yes."

                               MORPHEUS

 "I brought you deep, yet I no longer know the way. No one does. With
 every second we sink deeper than before. You are our guiding light,
now. Your powers exceed mine a millionfold. I have shown you the path
                  to victory, Neo. Lead us down it."


INT. MAIN DECK

MORPHEUS, NEO, TRINITY, CHOI, and  NIOBE are on the chairs  as theyre
being JACKED IN by CIRCA and RAZOR.

CUT TO: RAZOR jumps in the  operators chair, his hands blur over  the
touchscreens and keyboard as he drops his crewmates into the Matrix.

                           MORPHEUS (O.S.)

            "Were going straight for the throat, people."

ANGLE ON: RAZOR and CIRCA  typing like made at their  keyboards. RAZOR
hits the ENTER  key. They look  on, transfixed with  anticipation. The
screaming Matrix code grinds to a readable halt. The slap each others
hands and continue hacking.

                           MORPHEUS (O.S.)

"We have the advantage of surprise. They wont expect us to return so
                                soon."


INT. ABANDONED WAREHOUSE

THE FIVE  of them  stand, immobile,  around a  ringing phone  as their
minds filter in to their body images. They are dressed practically  in
denim  and leather,  like blue  collar workers.  Their dress  wouldnt
attract the slightest  bit of attention,  except for the  padded coats
and tote bags filled with firepower.


INT. MAIN BRIDGE

                                CIRCA

 "Keep your eyes out for changes, theyre modifying things. Dial 0
                            for operator."


INT. ABANDONED WAREHOUSE

                 MORPHEUS holds his celly to his ear.

                             CIRCA (O.S.)

                        "And have a nice day."

        HE drops the phone into his pocket. They turn to him.

                               MORPHEUS

"Niobe, youre the liasion to our operators. Neo, what do you have for
                            a game plan?"

                                 NEO

                      "Where is the mainframe?"

                               MORPHEUS

                      "The Metacortex building."

                           NEOs jaw drops.

                                 NEO

               "What the fuck? Thats where I worked."

                                 CHOI

 "And what do you think you were doing there, writing code for video
                games? You were working for The Man."

                               TRINITY

   "Its true, Neo. Metacortex employs humans to write code for the
                               Matrix."

                                 NEO

           "I thought I was working on a fucking database."

                               MORPHEUS

  "They keep the left hand from seeing what the right hand is doing.
 Thats how an evil system can be made by innocent people. But, that
                           doesnt matter."

                            NEO recovers.

                                 NEO

"How bout this? I just walk up to the Metacortex building and blow it
                                 up?"

                             CHOI laughs.

                                 CHOI

                      "What, by power of will?"

        NEO nods. CHOIS smile fades. He looks to the others.

                                 CHOI

                         "Hes joking right?"

                      MORPHEUS shakes his head.

                               MORPHEUS

"Well fan out around the city, keeping an eye out for you. If youre
able to accomplish this mission, well phase back into the ship. Stay
 in contact. If you lose your cell, contact an operator immediately."


EXT. ABANDONED WAREHOUSE

THE five  of them  exit. They  blend into  the crowds  on the  street,
anonymous and  quiet. MORPHEUS  looks back  as NEO,  taller than most,
heads down the street.

                      NIOBE pauses next to him.

                                NIOBE

                            "What is it?"

                      MORPHEUS shakes his head.

                               MORPHEUS

     "Whats going to happen? If this is it, right now? The end?"

                                NIOBE

                       "I cant even imagine."

HE grins  and starts  to turn.  As he  does, his  profile matches  the
profile on  a WANTED  poster stuck  to the  wall. Its  a dark, grainy
picture of him, alongside photos of Neo, and Trinity.

                   POSTER: INTERNATIONAL TERRORISTS

              MORPHEUS glances at it, and continues on.


EXT. DOWNTOWN STREET

NEO walks  calmly, observing  the people  that filter  by. Men, women,
children, all oblivious to their true nature.

A dirty homeless whino, nose  explosion red with burst blood  vessels,
is  staggering  along  the  edge of  the  crowd,  unseen  and ignored.
Somehow, he catches NEOs eye.

                               HOMELESS

                      "Spare a quarter, buddy?"

                NEO shakes his head, but still stares.

ANGLE on  the HOMELESS.  He mutters  something, and  reaches into  his
shopping cart to  open a garbage  bag. Its filled  with twenty dollar
bills, thousands of them.

                                 NEO

                      "How bout a quarter mil?"

THE homeless  man is  astounded. As  he stands,  speechless, NEO fades
back into the crowd.


EXT. FOREST GLADE

SMITH and GREGORY fight in the glade. SMITH is always one step  ahead.
HE is a cruel  sensei, and doesnt pull  punches. But with every  blow
GREGORY takes, he rebounds and attacks again.

FINALLY, just as  he seems to  be gaining on  SMITH, he takes  a rapid
fire series  of blows,  and collapses  to the  ground, breathless  and
beaten.

                               GREGORY

                               "Fuck."

                          SMITH circles him.

                                SMITH

 "Pain is only weakness leaving your body. When you are sufficiently
                   strong, you will feel no pain."

                               GREGORY

   "Tell me about what is happening. Whats wrong with the world?"

                                SMITH

                         "Get up and fight."

GREGORY gets to his feet and takes a stance. SMITH stares at him  from
a relaxed poise. He slaps at GREGORY, who deflects the blow and  takes
a jab, nearly hitting SMITH on the chin. They circle.

                                SMITH

                     "The world is not for you."

              HE slaps, has it deflected, dodges a blow.

                               GREGORY

                         "What do you mean?"

                                SMITH

 "Youre not human, Gregory. Thats why you dont fit in. Thats why
                      you have certain powers."

    GREGORY takes a swipe. They engage, then push off one another.

                               GREGORY

                  "What, am I from planet Krypton?"

                                SMITH

  "Not quite. But as humans continue to evolve, some are developing
    capabilities beyond those of the average man. Reality-altering
 abilities. I have them. Others in the Agency have them. And you have
    them, too. Were all that stands between law and order, and a
       terrorist dictatorship lead by the one called Morpheus."

                   THEY stop fighting for a moment.

                                SMITH

   "We need you to stop the terror. We need you to save our world."



             IT sinks in. GREGORY is starting to believe.

                                SMITH

   "We need you, because youre better than me. Now push past your
 abilities. You can turn you imagination into reality. See your hands
        striking me, see yourself overcoming me. Fight, boy!"

SMITH comes at him, and GREGORY responds. Their fists and kicks are  a
fast, then turn  into a blur.  GREGORY cant believe  his own actions.
SMITH misses  a block,  and GREGORY  blows him  backward with  a chest
punch.

SMITH, recovering, looks up. GREGORY looks around. CHANDRA is gone.

                               GREGORY

                           "Where is she?"

SMITH stands. From behind his back he produces a baseball sized  glass
ball. He tosses it to GREGORY.

                                SMITH

                               "Here."

GREGORY looks in the ball.  Its a window to an  apartment overlooking
the city. Chandra is in bed, waking up.

                                SMITH

    "She doesnt remember our encounter. Shes fine. Dont worry."

                         THE BALL disappears.

                 SMITH puts his hand to his earpiece.


INT. OFFICE BUILDING

AGENT BROWN is staring down at  the ground. ACROSS THE STREET, NEO  is
walking toward his building.

                                BROWN

                             "Hes back."


EXT. FOREST GLADE

                                SMITH

              "Ill be there. Execute the defense plan."

                       SMITH turns to GREGORY.

                                SMITH

 "Come with me. But only watch. Youre not ready to engage in a fight
                           with the enemy."

                               GREGORY

                              "Why not?"

                                SMITH

   "Because if you havent defeated me yet, you wont defeat them."

                       SMITH snaps his fingers.


EXT. ROOFTOP

GREGORY  finds  himself  alone  on  the  top  of  the  MAKARAO  hotel,
overlooking METACORTEX PLAZA.


EXT. STREET

The METACORTEX building stands across  the street. NEO has been  along
this road a thousand times, but in another lifetime.

NEO raises one hand, palm pointed toward the building.

CUT TO:  NEOS  POV:  The  building  is  a  massive  tower of  glowing
shimmering energy, no more real than a three-dimensional polygon.


EXT. BUILDING ROOFTOP

MORPHEUS and NIOBE  stand atop a  building a few  blocks away, looking
toward the Metacortex building.

                             ANGLE on NEO

HE FIXES his gaze on the building, then lowers his head and closes his
eyes.

THE building tremors slightly, like  a heat mirage. Slowly, it  starts
moving downward.

ANGLE ON: the first  level. The exterior glass  disappears, vaporizing
in a million crystal shards that melt into the air, exposing the  hive
of office cubicles and corridors within.

The walls, desks and cubicles vaporize, leaving a few hundred  people
- office  workers, security,  maintenance men,  standing with  nothing
between them.

              The massive LOAD BEARING MEMBERS vaporize.

CUT TO: the bottom of the building. One can look straight through  the
entire  building.  WE go  through  the empty  building,  passing dazed
people, until we pass out the other side, and come to NEO.

HE looks up. The office  building is supported by nothing.  Slowly, it
descends on the stunned people. They rush, screaming, some laughing in
hysteria, before the ceiling can come down on them. The last few  flee
just before  the ceiling  touches the  ground. The  second floor melts
away just like the first.


EXT. BUILDING ROOFTOP

NIOBE and MORPHEUS  stare on in  amazement as the  building collapses,
floor by floor.

                                NIOBE

                           "Hes doing it."

                               MORPHEUS

                             "I knew it."


EXT. STREET

CHOI and  TRINITY look  up in  the air  at the  roof of the METACORTEX
building, standing beyond  a block of  buildings. It sinks  toward the
ground as a flood of people come screaming around the corner.

                                 CHOI

                       "It cant be this easy."

                               TRINITY

                         "Its not over yet."



                          MANS VOICE (O.S.)

                        "Not by a long shot."

CU: TRINITYS FACE. SOMEONE plants the barrel of a silver Desert Eagle
.45 against her temple. TRINITY  whips her head backward as  it fires.
We drop into BULLET TIME as the flame and concussion blossoms in front
of her face, ripping her sunglasses off as she drops backward, pulling
a pair of MAC-10 Uzis from under her jacket.

                THE MANS VOICE belongs to AGENT BROWN

CHOI turns,  pulling a  short weapon  from under  his coat. Its boxy,
with a short barrel the size of a soda can. He plants it in the  small
of BROWNS back and pulls the trigger.

A CONE  OF FIRE  burns straight  through brown,  blowing steam, flame,
smoke, vertebrae, and viscera out a massive hole in his stomach.

CU on the weapon. It recoils on tension coils, discharging a shell the
size of a 12-ounce soda can.

                              REAL TIME

What remains  of BROWN  flies forward.  CHOI helps  TRINITY up and the
retreat into the building and  take cover under a window.  Through the
window, we see military trucks, filled with troops, charging down  the
street, toward the Metacortex  plaza. After the trucks  come rumbling,
black-painted M1A2 ABRAMS tanks. A black APACHE HELICOPTER flies  over
the convoy.

CHOI looks through the window as he reloads his hand cannon.

                                 CHOI

                         "Holy fucking shit."

                               TRINITY

              "Weve stirred up the hornets nest now."


INT. METACORTEX OFFICE

AGENT SMITH and JONES stare  down into the plaza. The  building shakes
slightly as it descends.

FROM the three  streets that enter  the plaza, military  vehicles pour
in. Hundreds  of troops  discharge and  form a  L-shaped circle around
NEO. Tanks  rumble in,  and the  Apaches whirl  to a  hover. Panicking
civilians rush out of the kill zone.

NEO stands calmly, continuing his work.


EXT. ROOFTOP

MORPHEUS and NIOBE stare from the rooftop.


EXT. METACORTEX PLAZA

The air rumbles as the building continues to gently collapse. The  sky
flashes, and massive streaks of  lighting blast across it like  cracks
in reality.

CU: SOLDIERS

           They line their weapons on NEO. They are nervous

                               PRIVATE

                "This is impossible. Whats going on?"

                               SERGEANT

               "Just keep him in your sites, soldier."


INT. TANK TURRET

                           CU: TANK GUNNER

HIS eye is glued to the tank  site and his trigger finger on the  fire
button.

                            POV: TANK SITE

               The green crosshairs sit on NEOS chest.

                               CU: NEO

His eyes open, but the building continues to collapse. He stares up at
a mirrored window, and somehow, straight into the eyes of:

                           CU: AGENT SMITH

                                SMITH

                             "Open fire."

A WALL of flame and fingers of tracers bursts from the skirmish lines.
The tracers grow into a cone of orange flame bearing down on NEO as we
drop into bullet time.

THE bullets sizzle  as tracers burn  off their backs.  The draw toward
him like  slugs. Thousands  of bullets  fired at  perpendicular angles
close  in on  him. As  they draw  close to  one another  along almost
perpendicular paths, they tinkle and chime and bounce.

The bullets come to a stop, glowing as their tracers backs continue to
burn.  The world  is in  stop motion  as the  bullets stop,  turn 180
degrees, and  suddenly accelerate  back at  their origins.  Faster and
fast they fly, until we drop back into REAL TIME.

THE SKIRMISH line  of troops is  ripped apart by  a hail of  their own
bullets.

CU: MACHINE GUNNER. With an M-249 SAW, he blazes away at NEO, only  to
be shredded by his own bullets. A  private takes a shot at NEO, and  a
bullet slaps into his  shoulder. REALIZING whats happening,  he drops
his weapon.

THE SOLDIERS are dropping like flies. The firing quickly subsides.

NEO stands  alone in  the center,  unharmed. He  turns to the skirmish
lines.  THE  surviving soldiers  drop  their weapons,  and  run. Panic
ensues. Only a few officers, NCOs, and soldiers too amazed to think of
running remain.


INT. HELICOPTER COCKPIT

                  NEO is targeted on an LCD screen.

                                PILOT

                              "Fox One."


EXT. HELICOPTER WING

              CU: AGM-65 HELLFIRE GROUND-TO-AIR-MISSILE

The missile drops from its release claws and ignites, accelerating off
screen.

                        POV: HELLFIRE NOSE CAM

The missile flies  horizontally over the  plaza, then pitches  up, and
back down at NEO. He looks at it, and at the last second the nose goes
back up.


EXT. PLAZA

The missile swoops up over him, leaving him in its exhaust smoke.

                        POV: HELLFIRE NOSE CAM

THE missile banks,  panning across the  city, until it  locks onto the
helicopter from which it originated.


INT. HELICOPTER COCKPIT

THE missile bears down the chopper.

CU: PILOT

HES TOO stunned to move. Mouth agape, he can only watch as:


EXT. HELICOPTER

ITS BLOWN to  fiery pieces, and  comes tumbling down,  landing on the
street as soldiers and civilians flee.


INT. TANK TURRET

                            TANK COMMANDER

                               "Fire!"

                    THE GUNNER pulls the trigger.


EXT. M1A2 ABRAMS

WE drop into bullet time as a cone of fire - bigger than the tank  and
the shape of a  pine tree, blows out  of the barrel, pushing  the tank
back. From the fire streaks a  HEAT round, white hot, leaving a  laser
like tracer as it bears down on NEO.

                              REAL TIME

 THE TRACER stops in front of NEO, and out of the air the HEAT round
  appears. Suspended in air, it shakes with violence. It accelerates
        backwards, flying straight back into the tank barrel.


INT. TANK TURRET

THE gunner screams as the BREECH explodes, blocking our view.


EXT. TANK

The tanks explodes like a  60-ton hand grenade, plowing soldiers  onto
their faces, consuming the unlucky ones close to it, and throwing  the
30-ton turret straight up, 10 yards into the air. It rotates,  aflame,
and comes crashing down on a nearby commander and his radio man.


INT. METACORTEX OFFICE

THE  EXPLOSION shakes  the building.  The scene  below is  a complete
route. Black smoke billows up  from the flaming wrecks. The  remaining
tanks arent retreating  - the crews  are piling out  and running. The
Apache helicopters turn tail and run.

                             AGENT JONES

                      "The plan is not working."

                             AGENT SMITH

                              "No shit."

                     AGENT BROWN enters the room.

                             AGENT BROWN

                      "What about your protégé?"

                             AGENT SMITH

          "Hes not ready yet. Ill deal with this myself."

                             AGENT JONES

                        "You cant beat him."

                             AGENT SMITH

                 "Ive been altered. Im Smith, 2.0."

             AGENTS BROWN and JONES look at one another.

                              CU: SMITH

 HE clenches his teeth, as though hes girding himself for something.

                                SMITH

              "Kill the others. Ill take care of this."


INT. MAIN BRIDGE

RAZOR is at  his operator chair,  surrounded by consoles.  Some of the
Matrix code screens are in blue, others in red, at least one in green.
The code  on the  green screen  starts pouring  down at  an incredible
rate.

                                RAZOR

                               "Fuck."

                   HE hits something on the keypad.


EXT. ROOF

                     MORPHEUS answers his phone.


INT. MAIN BRIDGE

                                RAZOR

"Theyre about to pull something. Processing power is pouring into the
agent programs and theyre locking onto your 3-D grid displacements.


EXT. ROOF

                               MORPHEUS

             "Send through ghosts to confuse their lock."

                                RAZOR

                              "Got it."


INT. MAIN BRIDGE

THE GHOST program  is loaded. We  see 3-D images  of Morpheus and  the
others flash across the screen.


INT. OFFICE BUILDING

SMITH STANDS alone, his comrades have disappeared.

THE glass before him shimmers.


EXT. OFFICE

THE mirrored glass of Smiths office wavers, then explodes towards us.
SMITH jumps, and we pan down to follow his descent. He smacks into the
pavement on his feet in front of NEO.


EXT. METACORTEX PLAZA


SMITH STANDS, facing NEO, about two fighting distances away.

NEOs  concentration is  broken. The  METACORTEX building  comes to  a
shuddering halt.

                                 NEO

                            "Youre back."

CU: SMITH

                               He nods.

                                 NEO

                    "And you have a ponytail now."

AS we concentrate  on NEO, and  he concentrates on  SMITH, we can  see
more black suits marching up behind him.

NEO attacks SMITH. SMITH backs away slowly, blocking against a  losing
battle and taking hits. Meanwhile,  the MEN IN BLACK converge  on NEO.
Just as NEO  lands a smashing  blow on SMITHS  chin, three voices  at
once shout:

                                "HEY!"

NEO turns,  and SMITH  pushes him  hard in  the opposite  direction to
face:

THREE SMITHS! They attack at once, one going low and hard with a  knee
breaking sweep kick, the other punching NEO in the face, and the third
breaking to the  side and putting  his toe into  NEOs stomach with  a
vicious side-kick.

They attack  is in  perfect synch,  eight arms  and eight legs working
like clockwork, striking  their target without  getting in the  way of
each other. The attack slams NEO back, right into the first,  bloodied
SMITH. NEO slams into his shoving arms, and stops as though he  backed
into a  brick wall.  AGENT SMITH  grabs him  and holds  him in  a FULL
NELSON, exposing him  to his three  copies. The copies  shift position
and attack again. Two stand together, left shoulder to right, and with
their combined arms slam NEO in the face, then step apart as the third
comes in. The THIRD  grabs the shoulders of  the other two and  flips,
walking his loafers up NEOs  body, and kicking him from  below, right
up into  the chin  of his  jaw! It  snaps NEOs  back with  a spray of
blood.


EXT. ROOFTOP

MORPHEUS and NIOBE stare on as the fight rages.



MORPHEUS grips  the edge  of the  brick wall  edge. The stone crumbles
under the tension.

                               MORPHEUS

                         "We can only watch."


EXT. PLAZA

THE ASSAULT on NEO continues. He struggles, unable to concentrate long
enough to find a way to fight back.


INT. MAIN DECK

RAZOR bangs away at the keyboard.

                                RAZOR

"Four fucking agents, no wonder so much processing power is devoted to
                                them."


EXT. ROOF

A  BIRD flying  by NIOBE  and MORPHEUS  slows its  flight, slows  its
flapping, and freezes.

CU: MORPHEUS. A pink lightning  bolt freezes as it streaks  across the
sky, sealing the worlds light in an a light rouge.


EXT. CITY STREET

Near the  plaza, panicked  civilians slow,  and fall  to the ground as
though theyre passing out.


INT. MAIN DECK

          Razor stares at the data pouring down the screens.

                                RAZOR

                         "No goddamned way."

                        His headphone chimes.

                                RAZOR

                             "Operator."


EXT. ROOF

                       MORPHEUS is on the phone


                               MORPHEUS

                     "What the hells going on?"


INT. MAIN DECK

                                RAZOR

"Theyre putting all the coppertops to sleep. They froze the Matrix."

                               MORPHEUS

                                "Why?"

                                RAZOR

  "All processing power is being re-diverted to the agent program."

      NIOBE stands at the edge of the building and points down.

                                NIOBE

                          "Morpheus, look!"

    DOWN on the ground below them, theres a swarm of AGENT Smiths


EXT. STREET

The passed-out people stand, and one by one, MORPH into AGENT  SMITHS.
It happens over, and over,  until dozens, then hundreds, are  marching
on the plaza.


EXT. PLAZA

NEO reaches back and puts his hands on either side of SMITHS head. As
hes  being pummeled  from the  front, he  squeezes and  screams. His
screams are mixed with SMITHS. The agents head deforms as were hear
a sickening  crack. Suddenly,  the body  reverts back  to that  of the
original owner, a security guard, and the head simply EXPLODES.

THE  hold broken,  NEO stumbles  back over  the body,  with the  three
SMITHS in pursuit. He somersaults, comes up on his feet, and jumps  to
the left, putting one Smith in front of the other two. He attacks, his
killing blows destroying SMITH, smashing through his blocks. He falls,
and NEO takes on the other two, giving a kick jump that knocks both of
them away in one shot.

As he comes  down, a wall  of Smiths converges  from all sides.  They
stop, leaving a circle around him.

WE PAN BACK to view a sea of black-suited SMITHS flooding the plaza.

CU: NEO

AS  his hand  passes over  his face,  it is  refreshed, anew,  perfect
again. He surveys the wall-to-wall SMITHS.

SMITH talks with his voice, times a thousand.

                                SMITH

       "NEO, leave the Matrix. You know not what youre doing."

                                 NEO

                        "Well, is that right?"

HE turns  to the  METACORTEX building.  Its repairing,  growing steel
girders and concrete skin.

                         NEOs face darkens.

                                 NEO

                                "No!"

REALITY SHIMMERS as  his anger strikes  out at the  building. The tops
floors burn, and then explode.  The explosion rips down the  building,
slowing, slowing, then stopping.

THOUSANDS of SMITHS  are gazing up  at the building,  concentrating on
combating NEOs attack.


EXT. ROOF

GREGORY sees the building exploding,  and runs. He smashes through  an
access door.

INT. STAIRWAY

GREGORY hurtles down the stairs, one at a time.


EXT. METACORTEX BUILDING

THE building is frozen, mid-explosion.  TONS of pieces hanging in  the
air, suspended only by frozen tendrils  of fire and arms of smoke  and
debris.

THE SMITHS attack NEO. They fight  in a massive melee, dying in  mass.
Meanwhile, the METACORTEX building pulls back together, the damage and
flame disappearing as time/space around it is reversed.

                                                               CUT TO:


EXT. ROOFTOP

CU: AGENT BROWN

With  his hand  on his  ear piece,  he comes  out the  elevator door,
slowly. Pistol drawn, he looks around the corner.

MORPHEUS and NIOBE stand there, their backs to him.

Without hesitating, he advances on them, blasting away with impunity.

THE BODIES of MORPHEUS and  NIOBE are wracked by gunfire  and collapse
in a heap of bullet-ravaged flesh.

BROWN  walks  up  to the  corpses  and  kicks one  with  his  shoe. It
shimmers, and then disappears, followed by the other.


INT. MAIN DECK

              RAZOR dials the phone. MORPHEUS picks up.

                           MORPHEUS (V.O.)

                                "Yes."

                                RAZOR

                    "Theyre hitting your ghosts."

             MASSIVE attack of STATIC bursts on the line.

                                RAZOR

                            "What the - "

                         THE LINE goes dead.


EXT. ROOFTOP

MORPHEUS looks  at the  phone and  redials. RAZOR  comes through,  his
voice digitized and distorted.

                                RAZOR

     "Theyre cutting comes, get to the access point on Laxe - "

                         THE line goes dead.

MORPHEUS signals to NIOBE. They exit the roof as he dials TRINITY


INT. EMPTY BUILDING

CHOI and TRINITY hide  in the shadows of  an empty room, watching  the
battle. TRINITYS cell rings. She answers silently.

                           MORPHEUS (V.O.)

                       "Lets go. Laxe Three."

                               TRINITY

                          "What about Neo?"

                           MORPHEUS (V.O.)

     "We can do nothing to help him. Well only get in his way."

                         THEY leave the room.


INT. LOBBY

GREGORY stumbles  into the  lobby. Slumbering  bodies lie  everywhere,
slumped over desks, half-in chairs, on the ground.


EXT. PLAZA

HE exits into the street. The scene is one from HELL.

UNDER the neon  sky, fires are  frozen and smoke  columns hang in  the
air, still, like massive tree trunks.

The battle rages and surges,  a thousand SMITHS pouring onto  one NEO.
All around, nearly covering the ground, are corpses, destroyed  bodies
abandoned  by the  agent. Men  and women,  of all  ages and  designs,
smashed, decapitated and broken.

CU: NEO

THE SMITHS overwhelm him  with sheer numbers. NEO  is a blur, a  human
chainsaw now,  crushing or  smashing them  all, but  they crowd on all
sides. The bodies pile up as they fall, and NEO finds himself stepping
up the rubbery mass of corpses. A few more smashed SMITHS fall,  morph
back into their stolen forms, and NEO is KNEE-DEEP IN THE DEAD.

He cant take it. Choking, NEO struggles to free himself. SMITHS climb
up the corpse pile and drop onto him, pounding viciously. NEO  stalls,
in shock, his eyes  locked with the lifeless  blue eyes of a  woman he
just killed. She looks amazingly like TRINITY.

Perhaps for the first time, he is confronted with the consequences  of
this war, and his mind seizes as the Smiths pummel him.

NEO goes  berzerk! SCREAMING  and fighting,  he claws  his way out and
surges into the wall of agents. They throw him back, and he cant kill
them fast  enough. HE  leaps upward,  trying to  fly away,  but Smiths
cling on to him, and cling on to each other.


EXT. PLAZA

NEO struggles to  fly, and as  he does, hes  pulling a stalagtite  of
black suits, clinging like iron filings on a magnet.

CU: NEO


HIS face  is wide  with fear  and shock.  He cant  climb anymore, and
looks back down at the mountain  of agents hes pulling into the  air.
His face  clenches shut  as a  scream wells  from deep  within him. He
starts to glow, and we jump back to see:

A MASSIVE orange, spherical shock  wave blasts away from his  body. It
rebounds on the plaza and throws bodies upward, even as it blasts  the
Smiths away, leaving him clean.

EVERYTHING slows down  as NEO, exhausted,  tumbles out of  the sky. On
his way down  through the neon  light, he passes  bodies flying upward
from the  concussion. NEO  hits the  ground, bounces,  and lies still,
sprawled,  as people  drop all  around him,  piling up,  like Satans
snowfall.


EXT. ALLEY (MATRIX) DAY

THE sky and Matrix are still  frozen. TRINITY and CHOI make their  way
along cautiously, leapfrogging from cover to cover. They pause  behind
a dumpster, and  just before looking  out, theres the  sound of metal
tapping metal, twice.

TRINITY looks in  the direction of  the sound. MORPHEUS  and NIOBE are
standing still in the shadows, near the end of the alley. TRINITY  AND
CHOI make their way to them.

TRINITY peeks  cautiously around  the edge.  On the  other side of the
street is a phone booth.

                               TRINITY

                            "Is it clear?"

                               MORPHEUS

                         "I smell an ambush."

                                NIOBE

                         "Me too. Too quiet."

                   CHOI grips his gun and grimaces.

                                 CHOI

           "Too quiet? The world is frozen. Ill go first."

                        NO one likes the idea.

REAL-TIME suddenly returns.  The lightning bolts  in the sky  suddenly
re-animate, thundering out of existence, making the four of them  jump
out of their skulls. The sounds of the city suddenly flood back.

ON THE street, people stir to  their feet. Everyone is confused as  to
what happened.


EXT. PLAZA

ITS a sea of the dead. From its center, NEO emerges, soaked in blood,
gagging and  gasping for  breath. He  stumbles over  them. Shocked and
crazed, he glimpses the Metacortex building. Its in one piece  again,
unharmed.

He falls against  a smashed corporate  art sculpture. He  picks a cell
phone up from the ground and dials.

                                 NEO

                         "Morpheus, pick up."

We hear nothing but static.  Disgusted, NEO throws the phone  away. He
falls against the sculpture and looks up. Coming around the corner  of
the building is a group of agents and soldiers.

NEO  sinks down,  staring at  his hands.  He catches  his breath  and
concentrates.  The  blood  disappears,  and he  dons  the  suit  of an
anonymous soldier in black. His face, too, seems to change.

HE stands and walks away. We only see his back.


EXT. ALLEY - DAY

THEY weigh their options. Finally, MORPHUES gives the nod to CHOI.



                               MORPHEUS

                                "Go."

CHOI checks his ammo and puts his guns under his coat. There are  lots
of people on the streets now. Everyones in shock over what  happened,
and the columns of smoke rising from the center of the city.

                                 CHOI

"And remember, kids, when youre in a war, never volunteer yourself!"

HE walks out  onto the street,  eyeing the phone  booth and everything
else. A  gorgeous Asian  businesswoman stumbles  into him. Recognition
lights up her face and she stops him.

                                WOMAN

          "Choi? Oh my God, I havent seen you for months."

       CHOI keeps looking around, making his way to the booth.

                     "Oh yeah, sorry about that."

                           SHE turns angry.

         "Sorry about that? What kind of an asshole are you?"


EXT. ALLEY (MATRIX) - DAY

TRINITY is looking around the corner. She pulls back into the alley.

                               TRINITY

                "Casanova just ran into an old flame."


EXT. STREET (MATRIX) - DAY

                                WOMAN

   "No. Fuck you, Choi, you just think you can come and go when you
                               please?"

CHOI is ignoring her now, walking straight for the phone booth as  she
is having a fit. Tears are welling in her enraged face.

"Choi, if you have one shred of decency, if you even care about me - "

Inexplicably, CHOI  hangs his  trench coat  on the  side of the booth.
Standing behind it, he reaches  around with his arm, keeping  the coat
between his body and the phone. The WOMAN doesnt even notice the  web
of gun harnesses and what looks like a ton of ammunition covering  the
inside of the jacket.

                                WOMAN

  " - youll tell me why you dont call, why you, you, what are you
                               doing?"

                                 CHOI

"The jacket stops fragmentation. Sometimes they bomb the phones. Kiss
                            me for luck."

HE grabs her to him and thrusts his mouth onto hers.

CU: PHONE

His hand grabs the phone. We hear the dialtone, and he mashes down one
of the  numbers of  the keypad.  The number  tone rises  in pitch to a
crescendo. WE pull back and:

THE BOOTH EXPLODES. CHOI and the woman are bowled over by the flame.


EXT. ALLEY (MATRIX) - DAY

They take  cover from  the blast  as people  all over  the street  are
knocked flat.


EXT. STREET (MATRIX) - DAY

THE PHONE BOOTH is obliterated.  Miraculously, CHOI and the woman  are
still under the cover of  the jacket. THROWING the smoking  jacket off
them, CHOI screams in agony as  he grasps the smoldering stump of  his
right shoulder. The arm is history.

THE WOMAN looks on,  her eyes as wide  as dinner plates. Shaking,  she
falls back, still staring.

                                 CHOI

                         "You werent lucky."

MORPHEUS, NIOBE, and TRINITY rush to him, picking him up on his  feet.
CHOI is  screaming and  laughing. Someone  grabs his  smoldering coat,
dragging it along. CHOI stares at the ex-flame as they cart him  away.
His eyes are crazy.

                                 CHOI

              "You still want me to call you? Ha ha ha!"

AS they struggle down the street, CHOI starts to walk more on his own.
PEOPLE run from the scene, screaming.

                        CU - the four of them.

MORPHUES looks  at something  off-screen and  frowns. HE  pulls to the
left.

                               MORPHEUS

                             "This way."

TANKS and  TROOPS are  filling into  the street  ahead of them, coming
from around the corner.

THEY turn onto a different  street. This street, too, is  filling with
troops. Worse, its being lead by AGENT BROWN.

                                NIOBE

                         "Tanks, or agents?"

                               TRINITY

                               "Tanks."

                                 CHOI

                         "Yeah, tanks a lot."

They break. CHOI stands on his own, and they run back onto the  street
with the tanks.

CU: TANKS

THREE ABRAMS stop in the  street. Their turrets swing into  place with
terrifying quickness and precision.

AT ONCE,  they open  fire with  their main  cannons and machines guns.
FIRE FLOWERS blaze from the death machines, sending a typhoon of  lead
down the street.  Troops filed between  the tanks pull  their triggers
and dont let go. Everything in the street is shredded and blown away,
as though it was hit by a high-power pressure hose.

WITH UNEARTHLY  SPEED, EVERYONE  BREAKS for  the sides  of the street,
except for CHOI. He stands amid  it all as the tracers come  closer to
his body. He raises his machine  gun with his good arm, and  lays into
the enemy.

TRACER rounds kick away from  his gun, ripping straight back  into the
wall  of soldiers.  His rounds  deflect off  the sloped  armor of  the
tanks, recoils pile into the flesh  of troops. He rakes his fire  into
the enemy bodies.

CU: CHOI

TRACERS zoom in on  him. A tank round  blasts by, and the  wall of air
kicks him to his side. He continues to fire even as a bullet, followed
by  another, blasts  through the  middle of  his body.  More and  more
bullets smack into  him, blasting chunks  of meat and  viscera out the
back.


EXT. STREET (MATRIX) DAY

TRINITY and NIOBE  take one side  of the street,  running and shooting
simultaneously. THEY reach  the buildings on  the side and  NIOBE goes
STRAIGHT UP THE FAÇADE OF THE BUILDING, as TRINITY jumps from cover to
cover, cart wheeling through tracer fire and bullets.

ON  THE  OTHER side  of  the street,  MORPHEUS  goes straight  up  the
building  façade  and  starts  running  sideways,  completely  defying
gravity, firing downward at the soldiers.

CU: CHOI

HE WILL NOT FALL, and a hose of lead drills into him, taking his  body
apart piece by piece. Bullets take away pieces of his head, neck,  and
torso, and in one final wave of fire, he is disintegrated, leaving his
machine gun, barrel  smoking, spinning in  the air, firing  still. The
arm is still attached and finger  clenching on the trigger. It is  the
last piece of CHOI to fall.

MORPHEUS climbs  as he  runs. In  mid-stride he  changes magazines and
stops, standing on the wall, his body parallel to the ground.

On the other side of the street, NIOBE stands on the wall, blazing  at
the mass of troops with two  guns that never cease. THERE is  no cover
and  no reprieve  from the  DOUBLE DEATH  from above.  Most are  still
firing down the street, or over toward TRINITY.

TRINITY runs  up the  side of  the street.  Her guns  go empty and she
dives behind a stoop as a squad of soldiers blazes away at her.

CU: SOLDIER

In slow motion, he  pulls a spoon from  a grenade. Somehow, the  metal
ring reaches TRINITYS ears.

CU: TRINITY

She slaps a magazine into her  pistol, pulls the action and comes  out
from under cover just enough to see the soldier releasing the grenade.
She fires, hitting the grenade. IT explodes directly over the group of
soldiers, flattening them to the ground.

A  BULLET smacks  through TRINITYS  wrist, and  the hand  comes off,
popping like the head off  a dandelion. Blood spurts from  the severed
arteries, spraying the hand, with the pistol still in its grip.

ABOVE THE STREET, MORPHEU AND  NIOBE leap for one another.  They catch
each others arms, fifty feet  above the surviving enemy, and  spin in
place, firing away. The tank commanders in their copulas blast  upward
with their  machine guns,  but the  rounds miss  the spinning  couple.
MORPHUES and NIOBE concentrate on the commanders, and cut them down.

THEY land amidst  the carnage. TRINITY  emerges, shaken, pressing  her
coat to her arm.


EXT. STREET (MATRIX) - DAY

The other end of the street fills with soldiers, and AGENT BROWN.

CU: AGENT BROWN

HE surveys the  scene, and immediately  draws and fires,  running full
bore for the rebels.

MORPHEUS, Niobe and TRINITY are too close to the tanks to be fired on,
but the nearest one lunges at them. They climb up over concrete stoops
and over  the side  of the  tank. They  sprint down  the street as the
tanks turn their turrets behind them, searching.

                               MORPHEUS

                         "The garage, hurry!"

THEY dive behind a corner as  a tank fires. Morpheus throws the  woman
forward as the tank round hits  the edge of the building, blowing  the
concrete and brick wall into a massive cloud of powder. Perhaps a  ton
of rubble falls on Morpheus legs. He drags himself forward. Niobe and
Trinity grab his arms and haul him out of the rubble. Niobe shoots the
lock off a steel door, and they pile into the building.


EXT. STREET (MATRIX) - DAY

AGENT BROWN  and his  men rush  into position  around the building the
rebels are hiding in.


Suddenly, an unimaginably powerful engine  starts, and as we stare  at
the  garage door,  it explodes  outward. A  jet-black, hyped  COUNTACH
explodes out onto the street, tires literally on fire as they throw up
smoke. It cuts through a few  soldiers, hitting them in the knees,  as
it rips up the street, the throttle going way too high.


INT. COUNTACH (MATRIX) - DAY

THE street scene spins before them. TRINITY is at the wheel, a  broken
and dusty MORPHEUS sitting next to  her. The tach is redlining as  the
car rips up the street. Pedestrians dive for cover.

TRINITY holds her wounded hand to her chest and drives one-handed.

                               "Shift."

MORPHEUS does so,  and the tires  squeal again when  she releases into
second, then  third. In  a few  seconds theyre  over 60  on the  busy
street.


EXT. STREET (MATRIX) - DAY

Soldiers pick themselves up  just in time to  hear another engine -  a
super powerful track bike, emerges from the burnt rubber smoke screen.
A wheely bar on the back of the bike keeps it from flipping around the
rear tire as it accelerates like a bullet out of a barrel. There isnt
even time to take a shot until shes gone.


INT. COUNTACH (MATRIX) - DAY

THEY rocket up the entry to a highway, ripping past cars by driving up
the breakdown lane.  Once they hit  a straightaway Trinity  floors it,
and the speedo creeps up past 130 as they dodge in and out of cars.

MORPHEUS grabs his twisted, folded legs. He was literally poured  into
the seat. Concentrating, his face knotting in pain, he straightens the
broken, fractured legs. He closes his eyes and concentrates.

             The legs reform into straight, strong limbs.

                      MORPHEUS grabs the wheel.

                               MORPHEUS

              "Keep your foot on the gas. Heal thyself."

TRINITY pulls her bleeding wound from her arm. Her face tightens,  and
she closes her eyes, fervently concentrating, shutting the world  out,
which  is  good,  as  they suffer  constant  close  calls  as Morpheus
controls the wheel from his awkward spot.

When she opens her eyes again, she grabs the wheel. With BOTH hands.

MORPHEUS pulls out  his cell and  tries the line.  Its still full  of
static.

                               TRINITY

                             "Any luck?"

                               MORPHEUS

               "None. Theyve killed city-wide comms."

                               TRINITY

         "Then the agents are out of touch with each other."

                               MORPHEUS

  "They cant track us, but that gives them more time to destroy our
exits, and find the Neb. Well try the desert. Communications might be
                        working there still."

                               TRINITY

                         "What about Niobe?"

                               MORPHEUS

                    "She knows to meet us there."




EXT. HIGHWAY (MATRIX) - DAY

NIOBEs bike sizzles down the highway, insanely lane splitting at over
100 miles  per hour.  The wheely  bar is  folded up  against the  rear
wheel. A dual  stream of vehicles  spit by her  like giant machine-gun
bullets. She zooms out of view.


EXT. STREET (MATRIX) - DAY

GREGORY slows from a run. He looks back as police cars and  ambulances
race toward  the Metacortex  building. He  cant shake  what hes just
witnessed. He looks forward, only to run into:

                             AGENT SMITH

             GREGORY freezes, then bursts into questions.

                               GREGORY

                    "What the fuck just happened?"

                                SMITH

         "We need you, Gregory. Will you help us stop this?"

          GREGORY is perplexed. Resolve comes over his face.

                               GREGORY

                          "I can stop this?"

                                SMITH

                                "Yes."

                               GREGORY

                 "Alright. But how can I fight him?"

                                SMITH

                "I will give you the power you need."


INT. APARTMENT BUILDING (MATRIX) - DAY

THE building is old, crumbling, and inside painted a horrid green that
no sane person could find attractive. The humble place is home to  THE
ORACLE.

NEO exits an  elevator. Recomposed and  dressed normally, he  walks up
and down the hall, trying to remember which apartment she lived in.

A tall black woman, one of the Oracles priestesses, comes out of  the
stairwell and recognizes NEO.

                              PRIESTESS

                                "Neo."

HE turns  and looks  at her.  She smiles,  but as  Neo looks at her, a
flash of uncertainty, and maybe hate, flies across her face before the
smile returns.

                              PRIESTESS

                 "The Oracle is anxious to see you."

NEO follows her into the familiar apartment. The windows are  covered,
and NEO and the priestess are the only ones there. The Priestess moves
into the dark kitchen.

NEOs eyes  adjust to  the darkness.  He hears  something squish as he
steps, and looks down.

The tattered rug  is a swamp  of dark, congealing  liquid. NEO reaches
down and touches it with his fingertips. Its half-dried blood.

He stands, his eyes adjusted to  the dark now. The walls are  chipped,
covered in bullet holes.

In slow-motion, the entry door to the apartment opens. In walks  AGENT
BROWN. NEO turns to the  kitchen. AGENTS SMITH and JONES  appear. They
all draw their .45s.

NEO stands  still as  they walk  up to  him and  put their guns to his
head.

                         AGENT SMITH scoffs.

                                 NEO

 "I was on to you the whole time. I only came in here to isolate you,
                           to destroy you."

                             AGENT JONES

                     "What are you waiting for?"

                                 NEO

              "I realized, that I cant destroy you - "

                           HE nods at SMITH

                                 NEO

              " - without destroying the Matrix itself."

                                SMITH

                 "You killed me too easy last time."

                                BROWN

                       "And if you kill us - "

                           HE nods at JONES

                                BROWN

                   "Well only come back like him."

                         BROWN nods to SMITH.

                                 NEO

                              "I know."

   SMITH breathes deep, and drops his gun. The others follow suit.

                                SMITH

                "So, why dont you take it all down?"

                                 NEO

                            "The Matrix?"

                                SMITH

                                "Yes."

                                 NEO

  "I can. But if I destroy the Matrix, everyone within it will die."

                            SMITH snorts.

                                SMITH

        "I take it the great Morpheus failed to mention this?"

       NEO looks up at him, but his expression doesnt change.

                                 NEO

                     "How many people are in it?"

        SMITH holsters his weapon. He speaks matter-of-factly.

                                SMITH

                      "Six and a half billion."

            FOR NEO, the numbers are too huge to imagine.

                            BROWN scoffs.

                                BROWN

                      "Could you destroy us?"

ITS a serious question for Neo. But he nods. He knows his potential.

                                 NEO

                              "I could."

                                SMITH

              "What does that make you feel like? God?"

                      HE is amused by the idea.

                                JONES

        "This is getting tiresome. Where do we go from here?"

                                 NEO

 "IF you cut the power that the Matrix supplies to your armies, Ill
                            let you live."

                                SMITH

      "Idiot. We dont care about life, we care about victory."

                                 NEO

                                "Why?"

                                JONES


                       "So our kind... prevails."

                                 NEO

                          "You mean, lives."

                                SMITH

 "Who do you think started this war, boy? Your kind tried to kill us
                               first."

                                BROWN

         "But you didnt. Youre not as tough as you think."

                                 NEO

                             "Well see."

THE three agents, helpless to stop him, watch as he walks for the door
of the apartment. NEO opens it,  and stops, his face meeting a  flying
FIST. His vision  FLASHES with the  impact, and he  staggers back into
the room, falling on his ass and rolling back onto his feet.

              GREGOR steps into the room, tall and BAD.

                         NEO holds up a hand.

                                 NEO

           "Stop! I dont want to fight you! Youre human!"

GREGORY  doesnt  answer.  He  smashes  a  side-kick  into  NEOs gut,
doubling him over.

THE kick carries  such an impact  that a pale  concussion wave flashes
past Gregor. It sends NEO crashing out the window.

GREGORY stands upright and moves to the window, followed by the  three
agents. Theres nothing on the street, twenty stories below.

The building  starts trembling.  We hear  rapid-fire impacts,  growing
louder and coming faster.

THE FLOOR EXPLODES  as NEO crashes  up through the  concrete, throwing
the agents away as  he embraces GREGORY in  a bear hug. THEY  blast up
through the ceiling. WE follow them up through three more floors, bam,
bam, bam. Each concrete floor smashes GREGORY in the head.


EXT. ROOFTOP (MATRIX) - DAY

NEO and GREGORY SMASH through the roof, flying upward, like a missile,
past us.


EXT. SKY (MATRIX) - DAY

CU: NEO

HIS FACE is contorted in rage as he rockets upward. GREGORY is  barely
conscious. Seeing this, NEO stops, and flings Gregorys body violently
earthward.

NEO looks down as  the body falls toward  the city, thousands of  feet
below. He turns away,  just as the distant  GREGORY is falling out  of
sight. Just before he does, the speck of a person PULLS up, and  grows
larger and larger as  it returns. A contrail  streaks behind him as  a
rips through  the air.  FISTS FORWARD,  GREGORY is  like an MX missile
bearing on NEO.

NEO turns just in  time to catch BOTH  FISTS in his chest.  Like a cue
ball striking another billiard,  all Gregors momentum is  transferred
into Neo. Gregor stops dead in the air as Neo is hurtled out of view.

CU: GREGOR

HE is in  shock somehow as  he sees NEO  flying away. He  clenches his
fists and flexes his body, then looks down.

WE see the ground, thousands of feet below.

                               GREGORY

                             "Holy shit!"

FOR some  reason, he  starts to  fall. Even  as he  claws to  maintain
altitude, his  rational mind  has caught  up with  him and  is somehow
denying the fact that he can fly.

As hes  facing the  ground, NEO  slams into  him from above. Gripping
Gregor by the neck and his  belt, he drives straight down. The  ground
rushes, it takes  one second to  drop past a  50-story skyscraper. Neo
slams  Gregor,  front first,  into  the concrete  sidewalk.  They bust
through the sidewalk, into the sewer below.


INT. SEWER (MATRIX) - DAY

NEO stands. Offscreen,  we can here  choking breaths. Neo  looks down.
Gregor lies twisted on a concrete slab, impaled multiple times through
the chest by snapped, rusty rebar.  He takes one last breath, and  his
eyes half-close.

NEO checks the pulse. Finding nothing, he leaps out of the hole.

CU: GREGORY

HIS eyes  blink, and  he follows  NEOs departure.  Choking, unable to
breath with the rebar through him, he writhes. Theres nothing for him
to grab to pull himself off the steel.

His eyes clenched  shut, Gregor levitates,  by force of  will, pulling
his body off the rebar.  The corrugated bars make wet,  sucking sounds
as the pull through his body.  Finally, he gets to a twisted  piece of
bar, and cant make it over. Hes losing all his breath, all his  life
force, over one piece of twisted steel protruding from his chest.

WITH one  last, wiggling  effort, he  works it  through him. HIS mouth
opens wide, but no sounds emit, lest he recall Neo. Just as the end of
the steel bar enters his body and we cant take any more,

                                                               CUT TO:


EXT. DESERT HIGHWAY (MATRIX) - SUNSET

THE Countach and bike  zip down a long,  perfectly flat empty road.  A
brown sunset plagues the horizon. There is no civilization in sight.


INT. COUNTACH (MATRIX) - SUNSET

MORPHEUS tries his cell again. This time, it reaches the Neb.


INT. MAIN DECK - NIGHT

RAZOR and CIRCA are both operating the consoles.

                                RAZOR

                             "Operator."

                           MORPHEUS (O.S.)

                  "Good to hear youre still there."

                                RAZOR

              "Jesus, you too. Where the fuck are you?"

                               MORPHEUS

"About two hundred miles east of the city, on highway 315. We need an
                                exit."

                                RAZOR

          "Coming up on your left, ten miles, a rest stop."


INT. COUNTACH (MATRIX) - SUNSET

                               MORPHEUS

                  "I dont remember an exit there."

                                RAZOR

                        "Gimme five minutes."

                               MORPHEUS

                                "Out."


INT. MAIN DECK (NIGHT)

RAZOR clears the  screen in front  of him and  cracks his fingers.  He
looks at Circa.

                                CIRCA

                            "Theyre OK?"

                                RAZOR

           "Gotta get em out. They need an exit program."

CU: Keyboard.  RAZORS fingers  fly at  inhuman speeds  over the keys.
Data  pours down  the console  as he  blazes away.  Finally, he  hits
enter so hard it rocks the station.

RAZOR  turns to  Circa as  Matrix code  resumes its  cascade down  the
screens.

                                RAZOR

                      "Yes! Did you like that?"

                      CIRCA just rolls her eyes.


INT. COUNTACH (MATRIX) SUNSET

            MORPHEUS phone rings. He answers. Its Razor.

                                RAZOR

                          "Exit ready sir."

                               MORPHEUS

                     "Check the phone for bombs."


INT. MAIN DECK - NIGHT

           CIRCA looks over some data and shakes her head.

                                CIRCA

                            "Its clear."


INT. COUNTACH (MATRIX) - SUNSET

                             RAZOR (O.S.)

   "Its all set. Theres a pair of cops at the rest stop, though."

                               MORPHEUS

                           "Not a problem."

THE Countach pulls into  the meager rest stop,  not more than a  water
fountain, toilet house and phone booth.

A police cruiser sits, lights off, waiting to intercept speeders.


EXT. REST STOP (MATRIX) - SUNSET

THE Countach skids  to a stop,  kicking up a  massive dust cloud  that
hides the  car. We  hear the  door slide,  and the  massive black-clad
figure of MORPHEUS emerges from the dust.

                 An Uzi in each hand, pointed at US.

THE COP behind the wheel is too slow to draw, call for backup, or even
duck for cover. The safety glass is destroyed as gunfire rips  through
it, chewing the cop to pieces. His body thrashes in the seat.

MORPHEUS turns away. NIOBE pulls up on her bike and gets off,  slowly,
obviously the ride had been  a long one. Trinity joins  them. Morpheus
stops.

                               MORPHEUS

             "I thought Razor said their were two cops."


INT. BATHROOM HOUSE (MATRIX) - SUNSET

A ROOKIE cop, his  face to young for  a razor, is shaking  as he peeks
through a crack in the door, through which he sees the terrorists  who
just wasted his partner. He finishes buckling his pants, and draws his
service pistol, only to shake in pain as his body morphs.


INT. MAIN DECK - NIGHT

RAZOR and CIRCA see the agent morph as the code flies down the screen.

                                RAZOR

                          "Fuck, fuck fuck!"


EXT. REST STOP (MATRIX) - SUNSET

THEY smell somethings wrong. They  move, back to back in  a triangle,
for the  phone booth,  weapons draw  and looking  in all  direction at
once.

                               MORPHEUS

                         "Niobe, you first."

                               TRINITY

                      "Bullshit, its my turn."

                                NIOBE

                     "Junior ranks leave first."

TRINITY enters the booth as the phone starts ringing.

Its the moment Smith was waiting for.

HE BURSTS  out of  the door,  gun firing  at the  booth. Inside, glass
shatters, and blood sprays as  Trinity is riddled with bullets.  Smith
doesnt stop. He sprays for an eternity, even firing as she collapses,
phone still ringing. Her body slumps, smearing blood against the booth
door as it shuts from her weight.


INT. MAIN DECK (NIGHT)

TRINITYS body spasms violently against her harness as her life  signs
go berserk.  Shes not  dead, but  death is  only seconds  away. Circa
screams, but Razor is locked, staring at the screen with the intensity
from which he derived his name.


EXT. REST STOP (MATRIX) - NIGHT

MORPHEUS and NIOBE open fire. Smith shudders, flickers violently, his
body moving too fast to follow as the two rebels empty their clips at
 him. The actions of the guns stop in the open position, barrels and
empty chambers smoking, as the last empty shells patter to the ground.

MORPHEUS throws the guns down and turns to Niobe.

                               MORPHEUS

                            "Get her out."

NIOBE dives for  the shattered booth,  kicking away the  starred glass
and  answering  the  ringing  phone.  She  pulls  it  down,  and hauls
Trinitys destroyed body up, placing the phone to her ear.

TRINITYS head merely sags lifelessly to one side.

                                NIOBE

      "Come on! Go through, Trinity! God damnit dont give up!"

TRINITYS  eyes   flicker.  She   focuses  on   Niobe,  summoning  her
consciousness enough to make the  phase back into the real  world. She
starts to fade as we cut to:


INT. MAIN DECK (NIGHT)

CIRCA stands over  Trinity as the  rebels blue eyes  flutter open. Her
whole body goes into a seizure and she chokes and screams as she grabs
Circa.

                                CIRCA

                     "Youre safe, youre safe!"


EXT. REST STOP

MORPHEUS charges SMITH.  Smith ignores reloads  him, and sights  in on
the exposed back of Niobe as she is reaching up to put the phone  back
on the  hook. As  the sights  rest right  between her shoulder blades,
Morpheus grabs his gun with both hands. He squeezes off one shot,  the
action freeze  back on  an empty  chamber, before  Morpheus throws his
hands up in the air

The shot ricochets clips Niobes ear and ricochets off the booth.  She
hangs up the phone and touches the blood of her ear. The phone  rings.
She looks at it, then back at Morpheus and Smith, raising dust as they
fight.

She leaves the ringing phone and runs to join the fight.


INT. MAIN DECK - NIGHT

RAZOR pounds the edge of the console as he watches the screen.

                                RAZOR

                           "Crazy mothers!"

CIRCA has  removed Trinitys  interface, but  shes having  a seizure.
Circa can barely hold her down as she uses her teeth to rip the  cover
off a wicked hypo.

                                RAZOR

                       "Whats wrong with her?"

                                CIRCA

             "Her bodys dying but her mind wont quit."

CIRCA straddles her and plunges the massive needle into her chest.


EXT. REST STOP (MATRIX)

Morpheus and  Smith clash  in the  dust -  punches, kicks,  and blocks
coming too  fast to  see. Smith  is wailing  on Morpheus, but Morpheus
sneaks in a  kick that separates  them. They take  stances a good  two
distances away. Theyre about to go at it again when:

NIOBE sprints  into the  fight. Performing  a flying  leap kick, Smith
grabs her  and swings  her down,  crashing her  body into the concrete
with a sickening crack-thud. She rolls, fighting the pain, as Morpheus
flies  back into  action, catching  the agent  with a  furious ass  of
swinging kicks.

Niobe grits back the pain and rejoins her love. Together they  assault
the agent, their speed almost, almost equaling his, their will  capped
by the limits of their Matrix-bending powers. Finally, Smith resurges.
He  lands  a punch  into  Niobes stomach,  and  her body  folds  over
unnaturally, as if her back is broken. She crumples to the deck, blood
pouring from her mouth.

MORPHEUS screams and brings a hammer blow down on the back of  Smiths
neck,  smashing  the  agents  face  down  and  imprinting  it  in the
concrete. For a  moment, Smith is  still. Morpheus collects  Niobe and
runs for the phone booth, which is still ringing.

ITS too far. Smith grabs him around the knees, spilling him  forward.
Man handling him like he weighs nothing, Smith gets on top of him  and
starts smashing his fists down into Morpheus face.

                                SMITH

          "I should have killed you the first chance I had."

Like an enraged silverback, he raises his fists together for one final
blow. But  instead of  striking, his  eyes catch  something. He  flips
back, jumping, as a silver streak cuts through the air, a split second
too  slow to  cut the  agents head  off. Instead,  it slices  cleanly
through the triceps of the raised arms, leaving nick on the throat.

RAZOR, dressed in a black kimono and wielding two katanas, steps  over
Morpheus as  he pursues  the agent.  Smith rolls  backwards, gains his
footing, and retreats from the  swirling blades of death. He  turns to
Morpheus:

                                RAZOR

                                "Go!"


INT. MAIN DECK - NIGHT

RAZOR is strapped into one of the interface chairs, his eyes closed.


EXT. REST STOP

HALF-DEAD MORPHEUS drags NIOBE to the booth.

Behind them, Agent Smith backs away from RAZORS dual blades, on long,
one short. Whenever Razor attacks,  Smith backs away. They circle  one
another.

                MORPHEUS puts Niobe through the phone.

                      RAZOR forces Smith around.

                                RAZOR

              "Come on, tough guy, come got some Razor."

SMITH frowns  and moves  forward, but  the whistling  edge of  a blade
makes him  think twice.  RAZOR holds  the short  sword parallel to the
ground, the long sword straight up. He hides his eyes behind the short
sword.

SMITHs back is against the sunset. The sun drops below a cloud.

RAZOR flashes  the light  off his  short blade,  directly into Smiths
eyes, blinding him as he strikes with the long sword.

SMITH, blinded, turns and backs away. RAZOR attacks.

IN the  booth, Niobe  is gone.  MORPHEUS hangs  up the  phone. He  can
barely stand up enough to reach the handset. When it rings he picks it
up. But he doesnt disappear.

                               MORPHEUS

                             "Reload me."


INT. MAIN DECK - NIGHT

                                CIRCA

                             "All right."

SHE punches  some keys.  MORPHEUS 3-D  avatar flashes  on a  console,
along with a massive array of weapons.


EXT. BOOTH (MATRIX) - SUNSET

MORPHEUS disappears for a second, then reappears. Now he is  perfectly
clean, and immaculately dressed. He replaces his sunglasses and  kicks
through  the remains  of the  booth, walking  toward the  fight as  he
produces new weapons, heavy with ammo, from his long coat.

RAZOR keeps  swinging at  SMITH -  and missing.  Seeing his chance, he
runs back for the ringing  phone. SMITH pursues, almost on  RAZOR when
the neo-samurai jumps in the  air and pirouhettes, swinging one  sword
after another, like a helicopter blade from Hell.

IN the liquid  world of slo-mo,  the short sword  cuts through Smiths
outstretched fingers, sending them  flying. The long sword  grazes his
forearm, cutting through the fabric  and taking off a slice  of flesh.
The tip of  the sword slices  through his suit,  cutting his tie  off,
digging about an inch into his torso.

SMITH collapses into the dust, his  face a mask of blood and  dust. He
doesnt try to get up.

RAZOR passes MORPHEUS, who backs up to the ringing phone booth.  Razor
goes  through first.  MORPHEUS keeps  his eyes  and weapon  locked on
SMITH, who  makes no  attempt to  pursue. He  stands calmly,  and in a
dignified manner, wipes dust off  his clothing as he watches  Morpheus
step into the booth, and replace the phone.

It rings. One hand on the receiver, Morpheus stares back at Smith.

SMITH stands there, not attempting to pursue. Morpheus pauses,  taking
advantage of the chance to observe his deadly enemy.

SMITH stares at the booth for a second. Emotion twists his face, first
anger,  then  perhaps  sadness.  Hes lost.  Hell  be  in  the Matrix
forever.

With a quicksilver flash,  his body reverts back  to the shape of  the
rookie cop.

THE young  man is  left standing  there. He  is filthy,  bloody, badly
sliced up, and the fingers of one hand are missing. He looks around at
the carnage  as his  mouth simply  opens and  closes, reflexively,  in
shock. He focuses on Morpheus.

The rebel answers the phone and disappears, leaving the cop, his  body
broken and his mind blown.


INT. MAIN DECK - NIGHT

CIRCA helps MORPHEUS off the interface chair. Razor is triumphant.

                                RAZOR

   "Did you see that? We beat him! A fucking agent! He gave up!"

MORPHEUS, unflappable, rises and rushes to the operations consoles.

                               MORPHEUS

                           "Where is Neo?"

                                CIRCA

 "Havent heard from him. The city is still cut off from the rest of
                             the Matrix."

   MORPHEUS appears enraged. He looks at Neo, supine on his chair.

                               MORPHEUS

      "Why does it still exist? Why hasnt he destroyed it yet?"

                                RAZOR

                          "Maybe he cant."

 TRINITY is sitting on the edge of her interface chair, looking like
                                hell.

                               TRINITY

                 "Is he even alive? Is he captured?"

                                RAZOR

  "Last we saw he was trying to blow up the building. Havent locked
                           onto him since."

                               MORPHEUS

                           "What? Why not?"

                                CIRCA

    "Call me crazy, but I think hes masking his own displacement
                             signature."

                                RAZOR

"His carrier signal just goes nowhere. But there is data going back
                             and forth."

MORPHEUS  stares at  the data  on the  screens. The  Matrix lives.  He
pushes Razor out of the way, and starts hacking at the keyboard at  an
incredible rate. Its obvious Morpheus can handle computers.

                               MORPHEUS

               "I found him once. Ill find him again."

We  go deeper  into the  miasma of  green symbols,  swallowed by  the
blackness of the screen, and emerge into:


INT. PENTHOUSE APARTMENT (MATRIX) - NIGHT

The apartment is luxuriously laid out and furnished. Gregory sits on a
leather couch, watching  whatever on the  tube with the  sound off. He
absentmindedly  manipulates a  quarter over  and around  his fingers.
Finally, he stops and looks at the quarter.

Holding it between his  thumb and forefinger, he  folds it in half  as
though it was a disk of bubble  gum. He folds it again, then rools  it
as though its a musket ball.

Chandra enters the living room and collapses on the couch. She reaches
points the remote at the TV, but Gregory puts his hand over it to  get
her attention.

                               GREGORY

        "So, you really dont have any idea how you got here?"

                               CHANDRA

               "No. I only remember being on the bike."

                            GREGORY sighs.

                               GREGORY

 "Yeah, you took a pretty good knock on the head. Do you know how we
                           got this place?"

                      She looks at him, annoyed.

                               CHANDRA

            "Duh. We broke in. We dont own a penthouse."

                               GREGORY

                       "What if I said we did?"

                               CHANDRA

                       "Id say youre insane."

She finally gets the remote and changes the channel. The volume  comes
on, louder and  infinitely more tinny  and obnoxious than  anything in
life. Chandra laughs at the images as Gregory stares into space.



INT. BURNT-OUT CATHEDRAL (MATRIX) - NIGHT

NEO sits with his back against a blackened brick wall, staring  ahead.
Hes  in the  belfry of  an ancient,  destroyed cathedral,  among the
pigeon nests, soot, and bird crap.

FROM here, in  downtown, we can  see the modern,  uptown section, with
its  gleaming  skyscrapers. METACORTEX  still  stands, illuminated  by
searchlights.

NEO sits and broods. Isolated, his world turned upside down and  right
side out in less than a week, his mind and spirit are a blank.

Again, he tries his cell phone.  Static. He collapses it and puts  it.
Just as it leaves his mind, it rings. The face flips open.

NEO puts it to his ear without speaking.

                           MORPHEUS (O.S.)

                                "Neo."

              NEOS grim expression is melted by relief.

                                 NEO

       "Morpheus! Holy shit! You wont believe what happened."

                               MORPHEUS

                              "I know."

                                 NEO

           "I couldnt do it. Morpheus, theres a problem."


INT. MAIN DECK - NIGHT

       MORPHEUS has the headset on. He stands and surveys NEO.

                               MORPHEUS

            "Yes, there is a problem. The Matrix exists."


EXT. BURNT-OUT CATHEDRAL (MATRIX) - NIGHT

                  NEOS relief fades into confusion.

                                 NEO

                         "I know. Im sorry."

                           MORPHEUS (O.S.)

                        "And the problem is..."

                                 NEO

 "Uh, its impossible. If the Matrix is destroyed, the people within
the system will die. They will all die. There has to be a different
                                way."

                      MORPHEUS doesnt respond.

                                 NEO

                    "Morpheus? Did you know this?"

We  hear  nothing. NEO  can  hear his  own  heart beating.  Anger  and
confusion add to the already heavy mental burden he carries.



                           MORPHEUS (O.S.)

              "I didnt say things would be easy, Neo."

        NEO sinks to the ground, shocked. He shakes his head.

                                 NEO

                                "No."


INT. MAIN DECK - NIGHT

MORPHEUS isnt happy about what he has to tell his protégé, but  there
is no bending his will. The others look on soberly.

                               MORPHEUS

   "Neo, the Matrix... its not real. And its up to you to end it."




EXT. BURNT-OUT CATHEDRAL (MATRIX) - NIGHT

NEO cant stand the reality of the situation. Hes coming apart.

                                 NEO

  "No, Morpheus, this cant be! We cant do this! We have to get the
                             people out."

                           MORPHEUS (O.S.)

 "Even if we could somehow get to them without cutting through their
defenses, theres no way we can rehabilitate billions of people. They
                 wouldnt even want to be woken up."

                            Neo is silent.

                           MORPHEUS (O.S.)

                  "You can do it. You can free us."

                                 NEO

             "Why me? Why the fuck do I have to do this?"

                 MORPHEUS is silent for a long while.


INT. MAIN DECK - NIGHT

Everyone is watching  Morpheus, and no  one can quite  believe what is
happening.

                               MORPHEUS

"You know what needs to be done. Time is short. Make up your mind. The
only way youre getting out of the Matrix is through its destruction."

                    Morpheus kills the connection.


EXT. BURNT-OUT CATHEDRAL (MATRIX) - NIGHT

Neo hears the line click dead. He cant believe what has happened.


INT. MAIN DECK - NIGHT

MORPHEUS drops the headset on  the operations console. He types  a few
commands on the keyboard, then addresses the crew.

                               MORPHEUS

                  "No one goes in. Hes on his own."

                       He leaves the main deck.

Trinity stares at Neo for a moment, her face fighting for composure No
one looks at her. She walks away, then leans against the bulkhead, her
body shaking.


EXT. BURNT-OUT CATHEDRAL (MATRIX) - NIGHT

Neo closes the cell  phone. He reaches to  tuck it away, then  pauses,
looking at it. He drops it to the ground and walks on.

He stands out on   a finger of crumbling   church, the night air   all
around him.  The  city  lights are   alive below.  He  focuses  on the
Metacortex building. Leaving  him there, we  rush to it  until we dive
into the dark  shadows  of the  very building,  going  microscopically
close, until the  darkness gives way  to the glowing  green miasma  of
quantum  code.  It  fills  the  screen  before  we  bust  through into
darkness again.


TO BE CONTINUED...
THE MATRIX

	FADE IN ON:

	COMPUTER SCREEN

	So close it has no boundaries.

	A blinking cursor pulses in the electric darkness like a
	heart coursing with phosphorous light, burning beneath
	the derma of black-neon glass.

	A PHONE begins to RING, we hear it as though we were 
	making the call.  The cursor continues to throb,
	relentlessly patient, until --

					MAN (V.O.)
			Hello?

	Data now slashes across the screen, information flashing
	faster than we read.

					SCREEN
			Call trans opt:  received.
			2-19-96  13:24:18  REC:Log>

					WOMAN (V.O.)
			I'm inside.  Anything to report?

	We listen to the phone conversation as though we were on
	a third line.  The man's name is CYPHER.  The woman, 
	TRINITY.

					CYPHER (V.O.)
			Let's see.  Target left work at
			5:01 PM.

					SCREEN
			Trace program:  running.

	The entire screen fills with racing columns of numbers.
	Shimmering like green-electric rivets, they rush at a 10-
	digit phone number in the top corner.

					CYPHER (V.O.)
			He caught the northbound Howard 
			line. Got off at Sheridan.  
			Stopped at 7-11.  Purchased six-
			pack of beer and a box of Captain 
			Crunch.  Returned home.

	The area code is identified.  The first three numbers
	suddenly fixed, leaving only seven flowing columns.

	We begin MOVING TOWARD the screen, CLOSING IN as each 
	digit is matched, one by one, snapping into place like
	the wheels of a slot machine.

					TRINITY (V.O.)
			All right, you're relieved.  Use
			the usual exit.

					CYPHER (V.O.)
			Do you know when we're going to
			make contact?

					TRINITY
			Soon.

	Only two thin digits left.

					CYPHER (V.O.)
			Just between you and me, you don't 
			believe it, do you?  You don't 
			believe this guy is the one?

					TRINITY (V.O.)
			I think Morpheus believes he is.

					CYPHER (V.O.)
			I know.  But what about you?

					TRINITY (V.O.)
			I think Morpheus knows things that
			I don't.

					CYPHER (V.O.)
			Yeah, but if he's wrong --

	The final number pops into place --

					TRINITY (V.O.)
			Did you hear that?

					CYPHER (V.O.)
			Hear what?

					SCREEN
			Trace complete.  Call origin:
			#312-555-0690

					TRINITY (V.O.)
			Are you sure this line is clean?

					CYPHER (V.O.)
			Yeah, course I'm sure.

	We MOVE STILL CLOSER, the ELECTRIC HUM of the green 
	numbers GROWING INTO an OMINOUS ROAR.

					TRINITY (V.O.)
			I better go.

					CYPHER (V.O.) 
			Yeah.  Right.  See you on the other side.

	She hangs up as we PASS THROUGH the numbers, entering the
	netherworld of the computer screen.

	Where gradually the sound of a police radio grows around 
	us.

					RADIO (V.O.)
			Attention all units.  Attention
			all units.

	Suddenly, a flashlight cuts open the darkness and we find
	ourselves in --


	INT.  CHASE HOTEL - NIGHT

	The hotel was abandoned after a fire licked its way 
	across the polyester carpeting, destroying several rooms 
	as it spooled soot up the walls and ceiling leaving 
	patterns of permanent shadow.

	We FOLLOW four armed POLICE officers using flashlights as 
	they creep down the blackened hall and ready themselves
	on either side of room 303.

	The biggest of them violently kicks in the door --

	The other cops pour in behind him, guns thrust before
	them.

					BIG COP
			Police!  Freeze!

	The room is almost devoid of furniture.  There is a fold-
	up table and chair with a phone, a modern, and a powerbook 
	computer.  The only light in the room is the glow of the
	computer.

	Sitting there, her hands still on the keyboard, is 
	TRINITY; a woman in black leather.

					BIG COP
			Get your hands behind your head!

	Trinity rises.

					BIG COP
			Hands behind your head!  Now!  Do
			it!

	She slowly puts her hands behind her head.


	EXT.  CHASE HOTEL - NIGHT

	A black sedan with tinted windows glides in through the 
	police cruisers.

	AGENT SMITH and AGENT BROWN get out of the car.

	They wear dark suits and sunglasses even at night.  They 
	are also always hardwired; small Secret Service earphones 
	in one ear, its cord coiling back into their shirt
	collars.

					AGENT SMITH
			Lieutenant?

					LIEUTENANT
			Oh shit.

					AGENT SMITH 
			Lieutenant, you were given 
			specific orders --

					LIEUTENANT
			I'm just doing my job.  You gimme 
			that Juris-my dick-tion and you 
			can cran it up your ass.

					AGENT SMITH
			The orders were for your protection.

	The Lieutenant laughs.

					LIEUTENANT
			I think we can handle one little
			girl.

	Agent Smith nods to Agent Brown as they start toward the
	hotel.

					LIEUTENANT
			I sent two units.  They're 
			bringing her down now.

					AGENT SMITH
			No, Lieutenant, your men are dead.


	INT.  CHASE HOTEL

	The Big Cop flicks out his cuffs, the other cops holding 
	a bead.  They've done this a hundred times, they know 
	they've got her, until the Big Cop reaches with the cuff 
	and Trinity moves --

	It almost doesn't register, so smooth and fast, inhumanly 
	fast.

	The eye blinks and Trinity's palm. snaps up and the nose 
	explodes, blood erupting.  The cop is dead before he
	begins to fall.

	And Trinity is moving again --

	Seizing a wrist, misdirecting a gun, as a startled cop 
	FIRES --

	A head explodes.

	In blind panic, another airs his gun, the barrel, a fixed 
	black hole --

	And FIRES --

	Trinity twists out of the way, the bullet missing as she 
	reverses into a roundhouse kick, knocking the gun away.

	The cop begins to scream when a jump kick crushes his 
	windpipe, killing the scream as he falls to the ground.

	She looks at the four bodies.

					TRINITY
			Shit.


	EXT.  CHASE HOTEL

	Agent Brown enters the hotel, while Agent Smith heads for 
	the alley.


	INT.  CHASE HOTEL

	Trinity is on the phone, pacing.  The other end is 
	answered.

					MAN (V.O.)
			Operator.

					TRINITY
			Morpheus!  The link was traced!  I
			don't know how.

					MORPHEUS (V.O.)
			I know.  Stay calm.

					TRINITY
			Are there any agents?

					MORPHEUS (V.O.)
			Yes.

					TRINITY
			Goddamnit!

					MORPHEUS (V.O.)
			You have to focus.  There is a 
			phone.  Wells and Laxe.  You can
			make it.

	She takes a deep breath, centering herself.

					TRINITY
			All right --

					MORPHEUS (V.O.)
			Go.

	She drops the phone.


	INT.  HALL

	She bursts out of the room as Agent Brown enters the hall,
	leading another unit of police.  Trinity races to the 
	opposite end, exiting through a broken window onto the 
	fire escape.


	EXT.  FIRE E5CAPE

	In the alley below, Trinity sees Agent Smith staring at 
	her.  She can only go up.


	EXT.  ROOF

	On the roof, Trinity is running as Agent Brown rises over 
	the parapet, leading the cops in pursuit.

	Trinity begins to jump from one roof to the next, her 
	moverents so clean, gliding in and out of each jump,
	contrasted to the wild jumps of the cops.

	Agent Brown, however, has the same unnatural grace.

	The METAL SCREAM of an EL TRAIN is heard and Trinity 
	turns to it, racing for the back of the building.

	The edge falls away into a wide back alley.  The next 
	building is over 40 feet away, but Trinity's face is 
	perfectly calm, staring at some point beyond the other 
	roof.

	The cops slow, realizing they are about to see something 
	ugly as Trinity drives at the edge, launching herself 
	into the air.

	From above, the ground seems to flow beneath her as she 
	hangs in flight

	Then hitting, somersaulting up, still running hard.

					COP
			Motherfucker -- that's impossible!

	They stare, slack-jawed, as Agent Brown duplicates the 
	move exactly, landing, rolling over a shoulder, up onto 
	one knee.

	Just below the building are the runbling tracks of 
	riveted steel.  The TRAIN SCREECHES beneath her, a 
	rattling blur of gray metal.  Trinity junps, landing
	easily.

	She looks back just as Agent Brown hurls through the air 
	barely reaching the last car

	Agent Brown stands, yanking out a gun.

	Trinity is running hard as BULLETS WHISTLE past her head.

	Ahead she sees her only chance, 50 feet beyond the point 
	where the train has begun to turn, there is --

	A window; a yellow glow in the midst of a dark brick
	building.

	Trinity zeroes in on it, running as hard as she can, her 
	speed compounded by the train.  The SCREAM of the STEEL 
	rises as she nears the edge where the train rocks into the
	turn.

	Trinity hurtles into the empty night space, her body 
	leveling into a dive.  She falls, arms covering her head
	as --

	The whole world seems to spin on its axis --

	And she crashes with an EXPLOSION of GLASS and WOOD, then 
	falls onto a back stairwell, tumbling, bouncing down
	stairs bleeding, broken --

	But still alive.

	Through the smashed window, she glimpses Agent Brown,
	still on the train, his tie and coat whipping in the
	wind; stone-faced, he touches his ear piece as the train 
	slides him past the window.

	Trinity tries to move.  Everything hurts.

					TRINITY
			Get up, Trinity.  You're fine.
			Get up -- just get up!

	She stands and limps down the rest of the stairs.


	EXT.  STREET

	Trinity emerges from the shadows of an alley and, at the 
	end of the block, in a pool of white street light, she
	sees it.

	The telephone booth.

	Obviously hurt, she starts down the concrete walk,
	focusing in completely, her pace quickening, as the PHONE
	begins to RING.

	Across the street, a garbage truck suddenly u-turns, its 
	TIRES SCREAMING as it accelerates.

	Trinity sees the headlights on the truck arcing at the
	telephone booth as if taking aim.

	Gritting through the pain, she races the truck --

	Slamming into the booth, the headlights blindingly
	bright, bearing down on the box of Plexiglas just as --

	She answers the phone.

	There is a frozen instant of silence before the hulking 
	mass of dark metal lurches up onto the sidewalk --

	Barreling through the booth, bulldozing it into a brick
	wall, smashing it to Plexiglas pulp.

	After a moment, a black loafer steps down from the cab of 
	the garbage truck.  Agent Smith inspects the wreckage.
	There is no body.  Trinity is gone.

	His jaw sets as he grinds his molars in frustration.
	AGENT JONES walks up behind him.

					AGENT SMITH
			Did you get anything from the
			room?

					AGENT JONES
			Their next target.  The name is
			Neo.

	The handset of the pay phone lays on the ground,
	separated in the crash like a severed limb.

					AGENT SMITH
			We'll need a search running.

					AGENT JONES
			It's already begun.

	We are SUCKED TOWARDS the mouthpiece of the phone, CLOSER 
	and CLOSER, UNTIL the smooth gray plastic spreads out 
	like a horizon and the small HOLES WIDEN until we fall
	through one --

	Swallowed by the darkness that becomes --

	A computer screen.

	We are on-line, inside a chat room called "The Matrix." 
	It is an exklusive web-site where hackers hang out.

					SCREEN
			JACKON:  I heard Morpheus has been
			on this board.
			SUPERASTIC:  Morpheus doesn't even
			exist and the Matrix is nothing 
			but an advertising gimmick 4 a new
			game.
			TIMAXE:  All I want to know is
			Trinity really a girl?
			LODIII:  87% of all women on line
			are really men.
			QUARK:  The Matrix is a euphemism 
			for the government.
			SUPERASTIC:  No, The Matrix is the
			system controlling our lives.
			TIMAXE:  You mean MTV.
			SUPERASTIC:  I mean Sega.
			FOS4:  ALL HAIL SEGA!!!

	We drift back from the electric conversation entering --


	INT.  NEO'S APARTMENT

	It is a studio apartirent that seems overgrown with
	technology.

	Weed-like cables coil everywhere, duct-taped into
	thickets that wind up and around the legs of several
	desks.

	Tabletops are filled with cannibalized equipment that lay
	open like an autopsied corpse.

	We turn towards the center of this rat-nest of
	technology, following the slurping and crunching of
	cereal.  We pass an open box of Capln Crunch as we find --

	NEO, a younger man who knows more about living inside a 
	computer than living outside one.

					NEO
			Fuckin' idiots don't know shit.

	He finishes his cereal and is about to disconnect when an 
	anonynous message slices onto the screen.

					SCREEN
			Do you want to know what the
			Matrix is, Neo?

	Neo is frozen when he reads his name.

					SCREEN
			SUPERASTIC:  Who said that?
			JACKON:  Who's Neo?
			GIBSON:  This is a private board.

			If you want to know, follow the
			white rabbit.

					NEO
			What the hell...

					SCREEN
			TIMAXE:  Someone is hacking the
			hackers!
			FOS4:  It's Morpheus!!!!!
			JACKON:  Identify yourself.

			Knock, knock, Neo.

	A chill runs down his spine and when someone KNOCKS on
	his door he almost jumps out of his chair.

	He looks at the door, then back at the computer but the
	message is gone.

	He shakes his head, not completely sure what happened.
	Again, someone knocks.

	Cautiously, Neo approaches the door.

					VOICE (O.S.)
			Hey, Tommy-boy!  You in there?

	Recognizing the voice, he relaxes and opens it.  ANTHONY,
	who lives down the hall, is standing outside with a group
	of friends.

					NEO
			What do you want, Anthony?

					ANTHONY
			I need your help, man.  Desperate.
			They got me, man.  The shackles of 
			fascism.

	He holds up the red notice that accompanies the Denver
	boot.

					NEO
			You got the money this time?

	He holds up two hundred dollars and Neo opens the door.
	Anthony's girlfriend, DUJOUR, stops in front of Neo.

					DUJOUR
			You can really get that thing off,
			right now?

					ANTHONY
			I told you, honey, he may look 
			like just another geek but this 
			here is all we got left standing 
			between Big Brother and the New
			World Order.


	EXT.  STREET

	A police officer unlocks a yellow metal boot from the
	wheel of an enormous oldsmobile.


	INT.  NEO'S APARTMENT

	They watch from the window as the cops, silently,
	robotically, climb into their van.

					ANTHONY
			Look at 'em.  Automatons.  Don't 
			think about what they're- doing or
			why.  Computer tells 'em what to
			do and they do it.

					FRIEND #l
			Thc banality of evil.

	He slaps the money in Neo's hand.

					ANTHONY
			Thanks, neighbor.

					DUJOUR
			Why don't you come to the party
			with us?

					NEO
			I don't know.  I have to work
			tomorrow.

					DUJOUR
			Come on.  It'll be fun.

	He looks up at her and suddenly notices on her black
	leather motorcycle jacket dozens of pins:  bands,
	symbols, slogans, military medals and --

	A small white rabbit.

	The ROOM TILTS.

					NEO
			Yeah, yeah.  Sure, I'll go.


	INT.  APARTMENT

	An older Chicago apartment; a series of halls connects a 
	chain of small high-ceilinged rooms lined with heavy
	casements.

	Smoke hangs like a veil, blurring the few lights there 
	are.

	Dressed predominantly in black, people are everywhere,
	gathered in cliques around pieces of furniture like
	jungle cats around a tree.

	Neo stands against a wall, alone, sipping from a bottle
	of beer, feeling completely out of place, he is about to
	leave when he notices a woman staring at him.

	The woman is Trinity.  She walks straight up to him.

	In the nearest room, shadow-like figures grind against
	each other to the pneumatic beat of INDUSTRIAL MUSIC.

					TRINITY
			Hello, Neo.

					NEO
			How did you know that --

					TRINITY
			I know a lot about you.  I've been
			wanting to meet you for some time.

					NEO
			Who are you?

					TRINITY
			My name is Trinity.

					NEO
			Trinity?  The Trinity?  The
			Trinity that cracked the I.R.S.
			Kansas City D-Base?

					TRINITY
			That was a long time ago.

					NEO
			Gee-zus.

					TRINITY
			What?

					NEO
			I just thought... you were a guy.

					TRINITY
			Most guys do.

	Neo is a little embarrassed.

					NEO
			Do you want to go sorewhere and
			talk?

					TRINITY
			No.  It's safe here and I don't
			have much time.

	The MUSIC is so loud they must stand very close, talking
	directly into each other's ear.

					NEO
			That was you on the board tonight.
			That was your note, wasn't it?

					TRINITY
			I had to gamble that you would see
			and they wouldn't.

					NEO
			Who wouldn't?

					TRINITY
			I can't explain everything to you.
			I'm sure that it's all going to
			seem very strange, but I brought
			you here to warn you, Neo.  You
			are in a lot of danger.

					NEO
			What?  Why?

					TRINITY
			They're watching you.  Something
			happened and they found out about
			you.  Normally, if our target is
			exposed we let it go.  But this
			time, we can't do that.

					NEO
			I don't understand --

					TRINITY
			You came here because you wanted
			to know the answer to a hacker's
			question.

					NEO
			The Matrix.  What is the Matrix?

					TRINITY
			Twelve years ago I met a man, a
			great man, who said that no one
			could be told the answer to that
			question.  That they had to see
			it, to believe it.

	Her body is against his; her lips very close to his ear.

					TRINITY
			He told me that no one should look
			for the answer unless they have to
			because once you see it,
			everything changes.  Your life and
			the world you live in will never
			be the same.  It's as if you wake
			up one morning and the sky is
			falling.

	There is a hypnotic quality to her voice and Neo feels
	the words like a drug, seeping into him.

					TRINITY
			The truth is out there, Neo.  It's
			looking for you and it will find
			you, if you want it to.

	She takes hold of him with her eyes.

					TRINITY
			That's all I can tell you right
			now.  Good-bye, Neo.  And good
			luck.

					NEO
			Wait.  Who was it?  Who was the
			man?

	She leans close, her lips alrost touching his ear as she
	whispers.

					TRINITY
			You know who.

	She turns and he watches her melt into the shifting wall
	of bodies.

	A SOUND RISES steadily, growing out of the music,
	pressing in on Neo until it is all he can hear as we --

							CUT TO:


	INT.  NEO'S APARTMENT

	The sound is an ALARM CLOCK, slowly dragging Neo to
	consciousness.  He strains to read the clock face:
	9:15 A.M.

					NEO
			Shitshitshit.


	EXT.  SKYSCRAPER

	The downtown office of CorTechs, a software development
	company.


	INT.  CORTECHS OFFICE

	The main offices are along each wall, the windows
	overlooking downtown Chicago.

	RHINEHEART, the ultimate company man, lectures Neo
	without looking at him, typing at his computer
	continuously.

	Neo stares at two window cleaners on a scaffolding
	outside, dragging their rubber squeegees down across the
	surface of the glass.

					RHINEHEART
			You have a problem, Mr. Anderson.
			You think that you're special.
			You believe that somehow the rules
			do not apply to you.

	He stops, glancing over his glasses at Neo, who turns in
	time.

					RHINEHEART
			Obviously, you are mistaken.

	His long, bony fingers resume clicking the keyboard.

					RHINEHEART
			This company is one of the top
			software companies in the world
			because every single employee
			understands that they are a part
			of a whole.  Thus, if an employee
			has a problem, the company has a
			problem.

	He turns again.

					RHINEHEART
			The time has come to make a 
			choice, Mr. Anderson.  Either you
			choose to be at your desk on time
			from this day forth, or you choose
			to find yourself another job.  Do
			I make myself clear?

					NEO
			Yes, Mr. Rhineheart.  Perfectly
			clear.

	INT.  NEO'S CUBICLE

	The entire floor looks like a human honeycomb, with a
	labyrinth of cubicles structured around a core of
	elevators.

	Neo slumps down into his chair.  A TALL EMPLOYEE stands
	up in the adjacent cubicle, leaning over the partition.

					TALL EMPLOYEE
			What did he say?

					NEO
			If I was late again, I'm going to
			be fired.

	He smirks.

					TALL EMPLOYEE
			Well, it was nice working with
			you.

	Neo glares at him, as he sinks down.

					VOICE (O.S.)
			Thomas Anderson?

	Neo turns and finds a FEDERAL EXPRESS MAN at his cubicle
	door.

					NEO
			Yeah.  That's me.

	Neo signs the electronic pad and the Fedex guy hands him
	the softpak.

					FEDEX
			Have a nice day.

	He opens the bag.  Inside is a CELLULAR PHONE.  It seems
	the instant it is in his hand, it RINGS.  Unnerved, he
	flips it open.

					NEO
			Hello?

					MORPHEUS (V.O.)
			Hello, Neo.  This is Morpheus.

	Neo's knees give and he falls into his chair.

					MORPHEUS (V.O.)
			I had hoped for this conversation
			to take place under less adverse
			conditions, but you can never
			count on hope, can you, Neo?

					NEO
			... no.

					MORPHEUS (V.O.)
			I've been watching you, Neo, and I
			want to meet you.  I don't know if
			you're ready to see what I want to
			show you, but unfortunately, we
			have run out of time.  They're
			coming for you, Neo.  And I'm not
			sure what they're going to do.

					NEO
			Who's coming for me?

					MORPHEUS (V.O.)
			Stand up and see for yourself.

					NEO
			Right now?

					MORPHEUS (V.O.)
			Yes.  Now.

	Neo starts to stand.

					MORPHEUS (V.O.)
			Do it slowly.  Slowly.  The elevator.

	His head slowly peeks up over the partition.

	At the elevator, he sees Agent Brown and Agent Jones
	leading a group of cops.  A female employee turns and
	points out Neo's cubicle.

	Neo ducks.

					NEO
			Holy fuckin' shit!

					MORPHEUS (V.O.)
			Yes.

	One cop stays at the elevator, the others follow the
	agents.

					NEO
			What the fuck do they want with
			me?!

					MORPHEUS (V.O.)
			I'm not sure.  But, if you don't
			want to find out, you better get
			out of there.

					NEO
			How?!

					MORPHEUS (V.O.)
			I can guide you out, but you have
			to do exactly what I say.

	The agents are moving quickly towards the cubicle.

					MORPHEUS (V.O.)
			The cubicle across from you is
			empty.

					NEO
			But what if...?

					MORPHEUS (V.O.)
			Go!  Now!

	Neo lunges across the hall, diving into the other cubicle
	just as the agents turn into his row.

	Neo crams himself into a dark corner, clutching the phone
	tightly to him.

					MORPHEUS (V.O.)
			Stay here for a moment.

	The agents enter Neo's empty cubicle.  A cop is sent to
	search the bathroom.

	Morpheus' voice is a whisper in Neo's ear.

					MORPHEUS (V.O.)
			A little longer...

	Brown is talking to the tall employee.

					MORPHEUS (V.O.)
			When I tell you, go to the end of
			the row to the first office on the
			left, stay.as low as you can.

	Sweat trickles down his forehead.

					MORPHEUS (V.O.)
			Now.

	Neo rolls out of the cubicle, his eyes popping as he
	freezes right behind a cop who has just turned around.

	Staying crouched, he sneaks away, down the row, SHOOTING
	across the opening to the first office on the left.

	The room is empty.

					MORPHEUS (V.O.)
			Good.  Now there is a window.
			Open it.

					NEO
			How do you know all this?

	Morpheus laughs quietly.

					MORPHEUS (V.O.)
			The answer is coming, Neo.

	He opens the window.  The window howls into the room.

					MORPHEUS (V.O.)
			Outside, there's a scaffold.  You
			can use it to get to the roof.

	Leaning out the window, he sees that the scaffold is
	several offices away.

					NEO
			No! It's too far away.

					MORPHEUS (V.O.)
			There's a small ledge.  It's a
			short climb.  You can make it.

	Neo looks down; the building's glass wall vertigos into a
	concrete chasm.

					NEO
			No way, no way, this is crazy.

					MORPHEUS (V.O.)
			Don't be controlled by your fear,
			Neo.  There are only two ways out
			of this building.  One is that
			scaffold.  The other is in their
			custody.  You take a chance either
			way.  I leave it to you.

	CLICK.  He hangs up.  Neo looks at the door, then back at
	the scaffold.

					NEO
			This is insane!  Why is this
			happening to me?  What did I do?
			I'm nobody.  I didn't do anything.
			Fuck! Fuck!  Fuck!

	He climbs up onto the window ledge.  Hanging onto the
	frame, he steps onto the small ledge.

	The scaffold seems even farther away.

					NEO
			I'm going to die.

	The WIND suddenly BLASTS up the face of the building,
	knocking Neo off balance.  Recoiling, he clings harder to
	the frame, and the phone falls out of his hand.

	He watches as it is swallowed by the distance beneath him.

					NEO
			This is insane.  I can't do this!
			Forget it!

	He climbs back into the office just as a cop opens the
	door.

					NEO
			I didn't do anything!


	EXT.  SKYSCRAPER

	The agents lead a handcuffed Neo out of the revolving
	doors, forcing his head down as they push him into the
	dark sedan.

	Trinity watches in the rear view mirror of her
	motorcycle.

					TRINITY
			Shit.

	INT.  INTERROGATION ROOM - CLOSE ON CAMERA MONITOR

	A wide angle view of a white roon, where Neo is sitting at
	a table alone.

	We MOVE INTO the monitor, ENTERING the room as if the
	monitor were a window.

	At the same moment, the door opens and the agents enter.

	Smith sits down across from Neo.  A thick manila envelope
	slaps down on the table between them.

	Neo glances at the name on the file: "Anderson, Thomas 
	A."

					AGENT SMITH
			As you can see, we've had our eye
			on you for some time now, Mr.
			Anderson.

	He opens the file.  Paper rattle marks the silence as he
	flips several pages.  Neo cannot tell if he is looking at
	the file or at him.

					AGENT SMITH
			It seems that you have been living
			two lives.  In one life, you are
			Thomas A. Anderson, program writer
			for a respectable software
			company.  You have a social
			security number, you pay your
			taxes and you help your land lady
			carry out her garbage.

	The pages continue to turn.

					AGENT SMITH
			The other life is lived in
			computers where you go by the
			hacker alias Neo, and are guilty
			of virtually every computer crime
			we have a law for, including the
			unauthorized use of the D.M.V.
			system for the removal of
			automobile boots.

	Neo feels himself sinking into a pit of shit.

					AGENT SMITH
			One of these,lives has a future.
			One of them does not.

	He closes the file.

					AGENT SMITH
			I'm going to be as forthcoming as
			I can be, Mr. Anderson.  You are
			here because we need your help.

	He removes his sunglasses; his eyes are an unnatural ice-
	blue.

					AGENT SMITH
			We know that you have been
			contacted by a certain individual.
			A man who calls himself Morpheus.
			Whatever you think you know about
			this man is irrelevant to the fact
			that he is wanted for acts of
			terrorism in more countries than
			any other man in the world.  He is
			considered by many authorities to
			be the most dangerous man alive.

	He leans closer.

					AGENT SMITH
			My colleagues believe that I am
			wasting my time with you, but I
			believe you want to do the right
			thing.  It is obvious that you are
			an intelligent man, Mr. Anderson,
			and that you are interested in the
			future.  That is why I believe you
			are ready to put your past
			mistakes behind you and get on
			with your life.

	Neo tries to match his stare.

					AGENT SMITH
			We are willing to wipe the slate
			clean, to give you a fresh start
			and all we are asking in return is
			your cooperation in bringing a
			known terrorist to justice.

	Neo nods to himself.

					NEO
			Yeah.  Wow.  That sounds like a
			real good deal.  But I think I
			have a better one.  How about I
			give you the finger --

	He does.

					NEO
			And you can cram that file up your
			Secret Service sphincter.

	Agent Smith puts his glasses back on.

					AGENT SMITH
			You disappoint me, Mr. Anderson.

					NEO
			You ain't seen nothing yet.

					AGENT SMITH
			The irony of your situation is
			that you have no choice.

					NEO
			You can't scare me with this
			gestapo crap.  I know my rights.
			I want my phone call.

	Agent Smith smiles.

					AGENT SMITH
			And tell me, Mr. Anderson, what
			good is a phone call iy you are
			unable to speak?

	The question unnerves Neo and strangely, he begins to
	feel the muscles in his jaw tighten.

	The standing agents snicker, watching Neo's confusion
	grow into panic.

	Neo feels his lips grow soft and sticky as they slowly
	seal shut, melding into each other until all trace of his
	mouth is gone.

	Wild with fear, he lunges for the door but the agents
	restrain him holding him in the chair.

					AGENT SMITH
			You are going to help us, Mr.
			Anderson, whether you want to or
			not.

	Smith nods and the other two rip open his shirt.

	From a case taken out of his suit coat, Smith removes a
	long, fiber-optic wire tap.

	Neo struggles helplessly as Smith dangles the wire over
	his exposed abdomen.  Horrified, he watches as the
	electronic device animates, become an organic creature
	that resembles a hybrid of an insect and a fluke worm.

	Thin, whisker-like tendrils reach out and probe into
	Neo's navel.  He bucks wildly as Smith drops the creature
	which looks for a moment like an uncut umbilical cord --

	Before it begins to burrow its, tail thrashing as it
	worms its way inside.


	INT.  NEO'S APARTMENT - NIGHT

	Screaming, Neo bolts upright in bed.

	He realizes that he is home.  Was it a dream?  His mouth
	is normal.  His stomach looks fine.  He starts to take a
	deep, everything-is-okay breath, when --

	The PHONE RINGS.

	It almost stops his heart.  It CONTINUES RINGING,
	building pressure in the room, forcing him up out of bed,
	sucking him in with an almost gravitational force.

	He answers it, saying nothing.

					MORPHEUS (V.O.).
			This line is tapped, so I must be
			brief.

					NEO
			The agents --

					MORPHEUS (V.O.)
			They got to you first, but they've
			underestimated how important you
			are.  If they knew what I know,
			you would probably be dead.

	Neo feels sick.

					MORPHEUS (V.O.)
			I don't know what you are thinking
			right now but I want you to
			understand that I will not give up
			on you until you give up on me.

	Neo's throat cracks, dry as the Sahara.

					MORPHEUS (V.O.)
			Do you still want to meet?

					NEO
			... Yes.

					MORPHEUS (V.O.)
			Take the Howard line south.

	CLICK.  He closes his eyes, unsure of what he has done.


	EXT.  EL TRAIN

	An EL TRAIN RAGES against its metal rails.


	INT.  TRAIN

	It is three a.m., and the train carries the usual urban
	night crawlers.  Neo sits alone, eyes shifting, watching
	everything nervously.

	There is a METAL BANG and TRAIN CLATTER fills the car as
	the door is opened.

	Neo turns and sees a large man enter.  He is wearing
	sunglasses and a black leather jacket.  His name is APOC
	and he walks straight at Neo.

					APOC
			Come with me.

	Neo stands just as the door at the opposite end opens and
	two police officers rush in, drawing their guns.

	Apoc grabs Neo, muscling him to the nearest exit.  There
	is no upcoming station.

	Apoc yanks the emergency brake and the train buckles
	against its own speed.  The cops are thrown back.  Neo
	slams against the metal rail.

	The doors open onto nothing and just when Neo regains his
	balance, Apoc shoves him backwards --

	He flies out from the train, arms windrilling as he falls
	from, the raised tracks --

	Hurtling towards a busy city street when, out of nowhere,
	a truck races under him and --

	He crashes into a large dumpster-bed filled with empty
	boxes.


	INT.  TRUCK BED

	Still shaking his head, Neo realizes he is not alone.  A
	man named Cabie is aiming a big gun at him.  Trinity is
	next to him, talking into a cellular phone.

					TRINITY
			We got him.  Call the chop-shop.

	She hangs up.

					TRINITY
			Listen to me, Neo.  You have to,
			trust us.

	She tears off a long strip of black duct-tape and reaches
	for his face.

					NEO
			What are you doing?

					TRINITY
			This has to be done for your
			protection and ours.

	She seals his eyes shut with the tape.

					TRINITY
			You can't understand right now,
			but if you're not one of us,
			you're one of them.


	EXT.  LOWER WACKER

	A featureless black van glides up to a staircase that
	curls down from the city's surface.

	trinity guides the blind Neo down the steps.  The back of
	the van slaps open, revealing a young, skinny man who
	looks to be still in his teens, wearing an outfit that is
	a cross between a surgeon and a telephone repair man.

	His name is GIZMO and he smiles lewdly at Trinity,
	exposing his teeth that are wired with weird-looking
	braces.

					GIZMO
			Va va va voom.  Still the hottest
			software around.

					TRINITY
			Hello, Gizmo.

	Neo hears the voices around him.

					GIZMO
			This is really the guy?  The guy
			that Morpheus thinks --

					TRINITY
			Yeah.

					GIZMO
			But he's so old.

					TRINITY
			Are you going to help us or aren't
			you?

					GIZMO
			Hacksaw.  Load up the copper-top
			and let's get the hell outta here.

	Hacksaw is a huge man in a leather welder's apron.  He
	shoulders Neo and hauls him into the van.

	A moment later the green lights of Lower Wacker curve
	over the tinted windshield as the van rushes through the
	underworld.


	INT.  VAN

	The chop-shop is filled with electronic gadgets, wired to
	meters and monitors.  There are shelves lined with
	medical supplies and rows of hanging tools, knives,
	cleavers, and stainless steel clamps.

	Neo is strapped down to an ambulance cart, listening
	nervously as Gizmo gets to work.

					GIZMO
			Okay, first we take a little look
			under the hood.

	He pulls up the goggles hanging at his neck and they
	blink to life with tiny halogen lights and lenses irising
	to varying levels of magnification.

					GIZMO
			You're going to feel a little
			prick.

	He inserts acupuncture-like needles into Neo's lower
	abdomen.  The needles are wired to video monitors.
	Hacksaw pilots the fiber-optic lens.

					NEO
			What are you doing?

					TRINITY
			We think you're bugged.  We can't
			take you to Morpheus until you're
			clean.

					GIZMO
			There it is.

	On a monitor, we see the bug nestled in among Neols large
	intestines.

					GIZMO
			Hit him with 10 ccs of local.

	Hacksaw loads a hypodermic needle and pumps an anesthetic
	around Neols navel.

	Using a device that looks like a miniature speculum,
	Gizmo inserts a knuckled dental pick.  Typing into a
	calculator keypad wired to the pick, he automates the
	tip.

	On the monitor, we watch it telescope out and the end
	separate into a tiny hooked, metal claw.

					GIZMO
			Here, kitty, kitty, kitty.

	The claw snags hold of the bug.

					GIZMO
			Gotcha!

	But the bug reacts violently.  Neo screams as it wraps
	itself around the soft tissue web of intestine.

					GIZMO
			Shit.

					TRINITY
			What's happening?

					GIZMO
			I don't know.  They've never done
			that before.

	Neo writhes in pain.

					GIZMO
			Hold him down.

					NEO
			Jesus!  God!

					TRINITY
			Do something!

					GIZMO
			I got it!  Maybe we can stun it.

					TRINITY
			Are you crazy?  That will kill
			him.

	We watch Neo, who can't see what they are talking about.

					GIZMO
			It'll work.  Come on, do it or
			Hacksaw will.

					NEO
			Do what?

	The instant he hears the word, he knows.

					TRINITY
			Clear.

					NEO
			Oh, shit --

	The cry is frozen in his mouth as the paddles hit his
	chest.  Gizmo wrestles with the bug.

					GIZMO
			Hit him again!

	Again, the electricity convulses through him as Gizmo
	yanks the speculum out.

					GIZMO
			Got it!

	Trinity touches Neo, who is just beginning to breathe.
	She eases the tape off his eyes.

					TRINITY
			Neo, are you okay?

	He nods.

					TRINITY
			It's over.  We got it.

	Hanging from the claw pick is the inanimate metal wire-
	tap.

					GIZMO
			Nasty little bugger, ain't it?


	INT.  HOTEL LAFAYETTE

	The van stops in a deserted alley behind a forgotten
	hotel.  The doors open and Trinity helps Neo get out.

					TRINITY
			Thanks for your help, Gizmo.

					GIZMO
			I just hope the man knows what
			he's doing.

	She nods then climbs out of the van.  Gizmo ogles the
	tight leather pants.

					GIZMO
			Goddamn, what I wouldn't give for
			a copy of that software.

	Trinity turns around.

					TRINITY
			Gizmo, you don't have the hardware
			to handle this software.

	He howls with adolescent laughter as the van pulls away.
	Trinity turns to Neo.

					TRINITY
			Let's go.  He's waiting.


	INT.  HOTEL LAFAYETTE

	It is a place of putrefying elegance, a rotting host of
	urban maggotry.

	Trinity leads Neo from the stairwell down the hall of the
	thirteenth floor.  They stop outside room 1313.

					TRINITY
			This is it.

	Neo can hear his own heart pounding.

					TRINITY
			Let me give one piece of advice.
			Be honest.  He knows more than you
			can possibly imagine.


	INT.  ROOM 1313

	Across the room, a dark figure stares out the tall
	windows veiled with decaying lace.  He turns and his
	smile lights up the room.

					MORPHEUS
			At last.

	He wears a long black coat and his eyes are invisible
	behind circular mirrored glasses.

	He strides to Neo and they shake hands.

					MORPHEUS
			Welcome, Neo.  As you no doubt
			have guessed, I am Morpheus.

					NEO
			It's an honor.

					MORPHEUS
			Please.  Come.  Sit.

	He nods to Trinity.

					MORPHEUS
			Thank you, Trinity.

	She bows her head sharply and exits through a door to an
	adjacent room.

	They sit across from one another in cracked, burgundy-
	leather chairs.

					MORPHEUS
			I imagine, right now, you must be
			feeling a bit like Alice, tumbling
			down the rabbit hole?

					NEO
			You could say that.

					MORPHEUS
			I can see it in your eyes.  You
			have the look of a man who accepts
			what he sees because he is
			expecting to wake up.

	A smile, razor-thin, curls the corner of his lips.

					MORPHEUS
			Ironically, this is not far from
			the truth.  But I'm getting ahead
			of myself.  Can you tell me, Neo,
			why are you here?

					NEO
			You're Morpheus, you're a legend.
			Most hackers would die to meet
			you.

					MORPHEUS
			Yes.  Thank you.  But I think we
			both know there's more to it than 
			that.  Do you believe in fate, Neo?

					NEO
			No.

					MORPHEUS
			Why not?

					NEO
			Because I don't like the idea that
			I'm not in control of my life.

					MORPHEUS
			I know exactly what you mean.

	Again, that smile that could cut glass.

					MORPHEUS
			Let me tell you why you are here.
			You are here because you have the
			gift.

					NEO
			What gift?

					MORPHEUS
			I've watched you, Neo.  You do not
			use a computer like a tool.  You
			use it like it was part of
			yourself.  What you can do inside
			a computer is not normal.  I know.
			I've seen it.  What you do is
			magic.

	Neo shrugs.

					NEO
			It's not magic.

					MORPHEUS
			But it is, Neo.  It is.  How else
			would you describe what has been
			happening to you?

	He leans forward.

					MORPHEUS
			We are trained in this world to
			accept only what is rational and
			logical.  Have you ever wondered
			why?

	Neo shakes his head.

					MORPHEUS
			As children, we do not separate
			the possible from the impossible
			which is why the younger a mind is
			the easier it is to free while a
			mind like yours can be very
			difficult.

					NEO
			Free from what?

					MORPHEUS
			From the Matrix.

	Neo locks at his eyes but only sees a reflection of
	himself.

					MORPHEUS
			Do you want to know what it is,
			Neo?

	Neo swallows and nods his head.

					MORPHEUS
			It's that feeling you have had all
			your life.  That feeling that
			something was wrong with the
			world.  You don't know what it is
			but it's there, like a splinter in
			your mind, driving you mad,
			driving you to me.  But what is
			it?

	The LEATHER CREAKS as he leans back.

					MORPHEUS
			The Matrix is everywhere, it's all
			around us, here even in this room.
			You can see it out your window, or
			on your television.  You feel it
			when you go to work, or go to
			church or pay your taxes.  It is
			the world that has been pulled
			over your eyes to blind you from
			the truth.

					NEO
			What truth?

					MORPHEUS
			That you are a slave, Neo.  That
			you, like everyone else, was born
			into bondage...
			... kept inside a prison that you
			cannot smell, taste, or touch.  A
			prison for your mind.

	Outside, the WIND BATTERS a loose PANE of glass.

					MORPHEUS
			Unfortunately, no one can be told
			what the Matrix is.  You have to
			see it for yourself.

					NEO
			How?

					MORPHEUS
			Hold out your hands.

	In Neo's right hand, Morpheus drops a red pill.

					MORPHEUS
			This is your last chance.  After
			this, there is no going back.

	In his left, a blue pill.

					MORPHEUS
			You take the blue pill and the
			story ends.  You wake in your bed
			and you believe whatever you want
			to believe.

	The pills in his open hands are reflected in the glasses.

					MORPHEUS
			You take the red pill and you stay
			in Wonderland and I show you how
			deep the rabbit-hole goes.

	Neo feels the smooth skin of the capsules, with the
	moisture growing in his palms.

					MORPHEUS
			Remember that all I am offering is
			the truth.  Nothing more.

	Neo opens his mouth and swallows the red pill.  The
	Cheshire smile returns.

					MORPHEUS
			Follow me.

	He leads Neo into the other room, which is cramped with
	high-tech equipment, glowing ash-bliie and electric green
	from the racks of monitors.

	Trinity, Apoc and Cypher look up as they enter.

					CYPHER
			Shit.

					TRINITY
			I knew he would.

	Cypher saddles up to Morpheus, talking in a hushed tone
	away from, Neo.

					CYPHER
			Morpheus, I know what you believe
			but I think this is a mistake.
			We're rushing him.  He's old.  I'm
			afraid he might pop.

					MORPHEUS
			Haven't I always told you, Cypher,
			not to let fear control your life.
			Apoc, are we on-line?

	Neo recognizes the large man from the El train.

					APOC
			Almost.

	He and Trinity are working quickly, hardwiring a complex
	system of monitors, modules and drives.

					NEO
			Apoc?  You wrote the Four Horsemen
			Virus.

					APOC
			That's right.

					MORPHEUS
			Neo, time is always against us.
			Will you take a seat there?

	In the center of the room sits a chair.  Near the chair
	is an old oval dressing mirror that is cracked.

					MORPHEUS
			I imagine you know sonething about
			virtual reality.

	Neo sits and Trinity begins gently fixing white electrode
	disks to his head, arns, and the back of his neck.

					NEO
			A little.

					MORPHEUS
			Tell me about it.

					NEO
			Essentially, it's a hardware
			system that uses an apparatus;
			headgear, gloves and whatever to
			make you feel that you are in a
			computer program.

					MORPHEUS
			If the virtual reality apparatus,
			as you called it, was wired to all
			of your senses and controlled them
			completely, would you be able to
			tell the difference between the
			virtual world and the real world?

					NEO
			You might not, no.

					MORPHEUS
			No, you wouldn't.

	Neo whispers to Trinity.

					NEO
			You did all this?

	She nods, placing a set of headphones over his ears.
	They are wired to an old hotel phone.

					MORPHEUS
			The pill you took is part of a
			trace program.  It's going to make
			things feel a bit strange.

	Distantly, through the ear phones, he hears Apoc POUNDING
	on a KEYBOARD.  Sweat beads his face.  His eyes blink and
	twitch when he notices the mirror.

	Wide-eyed he stares as it begins to heal itself, a
	webwork of cracks that slowly run together as though the
	mirror were becoming liquid.

					NEO
			Shit...

	Cypher works with Apoc checking reams of phosphorescent
	data.  Trinity monitors Neo's electric vital signs.

	Neo reaches out to touch the mirror and his fingers
	disappear beneath the rippling surface.

	Quickly, he tries to pull his fingers out but the mirror
	stretches in long rubbery strands like mirrored-taffy
	stuck to his fingertips.

					NEO
			What is this?  Mescaline?

					MORPHEUS
			Just relax, Neo.

	The strands thin like rubber cement as he pulls away,
	until the fragile wisps of mirror thread break.

	With the TINKLING of GLASS, shimmering snowflakes
	of electric-blinking mercury fall, hit the ground, and
	fade.

	He looks at his hand; fingers distended into mirrored
	icicles that begin to melt rapidly, dripping, running
	like wax down his fingers, spreading across his palms
	where he sees his face reflected.

					NEO
			Uh-oh...

					TRINITY
			It's going into replication.

					MORPHEUS
			Apoc?

					APOC
			Still nothing.

	Morpheus takes out a cellular phone and dials a number.

					MORPHEUS
			Tank, we're going to need the
			signal soon.  Stay calm, Neo.

	The mirror gel seems to come to life, racing, crawling up
	his arns like hundreds of insects.

					NEO
			It's cold.

	The mirror creeps up his neck as Neo begins to panic,
	tipping his head as though he were sinking into the
	mirror, trying to keep his mouth up.

					NEO
			It's all over me --

	Morpheus is right next to him, with the phone.

					TRINITY
			I got a fibrillation!

					CYPHER
			I knew it, I knew it...

					MORPHEUS
			Shit!  Apoc?

	Streams of mercury run from Neo's nose.

					APOC
			Targeting... almost there.

	An ALARM, on Trinity's monitor ERUPTS.

					TRINITY
			He's going into arrest!

					CYPHER
			He's gonna pop!

					APOC
			Lock!  I got him!

					MORPHEUS
			Now, Tank now!

	His eyes tear with mirror, rolling up and closing as a
	high-pitched ELECTRIC SCREAM ERUPTS in the headphones --

	It is a piercing SHRIEK like a computer calling to
	another computer --

	Neo's body arches in agony and we are pulled like we were
	pulled into the holes of the phone

	Sucked into his SCREAM and swallowed by darkness.


	INT.  POWER PLANT - CLOSE ON MAN'S BODY

	Floating in a womb-red amnion.

	His body spasms, fighting against the thick gelatin.

	Metal tubes, surreal versions of hospital tubes, obscure
	his face.  Other lines like IVs are connected to limbs
	and cover his genitals.

	He is struggling desperately now.  Air bubbles into the
	Jell-O but does not break the surface.

	Pressing up, the surface distends, stretching like a red
	rubber coccon.

	Unable to breathe, he fights wildly to stand, clawing at
	the thinning elastic shroud --

	Until it ruptures, a hole widening around his mouth as he
	sucks for air.  Tearing himself free, he emerges from the
	cell.

	It is Neo.

	He is bald and naked, his body slick with gelatin.
	Dizzy, nauseous, he waits for his vision to focus.

	He is standing in an oval capsule of clear alloy filled
	with red gelatin, the surface of which has solidified
	like curdled milk.

	The IVs in his arms are plugged into outlets that appear
	to be grafted to his flesh.

	He feels the weight of another cable and reaches to the
	back of his head where he finds an enormous coaxial
	plugged and locked into the base of his skull.

	He tries to pull it out but it would be easier to pull
	off a finger.

	To either side he sees other tube-shaped pods filled with
	red gelatin; beneath the wax-like surface, pale and
	motionless, he sees other human beings.

	Fanning out in a circle, there are more.  All connected
	to a center core, each capsule like a red, dimly glowing
	petal attached to a black metal stem.

	Above him, level after, level, the stem rises seemingly
	forever.  He moves to the foot of the capsule and looks
	out.

	The image assaults his mind.

	Towers of glowing petals spiral up to incomprehensible
	heights, disappearing down into a dim murk like an
	underwater abyss.

	His sight is blurred and warped, exaggerating the
	intensity of the vision.  The sound of the PLANT is like
	the sound of the ocean heard from inside the belly of
	Leviathan.

	Below Neo, a petal detaches from the stem, bearing away
	the body of an old man like an automated barge even as a
	new pod rises up and plugs itself into the empty space.

	Inside the new capsule, its surface more translucent and
	pinkish in color, Neo sees a small baby.

	From above, a machine drops directly in front of Neo.

	He swallows his scream as it seems to stare at him.

	It is almost insect-like in its design; beautiful
	housings of alloyed metal covering organic-like systems
	of hard and soft polymers.

	A black particle beam washes over Neo, he reacts in pain
	as the scanner seems to expose the nervous system wired
	to the coaxial cable at his cerebral cortex.

	At the back of the neck, the cable lock spins and opens,
	disengaging.

	The cable pulls itself free, a long clear plastic needle
	and cerebrum-chip slides from the anterior of Neols skull
	with an ooze of blood and spinal fluid.  The other
	connective hoses snap free and snake away as --

	The back of the unit opens and a tremendous vacuum, like
	an airplane door opening, sucks the gelatin and then Neo
	into a black hole.


	INT.  WASTE LINE

	The pipe is a waste disposal system and Neo falls,
	sliding with the clot of gelatin.

	Banking through pipe spirals and elbows, flushing up
	through grease traps clogged with cily clunps of
	cellulite.

	Neo begins to drown when he is suddenly snatched from the
	flow of waste.

	The metallic cable then lifts, pulling him up into the
	belly of the futuristic flying nachine, hovering inside
	the sewer main line.


	INT.  HOVERCRAFT

	The metal harness opens and drops the half-conscious Neo
	onto the floor.

	Human hands and arms help him up as he finds himself
	looking straight at Morpheus.

	Trinity and Apoc.  And others, dressed in bizarre, high-
	tech combat gear.

	Morpheus smiles.

					MORPHEUS
			Welcome to the real world, Neo.

	Neo passes out.

									FADE TO BLACK.

	We have no sense of time.  We hear VOICES whispering.

					MAN (O.S.)
			Do you think Morpheus is right?
			Do you think he could be the One?

					WOMAN (O.S.)
			It doesn't matter now.  But if
			he's wrong...

	FADE IN:

	NEO'S POV

	Neo's eyes flutter open.  We see Trinity's face above us,
	angelic in the fluorescent glow of a light stick.


	ANGLE ON NEO

					NEO
			... am I dead?

					TRINITY
			Far from it.

									FADE TO BLACK.


	FADE IN:


	ANGLE ON NEO

	He opens his eyes again, something tingling through him.
	He focuses and sees his body pierced with dozens of
	acupuncture-like needles wired to a strange device.

					DOZER
			He needs a lot of work.

					MORPHEUS
			I know.

	Dozer and Morpheus are operating on Neo.

					NEO
			What are you doing?

					MORPHEUS
			Your muscles have atrophied.
			We're rebuilding them.

	Fluorescent light sticks burn unnaturally bright.

					NEO
			Why do my eyes hurt?

					MORPHEUS
			You've never used them before.

	Morpheus takes his sunglasses off and puts them on Neo.
	Neo lays back.

					MORPHEUS
			Rest, Neo.  The answers are
			coming.


	INT.  NEO'S ROOM

	Neo wakes up from a deep sleep, feeling better.  He is
	wearing a black tank top and shorts.

	He begins to examine himself.  There is a futuristic IV
	plugged into the jack in his forearm.  He pulls it out,
	staring at the grafted outlet.

	He feels his bald head.  His fingers find and explore the
	large outlet in the base of his skull.

	Just as he starts to come unglued, Morpheus opens the
	door.

					NEO
			Morpheus, what's happened to me?
			What is this place?

					MORPHEUS
			More important than what is when?

					NEO
			When?

					MORPHEUS
			You believe the year is 1997 when
			in fact it is much closer to 2197.
			I can't say for certain what year
			it is because we honestly do not
			know.

	The wind is knocked from Neo's chest.

					NEO
			That's not possible.

					MORPHEUS
			I promised you the truth, Neo, and
			the truth is that the world you
			were living in was a lie.

					NEO
			How?

					MORPHEUS
			I'll show you.


	INT.  HOVERCRAFT

	Like a sleepwalker, Neo follows Morpheus through the ship.

					MORPHEUS
			This is my ship, the
			Nebuchadnezzar.  It's a
			hovercraft.  Small like a
			submarine.  It's dark.  It's
			cramped and cold.  But it's home.

	They climb a ladder up to the main deck.


	INT.  MAIN DECK

	Everyone is there.

					MORPHEUS
			This is the main deck.  You know
			most of my crew.

	Trinity smiles and nods.

					MORPHEUS
			The ones you don't know.  That's
			Mouse and Switch.  The two big
			guys are Tank and Dozer.

	The names and faces wash meaninglessly over Neo.

					MORPHEUS
			And this, this is the Core.  This
			is where we broadcast our pirate
			signal and hack into the Matrix.

	It is a swamp of bizarre electronic equipment.  Vines of
	coaxial hang and snake to and from huge monolithic
	battery slabs, a black portable satellite dish and banks
	of little systems and computer monitors.

	At the center of the web, there are six ectoskeleton
	chairs made of a poly-alloy frame and suspension harness.

	Near the circle of chairs is the control console and
	operator's station where the network is monitored.

					MORPHEUS
			Help him, Trinity.

	Neo allows himself to be helped into one of the chairs.

					MORPHEUS
			Do you remember when I asked you
			about an apparatus that could turn
			a virtual reality into reality?

	Neo nods.

					MORPHEUS
			It's right here.

	He touches Neo's head.

					MORPHEUS
			And it's accessed here.

	Neo feels Morpheus guiding a coaxial line into the jack
	at the back of his neck.  The cable has the same kind of
	cerebellum chip we saw inside the plant.

					MORPHEUS
			This will feel a little weird.

	There are several disturbing NOISES as he works the
	needle in.

	We MOVE IN as Neo's shoulders bunch and his face tightens
	into a grimace until a loud CLICK fires and his ears pop
	like when you equalize them underwater.

	He relaxes, opening his eyes as we pull back to a feeling
	of weightlessness inside another place --


	INT.  CONSTRUCT

	Neo is standing in an empty, blank-white space.

					MORPHEUS
			This is the Construct.

	Startled, Neo whips around and finds Morpheus now in the
	room with him.

					MORPHEUS
			It is our loading program.  We can
			load anything from clothes, to
			weapons, to training simulations.
			Anything we need.

	Morpheus walks past Neo and when Neo turns he sees the
	two leather chairs from the hotel set up in front of a
	large-screen television.

					MORPHEUS
			Sit down.

	Neo stands at the back of the chair as Morpheus sits.

					NEO
			Right now, we're inside a computer
			program?

					MORPHEUS
			Wild, isn't it?

	Neo's hands run over the cracked leather.

					NEO
			This isn't real?

					MORPHEUS
			What is real?  How do you define
			real?  If you're talking about
			your senses, what you feel, taste,
			smell, or see, then all you're
			talking about are electrical
			signals interpreted by your brain.

	He picks up a remote control and clicks ON the
	TELEVISION.  We drift through the Windy City circa 1996.

					MORPHEUS
			This is the Chicago you know.
			Chicago as it was at the end of
			the twentieth century.  This
			Chicago exists only as part of a
			neural-interactive simulation that
			we call the Matrix.

	We GLIDE AT the television as he changes the channel.

					MORPHEUS
			You have been living inside
			Baulliaurd's vision, inside the
			map, not the territory.  This is
			Chicago as it exists today.

	The sky is an endless sea of black and green bile.  The
	earth, scorched and split like burnt flesh, spreads out
	beneath us as we ENTER the television.

					MORPHEUS
			'The desert of the real.'

	In the distance, we see the ruins of a future Chicago
	protruding from the wasteland like the blackened ribs of
	a long-dead corpse.

					MORPHEUS
			We are, right now, miles below the
			earth's surface.  The only place
			humans can survive outside the
			Matrix is underground.

	Still MOVING, we TURN and find Neo and Morpheus; the
	chairs now sitting in the middle of the black desert.
	Dizzy, Neo holds onto the chair.

					NEO
			What happened?

					MORPHEUS
			It started early in the twenty-
			first century, with the birth of
			artificial intelligence, a
			singular consciousness that
			spawned an entire race of
			machines.

	In his sunglasses, we see storm clouds gather.

					MORPHEUS
			At first all they wanted was to be
			treated as equals, entitled to the
			same human inalienable rights.
			Whatever they were given, it was
			not enough.

	In the circular window of the glasses, EXPLOSIONS light
	up a bloody battle field.

					MORPHEUS
			We don't know who struck first.
			Us or them.  But sometime at the
			end of the twenty-first century
			the battle was joined.

	We MOVE INTO his glasses and the war surrounds us.

					MORPHEUS
			The war raged for generations and
			turned the face of our planet from
			green and blue to black and red.

	At last we see the Sentinels; killing machines that are
	at once terrifying and beautiful.  They have an organic
	architecture like a microbiotic organism, that is
	perpetually in motion.

	The Sentinel cracks the body armor of a soldier,
	splitting open the soft, stearing meat inside.

					MORPHEUS
			It scorched and burned the sky.
			Without the sun, the machines
			sought out a new energy source to
			survive.

	The Sentinel locks up, as heat lightning of black ink
	bursts against the sky, spreading into a permanent cloud
	of stain.

					MORPHEUS
			They discovered a new form of
			fusion.  All that was required to
			initiate the reaction was a small
			electric charge.  Throughout human
			history we have been dependent on
			machines to survive.  Fate, it
			seems, is not without a sense of
			irony.

	We return to the power plant that Neo escaped from where
	we see human beings looking almost blissful in their
	gelatin cocoons.

					MORPHEUS
			The human body generates more bio-
			electricity than a 120-volt
			battery and over 25,000 B.T.U.'s
			of body heat.

	Outside, spreading all around the power plant, beneath a
	breathing greenhouse, are the growing fields.

					MORPHEUS
			We are, as an energy source,
			easily renewable and completely
			recyclable, the dead liquified and
			fed intravenously to the living.

	Huge farm-like reapers are harvesting the crop.

					MORPHEUS
			All they needed to control this
			new battery was something to
			occupy our mind.

	We see inside a clear tubular husk.  Floating in viscous
	fluid, there is a human fetus; its soft skull already
	growing around the brain-jack.

					MORPHEUS
			And so they built a prison out of
			our past, wired it to our brains
			and turned us into slaves.

	We PULL BACK to find the image is now on the television
	and we are again inside the white space of the Construct.

					NEO
			No!  I don't believe it!  It's not
			possible!

					MORPHEUS
			I didn't say that it would be
			easy, Neo.  I just said that it
			would be the truth.

	The room without walls begins to spin.

					NEO
			Stop!  Let me out!  I want out!


	INT.  MAIN DECK

	His eyes snap open and he thrashes against the chair,
	trying to rip the cable from the back of his neck.

					NEO
			Get this thing out of me!

					TRINITY
			Easy, Neo.  Easy.

	Dozer holds him while Trinity unlocks it.  Once it's out,
	he tears away from them, falling as he trips free of the
	harness.

					NEO
			Don't touch me!  Get away from me!

	On his hands and knees, he reels as the world spins.
	Sweat pours off him as a pressure builds inside his skull
	as if his brian had been put into a centrifuge.

					CYPHER
			He's going to pop!

	Vomiting violently, Neo pitches forward and blacks out.


	INT.  NEO'S ROOM

	He blinks, regaining consciousness.  The room is dark.
	Neo is stretched out on his bed.

					NEO
			I can't go back, can I?

	Morpheus sitting like a shadow on a chair in the far
	corner.

					MORPHEUS
			No.  But if you could, would you
			really want to?

	Neo isn't sure of that answer.

					MORPHEUS
			I feel that I owe you an apology.
			There is a rule that we do not
			free a mind once it reaches a
			certain age.  It is dangerous.
			They have trouble letting go..
			Their mind turns against them.
			I've seen it happen.  I broke the
			rule because I had to.

	He stares into the darkness, confessing as much to
	himself as Neo.

					MORPHEUS
			When the Matrix was first built
			there was a man born inside that
			had the ability to change what he
			wanted, to remake the Matrix as he
			saw fit.  It was this man that
			freed the first of us and taught
			us the secret of the war; control
			the Matrix and you control the
			future.

	He pauses.

					MORPHEUS
			When he died, the Oracle at the
			temple of Zion prophesied his
			return and envisioned an end to
			the war and freedom for our
			people.  That is why there are
			those of us that have spent our
			entire lives searching the Matrix,
			looking for him.

	Neo can feel his eyes on him.

					MORPHEUS
			I did what I did, because I
			believe we have been brought here
			for a reason, Neo.  You are here
			to serve a purpose, just as I am
			here to serve mine.

					NEO
			I told you I don't believe in
			fate.

	Morpheus smiles, leaning towards hin.

					MORPHEUS
			But I do, Neo.  I do.

	He stands up.

					MORPHEUS
			Get some rest.  You're going to
			need it.

					NEO
			For what?

					MORPHEUS
			Your training.



	INT.  HOVERCRAFT

	There is no morning; there is only darkness and then the
	fluorescent light sticks flicker on.


	INT.  NEO'S ROOM

	Neo is awake in his bed, staring up at the lights.  The
	door opens and TA.NK steps inside.

					TANK
			Morning.  Did you sleep?

					NEO
			No.

					TANK
			You will tonight.  I guarantee it.
			I'm Tank.  I'll be your operator.

	He offers his hand and Neo shakes it.  He notices that
	Tank doesn't have any jacks.

					NEO
			You don't have...

					TANK
			Any holes?  Nope.  Me and my
			brother Dozer, we are 100 percent
			pure, old fashioned, home-grown
			human.  Born free.  Right here in
			the real world.  Genuine child of
			Zion.

					NEO
			Zion?

					TANK
			Zion is the place, man.  You'll
			see it one day.  Last human city.
			All we got left.

	Tank smiles.

					TANK
			Goddamn, I got to tell you I'm
			fairly excited to see what you are
			capable of.  I mean if Morpheus is
			right and all.  We're not supposed
			to talk.about any of that, but if
			you are, well then this is an
			exciting time.  We got a lot to do
			so let's get to it.


	INT.  MAIN DECK

	Neo is plugged in, hanging in one of the suspension
	chairs.

					TANK
			We're supposed to load all these
			operations programs first, but
			this is some major boring shit.
			Why don't we start something a
			little fun?

	Tank smiles as he plops into his operator's chair.  He
	begins flipping through a tall carousel loaded with micro
	discs.

					TANK
			How about sore combat training?

	Neo reads the label on the disk.

					NEO
			Jiujitsu?  I'm going to learn
			jujitsu?

	Tank slides the disk into Neo's supplement drive.

					NEO
			No way.

	Smiling, Tank punches the "load" code.

	His body jumps against the harness as his eyes clamp
	shut.  The monitors kick wildly as his heart pounds,
	adrenaline surges, and his brain sizzles.

	An instant later his eyes snap open.

					NEO
			Holy shit!

					TANK
			Hey, Mikey, he likes it!  Ready
			for more?

					NEO
			Hell yes!


	INT.  MAIN DECK - CLOSE ON COMPUTER MONITOR - LATER

	as grey pixels slowly fill a small, half-empty box.  It
	is a meter displaying how much download time is left.

	The title bar reads:  "Combat Series 10 of 12," file
	categories flashing beneath it:  Savate, Jujitsu, Ken Po,
	Drunken Boxing...

	Morpheus walks in.

					MORPHEUS
			How is he?

	Tank looks at his watch, rubs his eyes.

					TANK
			Ten hours straight.  He's a
			machine.

	Neo's body spasms and relaxes as his eyes open, breath
	hissing from his lips.  He looks like he just orgasmed.

	He locks at Morpheus.

					NEO
			This is incredible.  I know Kung
			Fu.

	Morpheus sits in the drive chair next to hin.  He nods to
	Tank.

					MORPHEUS
			Show me.


	INT.  DOJO

	They are standing in a very sparse japanese-style dojo.

					MORPHEUS
			This is a sparring program,
			similar to the programmed reality
			of the Matrix.  Consider this your
			first lesson.

	He assumes a fighting stance.

					MORPHEUS
			Attack me.

	Neo assumes a similar stance, cautiously circling until
	he gives a short cry and launches a furious attack.

	It is like a Jackie Chan movie at high speed, fists and
	feet striking from every angle as Neo presses his attack
	--

	But each and every blow is blocked by effortless speed.


	INT.  MAIN DECK

	While their minds battle in the programmed reality, the
	two bodies appear quite serene, suspended in the drive
	chairs.

	Tank monitors their life systems noticing that Neo is
	wildly and chaotically lit up as opposed to the slow and
	steady rhythm of Morpheus.


	INT.  MESS HALL

	Dinner is up.  Everyone is eating bowls of single-cell
	protein.  It has a cottage cheese consistency.

	MOUSE bursts in the room.

					MOUSE
			Morpheus is fighting Neo!

	All at once they bolt for the door.


	INT.  DOJO

	Neo's face is knotted, teeth clenched, as he hurls
	himself at Morpheus.

					MORPHEUS
			Good.  Adaption.  Improvisation.
			But your weakness isn't your
			technique.

	Morpheus attacks him and it is like nothing we have seen.
	His feet and fists are everywhere taking Neo apart.  For
	every blow Neo blocks, five more hit their marks until --

	Neo falls.

	Panting, on his hands and knees, blood spits fror, his
	mouth speckling the white floor of the Dojo.

					MORPHEUS
			How did I beat you?

					NEO
			You -- You're too fast.

					MORPHEUS
			Do you think my being faster,
			stronger has anything to do with
			my muscles in this place?

	Neo is frustrated, still unable to catch his breath.

					MORPHEUS
			Do you believe that's air you are
			breathing now?

	Neo squints at him.

					MORPHEUS
			If you can free your mind, the
			body will follow.

	Neo stands, nodding.

					MORPHEUS
			Again.

	Their fists fly with  pneumatic speed.


	INT.  MAIN DECK

	Everyone is gathered behind Tank, watching the fight,
	like watching a game of Mortal Combat.

					CABLE
			Jeezus Keerist!  That boy is fast!

					MOUSE
			You ever seen anyone that fast
			that soon, Tank?

					TANK
			Never.

					APOC
			Morpheus is right.  He's got to be
			the one.


	INT.  DOJO

	The speed of the blows rises like a drum solo that seems
	impossible to sustain.  Neo's face sheds its mask of calm
	with a scream.

	He wants to beat Morpheus bad.

	Finally a single blow catches Morpheus on the side of the
	head, knocking his glasses off.


	INT.  MAIN DECK

	There are several gasps.

					MOUSE
			I don't believe it!


	INT.  DOJO

	Morpheus rubs his face.

					MORPHEUS
			You are angry with me.

	Neo pants.

					NEO
			I, uh... maybe.

					MORPHEUS
			It's all right.  It's natural.

					NEO
			I feel better.

					MORPHEUS
			Good, good.  Anger is a gift, Neo,
			but it's a heavy one.

	Morpheus smiles.

					MORPHEUS
			Tank, load the jump program.

	Neo straightens as the dojo DISSOLVES away like a curtain
	lifting, leaving the two men now standing on a building
	rooftop in a city skyline.

					MORPHEUS
			You have to learn to let go of
			that anger.  You must let go of
			everything.

	A WIND HOWLS, whipping Morpheus' long coat to the side.

					MORPHEUS
			You must empty yourself to free
			your mind.

	Morpheus spins, running hard at the edge of the rooftop.
	And jumps.  He sails through the air, his coat billowing
	out behind him like a cape --

	Somersaults once and lands on the rooftop across the
	street.

					NEO
			Shit.

	Neo looks down at the street twenty floors below, then at
	Morpheus an impossible fifty feet away.

					NEO
			Okie dokie.

	He takes a deep breath.

					NEO
			Yeah.  Free my mind.  Right.  No
			problem.

	He concentrates.  Runs.


	INT.  MAIN DECK

	They are transfixed.

					CABLE
			He's gonna make it.

					APOC
			No way.  Not possible.

					MOUSE
			No one's ever made their first
			jump.

					SWITCH
			What if he does?

					APOC
			He won't.

					TANK
			It's never been done.

	Trinity stares at the screen, her fists clenching as she
	whispers.

					TRINITY
			Come on.


	EXT.  ROOFTOP

	Summoning every ounce of strength in his legs, Neo
	launches himself into the air in a single maniacal shriek
	--

	But comes up drastically short.

	His eyes widen as he plummets.  Stories fly by, the
	ground rushing up at him, but as he hits --

	The ground gives way, stretchinp like a trapeze net.

	He bounces and flips, slowly coming to a rest, flat on
	his back.

	He laughs, a bit unsure, wiping the wind-blown tears from
	his face.

	Morpheus exits the building and helps him to his feet.

					MORPHEUS
			Everyone falls the first time.

	Neo nods quietly.

					MORPHEUS
			If you never know failure, how can
			you know success?


	INT.  MAIN DECK

	They break up.

					MOUSE
			What does it mean?

					CABLE
			It doesn't mean anything.

					CYPHER
			Everyone falls, right, Trinity?

	But Trinity has left.

	Neo's eyes open as Tank eases the plug out.  He tries to
	move and groans, cradling his ribs.

	While Tank helps Morpheus, Neo spits blood into his hand.

					NEO
			I thought it wasn't real.

	Neo stares at the blood.

					NEO
			If you are killed in the Matrix,
			you die here?

					MORPHEUS
			The body cannot live without the
			mind.


	INT.  NEO'S ROOM

	Trinity enters from the hall, carrying a try of food.

					TRINITY
			Neo, I saved you some dinner --

	She sees him passed out on the bed.  She sets the tray
	down and pulls the blanket over him.

	She pauses, her face close to his, then inhales lightly,
	breathing in the scent of him, before slowly pulling away.

	It seems the moment she closes the door, he wakes with a
	start, unsure of where he is.  After a moment, he gets
	out of bed.


	INT.  HALL

	The ship is quiet and dark.  Everyone is asleep.


	INT.  MAIN DECK

	The core glows with monitor light.  Cypher is in the
	operator's chair as Neo cones up behind him.

					CYPHER
			Whoa!  Shit, Neo, you scared the
			bejeezus out of ne.

					NEO
			Sorry.

					CYPHER
			No, it's all right.

					NEO
			What are you doing?

					CYPHER
			Midnight watch.

	Neo's eyes light up as he steps closer to the screens
	that seem alive with a constant flow of data.

					NEO
			Is that... ?

					CYPHER
			The Matrix?  Yeah.

	The monitors are packed with bizarre codes and equations.

					CYPHER
			You want a drink?

	He pours Neo a drink from a large plastic jug.

					CYPHER
			I'll tell you, I feel for you,
			man.  I really do.  Most of us
			were still young, just punks, when
			Morpheus jacked us.  But you, you
			had a real life.

	Neo takes a sip and it almost kills him.  Cypher pounds
	on his back.

					CYPHER
			Good shit, huh?  Dozer makes it.
			It's good for two things:
			degreasing engines and killing
			brain cells.

	Red-faced, Neo finally stops coughing.

					CYPHER
			Did he tell you why he did it?

	Neo nods.

					CYPHER,
			I'll be the didn't tell you that
			this wasn't the first time he
			thought he found the One.

	Neo shakes his head as Cypher fills his cup and laughs.

					CYPHER
			Let me give you a piece of advice.
			Between you and me, if Morpheus
			says you can fly, I wouldn't go
			jumping out any windows to find
			out if he's right.  Understand?

	Cypher raises his drink.  Neo swallows another throat-
	scorching mouthful.

					CYPHER
			Welcome to the real world!


	INT.  RESTAURANT (MATRIX) - NIGHT

	CHAMBER MUSIC and the ambiance of wealth soak the room as
	we watch a serrated knife saw through a thick, gorgeous
	steak.

					CYPHER
			That's what he said to me nine
			years ago.

	The meat is so perfect, charred on the outside, oozing
	red juice from the inside, that it could be a dream.

					CYPHER
			The real world.  Ha, what a joke.

	We recognize the grating voice, the insidious laugh.

					CYPHER
			You know what real is?  I'll tell
			you what real is.

	A fork stabs the cube of meat and we FOLLOW it UP TO the
	face of Cypher.

					CYPHER
			Real is just another four-letter
			word.

	He laughs, shoving the steak into his mouth.

	The restaurant is located on the top floor of a Chicago
	skyscraper where the view is breathtaking and the menu
	has no prices.

	Sitting across from Cypher is Agent Smith.

					AGENT SMITH
			Do we have a deal, Mr. Reagan?

	Cypher chews the steak loudly, smacking it between his
	teeth.

					CYPHER
			Mmm, so, so fucking good.

	Smith watches him shovel another hunk of meat into his
	mouth.

					CYPHER
			You know, I know that this steak
			doesn't exist.  I know when I put
			it in my mouth, the Matrix is
			telling my brain that it is juicy
			and delicious.  After nine years,
			do you know what I've realized?

	Pausing, he examines the meat skewered on his fork.  He
	pops it in, eyes rolling up, savoring the tender beef
	melting in his mouth.

					CYPHER
			Ignorance is bliss.

					AGENT SMITH
			Then we have a deal?

					CYPHER
			I don't want to remember nothing.
			Nothing!  You understand?  And I
			want to be rich.  Someone
			important.  Like an actor.  You
			can do that, right?

					AGENT SMITH
			Whatever you want, Mr. Reagan.

	Cypher takes a deep drink of wine.

					CYPHER
			All right.  You get my body back
			in a power plant, reinsert me into
			the Matrix and I'll get you what
			you want.

					AGENT SMITH
			Access codes to Zion.

					CYPHER
			I told you, I don't know them.
			But I can give you the man who
			does.

					AGENT SMITH
			Morpheus.


	INT.  MAIN DECK

	Sweat dapples his lip as Neo snaps out of the construct
	coma.

					NEO
			Jeez, I was wondering about that.

					TANK
			What?

					NEO
			Why I was bald here but not in the
			Matrix.

					TANK
			R.S.I.

					NEO
			Residual self image.

					TANK
			Good.  Now what's this?

	He points to one of Neo's monitors.

					NEO
			Life systems monitor, glucose
			levels.

					TANK
			What's that?

					NEO
			Main power supply to the core.

	He follows Tank to the operator's station where he points
	to a red key-switch.

					TANK
			How about this?

					NEO
			Mainframe self-destruct.  Uses all
			remaining power to generate an...
			E.M.P?

					TANK
			Electromagnetic pulse.  Our best
			weapon against the machines.  The
			problem is if someone is still in
			the Matrix when that thing goes
			off, they're not coming back.

	Neo nods as Morpheus comes up behind them.

					MORPHEUS
			How's he doing?

					TANK
			We just finished the operation
			programs and he's showing great
			retention.

					MORPHEUS
			Good.  I want everyone alerted to
			12-hour stand-by.  We're going in.
			Neo, it's time for you to know why
			you're here.

	Morpheus walks away.

					NEO
			What's he talking about?

					TANK
			He's taking you into the Matrix to
			see her.

					NEO
			See who?

					TANK
			The Oracle.

	Neo looks down at the monitor teeming with Matrix data
	that seems to coalesce, equations giving way to images as
	a METAL SCREAM RISES BECOMING --


	EXT.  CHICAGO (MATRIX) - DAY

	An El train.


	INT.  HOTEL LAFAYETTE (MATRIX) - DAY

	The room is empty, heavy curtains covering windows.  It
	looks as if it hasn't been touched in years.  In the
	bedroom with the cracked oval mirror an old black PHONE
	begins to RING.

	In the mirror, we first glimpse them and as we keep
	TURNING, the room fills with equipment and the team.

	Morpheus answers the phone.

					MORPHEUS
			We're in.

	He hangs up.

					MORPHEUS
			Mouse and Cable hold the exit.
			Let's go.


	INT.  STAIRWELL (MATRIX) - DAY

	Neo follows the others down the stairwell that winds
	around an antique elevator shaft.

					NEO
			Did you have to do this?

					TRINITY
			Yeah.

					NEO
			What did she tell you?

					TRINITY
			Lots of things.

					NEO
			Any of them true?

	Trinity looks at him, then looks away.

					TRINITY
			Some of them.

					GIZMO
			Were they good or bad?

					TRINITY
			There's no point in worrylng.
			Whatever is going to happen is
			going to happen.

	They cross the old lobby.  Switch and Apoc stop at the
	doors.

					MORPHEUS
			We should be back in an hour.


	EXT.  HOTEL LAFAYETTE (MATRIX) - DAY

	Neo squints into the sun that seems unnaturally bright.
	He is the only one without sunglasses.

					MORPHEUS
			Do you now understand what it
			means when we say, if you're not
			one of us, you're one of them?

					NEO
			The agents.  They're sentient
			programs.  They can commandeer any
			software hardwired to the
			mainframe.

					MORPHEUS
			Anyone that is still in a power
			plant.  That is why we try to be
			invisible in the Matrix.

					NEO
			The best hacking is always
			traceless.

	Cypher and Trinity move away from them, securing the
	perimeter.  As Cypher passes a garbage can, he
	surreptitiously drops something inside.

	It is a cellular phone and we watch the blue display as
	the LINE CONNECTS.

	An early 1970s, black Lincoln Continental emerges from a
	corrugated roll-up garage.  Morpheus and Neo get in.


	INT.  LINCOLN CONTINENTAL (MATRIX) - DAY

	An enormous man is waiting for them.  A wad of chewing
	tobacco bulges his cheek.  He spits into a Coke can.

					MOJO
			Morpheus, been a long time coming.

					MORPHEUS
			You're looking well, Mojo.

	Mojo coughs a brown, cankerous laugh, juice speckling his
	chin and shirt.  He stares at Neo.

					MOJO
			You bringing us geriatrics now.
			Morpheus?

	He spits and laughs again.

					MOJO
			Guess you are locking for a
			miracle.


	EXT.  BAR (MATRIX) - DAY

	The Continental pulls up to a bar in the kind of
	neighborhood where every corner has a pair of eyes.


	INT.  BAR (MATRIX) - DAY

	A lightless, lower-class bar.  No one enters that is not
	expected.

	The front doors open in a brilliant burst of sunlight as
	Mojo leads Morpheus and Neo inside.  Neo looks around,
	his eyes adjusting to the darkness.

	Mojo talks to the bartender, then looks over.

					MOJO
			All right, it's cool.  Go on back.

	They weave their way to the back of the bar, the STICKY
	FLOOR SNAPPING under their FEET.

	A monolith of a man rises from his stool as they walk up.

					REX
			You're late.

	He moves to the side, opening the heavy iron door behind
	him.  They descend the basement staircase toward the
	single bare bulb at the bottom, hanging above the only
	door.


	INT.  BASEMENT (MATRIX) - DAY

	A high-tech laptop and modem are set up on a stack of
	milk crates.  Neo waits as Morpheus types in a series of
	access codes.  After a moment the screen blinks, "Welcome
	Morpheus."

	Morpheus walks back to the same door they entered, but it
	now leads into --


	INT.  TEMPLE OF ZION (MATRIX) - DAY

	The walls and floors are polished marble.  Neo follows,
	his mouth agape.

					NEO
			What -- what happened?

					MORPHEUS
			This is the temple.  It is a part
			of Zion's mainframe.  It's hidden
			inside the Matrix so that we can
			access it.

	Two PRIESTESSES are waiting in the antechamber.

					PRIESTESS
			Hello, Morpheus.  We've been
			expecting you.

					MORPHEUS
			Okay, you're on your own.  Go with
			them.

	They take Neo by the arm, leading him down a hall into
	another room.

					PRIESTESS
			Wait here.  Among the other
			Potentials.


	INT.  ROOM OF POTENTIALS (MATRIX) - DAY

	Neo enters and finally understands the attention given to
	his age.  The Potentials are all little children.

	The room feels at once like a Buddhist temple and a
	kindergarten class.  The children's heads are either
	shaved or thick with dreadlocks.  Some are playing,
	others meditating or practicing their gift.

	Neo watches a little girl levitate wooden alphabet
	blocks.  A skinny BOY holds a SPOON which sways like a
	blade of grass as he bends it with his rnind.

	Neo crosses to him, sits.

	The Boy smiles as Neo picks up a spoon and tries to
	imitate him.  Despite his best efforts, Neo cannot make
	it bend.

					SPOON BOY
			Your spoon does not bend because
			it is just that, a spoon.  Mine 
			bends because there is no spoon,
			just my mind.

	Neo watches as it curls into a knot.

					SPOON BOY
			Link yourself to the spoon.
			Become the spoon and bend
			yourself.

	Neo nods, again holding up his spoon.

					NEO
			There is no spoon.  Right.

	He concentrates.  The spoon begins to bend just as the
	Priestess touches his shoulder.

					PRIESTESS
			The Oracle will see you now.

	Spoon Boy smiles.


	INT.  SHRINE (MATRIX) - DAY

	Neo enters nervously.  Beneath his feet is a path of the
	zodiac leading to marbled stairs that rise to a dais and
	a three-legged throne.

	The throne is empty.

					NEO
			Hello?

	A DISTANT FEMALE VOICE calls to him and he follows it up
	the stairs.  At the top of the dais, he smells something
	cooking.

	Following the scent, he moves behind the pillars where he
	finds an open door.

					VOICE (O.S.)
			Just come on in.

	He walks through a vestibule where he sees a fabulous
	moonstone headdress and velvet robes.  A second door
	leads into --


	INT.  ORACLE'S CHAMBERS (MATRIX) - DAY

	It looks like a suburban tract house.

	There is a lot of cozy furniture, a dining roon hutch
	filled with china, shelves and tables crowded with
	doilies, knick-knacks and ceramic brick-a-brack.

	Neo follows the plastic carpet runner to the kitchen.

	A WOMAN is huddled beside the oven, peering inside
	through the cracked door.

					NEO
			Hello?

					ORACLE (WOMAN)
			I know.  You're Neo.  Be right
			with you.

					NEO
			You're the Oracle?

					ORACLE
			Bingo.  I got to say I love seeing
			you non-believers.  It's really a
			relief.  All that pomp and
			circumstances just plain tucker me
			out.  Almost done.  Smell good,
			don't they?

					NEO
			Yeah.

					ORACLE
			I'd ask you to sit down, but
			you're not going to anyway.  And
			don't worry about the vase.

					NEO
			What vase?

	He turns to look around and his elbow knocks a VASE from
	the table.  It BREAKS against the linoleum floor.

					ORACLE
			The vase.

					NEO
			Shit, I'm sorry.

	She pulls out a tray of chocolate chip cookies and turns.
	She is an older woman, wearing big oven mitts,
	comfortable slacks and a print blouse.  She looks like
	someone's grandma.

					ORACLE
			I said don't worry about it.  I'll
			get one of my kids to fix it.

					NEO
			How did you know...?

	She sets the cookie tray on a wooden hot-pad.

					ORACLE
			What's really going to bake your
			noodle later on is, would you
			still have broken it if I hadn't
			said anything.

	Smiling, she lights a cigarette.

					ORACLE
			You're cuter than I thought.  I
			see why she likes you.

					NEO
			Who?

					ORACLE
			Not too bright, though.

	She winks.

					ORACLE
			You know why Morpheus brought you
			to see me?

					NEO
			I think so.

					ORACLE
			So? What do you think?  You think
			you're the one?

					NEO
			I don't know.

	She gestures to a wooden plaque, the kind every grandma
	has, except that the words are in Latin.

					ORACLE
			You know what that means?  It's
			Latin.  Means, 'Know thyself.'

	She puts her cigarette down.

					ORACLE
			Well, let's have a look at you.

	She widens his eyes, checks his ears, then feels the
	glands in his neck.

					ORACLE
			Open your mouth.  Say, 'ahhh.'

	She nods then looks at his palms.

					ORACLE
			Hmmm.  You sure got the gift, but
			it's tricky.  I'd say the bad news
			is, you're not the one.  Still got
			a lot to learn.  Maybe next life.

					NEO
			What's the good news?

					ORACLE
			Same as the bad news, you're not
			the one.

					NEO
			Is that it, then?

					ORACLE
			No.  Here.

	She picks up the tray of cooling cookies.

					ORACLE
			You better take a cookie.  Got a
			big day ahead of you.

	He eyes her, then takes a cookie.

					ORACLE
			Make a believer out of you yet.


	INT.  ANTECHAMBER (MATRIX) - DAY

	Morpheus rises from a bench as the Priestess escorts Neo
	out.  When they are alone, Morpheus puts his hand on
	Neo's shoulder.

					MORPHEUS
			You don't have to tell me
			anything, Neo, because I already
			know what she said.

					NEO
			You do?

					MORPHEUS
			I brought you so that you could
			hear it for yourself.  I knew it
			would help.

	Neo finishes his cookie.

					MORPHEUS
			No one will ever ask you because
			it is a gift from her.  It is for
			you and you alone.


	EXT.  CITY STREET (MATRIX) - DAY

	Storm clouds shroud the streets as the sky turns
	jaundice.

	Cypher nervously glances down the surrounding streets.
	He notices several unmarked white vans.

	He mops the sweat from his forehead, when Trinity sees
	the black Lincoln.

					TRINITY
			Here they come.


	INT.  MAIN DECK

	In the hovercraft, we see the sweat rolling down Cypher's
	face and neck.

	Tank is typing rapidly at the keyboard.

					TANK
			Weird.  This area never has this
			much activity.


	EXT.  HOTEL LAFAYETTE (MATRIX) - DAY

	Apoc opens the side door and they enter the hotel.


	INT.  ROOM 1313 (MATRIX) - DAY

	Mouse's CELLULAR RINGS.

					MOUSE
			Welcome to Movie-Phone.

					TANK (V.O.)
			They're on their way.

					MOUSE
			Right.

	The phone flips shut as he jumps up.

					MOUSE
			Let's get to work.


	INT.  HOTEL LAFAYETTE (MATRIX) - DAY

	Light filters down the throat of the building through a
	caged skylight at the top of the open elevator shaft.
	Four figures glide up the dark stairs that wind around
	the antique elevator.

	Neo notices a black cat, a yellow-green-eyed shadow that
	slinks past them and pads quickly down the stairs.

	A moment later, Neo sees another black cat that looks and
	moves identically to the first one.

					NEO
			Whoa.  Deja vu.

	Those words stop the others dead in their tracks.


	INT.  MAIN DECK

	The monitors suddenly glitch as though the Matrix had an
	electronic seizure.

					TANK
			Oh, shit!  Oh, shit!


	INT.  HOTEL LAFAYETTE (MATRIX) - DAY

	Trinity turns around, her face tight.

					TRINITY
			What did you just say?

					NEO
			Nothing.  Just had a little deja
			vu.

					TRINITY
			What happened?  What did you see?

					NEO
			A black cat went past us and then
			I saw another that looked just
			like it.

					TRINITY
			How much like it?  Was it the same
			cat?

					NEO
			It might have been.  I'm not sure.

	Trinity looks at Morpheus, who listens quietly to the
	rasping breath of the old building.

					NEO
			What is it?

					TRINITY
			A deja vu is usually a glitch in
			the Matrix.  It happens when they
			change something.

	She also listens as the staccato BEAT of HELICOPTER
	BLADES GROW ominously LOUDER.


	INT.  MAIN DECK

	Tank sees what was changed.

					TANK
			It's a trap!


	INT.  STAIRCASE (MATRIX) - DAY

	Morpheus looks up the stairs as a helicopter shadow
	passes over the clouded glass.

					MORPHEUS
			Come on!


	INT.  ROOM 1313 (MATRIX) - DAY

	Cable goes to the draped windows.

					CABLE
			Did you just feel something weird?

					MOUSE
			Yeah...

	The CELLULAR RINGS.


	INT.  BASEMENT (MATRIX) - DAY

	Heavy bolt-cutters snap through the main phone cable.


	INT.  ROOM 1313 (MATRIX) - DAY

	Mouse answers the phone.

					MOUSE
			What's going on?

					TANK (V.O.)
			They cut the hard-line!  It's a
			trap!  Get out!

	Cable yanks open the curtain.

					CABLE
			Oh, no.

	The windows are bricked up.


	INT.  HALL (MATRIX) - DAY

	The door to the roof explodes open as heavily-armed rnen
	rush towards room 1313.


	INT.  MAIN DECK

	Tank watches helplessly.

					TANK
			No, no, no.


	INT.  ROOM 1313 (MATRIX) - DAY

	The door slams open and the police force pours in, dozens
	of assault rifles surrounding Mouse and Cable who are
	armed with only handguns.

					CABLE
			Morpheus!  It's a trap --


	INT.  STAIRS (MATRIX) - DAY

	Morpheus stops as the scream is drowned by the REPORT of
	MACHINE GUNS filling the building with a terrible fury.

					TRINITY
			Oh, God.


	INT.  MAIN DECK

	Mouse's body thrashes against its harness as --


	INT.  ROOM 1313 (MATRIX) - DAY

	BULLETS POUND him against the blood-splattered brick
	window.  Gun smoke thickens the room, Cable blasting and
	moving until --

	The HAMMER CLICKS empty.  He screams as a DOZEN GUNS OPEN
	FIRE, ripping him apart.


	INT.  MAIN DECK

	Blood spits from Cable's mouth, his body spasming, then
	lying perfectly still.

	The flat-line ALARM softly cries out from the life
	MONITORS of the two dead men.


	EXT.  HOTEL LAFAYETTE (MATRIX) - DAY

	More police cars arrive as cops break open the lobby
	doors.


	INT.  STAIRWELL (MATRIX) - DAY

	Flying downstairs, Morpheus stops, hearing the police
	swarming below.  He turns and rushes down the hall of the
	eighth floor.  At the end of it, he finds the bricked-up
	windows.

					CYPHER
			That's what they changed.  We're
			trapped.  There's no way out.

	The sound of heavy BOOT-STEPS close around them with the
	mechanical sureness of a vice.

					MORPHEUS
			Give me your phone.

					TRINITY
			They'll be able to track it.

					MORPHEUS
			We have no choice.


	INT.  MAIN DECK

	Tank answers the call.

					MORPHEUS (V.O.)
			Tank, find a structural drawing of
			this building and find it fast.

	His fingers pound the keyboard.


	INT.  LAFAYETTE (MATRIX) - DAY

	Flashlights probe the rotting darkness as the police
	search every floor.


	INT.  MAIN DECK

	The diagram windows onto the screen.

					TANK
			Got it.

					MORPHEUS (V.O.)
			I need the main wet-wall.


	INT.  HALL (MATRIX) - DAY

	Agent Smith pauses, his hand going to his earpiece.


	INT.  ROOM 808 (MATRIX) - DAY

	Morpheus is guided by Tank.

					TANK (V.O.)
			Now left and that's it in front of
			you.

					MORPHEUS
			Good.

	He cuts off the phone.


	INT.  HALL (MATRIX) - DAY

	Agent Smith hears the LINE CLICK dead.

					AGENT SMITH
			Eighth floor.  They're on the
			eighth floor.


	INT.  HALL (MATRIX) - DAY

	Agent Brown hears Smith on his earphone.

					AGENT BROWTJ
			Eighth floor!  Move!


	INT.  STAIRWELL (MATRIX) - DAY

	Cops flood the eighth floor, rushing everywhere.


	INT.  ROOM 808 (MATRIX) - DAY

	Several cops sweep through the room.  It is empty.  As
	they pass the bathroom, we see a man-sized hole smashed
	through the plaster and lathe.


	INT.  WALL (MATRIX) - DAY

	They are inside the main plumbing wall, slowly worming
	their way down the greasy, black stack pipes.

	Above them, light fills the hole they made to get inside.

	INT.  HALL (MATRIX) - DAY

	Brown turns to Smith.

					AGENT BROWN
			Where are they?


	INT.  ROOM 608 (MATRIX) - DAY

	The cops search in silence, straining for a clue, when
	one hears SOMETHING STRANGE near the bathroom.


	INT.  WALL (MATRIX) - DAY

	Cypher has slipped and is wedged between the wall and
	several thick supply pipes.


	INT.  ROOM 608 (MATRIX) - DAY

	The Cop leans in, his ear almost against the thin
	membrane of plaster separating them.  He can hear
	WHISPERS, HISSES and a GRUNT when --

	The WALL suddenly bulges, SHATTER-CRACKING as the Cop
	realizes --

					COP
			They're in the walls!


	INT.  WALL (MATRIX) - DAY

	Neo pulls Cypher free just as the Cop OPENS FIRE --

	BULLETS PUNCHING shafts of light like swords into the box
	of soot-black space.


	INT.  ROOM 608 (MATRIX) - DAY

	The Cop keeps FIRING, his flashlight strapped to his gun
	barrel, lighting up the wall until --

	A BULLET spits out his forehead.  Agent Smith watches the
	BODY fall with a THUD.

					AGENT SMITH
			Are orders that hard to follow?
			I'll say it again.  Morpheus must
			be taken alive.  Understand?


	INT.  WALL (MATRIX) - DAY

	They're almost falling, they're climbing so fast.

	Above them, plaster is smashed open as crunbling bits
	shower down on them, filling the crawlway with dust.


	INT.  ROOM 608 (MATRIX) - DAY

	Agent Smith looks into the open wall, at the exposed
	intestines of the building, and realizes where they are
	going.

					AGENT SMITH
			How like a rodent.


	INT.  WALL (MATRIX) - DAY

	Just below, a RIFLE-BUTT SMASHES open the WALL, light
	raking across the lathe.

					COP
			I got him!  I got him!

	Trinity finds her gun first.  BULLET-HOLES POP out the
	WALL as she STRAFES the room, sending cops diving for
	cover.

	They continue, Trinity exposed for a roment, when a
	creeping cop smashes a fist through and grabs a fistful
	of her hair.

	He starts to yank her out when Neo kicks, his boot
	bursting through plaster and splintering lathe, knocking
	the Cop out.

	They then quickly sink out of sight.


	INT.  BASEMENT (MATRIX) - DAY

	This part of the basement, a dark concrete cavern, was
	the main mechanical room.  There are four enormous
	boilers, dinosaur-like technology that once pumped hot
	water like arteries.

	Black and bloody, they squeeze out from the ceiling into
	the tangled web of pipes.

	Their enemies are waiting for them.

	Blinding lights cut open the darkness as gas-masked
	figures FIRE GRENADE LAUNCHERS.

	Smoke blossoms from the green-metal canisters.

	Morpheus never stops moving.  Searching the floor, he
	finds what.he needs; the cover of the catch basin.

	Cypher watches him pry open the grate, when a gas can
	bounces near him.

					MORPHEUS
			Come on!

	Cypher seems to trip as the cloud envelops him.


	INT.  MAIN DECK

	Cypher's body begins to shiver uncontrollably.

					TANK
			Nerve gas.


	INT.  BASEMENT (MATRIX) - DAY

	Morpheus watches Cypher disappear into the smoke then
	follows the others down the wet-black hole.


	INT.  CATCH BASIN (MATRIX) - DAY

	They crawl through greasy black water in a three foot
	diameter pipe that feeds into the sewer main.


	INT.  BASEMENT (MATRIX) - DAY

	Gas-masked apparitions find the open hole.


	EXT.  HOTEL LAFAYETTE (MATRIX) - DAY

	Cypher is carried out, hand-cuffed, his body still
	shaking, mucus bubbling out his nose.  As he is led past
	Agent Smith, it almost seems that both men smile.

					AGENT SMITH
			We have them now.


	INT.  SEWER MAIN (MATRIX) - DAY

	Neo punches out the screen and then spills down into the
	main water trough.

	Oily water forms around them as they wade across the man-
	made underground river, towards the service catwalk.

	Neo is about to pull himself out when he sees them coming.

	Flashlights and laser sites sweep at them as cops in
	helmets and heavy armor, looking more nachine than human,
	fill both ends of the tunnel.

	There is a single manhole cover above them.

	Morpheus whispers to Trinity.

					MORPHEUS
			You have to get Neo out.
			Understand?  That's all that
			matters now.

					TRINITY
			Morpheus, don't --

					MORPHEUS
			He must get out.  Do you
			understand me?

	She nods.

	A font of water erupts as Morpheus leaps for the manhole
	ladder, his coat flying open like the wings of a manta
	ray.

					COPS
			There he is!  That's him!

	Pools of light wash over him as he hauls himself to the
	surface.

					COP
			He's heading for the street!

	Trinity urges the others to follow her.  Grabbing Neo,
	they wade quietly away from the chaos.


	EXT.  STREET (MATRIX) - DAY

	Morpheus shoots out of the sewer but the police are
	waiting for him.  The closest cop is armed with a
	tranquilized gun.  He fires --

	But Morpheus' is too fast, using the manhole cover as a
	shield, blocking the darts, then --

	Frisbee-ing it into the cop's armored chest, knocking him
	off his feet.

	The cops lunge at him but every part of his body is a
	deadly weapon moving with impossible speed.

	It seems he might fight his way out when he throws a
	spinning back fist that is caught by --

	Agent Smith.

					AGENT SMITH
			So, we meet at last.

					MORPHEUS
			And you are?

					AGENT SMITH
			Smith.  I am Agent Smith.

					MORPHEUS
			You all look the same to me.

					AGENT SMITH
			I've been waiting for this noment.

	Faster than a snake spits, Morpheus cracks Smith with a
	jaw-breaking right.

				MORPHEUS
			Oh, so have I.

	Agent Smith smiles.


	INT.  SEWER MAIN (MATRIX) - DAY

	Trinity leads the others, fading into the darkness of the
	tunnel, lit only with shafts of lights streaming through
	the street drains as we RISE TOWARDS them --

	THROUGH a grate INTO the fight.


	EXT.  STREET (MATRIX) - DAY

	Smith and Morpheus exchange a furious serious of blows
	that is witnessed but not believed by the surrounding
	police.

	Agent Smith delivers a punishing kick that staggers
	Morpheus.

					AGENT SMITH
			You can't win.

	Morpheus smiles.

					MORPHEUS
			I already have.

	He stands up and drops his fists; a steely resolve in his
	eyes.

					AGENT SMITH
			Take him.

	Cops swarm over Morpheus.


	INT.  MAIN DECK

	Tank reaches out to the screen as if reaching for
	Morpheus.

					TANK
			No!


	EXT.  HOTEL LAFAYETTE (MATRIX) - DAY

	Cuff ed and beaten, Morpheus is thrown into a caged
	transport vehicle.  The DOOR CLANGS shut.

	Agent Jones finds Agent Smith.

					AGENT JONES
			The others were lost.

					AGENT SMITH
			You've taken care of Reagan?

	Agent Jones nods.

					AGENT SMITH
			Then the others do not matter.


	EXT.  STREET (MATRIX) - DAY

	A manhole cover cracks open.  Two eyes peek out just as a
	TRUCK RATTLES over it.  The THUNDER DOPPLERS AWAY and the
	cover opens.

	Neo, Trinity, Switch and Apoc climb out.  Trinity pulls a
	water-logged phone from her pocket.

					TRINITY
			We need a phone.


	INT.  MAIN DECK

	Tank is again at the monitors, searching the Matrix.

					TANK
			We gotta find the others.  They're
			still alive.

	The PHONE RINGS.

					TANK
			Operator.

					CYPHER (V.O.)
			I need an exit!  Fast!

					TANK
			Cypher?  I thought they had you?


	EXT.  STREET (MATRIX) - DAY

	Cypher is standing at a public phone.  Across the street
	is the burning paddy wagon that appears to have collided
	witli an oncoming car.

					CYPHER
			There was an accident.  A fucking
			car accident.  All of a sudden.
			Boom.  They're all dead.  I still
			got the shakes but, Jesus,
			someone's going to make a believer
			out of me.


	INT.  MAIN DECK

	Dozer spots the wreck.

					DOZER
			There he is.

					TANK
			I got you.

					CYPHER (V.O.)
			Just get me outta here.


	EXT.  STREET (MATRIX) - DAY

					TANK (V.O.)
			Nearest exit is Franklin and Erie.
			An old appliance store.

	Cypher hangs up and smiles as the fire trucks arrive.

					CYPHER
			An actor.  Definitely.


	INT.  MAIN DECK

	The PHONE RINGS.  Tank answers.

					TANK
			Operator.

					TRINITY (V.O.)
			Tank, it's me.


	EXT.  STREET (MATRIX) - DAY

	They are outside a pawn shop.  Trinity has a new cellular.

					TRINITY
			We need an exit!

					TANK (V.O.)
			Gotcha.  You're not far from
			Cypher.

					TRINITY
			Cypher, I thought --

					TANK (V.O.)
			So did we.  That boy's got nine
			lives.  I sent him to Franklin and
			Erie.

					TRINITY
			Got it.

	She hangs up.


	EXT.  STREET (MATRIX) - DAY

	Running, Cypher turns onto Erie.


	INT.  APPLIANCE STORE (MATRIX) - DAY

	Dead machines, eviscerated and shrouded with dust lay on
	metal shelves like bodies in a morgue.

	Plywood covering a small window is ripped off and Cypher
	crawls inside.

	Deep in the back room, a PHONE that has not rung in years
	begins to RING.


	INT.  MAIN DECK

	Tank punches the emit command.

					TANK
			Got him.

	Cypher's body twitches in its harness, jerking itself
	awake.  His eyes blink open.  Dozer unplugs him.

					DOZER
			System check looks fine.

	Cypher stands, a raspy cough spewing from his lungs.


	EXT.  STREET (MATRIX) - DAY

	Trinity sees the appliance shop.


	INT.  MAIN DECK

	Cypher holds his chest.

					DOZER
			You okay?

					CYPHER
			Goddamn gas.  My lungs are killing
			me.

	He crosses to an overhead bin.

					CYPHER
			We got any pain killers?

					DOZER
			The first aid kit's over here.

	As Dozer stoops for a cabinet, Cypher pulls back a heavy
	blanket exposing a plasma rifle.


	INT.  APPLIANCE STORE (MATRIX) - DAY

	Neo crawls through the window that Cypher opened.


	INT.  MAIN DECK

	Tank finishes loading the exit programs as Cypher rises
	behind him, swinging the weapon at his back.

	He looks over as Dozer turns with the first aid kit, a
	look of frozen disbelief crossing his face --

					DOZER
			No!

	Tank spins as red hot wads of PLASMA EXPLODE through his
	chair and into his back.  Diving, a second BURST tears up
	his side --

	As Dozer shoots a look at the monitor where Tank was
	working.  He stabs the enter command activating the exit
	sequence and ducks under a BARRAGE of PLASMA FIRE-


	INT.  APPLIANCE STORE (MATRIX) - DAY

	The PHONE begins to RING as the others crawl in.

					SWITCH
			God, I love that sound.


	INT.  MAIN DECK

	Dozer rolls up, grabbing a heavy crowbar from a box of
	tools.

	Cypher circles the drive chairs as the sights of the
	plasma rifle find Dozer's face.

	Dozer charges, screaming, and the PLASMA RIFLE SCREAMS
	back.


	INT.  APPLIANCE STORE (MATRIX) - DAY

	The PHONE is still RINGING.

					TRINITY
			You first,.Neo.

	Neo answers the phone when there is a CLICK.  There is no
	signal.  Nothing but silence.

					TRINITY
			What happened?

					NEO
			I don't know.  It just went dead.

	Trinity listens to the dead line and takes out the
	cellular.


	INT. MAIN DECK

	The operator PHONE begins to RING- Cypher steps over the
	body of Tank and looks at the monitor.


	INT.  APPLIANCE STORE (MATRIX) - DAY

	Trinity can almost feel him watching them.  Every
	unanswered RING wrings her gut a little tighter, until --

					CYPHER (V.O.)
			Hello, Trinity.

					TRINITY
			Cypher?  Where's Tank?

					CYPHER (V.O.)
			He had an accident.

					TRINITY
			An accident?  What about Dozer?
			Is Dozer there?


	INT.  MAIN DECK

	He walks over to Trinity's body, staring down at it
	hanging in its coma-like stillness.

					CYPHER
			You know, for a long time, I
			thought I was in love with you,
			Trinity.  I used to dream about
			you...

	He nuzzles his face against hers, feeling the softness of
	it.

					CYPHER
			You are a beautiful woman.  Too
			bad things had to work out like
			this.

	We INTERCUT BETWEEN the appliance store and the main
	deck.

					TRINITY
			You killed them.

					APOC
			What?!

					SWITCH
			Oh God.

	Wearing Tank's operator headgear, Cypher moves among the
	silent bodies.

					CYPHER
			In a way you're very lucky.  Most
			people never know why they die.
			One minute they're alive, the next
			they're dead.  No warning.
			Nothing.  That's why I thought
			maybe I should tell you.  It
			seemed the least I could do.

	He stands over the body of Morpheus, as his anger boils
	up out of him.

					CYPHER
			You see, the truth, the real,truth
			is that the war is over.  It's
			been over for a long time.  And
			guess what?  We lost!  Did you
			hear that?  We lost the war!

					TRINITY
			What about Zion?

					CYPHER
			Zion?  Zion is a part of this
			delusion.  More of this madness.
			That's why this has to be done.
			It has to end.  Now and forever.

	She suddenly sees the entire dark plan.

					TRINITY
			Oh rny God.  This is abzut Zion.
			You gave them Morpheus for the
			access codes to Zion.

	Cypher walks away from Morpheus and bends down next to
	Apoc's body.

					CYPHER
			You see, Trinity, we humans have a
			place in the future.  But it's not
			here.  It's in the Matrix.

					TRINITY
			The Matrix isn't real!

					CYPHER
			Oh, I disagree, Trinity.  I
			disagree.  I think the Matrix is
			more real than this world.  I
			mean, all I do is pull a plug
			here.  But there, you watch a man
			die.

	He grabs hold of the cable in Apoc's neck, twists it and
	yanks it out.

					CYPHER
			You tell me which is more real.

	Apoc seems to go blind for an instant, a scream caught in
	his throat, his hands reaching for nothing, and then
	falls dead.  Switch screams.

					CYPHER
			Welcome to the real world, right?

	He laughs.

					TRINITY
			Somehow, some way, you're going to
			pay for this.

					CYPHER
			Pay for it?  I'm not even going to
			remember it.  It'll be like it
			never happened.  The tree falling
			in the forest.  It doesn't make a
			sound.

	His hand slides around the neck of Switch as he takes
	hold of her plug.

	She suddenly feels her body severed from her mind as she
	is murdered.

					TRINITY
			Goddamn you, Cypher!

					CYPHER
			Don't hate me, Trinity.  I'm just
			the messenger.  And right now I'm
			going to prove that the message is
			true.

	He stands over Neo.

					CYPHER
			If Morpheus was right, then
			there's no way I can pull this
			plug, is there?

	She turns to Neo, eyes wide with fear, and he knows he is
	next.

					CYPHER
			If he is the One, then in the next
			few seconds there has to be some
			kind of miracle to stop me.
			Because if he dies like the others
			that means Morpheus was wrong.
			How can he be the One if he's
			dead?

	He takes hold of the cord when --

	She hears an EXPLOSION and a scream.

	Cypher is on the ground, his left leg blown off at the
	knee.  He rolls over and finds Tank on the ground, and
	the sights of the plasma rifle.

					TANK
			How's it feel, Cypher?  Knowing
			you're about to die?

					NEO
			It's Tank!  He's alive.

	Cypher lunges for Neo's plug just as Tank BLOWS his head
	off.


	INT.  APPLIANCE STORE (MATRIX) - DAY

	They're both listening, trying to figure out what is
	happening when the store PHONE starts to RING.

	Trinity smiles, tears moistening her eyes as Neo throws
	his arms around her.  For a moment, it looks as if they
	might kiss before Trinity lets go.

					TRINITY
			We should, we should hurry.

					NEO
			Yeah.  Right.


	INT.  MAIN DECK

	Trinity's eyes open, a sense of relief surging through
	her at the sight of the ship.  As Tank unplugs her, she
	sees his charred wounds.

					TRINITY
			Tank, you're hurt.

					TANK
			I'll be all right.

					TRINITY
			Dozer?

	Tank's face tightens.

					TRINITY
			I'm sorry, Tank.


	EXT.  NIKO HOTEL (MATRIX) - DAY

	A Japanese luxury hotel in downtown Chicago.

	A military helicopter sets down on the roof.  Heavily
	armed Marines begin to deploy.

	Agent Jones gets out of the helicopter, flanked by
	columns of Marines.  They open the roof access door
	and enter the top-floor maintenance level of the hotel.


	INT.  TOP FLOOR (MATRIX) - DAY

	They get in the elevator.  At every door, at least two
	Marines stop and post guard.


	INT.  HALL (MATRIX) - DAY

	They exit the elevator and walk to the Presidential
	suite; the final two Marines post guard.


	INT.  PRESIDENTIAL SUITE (MATRIX) - DAY

	Inside, he finds Agent Smith.

					AGENT JONES
			There is a problem.  Reagan has
			failed to secure the hardware.

	Agent Smith stares out the window.

					AGENT SMITH
			Never send a human to do a
			machine's job.

					AGENT JONES
			But if Reagan has failed, why
			haven't they pulled the plug?

					AGENT SMITH
			Haven't you learned by now, that
			it is impossible to understand why
			they do the things they do?

	He turns.

					AGENT SMITH
			Continue as planned.  Trace his
			signal to locate their position
			and deploy an extermination unit.

	Morpheus is handcuffed to a chair, stripped to the waist.
	He is bleeding from numerous wounds and is pumped full of
	serum, alternately shivering and sweating.  He is hooked
	up to various monitors with white disk electrodes.

	Agent Brown begins running a trace program.


	INT.  MAIN DECK

	Neo looks at Morpheus whose body is covered with a cold
	sweat.

					NEO
			What are they doing to him?

					TANK
			They're cracking his mind.

					NEO
			How?

					TANK
			They inject virus-like serums to
			break down the system.  It's like
			cracking a computer.  All it takes
			is time.

					NEO
			How much time?

					TANK
			Depends on the mind.  But
			eventually, it will crack and his
			alpha pattern will change from
			this to this.

	Tank punches several commands on Morpheus' personal unit.
	The monitor waves change from a chaotic pattern to an
	orderly symmetrical one.

					TANK
			When it does, Morpheus will tell
			them anything they want to know.

					NEO
			The access codes to Zion.

					TANK
			If an agent got inside Zion's
			mainframe he could do anything.
			Disable the defense system. It
			would be the end of us.

	He looks up at Trinity who is pacing relentlessly.

					TANK
			We can't let that happen.  We have
			to do it, Trinity.  Zion has to be
			protected.

	Trinity sees Cypher's dead body.  Rage overtakes her and
	she starts kicking hin.

					TRINITY
			Goddamnit!  Goddamnit!

					TANK
			We have to pull the plug.

					TRINITY
			No!

					TANK
			We don't have any other choice.

	Those words are like using gasoline to put out a fire and
	we watch the pain in her eyes burn into a blaze.  She
	walks past him and gets into her chair.

					TANK
			Trinity, what are you doing?

					TRINITY
			I'm going in after him.

					TANK
			Morpheus could conform at any
			minute --

					TRINITY
			If he does I'm sure you'll do what
			has to be done.

					TANK
			You saw that place.  It's suicide.

	She glares at him.

					TANK
			I know what Morpheus means to
			you --

					TRINITY
			No.  No, I don't think you do.  If
			you did, then you would know that
			I'm not letting him go.  Not
			without a fight, Tank.

	She yanks her harness tight.

					TRINITY
			Not without a fight.


	INT.  PRESIDENTIAL SUITE (MATRIX) - DAY

	Agent Smith stands in the bedroon of the enormous suite,
	staring out the windows at the city, below, shimmering
	with brilliant sunlight.

					AGENT SMITH
			Have you ever stood and stared at
			it, Morpheus?  Marveled at its
			beauty.  Its genius.  Billions of
			people just living out their 
			lives... oblivious.

	Agent Brown sucks a serum from a glass vial, filling a
	hypodermic needle.

					AGENT SMITH
			Did you know that the first Matrix
			was designed to be a perfect human
			world?  Where none suffered, where
			everyone would be happy.  It was a
			disaster.  No one would accept the
			program.  Entire crops were lost.

	Agent Brown jams the needle into Morpheus' shoulder, and
	plunges down.

					AGENT SMITH
			Some believed we lacked the
			programming language to describe
			your perfect world.  But I believe
			that, as a species, human beings
			define their reality through
			suffering and misery.

	Agent Brown studies the screens as the life signs react
	violently to the injection.

					AGENT SMITH
			The perfect world was a dream that
			your primitive cerebrum kept
			trying to wake up from.  Which is
			why the Matrix was re-designed to
			this:  the peak of your
			civilization.

	He turns from the window.

					AGENT SMITH
			I say 'your civilization' because
			as soon as we start thinking for
			you, it really becomes our
			civilization, which is, of course,
			what this is all about.

	He sits down directly in front of Morpheus.

					AGENT SMITH
			Evolution, Morpheus.  Evolution.

	He lifts Morpheus' head.

					AGENT SMITH
			Like the dinosaur.  Look out that
			window.  You had your time.

	Morpheus stares hard at him, trying hard not to show the
	pain racking his mind.

					AGENT SMITH
			The future is our world, Morpheus.
			The future is our time.


	INT.  MAIN DECK

	Neo goes to his chair and begins strapping in.

					TRINITY
			What do you think you're doing?

					NEO
			You need help.  I'm coming with
			you.

					TRINITY
			No.  No way.  Morpheus sacrificed
			himself so you could escape.
			There's no way you're going back
			in.

					NEO
			Morpheus did what he did because
			he believed that I'm something
			that I'm not.

					TRINITY
			What?

					NEO
			I'm not the One, Trinity.  The
			Oracle told me.

	Trinity is stunned.

					NEO
			She said I had a gift but I still
			had a lot to learn.  She told me
			maybe next life.

					TRINITY
			Did you tell Morpheus?

					NEO
			Why?  It wouldn't mean anything.
			He'd still believe what he wanted
			to believe.  But Morpheus is the
			one that matters.  He's more
			important than me and we both know
			it.

	He straps in.

					NEO
			I may not be what Morpheus thinks
			I am, but if I don't try to help
			him, then I'm not even what I
			think I am.

					TRINITY
			What are you?

					NEO
			His friend.

	INT.  PRESIDENTIAL SUITE (MATRIX) - DAY

	Agent Smith sits casually across from Morpheus who is
	hunched over, his body leaking and twitching.

					AGENT SMITH
			I'd like to share a revelation
			that I've had during my time here.
			It came to me when I tried to
			classify your species.  I've
			realized that you are not actually
			mammals.

	The life signs continue their chaotic patterns.

					AGENT SMITH
			Every mammal on this planet
			instinctively develops a natural
			equilibrium with the surrounding
			environment.  But you humans do
			not.  You move to an area and you
			multiply and multiply until every
			natural resource is consumed and
			the only way you can survive is to
			spread to another area.

	He leans forward.

					AGENT SMITH
			There is another organism on this
			planet that follows the same
			pattern.  Do you know what it is?
			A virus.

	He smiles.

					AGENT SMITH
			Human beings are a disease, a
			cancer of this planet.  You are a
			plague.  And we are... the cure.


	INT.  MAIN DECK

	Trinity and Neo hang motionless in the suspension unit.
	Tank is at the operations station.

					TANK
			Okay.  Store's open.  What do you
			need?

					TRINITY (V.O.)
			Guns.  Lots of guns.

					TANK
			Coming right up.

	He loads the weapons disk.


	INT.  CONSTRUCT

	Racks of weapons appear and Neo and Trinity arm
	themselves.

					TRINITY
			No one has ever done anything like
			this.

					NEO
			Yeah?

	He snap cocks an Uzi.

					NEO
			That's why it's going to work.

	INT.  PRESIDENTIAL SUITE (MATRIX) - DAY

	Agent Smith is again at the window.

					AGENT SMITH
			Why isn't the serum working?

					AGENT BROWN
			Perhaps we are asking the wrong
			questions.

					AGENT JONES
			Or he doesn't know.

					AGENT SMITH
			Of course he knows.  He's
			resisting.

					AGENT BROWN
			How?

					AGENT SMITH
			I don't know.  If I knew...

	Agent Smith hides his knotting fist.  He is becoming
	angry.  It is something that isn't supposed to happen to
	agents.

					AGENT SMITH
			Leave me with him.

	Agent Brown and Jones look at each other.

					AGENT SMITH
			Now!

	INT.  MAIN DECK

	Tank sits down beside Morpheus whose face is ashen like
	someone near death.  He takes hold of his hand.

					TANK
			Hold on, Morpheus.  They're coming
			for you.  They're coming.


	EXT.  NIKO HOTEL (MATRIX) - DAY

	A dark wind blows.


	INT.  NIKO HOTEL (MATRIX) - DAY

	In long, black coats, Trinity and Neo push through the
	revolving doors.

	Neo is carrying a duffel bag.  Trinity has a large metal
	suitcase.  They cut across the lobby drawing nervous
	glances.

	Dark glasses, game faces.

	Several plainclothes cops try to stop them.  They are met
	by the MUTED SPIT of a SILENCED GUN and the RAZORED
	WHISTLE of THROWING STARS.

	The cops slump down to the marbled floor while Neo and
	Trinity do not even break stride.


	INT.  PRESIDENTIAL SUITE (MATRIX) - DAY

	Agent Smith leans close to Morpheus, whispering to him.

					AGENT SMITH
			Can you hear me, Morpheus?  I'm
			going to be honest with you.

	He removes his earphone, letting it dangle over his
	shoulder.

					AGENT SMITH
			I hate this place.  This zoo.
			This prison.  This reality,
			whatever you want to call it, I
			can't stand it any longer.  It's
			the smell, if there is such a
			thing.  I feel saturated by it.  I
			can taste your stink and every
			time I do, I fear that I've
			somehow been infected by it.

	He wipes sweat from Morpheus' forehead, coating the tips
	of his fingers, holding them to Morpheus' nose.

					AGENT SMITH
			Repulsive, isn't it?

	He lifts Morpheus' head, holding it tightly with both
	hands.

					AGENT SMITH
			I must get out of here, I must get
			free.  In this mind is tlie key.
			My key.

	Morpheus sneers through his pain.

					AGENT SMITH
			Once Zion is gone, there's no
			need for me to be here.  Do you
			understand?  I need the codes.  I
			have to get inside Zion.  You have
			to tell me how.

	He begins squeezing, his fingers gouging into his flesh.

					AGENT SMITH
			Tell me!  Tell me!

	The skull is about to shatter when Agents Jones and Brown
	burst into the room.  Agent Smith releases Morpheus.

					AGENT BROWN
			What were you doing?

	Agent Smith recovers, replacing his ear piece.

					AGENT JONES
			You don't know.

					AGENT SMITH
			Know what?

	Agent Smith listens to his earphone, not believing what
	he is hearing.


	INT.  ELEVATORS (MATRIX) - DAY

	They get in.  Trinity immediately drops and opens the
	suitcase, wiring a plastique and napalm bomb.

	Beneath their trench coats is an arsenal of weapons slung
	from climbing harnesses.

	Neo hits the emergency stop.  He pulls down part of the
	false ceiling and finds the elevator shaft access panel.


	INT.  PRESIDENTIAL SUITE (MATRIX) - DAY

	Agent Jones looks at Morpheus.

					AGENT JONES
			I think they're trying to save
			him.


	INT.  ELEVATOR SHAFT (MATRIX) - DAY

	Neo ratchets down a clamp onto the elevator cable.  Both
	of them lock on.  He looks up the long, dark throat of
	the building and takes a deep breath.

					NEO
			There is no spoon.

	Neo whips out his gun and presses it to the cable, lower
	than where they attached themselves.

	BOOM!  The CABLE SNAPS.

	The counter-weights plummet, yanking Trinity and Neo up
	through the shaft as --

	The elevator falls away beneath them, distending space,
	filling it with the sound of WHISTLING METAL as they soar
	to the top.


	INT.  LOBBY (MATRIX) - DAY

	The ELEVATOR hits the botton.

	BA-BOOM!

	The massive EXPLOSION blows open the doors, fire clouds
	engulfing the elevator section of the lobby.


	INT.  PRESIDENTIAL SUITE (MATRIX) - DAY

	The Agents hear the BLAST AND FIRE ALARMS.

					AGENT JONES
			Lower level --

					AGENT BROWN
			They are actually attacking.


	INT.  ELEVATOR SHAFT (MATRIX) - DAY

	Hanging by a rope, Trinity hot-wires the panel for the
	door.


	INT.  TOP FLOOR (MATRIX) - DAY

	Nervous, the Marines watch as the ELEVATOR "DINGS" softly
	and slides open.

	Black smoke rises out of the exposed shaft.

	The nearest Marine eases to the edge, peering down at the
	churning blaze engulfing the lower levels.

	He does not see Trinity and Neo above him until it is too
	late.

	Krack!  Neo kicks, knocking the Marine flying down into
	the shaft.

	Before the others can react, Trinity flips out into the
	hall, decking the nearest Marine.  Neo cracks another.

	The fight is over before it begins.


	INT.  PRESIDENTIAL SUITE (MATRIX) - DAY

	An enormous EXPLOSION THUNDERS above them, shaking the
	building.  The ALARM SOUNDS, emergency sprinklers begin
	showering the room.

	Agent Smith smashes a table.

					AGENT SMITH
			Find them and destroy them!

	Agent Jones nods and touches his ear piece.


	EXT.  ROOF (MATRIX) - DAY

	The roof-access tower is now engulfed in flames as Neo
	and Trinity lay waste to a dozen more Marines.

	Guns and knives, like extensions of their bodies used
	with the same deadly precision as their feet and their
	fists.

	Across the roof, the pilot inside the army helicopter
	watches the ferocious onslaught.

					PILOT
			I repeat, we are under attack!

	Suddenly his face, his whole body dissolves, consumed by
	spreading locust-like swarm, of STATIC as --

	Agent Jones emerges.

	Just as she drops the last Marine, Trinity sees what's
	coming.

	Neo sees her, the fear in her face, and he knows what is
	behind him.

	Screaming, he whirls, GUNS filling his hands with
	thought-speed.

	Fingers PUMPING, SHELLS ejecting, dancing up and away, we
	look through the sights and gun smoke at --

	The Agent blurred with motion --

	Until the HAMMERS CLICK against empty metal.

					NEO
			Trinity!

	Agent Jones charges.

					NEO
			... help.

	His GUN BOOMS as we enter the liquid space of --

	Bullet-time.

	The AIR SIZZLES with wads of lead-like angry flies as Neo
	twists, bends, ducks just between them.

	Agent Jones still running, narrows the gap, the BULLETS
	coming faster until --

	Neo bent impossibly back, one hand on the ground as a
	spiraling gray ball shears open his shoulder.

	He starts to scream as another digs a red groove across
	his thigh.

	He has only time to look up, to see the barrel when Agent
	Jones, standing over him, pulls the TRIGGER the final
	time.

	CLICK.  Empty.

	Neo rolls, reaching for another gun when around-house
	kick snaps his jaw.  Agent Jones grabs the gun and levels
	it at Neo.

					AGENT JONES
			Only human...

	Suddenly Agent Jones stops.  Something is wrong.  He
	scans the roof.  Trinity is gone.

	Immediately, he whirls around and turns straight into the
	muzzle of her .45 --

	Jammed right into his head.

					TRINITY
			Dodge this, motherfucker!

	BOOM!  BOOM!  BOOM!  The body flies back with a flash of
	mercurial light and when it hits the ground --

	It is the pilot.

	Trinity helps Neo up.

					NEO
			Thanks.

					TRINITY
			You're hit --

					NEO
			I'm fine.

	Neo is already looking at the helicopter.

					NEO
			Can you fly that thing?

					TRINITY
			Not yet.

	She pulls out a cellular phone.


	INT.  HOVERCRAFT

	Tank is back at the controls.

					TANK
			Operator.

					TRINITY (V.O.)
			Tank, I need a pilot program for a
			military M-109 helicopter.

	Tank is immediately searching the disk drawers.

					TRINITY (V.O.)
			Hurry!

	His fingers flash over the gleaming laser disks, finding
	one that he feeds into Trinityls supplement drive,
	punching the "load" cormands on her keyboard.


	EXT.  ROOF (MATRIX) - DAY

	Trinity's eyes flutter as information surges into her
	brain, all the essentials of flying a helicopter absorbed
	at light-speed.

					TRINITY
			Let's go.


	INT.  HALL (MATRIX) - DAY

	Marines, trying to communicate with the men on the roof,
	are beginning to panic when Agent Jones comes around the
	corner.

					SERGEANT
			Sir!  Sir!  There was gunfire --
			we've lost communication with the
			roof!

					AGENT JONES
			Remain at your posts.

					SERGEANT
			But, sir -- the fire -- we should
			evacuate!

					AGENT JONES
			You will do as you are ordered!

					SERGEANT
			Yes, sir.

	Agent Jones marches into the Presidential Suite.


	INT.  PRESIDENTIAL SUITE (MATRIX) - DAY

	Agent Jones throws open the bedroom door and enters,
	walking through the puddles pooling in the carpet.

	Over the RUSHING WATER and the ALARMS, Agent Smith hears
	a SOUND and understands the seriousness of the attack.

	He turns to the wall of windows as the helicopter drops
	INTO VIEW --

	Neo is in the back bay, aiming the mounted .50 machine
	gun.

					AGENT SMITH
			No.

	The GUN jumps and BULLETS EXPLODE through the WINDOW in a
	cacophony of CRASHING GLASS --

	As the Agents go for their weapons.

	But Neo is too close, the .50 CALIBER too fast and
	BULLETS are everywhere, perforating the room.

	Agent Smith is hit first, his body jack-knifing back,
	blood arcing out with a sudden flash of light --

	Then Agent Brown, his GUN still FIRING as his body falls.

	And finally Agent Jones.

	Neo stares at Morpheus, trying to will him into action.

					NEO
			Get up, Morpheus!  Get up!

	Morpheus sits unmoving, his head still down.

	Neo grabs the climbing rope just as marines burst into
	the adjoining room.

	He attaches only one end to his harness when they OPEN
	FIRE.

	Quickly he swings the GUN, SPRAYING the other room,
	WINDOWS SHATTERING, FURNITURE EXPLODING, marines diving
	for cover.


	INT.  HALL (MATRIX) - DAY

	Just outside the Presidential Suite, three marines
	blister with snow-static.


	INT.  PRESIDENTIAL SUITE (MATRIX) - DAY

	Morpheus lifts his face into the room's rain.  His eyes,
	still white, begin to blink, twitch, then close.

	And when he opens them, they are again dark and flashing
	with fire.

	The Agents knife into the room, FIRING even as Neo's
	BULLET TRAILS chase them.

	Morpheus strains at his handcuffs.

	The Agents and the marines turn the tide, BLASTING LEAD,
	RICOCHETING, POCK-MARKING the COPTER.

	FIRING wildly, Neo turns to see Morpheus rising, snapping
	the handcuffs, starting for the window.

	Agent Smith stops and sees Morpheus run past the open
	bedroom door.

					AGENT SMITH
			Nooo!

	He FIRES, sweeping across the sheetrocked wall in a
	perfect line.

	For an instant, we see the BULLETS SHRED, PUNCTURING the
	WALL, searing through the wet air with jet trails of
	chalk.

	And as Morpheus starts to dive for the window, a bullet
	buries itself in his leg --

	Knocking him off balance.

					NEO
			He won't make it.

	Morpheus lunges, out of control --

	As Neo spins, every move a whip crack --

	Snapping the other rope-end onto a bolted bar.

	Morpheus begins to fall when Neo hurls himself into the
	wide blue empty space --

	Flying for a moment.

	The rope snaking out behind him; an umbilical cord
	attached to a machine.

	As their two bodies, set in motion, rushing at each other
	on a seemingly magnetic course until --

	They collide.

	Almost bouncing free of each other, arms, legs,
	scrambling, hands searching in furious desperation,
	finding hold and clinging.

	Until the line ends, snapping taut, cracking their
	fragile embrace.  Morpheus tumbles, legs flipping over,
	falling down --

	The ground deliriously distant --

	As Neo snatches hold of his mentor's still handcuffed
	wrist.

					NEO
			Gotcha!

	Trinity is already pulling the copter up and away.

	As Agent Smith grabs the M-16 from the nearest marine.

	He'll bring them all down.  Targeting the helicopter, he
	aims at something only he can see: the oil line.

	PONK.  PONK.  PONK.  The rear HULL is PUNCHED full of
	holes and smoke and oil pours out like black blood.

					TRINITY
			Shit-shit-no!

	Neo is pulling Morpheus up to him when he hears the
	HELICOPTER BEGIN TO DIE.

					NEO
			Oh fuck.

	Trinity throws the helicopter towards the roof of the
	nearest building.

	Morpheus and Neo cling to one another as they and the
	machine above them begin to fall.

	The ENGINE GRINDS, the CHOPPING BLADES start to slow
	while --

	The Agents stand in the open shattered window, watching
	the helicopter disappear behind taller buildings.

	Carried by its nomentum, Trinity guides the parabolic
	fall over the nearest roof where --

	Neo and Morpheus drop safely, rolling free as the rope
	goes slack.  Neo gets to his feet, trying to detach
	himself but --

	The helicopter is falling too fast, arcing over the roof
	like a setting sun --

	The coils of slack snap taught --

	Yanking Neo off his feet, dragging him with ferocious
	speed towards the edge even as --

	Trinity lunges for the back door, her gun in one hand,
	grabbing for the rope with the other --

	Neo flies like a skipping stone, hurtling straight AT us,
	when his feet hit the rain gutter --

	A fulcrum that levers him up just as --

	Trinity FIRES, severing the cord from the HELICOPTER,
	falling free of it as it SMASHES, blades first into a 
	glass skyscraper.

	Holding onto the rope she swings, connected to Neo, who
	stands on the building's edge watching her arc beneath
	him as the HELICOPTER EXPLODES --

	She bounces against a shatterproof window that spider-
	cracks out while FLAMES ERUPT behind her.


	INT.  MAIN DECK

	Tank stares at the screen, his mouth agape.

					TANK
			He's the One.  He's got to be...


	EXT.  ROOFTOP (MATRIX) - DAY

	Neo pulls Trinity up into his arms.  Both shaking, they
	hold each other again.

					MORPHEUS
			I knew it!  I goddamn knew it!

					TRINITY
			Morpheus!

	She runs at him, throwing her arms around him.

					MORPHEUS
			Do you believe me now?  He's the
			One!  Who else could have done
			this?

					NEO
			Morpheus, I know you won't believe
			me but the Oracle told ne I'm not
			the One.

					MORPHEUS
			It doesn't matter if I don't
			believe you --

	His eyes light up.

					MORPHEUS
			What matters is that you don't
			believe her.


	INT.  MAIN DECK

	The PHONE RINGS.

					TRINITY (V.O.)
			Tank, get us out of here.

					TANK
			Got one ready.  An underground El
			station.  State and Balbo.

					TRINITY (V.O.)
			See ya soon.

	LINE GOES DEAD.  Tank looks at the bodies and smiles.

					TANK
			See ya soon.


	EXT.  ROOFTOP (MATRIX) - DAY

	The rope is all that remains.  Agent Smith can barely
	control his anger.

					AGENT BROWN
			The trace was completed.

					AGENT JONES
			We have their position.

					AGENT BROWN
			The extermination unit is in
			place.

					AGENT JONES
			Order the strike.

	Agent Smith can't stand listening to them.  He moves to
	the edge of the building, looking out at the surrounding
	city.

					AGENT SMITH
			They're not out yet.


	INT.  "EL" STATION (MATRIX) - DAY

	A metal gate is locked, the sign reading, "Station
	Closed."  Neo looks around, takes out a GUN and BLOWS OFF
	the LOCK.

	In the moist underground distance they hear the MUTED
	RING of a TELEPHONE.

	The PHONE is RINGING inside a graffiti-covered booth.

	Across from it, sitting hunched against the red concrete
	wall, is an OLD MAN.  He stares at the RINGING PHONE,
	taking a final pull off his T-bird.  No one is around.
	It continues to RING.

	Determined, he stands and walks to the booth.  He is
	about to answer the phone, when Neo sees him.

					NEO
			Don't!

	The Old Man stops, Neo rushes at hin, gliding smoothly
	over the turnstiles.

					OLD MAN
			I'm sorry -- I didn't mean!

	The Old Man is shaking, terrified.  Neo looks at his gun.
	He glances over his shoulder, then eases back the hammer.

					NEO
			Get outta here.  Okay?  Run!  Go!

	The Old Man nods, turns and hurries deeper into the urban
	cave, disappearing into the shadows as Trinity and
	Morpheus arrive.

					TRINITY
			What happened?  Was that --

					NEO
			It was nobody.

	Neo turns to the RINGING BOOTH.

					NEO
			Let's go!  You first, Morpheus.

	Morpheus gets in and answers the phone.

	Lost in the shadow, the Old Man turns back and watches as
	Morpheus disappears, the phone dropping, dangling by its
	cord.

	His eyes grow wide, glowing white in the dark.


	EXT.  ROOFTOP (MATRIX) - DAY

	Agent Smith stares, his face twisted with hate.  He will
	never be free of the Matrix.

	He starts to turn from the edge of the building when he
	suddenly hears it, his head whipping back around,
	staring --


	INT.  "EL" STATION (MATRIX) - DAY

	As the Old Man stares.

	Trinity hangs up the phone.  She turns to Neo, standing
	close enough to kiss him.

					TRINITY
			Morpheus is right, you know.  It
			doesn't matter what he believes or
			even what the Oracle believes.
			What matters is what you believe.

					NEO
			I believe...

	He stares at the fullness of her lips.

					NEO
			I want to kiss you.

	She smiles.

					TRINITY
			I want to kiss you too...

	The PHONE begins to RING.

					TRINITY
			But I want it to be real.

	She pulls herself away and gets into the booth when
	something catches Neo's eye and he looks to where the Old
	Man had been.

	She hears him SCREAM and sees Agent Smith emerge as if
	formed by congealing darkness, charging with a fistful of
	metal.

	The GUN FIRES, the BULLET flying at her, BURSTING through
	the plastic WINDOW just as --

	Trinity disappears.

	The handset hanging in the air as the BULLET HITS,
	SHATTERING the EAR-PIECE.


	INT.  HOVERCRAFT

	Trinity blinks, shivering as her conscious exits the
	Construct.

					TRINITY
			Neo!

					TANK
			What the hell just happened?

					TRINITY
			An Agent!  You have to send me
			back!

					TANK
			I can't!


	INT.  "EL" STATION (MATRIX) - DAY

	GUN REPORT THUNDERS through the underground, both men
	BLASTING, moving at impossible speed.

	For a blinking noment we enter BULLET-TIME.

	Gun flash tongues curl from Neols gun, bullets float
	forward like a plane noving across the sky, cartridges
	cartwheel into space.

	An instant later they are nearly on top of each other,
	rolling up out of a move that is almost a mirrored
	reflection of the other --

	Each jamming their gun tight to the other's head.

	They freeze in a kind of embrace; Neo sweating, panting,
	Agent Smith machine-calm.

	Agent Smith smiles.

					AGENT SMITH
			You're empty.

	Neo pulls the TRIGGER.  CLICK.

					NEO
			So are you.

	The smile falls.  Agent Smith yanks his TRIGGER.

	CLICK.

	Agent Smith's face warps with rage and he attacks, fist
	flying at furious speed, blows and counters, Neo
	retreating as --

	A knife-hand opens his forearm, and a kick sends him
	slamming back against a steel column.

	Stunned, he ducks just under a punch that crunches into
	the beam, STEEL CHUNKS EXPLODING like shrapnel.

	Behind him, Neo leaps into the air, delivering a neck-
	snapping reverse round-house.  Agent Smith's glasses fly
	off and he glares at Neo; his eyes, ice blue.

					AGENT SMITH
			You can't win.

					NEO
			I already have.

	He attacks with a vicious series of blows but the Agent
	seems to absorb them, waiting for his opening.

	And this time Agent Smith's attack is too much, an
	unrelenting fury, fists pounding like jackhammers.


	INT.  HOVERCRAFT

	Trinity watches Neo as his body jerks, mouth coughing
	blood, his life signs going wild.

					TRINITY
			Jesus, he's killing him!


	INT.  "EL" STATION (MATRIX) - DAY

	Agent Smith grabs hold of him, lifting him into the air,
	hurling him against the curved wall of the train tunnel,
	where he falls inches from the electrified third-rail.

	The Agent is about to jump down, and press his attack
	when he hears sonething.  From deep in the tunnel, like
	an animal cry; a burst of high-speed METAL GRINDING
	against METAL.

	The sound of an ON-COMING TRAIN.


	INT.  HOVERCRAFT

	Tank is trying to find another entrance.

					TRINITY
			Send me back, Tank!  Anywhere!

					TANK
			I'm looking, Trinity!  I'm
			looking!

	From the cockpit, an ALARM sounds.  Morpheus hurries to
	the front console, typing, bringing up the radar.

	Trinity follows him.

					TRINITY
			What is it... oh no.

	In every pipe surrounding them, they see the
	Extermination Unit.

					TRINITY
			Sentinels.


	INT.  SEWER MAIN

	The killing machine we saw in the History Program blister
	by us like tracer bullets shot down the throat of the
	abyss.


	INT.  "EL" STATION (MATRIX) - DAY

	Neo tries to get up.  Agent Smith jumps down onto the
	tracks and drop-kicks him in the face.

	The world begins to shake, RUMBLING as the TRAIN NEARS.

					AGENT SMITH
			Do you hear that, Mr. Anderson?

	Agent Smith grabs Neo in a choke-hold, forcing him to
	look down the tracks, the train's headlight burning a
	hole in the darkness.

					AGENT SMITH
			That is the sound of
			inevitability.

	Neo sees it coming and he starts to fight.

					AGENT SMITH
			It is the sound of your death.

	There is another METAL SCREECH, MUCH LOUDER, closer, as
	Agent Smith tightens his hold.  Neo is unable to breathe.

					AGENT SMITH
			Goodbye, Mr. Anderson.

	The TRAIN ROARS at them, swallowing Agent Smith's words.

	The veins bulge in Neo's head, as he grits through the
	pain.

	He is not ready to die.

					NEO
			My name is Neo.

	Impossibly, he hurls himself straight up, smashing Smith
	against the concrete ceiling of the tunnel.

	They fall as the sound and fury of the TRAIN EXPLODES
	INTO the station.

	Neo back-flips up off the tracks just as --

	The train barrels over Agent Smith.

	Neo stands, knees shaking, when the train slams on its
	emergency brake.  With an ear-splitting SHRIEK of
	TORTURED RAILS, the train slows, part of it still in the
	station.

	Neo turns, limping, starting to run, racing for the
	escalator --

	As the train comes to a stop and the doors of the last
	car open; Agent Smith bursts out in furious pursuit, his
	glasses again intact.


	INT.  HOVERCRAFT

	Morpheus checks the ship's self destruct key.

					TRINITY
			You can't use that until Neo is
			out!

					MORPHEUS
			I know.  Don't worry, he'll make
			it.


	EXT.  CITY STREET (MATRIX) - DAY

	A man sits in his Mercedes, talking on his car phone when
	his door is thrown open.  Neo yanks him out and jumps in.

	Further down the street, Agent Smith slows, calmly
	touching his ear-piece.

	Neo throws the car across traffic, rocketing down a side-
	street.


	INT.  CAR (MATRIX) - DAY

	Driving like a demon with one hand, he grabs the car
	phone and dials long distance.

	Tank answers.

			Mr. Wizard, Get me the fuck out

	INT.  CAR (MATRIX) - DAY

	Looking over his shoulder, watching the mirrors, Neo
	drives almost unconsciously.

					NEO
			Hurry, Tank!  I got some serious
			pursuit!


	INT.  HOVERCRAFT

	The keyboard clicking, Tank searches for an exit.
	Trinity screams into the headset.

					TRINITY
			Neo, you better get your ass back
			here!


	INT.  CAR

					NEO
			I'm trying, Trinity.  I'm trying.

					TANK (V.O.)
			I got one!

	Neo glances to his right and sees Agent Brown, now
	driving the car beside his.  Agent Brown swerves,
	slamming into him.

					TANK (V.O.)
			Wabash and Lake.  A hotel.

	Neo fights the steering wheel as Agent Brown pushes the
	car up over the median.

					TANK (V.O.)
			Room 303.

	Neo drops the phone as his car bucks into the opposing
	lane --

	Directly into the charging path of an enormous truck
	driven by Agent Smith.

	Neo dives from the Mercedes as the truck plows into it,
	rending metal and GLASS, crushing through, totaling other
	cars, as it EXPLODES.

	Neo is up and running even as orange and black clouds
	billow up behind hin.


	EXT.  CITY STREET (MATRIX) - DAY

	Three figures silhouette by the burning wreckage become
	the three agents.

	Further down the street, Neo hauls his broken, bleeding
	ass.

	Agents Brown and Smith slow, touching their ear-pieces as
	Agent Jones continues chasing full-bore.

	Neo spins around a corner, racing toward a hotel called:
	the Heart of Chicago Hotel.

	Only Agent Jones is behind him now.

	Neo dives into the alley.  At the far end he sees Agent
	Brown charging.  Neo leaps for the fire escape and begins
	to climb.


	INT.  SEWER MAIN

	Sentinels open and shift like killer kaleidoscopes as

	EXT.  ALLEY (MATRIX) - DAY

	The agents chase him, FIRING, BULLETS SPARKING and
	RICOCHETING even as Neo jumps for the third-floor

	Neo kicks in the window, jumping into the hall.  The

	INT.  HOVERCRAFT

	Morpheus grabs the biggest gun he can find.  The lasers

					TRINITY
			Hurry, Neo.


	INT.  HALL (MATRIX) - DAY

	Neo can hear the PHONE RINGING.

	Agent Brown reaches the broken window behind him just as
	Neo grabs the handle of 303, throwing open the door to
	find --

	Agent Sniith, waiting, .45 cocked.

	Neo can't move -- can't think --

	BOOM.

	Trinity screams.  Morpheus is frozen in disbelief.


	INT.  HALL (MATRIX) - DAY

	Three holes in his chest, Neo falls to the blue shag
	carpeting, blood smearing down the wallpaper.

	Agent Smith stands over him, still aiming, taking no

			Check him.


	INT.  HOVERCRAFT

	Through the lasered opening, Morpheus screams, blasting
	away at the machines; comet-wads of plasma burning holes

			No-no-no!  Neo, you're not dead!
			You can't be dead!

	Tank is hit, a laser bolt knocking him to the ground.

			You're right here.  I'm holding

	Neo struggles, holding his chest, sitting up.  Down the

	Neo gives him the finger.

					AGENT SMITH
			Nooooo!

	Agent Smith pounds on the elevator door.

			Hi.  It's me.  I know you're out
			there.  I know you're working as
			fast as you can to catch me.

	We CLOSE IN ON the racing columns of numbers shimmering
	across the screen.

					NEO (V.O.)
			I thought I should call and let
			you know how things stand.

	We DIVE THROUGH the numbers, surging UP THROUGH the
	darkness, sucked TOWARDS a tight constellation of stars.

					NEO (V.O.)
			I know you're real proud of this
			world you've built, the way it
			works, all the nice little rules
			and such, but I've got some bad
			news.

	We realize that the constellation is actually the holes
	in the mouthpiece of a phone.  Seen from inside.

					NEO (V.O.)
			I've decided to make a few
			changes.

	We SHOOT THROUGH the holes as Neo hangs up the phone.

	He steps out of the phone booth and starts walking,
	wearing a long black coat and dark glasses.  He passes a
	mother dragging her little BOY, who cranes his neck as --

	Neo takes off, flying up into the air.

					BOY
			Mommy!  Mommy!

					MOMMY
			What?

					BOY
			That man!  That man flies!

					MOMMY
			Don't be silly, honey.  Men don't
			fly.

	There is a RUSH of AIR as the Boy stares up as Neo shoots
	overhead.  His coat billowing like a black leather cape
	as he soars up, up, and away.

										FADE OUT.

      HEADLINES flash before us, displaying their accompanying

      "UBERMAN - METRO CITY'S HERO AFTER DEFEATING MASTER MIND!
      
      PHOTO: A chiseled, statuesque man wearing the COOLEST SUPER
      HERO SUIT IMAGINABLE, COMPLETE WITH FLOWING CAPE, shines a
      confident smile at the lens. This is UBERMAN, champion of
      METRO CITY.
      
      "UBERMAN DEFEATS MASTER MIND'S GIANT ROBOT!"
      
      PHOTO: Wide-shot of Uberman in mid-flight lifting the GIANT
      ROBOT in the sky above the city buildings.
      
      "MASTER MIND ALL WET AFTER UBERMAN FOILS AQUARIUM HEIST!"
      
      PHOTO: Uberman stands knee-deep in water. He has his enemy by
      the collar. The villain blocks his face from the shot with a
      METALLIC GAUNTLET.
      
      The images start to flash by even quicker, each showing the
      MYSTERIOUS VILLAIN in various stages of humiliation. In each
      photograph he successfully blocks his face with his armored
      glove.
      
      We ZOOM IN to the last headline.
      
      "MASTER MIND BEHIND BARS ONCE AGAIN - THANKS TO UBERMAN!"
      
      PHOTO: Uberman stands in a gallant pose with his fists on his
      hips, obviously trying to accentuate the "U" insignia on his
      chest.
      
      END OF CREDITS SEQUENCE
      
      EXT. BUILDING - DAY
      
      We DISSOLVE from the photograph to Uberman standing in the
      exact same position.
      
      WE PULL BACK showing him atop a BUILDING overlooking the city
      below. A perfect view for our guardian hero.
      
      He watches the thriving metropolis, bristling with life as
      people happily go about their day.
      
      Yet, we can't help but detect a hint of sadness in Uberman's
      expression.
                                                               2.
      
      
      
                          UBERMAN
                You look so peaceful from up here.
      
      His serenity is suddenly interrupted by a loud BEEPING SOUND
      coming from his wrist.
      
      He looks down at a BRACELET (a manly one) on his right arm.
      It's a silver band with a FLASHING red letter "U".
      
                          UBERMAN (CONT'D)
                Looks like Roxanne's in trouble
                again.
      
      Uberman leaps off the building and into the air. His cape
      gracefully flows in the breeze behind him as he shoots off
      into the distance like a speeding bullet.
      
      EXT. OBSERVATORY HIDEOUT - ESTABLISHING SHOT
      
      Grime and moss decorate the outside of this long abandoned
      building overlooking the COAST. Once a place of knowledge and
      wonder - now home to a great evil.
      
      INT. OBSERVATORY HIDEOUT - DAY
      
      The inside is in complete contrast to the exterior. The huge
      hall with a GIANT TELESCOPE teems with advanced ELECTRONIC
      EQUIPMENT. Computers, monitors and machines which do not have
      an obvious function FLASH and HUM.
      
      A STEEL DOOR slides open, revealing the subject of our story
      MASTER MIND - a villainous sight to behold. His FACE IS
      INEXPLICABLY LIGHT BLUE, topped by an OVERSIZED, MUSHROOM-
      SHAPED HEAD with a CIRCULAR PATCH OF WHITE HAIR ON TOP.
      
      He's dressed in the kind of costume only a super villain
      could pull off: a PURPLE JUMPSUIT AND BLACK BOOT ENSEMBLE
      WITH A GIANT GREEN "M" ON THE CHEST. His right hand, hanging
      at his side, is a METAL GAUNTLET WITH THREE SHORT SPIKES
      PROTRUDING BETWEEN HIS KNUCKLES.
      
      Master Mind begins to survey the room with his TWO
      PERMANENTLY ARCHED EYEBROWS.
      
      A man dressed as ALBERT EINSTEIN is busy ranting to two other
      men. One, a hulking brute, is dressed as LEONARDO DA VINCI.
      The other, a small intellectual-type carrying a clip-board,
      is dressed as the philosopher PLATO.
      
                          EINSTEIN
                I hate the outfits. I mean, I get
                it: we're all supposed to be
                "masterminds" - very clever.
                          (MORE)
                                                                3.
                          EINSTEIN(cont'd)
                I just feel stupid. I mean, what
                the hell did Einstein really do
                anyway?
      
                          PLATO
                Theory of relativity.
      
      Einstein starts feverishly scratching his side.
      
                          EINSTEIN
                Well, you'd think he'd invent a
                wool sweater that didn't itch so
                much.
      
      Da Vinci and Plato's eyes suddenly grow with concern as they
      see Master Mind walk up behind Einstein.
      
      Einstein notices his colleague's staring over his right
      shoulder and turns around.
      
      He turns around and Master Mind SEIZES HIM BY HIS THROAT with
      his metal gauntlet.
      
                          MASTER MIND
                The real Einstein once said, "God
                does not play dice with the world."
                He was right, because the world is
                MY dice. Is that understood?
      
                          DA VINCI & PLATO
                Sir! Yes, sir!
      
                          EINSTEIN
                    (gasping for air)
                Yes, sir.
      
      Master Mind undoes his grip on Einstein's throat.
      
                          MASTER MIND
                Alright, then - clean slate. Do we
                have the girl?
      
                          DA VINCI
                Yes, sir. She fell into our trap
                just like you knew she would.
      
                          MASTER MIND
                Reporters are a curious lot, and
                easily manipulated.
      
      He quickly checks his physique in a GIANT MIRROR, adjusts his
      posture and sucks in his gut.
                                                                  4.
      
      
      
                          MASTER MIND
                Alright, let's not keep the lady
                waiting.
      
      MOMENTS LATER
      
      Da Vinci escorts a BLINDFOLDED and bound woman, ROXANNE
      RITCHI, to the back of the room where Plato and Einstein are
      standing guard over a large BLACK SWIVEL-CHAIR facing away
      from us.
      
      She pulls free of Da Vinci's grasp and waits for him to undo
      the blindfold.
      
      Her face uncovered, we finally see Roxanne's striking
      features - all of which seem overshadowed by piercing eyes
      that seem more put off by the situation than afraid of it.
      
                          MASTER MIND (O.S.)
                Miss Ritchi, we meet again.
      
      The chair turns menacingly slow, finally revealing Master
      Mind.
      
                          ROXANNE
                You didn't need to turn around like
                that. I can recognize the stench of
                failure.
      
      Master Mind unleashes a wicked laugh.
      
                          MASTER MIND
                I trust you gentlemen know the very
                sassy Roxanne Ritchi, highly
                regarded investigative journalist
                who some say has a more than
                friendly relationship with our
                super powered foe Uberman. And Miss
                Ritchi, I trust you've already met
                my new crew: The Mad Geniuses!
      
      Roxanne gives Einstein a once over.
      
                          ROXANNE
                Looks like a real group of winners.
                At the risk of sounding cliche',
                you'll never get away with this.
      
                          MASTER MIND
                In a way, I already have.
      
      Roxanne unleashes an exhausted SIGH.
                                                               5.
      
      
      
                          ROXANNE
                We go through this every time. You
                kidnap me to get to Uberman, he
                immediately finds your hideout,
                escapes whatever lame trap you've
                come up with, and takes you and
                your cronies to jail. I propose we
                just save everybody some heartache
                this time by YOU letting me go, and
                ME forgetting this whole thing ever
                happened?
      
                          MASTER MIND
                What about my revenge?
      
                          ROXANNE
                We can say it was wasting
                everyone's time.
      
                          MASTER MIND
                You have a wicked tongue. I hope
                you rid yourself of that when
                you're my queen.
      
      Roxanne unleashes a snort-filled laugh.
      
                          ROXANNE
                I'm sorry. What makes you think I
                would want to be your queen?
      
                          MASTER MIND
                Power corrupts absolutely, Miss
                Ritchi. And when I have ultimate
                power over this city, I have
                absolutely every intention of
                corrupting you with it.
      
                          PLATO
                Sir!
      
      Master Mind turns to Plato who's now standing at a computer
      terminal.
      
                          MASTER MIND
                    (annoyed)
                What is it!?
      
      EXT. OBSERVATORY HIDEOUT - DAY
      
      Uberman flies toward the Observatory like a rocket.
                                                                  6.
      
      
      
      
      INT. OBSERVATORY HIDEOUT - DAY
      
      Uberman crashes through the wall to the room we were just in.
      He looks around, but there's suddenly NOT A SOUL IN SIGHT.
      
                                                       CUT TO:
      
      EXT. MASTER MIND'S HYDROFOIL - DAY
      
      The boat is shooting through the ocean, away from the
      observatory.
      
      INT. HYDROFOIL CONTROL ROOM - DAY
      
      Machines, cables and terminals criss-cross the craft's main
      bridge. Through the enormous surrounding windows we can see
      the observatory shrinking in the distance.
      
      Master Mind watches Uberman on a small TV monitor as the hero
      intently searches his hideout.
      
                          UBERMAN
                    (on monitor)
                Master Mind!
      
      INT. OBSERVATORY HIDEOUT - DAY
      
      Uberman throws up his arms in frustration when suddenly -
      
                          MASTER MIND (O.S.)
                Over here, old friend.
      
      He turns to see a FAMILIAR BLUE FACE OF EVIL ON A GIANT
      SCREEN.
      
                           UBERMAN
                What's the matter, miss your old
                jail cell?
      
      Uberman starts walking toward the monitor.
      
                          MASTER MIND (ON MONITOR)
                Actually, I wanted to share the
                experience with my oldest friend.
      
      A MECHANIZED CAGE shoots out of the floor, suddenly trapping
      Metro City's protector.
      
      Totally unfazed, our hero stares on.
                                                                  7.
      
      
      
                           UBERMAN
                You can't possibly believe this
                will work.
      
      Master Mind pulls out a SMALL BLACK BOX with a SINGLE RED
      BUTTON on it.
      
                          MASTER MIND (ON MONITOR)
                Oh, can't I? I have attained
                control of the Earth's most
                abundant energy source. I doubt
                even you are strong enough to
                withstand the FULL CONCENTRATED
                POWER OF THE SUN!!!
      
      He presses the button.
      
      EXT. OUTER SPACE
      
      A sinister-looking SATELLITE orbits Earth's atmosphere. Its
      bay doors suddenly open, deploying two huge SOLAR PANELS.
      
      The panels shift, angling themselves in the direction of the
      sun. They immediately start GLOWING as they absorb the
      burning star's power.
      
      The front of the satellite begins to make a loud HUMMING
      SOUND as it prepares to unleash its unholy power.
      
      INT. HYDROFOIL CONTROL ROOM - DAY
      
      From the giant window we can see the boat is a good mile from
      the observatory.
      
                          PLATO
                We're now at minimum safe distance,
                master.
      
      Master Mind turns from the CAMERA he was broadcasting on and
      puts down the control box.
      
                          MASTER MIND
                Excellent. Stop here, I like this
                view.
      
                          PLATO
                Twenty seconds until impact.
      
      Master Mind turns to Roxanne who is being held by Da Vinci
      and Einstein. She almost appears a little bored.
      
      Disappointed by her lack of horror, he walks over to the
      monitor now showing Uberman trapped in the cage.
                                                               8.
      
      
      
                          MASTER MIND
                Any last words?
      
      Uberman looks up at the screen with a cocky smile.
      
                          UBERMAN (ON MONITOR)
                Yes: there's no caging the power of
                justice.
      
                          PLATO
                Ten seconds to impact.
      
      On the screen we see Uberman take two of the cage's bars in
      his hands. He yanks...NOTHING.
      
                           PLATO (CONT'D)
                Nine...
      
      Master Mind stares at the monitor, slightly confused.
      
                           PLATO (CONT'D)
                Eight...
      
      Uberman yanks on the bars again, this time using his foot as
      leverage.
      
                          MASTER MIND
                    (genuinely concerned)
                What's going on?
      
                          UBERMAN
                    (straining)
                Hold...on...a second.
      
      Master Mind looks back at Plato and Einstein. They're equally
      befuddled at the hero's sudden weakness.
      
                           PLATO
                Seven...
      
      Uberman loses his grip and FALLS BACKWARD ON HIS ASS.
      
                          UBERMAN
                SON OF A BITCH!!
      
      Master Mind and the minions all cringe in unison.
      
      Da Vinci turns to Roxanne not believing his ears.
      
                          DA VINCI
                What did he just say?
                                                               9.
      
      
      
                          PLATO
                Six......Five...
      
      Master Mind begins to laugh.
      
                          MASTER MIND
                What kind of trick is this?
      
      Uberman looks up at the camera with a very grave expression.
      
                          UBERMAN
                Like you don't know. These bars are
                made of copper, aren't they?
      
                             PLATO
                Four...
      
                             MASTER MIND
                Yeah, so?
      
      Uberman tries to shield his grief with his hand.
      
                          UBERMAN
                You figured out my weakness, damn
                you. I CAN'T BEND COPPER!
      
                             PLATO
                Three...
      
                          MASTER MIND
                Your weakness is copper?
      
                             PLATO
                Two...one.
      
      Everyone turns to the window.
      
      EXT. OUTER SPACE
      
      The satellite fires a giant BEAM OF LIGHT toward the earth.
      
      EXT. OBSERVATORY HIDEOUT - DAY
      
      The beam hits the observatory. The building instantly
      EXPLODES in a white nova blast of fire.
      
      INT. HYDROFOIL CONTROL ROOM - DAY
      
      The blast is so bright everyone turns away from the window.
      Then, as suddenly as it began, the awesome light dies out.
      
      One by one, the passengers unshield their eyes and look out
      toward the observatory.
                                                                10.
      
      
      
      All we can see through the haze of destruction is fire and
      smoke.
      
                          PLATO
                I don't think even he could have
                survived that.
      
      Einstein suddenly turns giddy with excitement.
      
                          EINSTEIN
                Whoa! Is it me or did you just
                finally destroy Uberman?
      
                           MASTER MIND
                    (carefully skeptical)
                Well...let's not get ahead of
                ourselves.
      
      Da Vinci suddenly sees something outside.
      
                          DA VINCI
                Look, there's something in the sky,
                coming this way.
      
                           ROXANNE
                Uberman!
      
      Master Mind turns toward the window.
      
      An object is in the air, flying directly toward them. As it
      closes in we can just make out the FAMILIAR OUTLINE OF A
      CAPPED FIGURE.
      
                          MASTER MIND
                I KNEW IT! PREPARE YOURSELVES! HE'S
                GONNA RAM US!!!
      
      Everyone scatters and braces themselves for the impact.
      
      Master Mind, seeing all the good places taken, doesn't know
      what to do with himself. He just covers his giant head with
      his hands.
      
      The figure CRASHES THROUGH THE WINDOW and lands at his feet.
      
      He looks down to see a CHARRED BLACK HUMAN SKELETON. Around
      its neck is the unmistakable black cape of Uberman.
      
                           MASTER MIND (CONT'D)
                    (horrified)
                HOLY SHIT!
                                                              11.
      
      
      
      Roxanne breaks out of Da Vinci's hold and runs over to the
      body.
      
                           ROXANNE
                Uberman?
      
      She stares down at the still smoking corpse, the tattered
      black cape with the yellow "U" on it.
      
      Roxanne turns to Master Mind, who's still visibly dumbfounded
      at the grotesque sight before him.
      
                          ROXANNE (CONT'D)
                You killed him!
      
      Roxanne's eyes roll back. Da Vinci catches her from behind as
      she FAINTS.
      
      Einstein turns to Master Mind, looking at him as if he's just
      walked on water.
      
                          EINSTEIN
                You did it!
      
      Now that he's committed the impossible - our villain is at a
      complete loss.
      
                          MASTER MIND
                ...so I did.
      
                          EINSTEIN
                I mean, I know you always wanted
                to. I mean, all the schemes all the
                plots - I never thought you'd
                actually be capable of it.
      
      Giddy as a school girl, Einstein turns to his fellow
      henchmen.
      
                          EINSTEIN
                This is history. Every villain and
                lackey in the history of villains
                and lackeys dream of this moment,
                but when does it actually EVER
                happen?
      
      A sudden realization comes over his face.
      
                          EINSTEIN
                Good lord...You do all realize what
                we get to do now, don't you?
                                                                 12.
      
      
      
      His question is met with acquisitive looks from Master Mind
      and the others.
      
                          EINSTEIN
                We get to go on a crime wave.
      
      CRIME WAVE MONTAGE - SET TO "Fun Fun Fun" by The Beach Boys.

      WAVE!"
      
      ARMORED TRUCK
      
      It's driving along when the men inside suddenly notice
      something - THEY'RE FLYING HIGH ABOVE THE CITY STREETS.
      
      We PULL BACK to see the truck being carried by a giant claw
      at the bottom of a BRAIN COPTER.
      
      Inside the cockpit Master Mind and his henchmen laugh
      maniacally.
      
      SPINNING HEADLINE: "CHAMPION-LESS CITY AT THE MERCY OF

      METRO CITY BANK
      
      Da Vinci and Einstein run out the front of the bank holding
      BAGS OF MONEY.
      
      Two beat officers see them and take chase after them around
      the corner and into an alley.
      
      After a moment the police reemerge from the alley screaming
      and running for their lives as a GIANT ROBOT CHASES after
      them.
      
      The robot stops, then suddenly it's head opens up like
      convertible car top with Master Mind and Plato at the
      driver's wheel.
      
      They smile and shake hands at a bad deed well done.
      
      SPINNING HEADLINE: "MASTER MIND BLACKMAILS METRO!!!"
      
      A VICIOUS TORNADO
      
      It's heading for downtown Metro as Master Mind and the
      lackeys coolly look on.
      
      Three large DUMP TRUCKS pull up, filled to the brim with
      bricks of CASH.
                                                              13.
      
      
      
      The DRIVERS jump out as the lackeys take the driver seats in
      the three trucks.
      
      Master Mind is about to climb into the passenger seat of one
      when a drivers taps him on the shoulder and motions toward
      the tornado.
      
                           MASTER MIND
                    (absentmindedly)
                Oh, right.
      
      Master Mind pulls a television REMOTE from his pocket and
      aims it at approaching windstorm of death.
      
      He presses the button marked "Tornado Off."
      
      The tornado shrinks and disappears just before it hits the
      city.
      
      As they drive through the city streets, Master stares out the
      window with a hint of something in his eyes. Is it
      melancholy?
      
      END OF MONTAGE
      
      EXT. KINGPIN BOWLING - DAY
      
      It's Metro City's premier bowling alley. On top of the neon
      lit building is a GIANT 30 FOOT TALL CEMENT BOWLING BALL.
      
      INT. KINGPIN BOWLING - DAY
      
      HAL STEWART (early 30's) takes careful aim with his BOWLING
      BALL.
      
                          HAL
                It's a sport of honor, focus and
                grace. Honor the ball, focus on the
                pins, release the ball not hard and
                fast, but as if you were releasing
                a baby dove.
      
      He takes a step, pulls back his arm, and releases the ball,
      following it with his eyes.
      
      It's a horrible shot - INSTANT GUTTER BALL.
      
      An aged barmaid type with a cigarette hanging from her mouth
      looks over at him.
      
                          HAL
                Okay, do something like that - but
                center it more.
                                                                14.
      
      
      
      She picks up her custom made FOGHAT BALL and takes aim.
      
                          ATTRACTIVE BLOND
                Tell me how my form looks, honey.
      
      Hal focuses on the misshapen bumps of her enormous Johnson
      administration era derriere.
      
                           HAL
                Oh, it's lookin' good. It's lookin'
                REAL good.
      
      It doesn't get anymore clear. This man is a pig.
      
                          VINNIE (O.S.)
                Hal, I want to see you in my
                office!
      
      Hal turns to see VINNIE, owner of the bowling alley, calling
      him.
      
                          VINNIE
                Now!
      
      INT. KINGPIN BOWLING - VINNIE'S OFFICE - MOMENTS LATER
      
      Hal sits down, facing Vinnie who's sitting at his desk.
      
                          VINNIE
                You're fired. Leave your shirt and
                locker key.
      
      This bit of news hits Hal like a freight train.
      
                          HAL
                Fired? Are you going to tell me
                why?
      
                          VINNIE
                Showing up to work late. Showing up
                to work late drunk. Sexually
                harassing customers. Stealing from
                the register.
      
                          HAL
                Vinnie, I don't know where you're
                getting these accusations -
      
      Vinnie takes out a video tape from his desk drawer and puts
      in a VCR.
                                                              15.
      
      
      
                              HAL
                   Oh, which one do you supposedly
                   have here?
      
                             VINNIE
                   This is all of them at once.
      
      TELEVISION
      
      A WOMAN walks up to a BOWLING EMPLOYEE and hands him a pair
      of shoes.
      
      As the employee turns to the wall of shoes, a very drunk and
      disheveled Hal comes running in and pushes him aside.
      
                             HAL
                   I've got this one, Benny. So,
                   Cinderella. Can I help you find
                   your glass slipper?
      
                             WOMAN
                   Yeah, I'm looking for a seven.
      
      He folds his arms on the counter and leans into her with a
      cat-like grin on his face.
      
                             HAL
                       (with a leer)
                   Seven - Well, maybe I could
                   interest you in something in an
                   EIGHT. Namely, me.
      
      Disgusted, she walks off screen.
      
                             HAL
                   Lesbo.
      
      Suddenly realizing the register's open, he quickly grabs a
      stack of cash and shoves it in his pocket.
      
      BACK TO OFFICE
      
      Vinnie turns off the television and waits for Hal to respond.
      
                             HAL
                   From the angle of the camera, I can
                   see where you might have gotten the
                   wrong idea. Listen, Vinnie, I don't
                   think you've thought this through.
                   If you fire me, who's gonna be
                   captain of the alley's bowling
                   team?
                                                                16.
      
      
      
                          VINNIE
                Um, I don't know. Maybe somebody
                who can actually bowl. You guys
                have never won a game. I hired you
                because you said you were on the
                pro circuit.
      
                          HAL
                No, I said I WILL BE on the pro
                circuit.
      
                          VINNIE
                Please, a loser like you will never
                amount to anything.
      
      This harsh remark seems to leave Hal genuinely stunned.
      
                          HAL
                Wow...If that's how you feel...I
                guess we should then talk about
                what kind of severance I'm gonna
                get.
      
      EXT. KINGPIN BOWLING - DAY
      
      TWO BRUISERS open the door and throw Hal out onto the street.
      
      He quickly picks himself up and turns back toward the
      building.
      
                          HAL
                Hey...what about my ball?
      
      A bowling ball sails past him, just missing his head.
      
                             HAL
                Thank-you!
      
      EXT. CHANNEL 7 NEWS BUILDING - DAY
      
      The massive building with a giant 7 on the roof stands in the
      heart of Metro City.
      
      INT. CHANNEL 7 NEWS BUILDING - OFFICE - DAY
      
      The cubicles and offices are alive with the hustle and bustle
      of a busy news day.
      
      Phones are RINGING, REPORTERS are TALKING, and Editors are
      SHOUTING.
      
      The elevator doors open and out steps Roxanne Ritchi.
                                                              17.
      
      
      
      Everything stops as the entire office suddenly falls SILENT.
      
      Somewhat taken aback by the reaction, Roxanne scans the room
      to see every eye on her.
      
                          ROXANNE
                It's...um...It's good to be back.
                Thanks for everyone's cards and
                concerns. I really appreciated it -
                now I'm ready to climb back on the
                horse.
      
      No one is budging - their looks of pity are really starting
      to make her uncomfortable.
      
      The back office door suddenly opens and out comes FRANK
      BONIN, the gruff, middle-aged Producer of Channel 7 News.
      
      Noticing the silence, he looks up and sees the sad
      expressions on everybody's face.
      
                          FRANK
                Someone die or something?
      
      He suddenly notices Roxanne - both feet are placed firmly in
      his mouth.
      
                           FRANK
                    (cursing himself)
                Oh, Jesus.
      
                             ROXANNE
                It's okay.
      
      Frank quickly walks up to Roxanne and takes her gently by the
      arm.
      
                          FRANK
                Come on into my office, sweetie.
      
      INT. CHANNEL 7 NEWS BUILDING - FRANK'S OFFICE - CONTINUOUS
      
      He sits her down on his leather couch, then quickly turns
      toward his door.
      
                          FRANK
                Can we get this woman some water
                for God's sake?
                    (to Rebecca)
                I gave you two months off. What're
                you doing back? People are gonna
                think I'm a slave driver.
                                                              18.
      
      
      
                          ROXANNE
                Aren't you?
      
                          FRANK
                Yeah, but I don't want people to
                think it.
      
                          ROXANNE
                Frank, listen. I want to go back to
                work. I NEED to go back to work.
      
                          FRANK
                ...You're hysterical, aren't you?
      
      Frank sits down on the couch and blankets Roxanne with A WARM
      EMBRACE.
      
                          ROXANNE
                What're you doing?
      
                          FRANK
                Keeping you warm before you go into
                shock.
                    (toward the open door)
                DO I HAVE SLICE OPEN A CAMEL HUMP
                TO GET A GLASS OF WATER AROUND
                HERE?
      
      A SECRETARY quickly enters with a bottled water. She sets it
      on the table in front of them and leaves.
      
      Roxanne pulls herself out of Frank's grasp and stands up to
      face him.
      
                          ROXANNE
                It was a traumatic experience. Yes,
                everyone knows Uberman and me
                were...close. But what I really
                need - what would really make me
                better is getting back to work.
      
      There's a sudden awkward silence from Frank.
      
                          FRANK
                Well, that's going to be...
      
                          ROXANNE
                I thought you'd be happy to have me
                back.
                                            19.
      
      
      
                FRANK
      Oh, we are. Honey, nothing makes us
      happier than to have our girl back,
      but...
      
                 ROXANNE
      Yes?
      
                FRANK
      Things have sorta...changed.
      
                ROXANNE
      In three weeks?
      
                FRANK
      Listen, I'm not one who likes to
      open up wounds - especially ones
      that are just starting to scab, but
      you were sorta our go to girl for
      the exclusive on Uberman. And now
      that he's gone...I moved Brad into
      your anchor spot.
      
                ROXANNE
          (disgusted)
      Brad? Brad Helms? The man is an
      idiot.
      
                FRANK
      It's the suits. They think it's
      time to switch things up.
      
                ROXANNE
      Oh, because they can't use me to
      get the big story.
      
                FRANK
      C'mon, Roxie. Using is in the
      nature of what we do. They used
      you, you used Uberman. Everybody's
      happy.
      
                ROXANNE
          (defensive)
      I didn't use him.
      
                FRANK
      Oh, I didn't mean that. I know you
      two were in love or something. My
      bad.
      
                 ROXANNE
      We were.
                                                                 20.
      
      
      
                          FRANK
                And that's great.
      
                          ROXANNE
                Very in love.
      
      There's a hind of self-doubt in Roxanne's expression, as if
      she's failed to convince even herself of this.
      
                          ROXANNE
                Okay. So, where are they going to
                move me if Brad has my spot?
      
                          FRANK
                ...Human interest.
      
                          ROXANNE
                Bake sales and pet stories.
      
                          FRANK
                I told them I wouldn't be surprised
                if you just upped and quit. You
                busted your ass for that desk.
      
      Roxanne can hardly get it out - she's busy swallowing her
      pride
      
                          ROXANNE
                I'll take it.
      
      Frank looks up at her, not believing what he's hearing.
      
                          FRANK
                What?
      
      EXT. ABANDONED METRO CITY LIBRARY   - NIGHT
      
      Amongst the jungle of high rises, one small building stands
      out from the rest - A tiny, forgotten piece of 19th century
      Gothic architecture.
      
      LIGHTENING FLASHES, revealing TWO CONCRETE GARGOYLES holding
      a cracked plaque, reading: METRO CITY LIBRARY.
      
      INT. ABANDONED METRO CITY LIBRARY   - NIGHT
      
      A mixture of old and new. Dusty Victorian furniture and
      dilapidated bookshelves sit side by side with pristinely
      futuristic machinery.
      
      The building has been converted into Master Mind's new SECRET
      LAIR.
                                                              21.
      
      
      
      In the center of the main room is a three storey tall GLOWING
      BLUE ORB. At the base of it is a sign that reads "Reactor -
      Don't Touch."
      
      We PAN OVER to the READING ROOM where Master Mind is sitting
      on a couch watching TELEVISION.
      
                          REPORTER ON TELEVISION (O.S.)
                It's been nearly six weeks, and
                still no word on the whereabouts of
                billionaire playboy, and
                philanthropist, Wayne Scott. Tune
                in at 11:00 as we look into what
                has become Metro City's biggest
                mystery.
      
                          TELEVISION NARRATOR (O.S.)
                We now return to "The Hero of our
                Hearts: The Uberman story."
      
      Einstein and Plato come into the room holding a BAG OF LOOT.
      
                          EINSTEIN
                Just robbed the diamond exchange.
      
                          MASTER MIND
                    (feigning pleasure)
                Great, great. Put it on the pile.
      
      Einstein tosses it on a LARGE PILE of purloined valuables in
      the corner of the room.
      
                          EINSTEIN
                Anything else today?
      
                          MASTER MIND
                No.
      
      Master Mind turns his attention back to the screen. Plato
      sees that Master Mind is in a funk and tries to snap him out
      of it.
      
                          PLATO
                    (cheerfully)
                Sir, the new reactor is installed.
      
      Plato nods to the giant orb.
      
                          PLATO
                Do you want to throw the switch? I
                know how you love to start
                reactors.
                                                                 22.
      
      
      
                          MASTER MIND
                Maybe later.
      
      Einstein gives Master Mind a funny look then exchanges
      glances with Plato before leaving the two of them alone.
      
      Without turning away from the TV, Master Mind addresses
      Plato.
      
                          MASTER MIND (CONT'D)
                What is it, Plato?
      
                          PLATO
                    (nervously)
                Sir, I can't help but notice that
                you've been...a little down lately.
      
                          MASTER MIND
                When I want your opinion I'll beat
                it out of you.
      
                          PLATO
                Yes, sir, I know, but please
                forgive my impertinence. It's just
                that you seem to have lost your
                lust for our profession. You've
                stopped going on jobs and spend
                most of your time watching Uberman
                specials.
      
      Master Mind relaxes slightly and turns to face the window in
      a classically contemplative pose. After an overdramatic
      beat...
      
                          MASTER MIND
                I have defeated my greatest enemy.
                I have free reign over Metro City.
                I have more wealth than a thousand
                Sultans. I've achieved all I have
                worked for...so why am I so
                unhappy?
      
      He walks over to a PAINTED PORTRAIT that looks almost exactly
      like him, except slightly older, maybe meaner - MASTER MIND'S
      FATHER.
      
                          MASTER MIND
                I mean, my father, god rest his
                evil and tormented soul, raised me
                straight from the test tube to be a
                symbol of evil.
                          (MORE)
                                                              23.
                          MASTER MIND(cont'd)
                And, I have accomplished something
                he had only dreamed about - the
                destruction of Metro City's
                champion. I tell you, I've always
                lived with this unquenchable
                thirst. I thought it was to make
                him proud or to get absolute power.
                But now that I've pretty much
                accomplished both, I am at a loss.
      
                          PLATO
                ...I sort of have a theory about
                all that.
      
                          MASTER MIND
                    (snippy)
                Oh, really?
      
                          PLATO
                Well, for one thing, maybe Uberman
                was more important to you than you
                thought.
      
                          MASTER MIND
                He was a worthy rival. Sometimes I
                wonder, did he consider me his evil
                equal or was I just an annoying,
                little gnat to him? ...What's the
                second part?
      
                          PLATO
                I think you sort of have a thing
                for Roxanne Ritchi.
      
      Master Mind quickly takes his lackey by the throat.
      
                          MASTER MIND
                YOU WORM! HOW DARE YOU! WHERE WOULD
                YOU GET SUCH A NOTION?
      
                          PLATO
                Sir, your plans always involve Ms.
                Ritchi either being kidnapped or
                placed in danger. If that's not
                love, I don't know what is. It's
                the grown up equivalent of dipping
                her pigtails in the ink well. Don't
                you see? She's the one treasure
                that's always escaped you.
      
      From Master Mind's expression, we see Plato's words beginning
      to ring true.
                                                                 24.
      
      
      
      INT. RESTURAUNT - DAY
      
      Roxanne is having lunch with several girlfriends sitting
      around her, gabbing.
      
                          FRIEND #1
                I can't believe you came back so
                soon.
      
                          FRIEND #2
                Are you sure it's not TOO SOON,
                honey?
      
                          ROXANNE
                I just wanted to get back to work.
      
                          FRIEND #3
                What we need to do is get you back
                on the saddle...the love saddle.
      
      Friend 1 and 2 give 3 disapproving looks.
      
                          FRIEND #3
                It's been three weeks.
      
                          FRIEND #2
                She just lost the love of her life,
                Grace.
      
      A WAITER comes by with a tray of CAESAR SALADS and begins
      setting them out for the ladies.
      
                          ROXANNE
                I keep trying to tell people it
                wasn't really like that. Uberman
                and I - We were kinda having
                problems. We broke up.
      
      The waiter ALMOST DROPS HIS TRAY AT THIS. The women are too
      shocked by Roxanne's revelation to notice.
      
                          FRIEND #1
                You broke up with Uberman!
      
                          FRIEND #3
                You must have REALLY, REALLY high
                standards. I mean, you were dating
                a god. I mean, what's it take?
      
                          ROXANNE
                Maybe someone who's a little more
                aware of his faults. Someone a
                little more sensitive.
                                                                 25.
      
      
      
                          FRIEND #3
                Right. Someone who listens, sexy
                but attainable with cute little
                cheeks like a hamster and
                heartbreak in his eyes.
      
      She turns to Friend one and two to explain.
      
                          FRIEND #3
                She wants John Cusack.
      
                             FRIEND #2
                The actor?
      
                          FRIEND #3
                No, the famous pediatrist - Yes,
                the actor. Ever since we were
                teenagers, Roxanne's totally had
                the hots for him.
      
                          ROXANNE
                Well, until he miraculously comes
                walking into my life, I'm just
                going to take a little reflection
                time for myself.
      
      The waiter gets a confused look on his face then slips away
      as Roxanne and her friends continue to chat away.

      The waiter tosses his apron in a trash can, then rolls up his
      sleeve and presses A STRANGE LOOKING DEVICE STRAPPED TO HIS
      WRIST.
      
      His image gets staticy, like a TV station going out, then
      disappears - revealing the man's true form underneath: MASTER
      MIND!
      
                          MASTER MIND
                Who the hell is John Cusack?

      A local POLITICIAN addresses a group of REPORTERS on the

                Project, which I championed, will
                breath new life into the downtown
                area. New life means new jobs and
                new revenue.
      
                          ROXANNE
                Councilman, is it true that your
                brother-in-law's construction
                company won the contract for this
                project?
      
                          POLITICIAN
                Well...er...yes, but...look I'm not
                here to answer a lot of crazy
                questions...
      
      YOUNG MOTHER
      
      The young mother stops halfway down the block, reaches into
      the stroller and tries to comfort her now crying baby.
      
      Above her, a CRANE is maneuvering a pile of STEEL GIRDERS to
      an upper floor.
      
      Hal comes around the corner and heads in her direction.
      
      CRANE
      
      The crane GRINDS TO A HALT. The OPERATOR has a confused look
      on his face as he moves levers back and forth in an effort to
      fix the problem.
      
      Hal stops a few feet from the woman and stoops down to tie
      his shoe.
      
      CRANE
      
      The operator's hand slips off the lever, hitting a RED
      BUTTON. To his horror the crane DROPS ITS LOAD OF STEEL.
      
      HAL AND THE WOMAN
      
      The woman looks up to see the girders seconds from crushing
      her and her baby. She screams.
      
      Hal looks up and sees it as well. He starts to run out of the
      way and crashes into the woman and stroller.
      
      ACROSS THE STREET
                                                                 27.
      
      
      
      The reporters turns their cameras just in time to catch on
      film what appears to be Hal pushing the woman to safety just
      as the GIRDERS CRASH TO THE GROUND.
      
      HAL AND MOTHER
      
      Tears of joy in her eyes, the woman picks up her baby and
      kisses it.
      
      Hal struggles to catch his breath as the mother turns to him.
      
                          YOUNG MOTHER
                Thank you! Thank you for saving me
                and my baby!
      
      She hugs him with her free arm, weeping with joy.
      
                             HAL
                       (not knowing what she's
                        talking about)
                Huh?
      
      He's a little uncomfortable with the woman's public display
      of affection and the small child in-between their embrace.
      
                          HAL (CONT'D)
                There, there.
      
      Hal slowly eases out of the woman's grip.
      
                          HAL (CONT'D)
                Okay, we better...well, I hear
                these little guys smother easy.
      
      The reporters rush over and surround Hal and the mother.
      
                          ROXANNE
                What's it feel like to be a hero?
      
      Hal looks up at Roxanne. Instantly, he's captivated by her
      beauty.
      
                          HAL
                Well...I'm just a man doing what
                men do. You're Roxanne Ritchi,
                aren't you?
      
      They're suddenly interrupted when another reporter pushes his
      way in between them.
      
                          REPORTER
                Were you scared?
                                                              28.
      
      
      
                             HAL
                   Scared? Who had time?
      
      The reporters eat this up.

      John Cusack stands in the rain looking up at a window of a
      two story house. He holds up a BOOMBOX and "In Your Eyes" by
      Peter Gabriel begins to play.
      
      From the couch, Master Mind and his minions watch.
      
                             MASTER MIND
                   John Cusack, huh? So all I have to
                   do is have a cute puppy dog stare,
                   be willing to make a fool of myself
                   and - Oh, REMOVE BOTH MY BALLS.
      
      He turns to see Da Vinci watching the movie and wiping a tear
      from his cheek.
      
                             MASTER MIND
                   Please, get a hold of yourself.
      
      INT. BOOKSTORE - NIGHT
      
      Roxanne is carrying a large paper coffee cup in her hands as
      she peruses the isles. She sets it down on a shelf to pull a
      book out and ends up KNOCKING THE DRINK OVER.
      
                             ROXANNE
                   Shit.
      
      She goes to pick it up when someone bends down and picks it
      up for her.
      
      Looking up to thank him, Roxanne is suddenly stunned
      speechless - It's popular and critically acclaimed actor JOHN
      CUSACK, or rather Master Mind disguised as him.
      
                             "JOHN CUSACK"
                   Oh the humanity - it was a Venti.
      
                             ROXANNE
                       (stunned)
                   You're...you're.
      
                             "JOHN CUSACK"
                   Yes, it's me. John Cusack...the
                   actor.
                                                               29.
      
      
      
      He notices the book she's reading.
      
                          "JOHN CUSACK"
                Hey, is that Shelly? Wait, I think
                remember something from that one -
                Let's see: "My head is screaming `I
                want you and need you' - my heart
                it keeps reaching to see you and
                feel you - yet in the end, I'm
                alone once again." Wow, I scare
                even myself. I'm sorry. I'm just
                really into poetry. Probably
                because I'm so sensitive and always
                going to great lengths to express
                myself. But enough about me. Can I
                fill you up?
      
                          ROXANNE
                    (captivated)
                ...Yes.
                    (catching herself)
                I mean, excuse me?
      
                          "JOHN CUSACK"
                Can I fill you up? Your coffee.
      
                          ROXANNE
                Right.
      
      INT. BOOKSTORE CAFE' - LATER
      
      Roxanne talks as John Cusack listens to her every word
      intently.
      
                          ROXANNE
                I did have a boyfriend - until
                fairly recently.
      
      She suddenly begins to feel the stares around her as passers-
      by being to notice who she's with.
      
                          ROXANNE
                I'm sorry - this is so surreal!
      
                          "JOHN CUSACK"
                Yeah, they charge way too much at
                these places - Now back to your
                boyfriend. I'm interested and
                compassionate. I want to know about
                you.
                                                              30.
      
      
      
                          ROXANNE
                Things were complicated. He was a
                man married to his work. There
                was...there was a lot of
                competition in his line of
                business. I'm sure you know what
                that's like.
      
                          "JOHN CUSACK"
                Sure. In my business, one thing I
                have is RIVALS. For example, mine
                is...uh...Lou Ferr...igno.
      
                          ROXANNE
                ...The body-builder who used to
                play The Hulk on TV?
      
                          "JOHN CUSACK"
                Did he? Well, we're always up for
                the same roles. Did your boyfriend
                have someone like that? A
                particular rival that was always
                getting his goat - so to speak?
      
                          ROXANNE
                Well...one rival in particular
                seemed to get more of his attention
                than I ever did. But enough about
                my problems.
      
                          "JOHN CUSACK"
                NO, TELL ME MORE!!!
      
      Suddenly realizing his outburst, he begins COUGHING to mask
      it.
      
                          "JOHN CUSACK" (CONT'D)
                I'm sorry. I got a whooping cough.
                Had it ever since Serendipity. I
                WONDER WHERE OUR REFILLS ARE!!!
                (fakes cough) See, there it goes
                again. Please, go on.
      
                          ROXANNE
                Right, well, he seemed to need him
                more than he needed me.
      
                          "JOHN CUSACK"
                How do you mean?
                                                               31.
      
      
      
                          ROXANNE
                It was conflict he thrived on. He
                always said he wouldn't know what
                to do with himself if Master - I
                mean, this guy were gone. It was
                like he needed it, like oxygen.
      
      The answer to his mental funk hits him like a bolt of
      lightening. He turns away from her as if for private time.
      
                          "JOHN CUSACK"
                    (almost to himself)
                I think I finally understand...The
                only logical answer is to recreate
                that rivalry - or if that's
                impossible, create one of equal
                structure. That's it!
      
                          ROXANNE
                What?
      
      John Cusack snaps out of his dream-like haze realizing she's
      heard every word.
      
                          "JOHN CUSACK"
                Oh, sorry, sorry. Just rehearsing
                for a part...where I play a man who
                talks to himself at inappropriate
                times.
      
      In a sudden rush, he rises out of his chair.
      
                          "JOHN CUSACK"
                I have to go right now, but I'd
                really like to see you again - if
                that's alright.
      
      Roxanne looks up at him - She can't help but laugh at the
      craziness of the situation.
      
                          ROXANNE
                I'd love that.

                It's plain and simple.
                Extraordinary minds need
                extraordinary stimulation. Without
                that stimulus they wither and die.
                Therefore, there is only one
                logical conclusion: I must create a
                new superhero.

      Dressed in a lab coat, Master Mind enters through a SLIDING
      GLASS DOOR rubbing his hands excitedly.
      
                          MASTER MIND
                Prepare the subject.
      
      He glances down into a large HOLE in the floor to see a naked
      thirty year old man, SEVERS, shivering. Above the hole, a
      huge vat dangles precariously.
      
      Master Mind steps behind a glass partition next to Plato and
      Einstein.
      
                          MASTER MIND (CONT'D)
                Plato, pour the toxic waste.
      
      Plato throws a switch causing the vat to tip hundreds of
      gallons of green and brown goo into the hole.
      
                            MASTER MIND (CONT'D)
                Drainage.
      
      The slime is sucked out through the floor, leaving a goo-
      soaked Severs.
                                                                33.
      
      
      
      Master Mind looks into the pit.
      
                          MASTER MIND (CONT'D)
                Well, Severs?
      
                          SEVERS
                I feel fine. Just a little sticky,
                but aside from that everything's
                completely -
      
      BOOM - Severs explodes. A hail of blood and tissue covers
      Master Mind and his men. For a good ten seconds nobody moves
      an inch. Finally...
      
                             MASTER MIND
                Okay then.
      
      INT. ABANDONED METRO CITY LIBRARY    - LABORATORY - DAY
      
      Through a glass WATER TANK we see a man breathing normally.
      
                          MASTER MIND
                And this one?
      
                          PLATO
                We attached gills to him. He can
                breath under water.
      
                          MASTER MIND
                Ah. Does he have extraordinary
                strength?
      
                             PLATO
                Well...no.
      
                          MASTER MIND
                Can he fly?
      
                             PLATO
                No.
      
                          MASTER MIND
                Resilient to weapons fire?
      
                             PLATO
                No.
      
                          MASTER MIND
                He just breathes under water, then.
      
                             PLATO
                Ah...yeah.
                                                               34.
      
      
      
      Master Mind rolls his eyes and walks away.
      
      INT. ABANDONED METRO CITY LIBRARY   - LABORATORY - DAY
      
      The next guinea-pig, STENWICK, is standing in a sealed glass
      tube not much wider than himself.
      
                          MASTER MIND
                Plato, the radioactive spider,
                please.
      
      Plato throws the switch DROPPING A SINGLE SPIDER onto
      Stenwick's arm.
      
      Stenwick looks and winces as it bites him.
      
                          STENWICK
                Ow!
      
      He brushes the spider off.
      
                          MASTER MIND
                Anything, Stenwick?
      
                          STENWICK
                    (shaken)
                No. Ah...sir, I didn't know this
                was about spiders. I have a pretty
                severe case of arachnophobia.
      
      Master Mind thinks for a moment, then turns to Plato.
      
                          MASTER MIND
                We're gonna need more venom.
      
      Plato throws another switch, this time DUMPING THOUSANDS OF
      SPIDERS on poor Stenwick. His SCREAMS begin to fade as he's
      engulfed with swarms of crawling arachnids.
      
                          MASTER MIND (CONT'D)
                How `bout now, Stenwick?
                ....Stenwick?
      
      INT. ABANDONED METRO CITY LIBRARY   - OFFICE - DAY
      
      Master Mind is pacing back and forth. The muted TV plays in
      the background.
      
                           MASTER MIND
                This has proven to be a challenge.
                I just don't know what I want. What
                do I want?
                                                                35.
      
      
      
      He stares at Einstein, Da Vinci and Plato, but they offer no
      advice.
      
                          MASTER MIND (CONT'D)
                I want a man of moral fiber with a
                strong sense of right and wrong.
                Someone who doesn't seek power -
                instead, they must have it thrust
                upon them and find, within
                themselves, the courage to rise to
                the occasion.
      
      Einstein lets out a short laugh, getting everyone's
      attention.
      
                          EINSTEIN
                Yeah, well, it sounds like what you
                want is Uberman.
      
      Master Mind snaps the fingers of his non-metal hand.
      
                          MASTER MIND
                That's it! Why make a copy when the
                real thing will do?
      
      The lackeys look at each other, they can't believe what
      they're hearing.
      
                          EINSTEIN
                I was just kidding, sir. In case
                you forgot, you actually burned
                Uberman alive.
      
                          MASTER MIND
                Then we'll make a new one. Plato,
                bring me the box!
      
      MINUTES LATER
      
      Master Mind and the lackeys stand in a circle around a small
      table.
      
      Plato places a STAINLESS STEEL CHEST in the tables center.
      
      As Master Mind opens it, he's immediately doused in WHITE
      GLOW emanating from inside.
      
                          MASTER MIND
                Behold - Uberessence. The very
                thing that gave Uberman his
                superhuman powers.
                                                              36.
      
      
      
                          EINSTEIN
                Where the hell did you get that?
      
                          MASTER MIND
                Oh, I shot him with a power sucking
                gun and had this idea to use this
                to clone a whole army of evil
                Ubermen. I'm not sure why I never
                got around to following up with
                that.
      
                          PLATO
                I believe he defeated you before
                you could, master.
      
                          MASTER MIND
                ...Right. Man, he was good!
      
                          DA VINCI
                You want another volunteer, sir?
      
                          MASTER MIND
                Not another volunteer driven by the
                need for personal gain. Somebody
                else, somebody pure.
      
      Master Mind turns to see an INTERVIEW WITH HAL playing on the
      muted television. Underneath his face is a blue caption with
      white lettering that reads: "Hal Stewart - Metro City's
      Newest Hero?"
      
                          NEWS REPORTER
                ...who risked his own life to save
                that of a young mother and her
                child.
      
                          HAL
                Please, please, you're embarrassing
                me. I saw someone in need and I
                helped them. What more can we ask
                of ourselves. I ask you, what more?
      
      A smile creeps across the evil one's face.
      
                          MASTER MIND (CONT'D)
                Somebody like him!
      
      EXT. CITY STREET - DAY
      
      Plato is sitting in the van, staring into a pair of
      binoculars as he speaks on a cellphone.
                                                              37.
      
      
      
                          PLATO
                Yeah, sir. This guy is a real piece
                of work. He used to teach bowling
                at Kingpin's.
      
      INT. MASTER MIND'S HIDEOUT - DAY
      
      Master Mind is sitting with his feet up on a computer console
      as he speaks to Plato.
      
                          MASTER MIND
                    (into phone)
                A modest profession to brilliantly
                hide his true heroic nature. I love
                it.
      
      EXT. CITY STREET - DAY
      
                          PLATO
                Then you are absolutely going to
                love this -
      
      We follow Plato's line of sight across the street where we
      see HAL PLAYING WITH A LARGE GROUP OF BLIND CHILDREN.
      
                          PLATO
                - He volunteers at a school for the
                blind.
      
      INT. MASTER MIND'S HIDEOUT - DAY
      
      Intrigued, he suddenly sits up in his chair.
      
                          MASTER MIND
                He volunteers. He doesn't ask for
                any reward for his deeds. The fates
                are shining down on me. This Mr.
                Stewart is truly an unselfish soul.
      
      EXT. BLIND SCHOOL - DAY
      
      From a distance, Hal seems to be consoling an upset child
      who's sitting on a rock. But up close...
      
                          HAL
                You greedy little bastard. I
                already gave you a twenty.
      
                          BLIND KID
                Hey, you want me to play along?
                Then pay up, bitch!
                                                              38.
      
      
      
                          HAL
                Fine, but you better be convincing.
      
      He gives the kid a bill out of his wallet and looks over his
      shoulder to see a HOT TEACHER walking toward them.
      
                          HAL
                Here she comes, go to work.
      
      Like a miniature Brando, the blind kid buries his face in his
      hands and begins to cry.
      
                          BLIND KID
                    (weeping)
                Why can't I see! Why God?
      
      Hal puts a warm consoling hand on the weeping boy's shoulder.
      
                          HAL
                Hey, Peter. C'mon champ, let me
                look at you.
      
      The Hot Teacher stops and curiously watches from a distance.
      
      The boy looks up at Hal, tears running down his dark
      sunglasses - he should get an Oscar.
      
                          HAL
                You know, in life we're all given
                no more than we can bear. This
                happened to you maybe because you
                were meant to rise above it - Maybe
                to be an inspiration to the other
                little Peteys out there.
      
                          BLIND KID
                You really think so, Hal?
      
                          HAL
                Hey, does it LOOK like I'm lying?
                Now c'mon, go feel your way to
                class before you get your little
                butt suspended.
      
      The boy stands up and is about to take off.
      
                          HAL
                Petey, wait a minute.
      
      Hal uses his shirt sleeve to wipe the tears away from the
      boy's face before sending him on his way.
                                                               39.
      
      
      
      The Hot Teacher grabs her chest. Her heart is about to
      absolutely melt.
      
                          HAL
                Don't run into anything!
      
      EXT. STREET - CONTINUOUS
      
      Plato lowers his binoculars. From his perspective, Hal should
      be next in line for popehood.
      
                          PLATO
                I think I've seen enough, sir. This
                is your guy.
      
                          MASTER MIND (O.S.)
                    (over radio)
                Then return to base. We have much
                work to do.
      
      Plato starts up the van and pulls away.
      
      INT. BAR - DAY
      
      It's a busy night. A couple of trucker types are shooting
      pool as the bartender slings drinks.
      
      Hal is nursing a beer at the bar when he suddenly notices a
      very ATTRACTIVE WOMAN sitting next to him.
      
      As he goes to straighten his stool-posture, Hal suddenly
      catches himself on the bar's TELEVISION - it's a story about
      how he saved the woman and her baby at the construction site.
      
      He turns back to the Attractive Woman next to him, then back
      to the TV. A plan of attack is forming.
      
                          HAL
                    (obviously playing it up
                     for the woman's benefit)
                Oh, there it is again. This is
                really getting embarrassing now.
      
      The woman looks up at the screen and gives Hal a double-take.
      
                          ATTRACTIVE   WOMAN
                Oh my God! It's you!   You're the man
                who saved that woman   and her baby
                the other day! It is   you, isn't it?
      
      TRUCKER #1, getting a drink at the bar next to them,
      OVERHEARS.
                                                               40.
      
      
      
      Hal rolls his eyes and puts his hands up in the air.
      
                          HAL
                    (to Attractive Woman)
                Oh, crap. You got me.
      
      TRUCKER#1 taps Hal on the shoulder.
      
                          TRUCKER#1
                Let me tell you something. That was
                just about the bravest damn thing
                I've ever witnessed. (he turns to
                the rest of the bar) Hey,
                everybody! This guy's the hero from
                TV!
      
      The bar ERUPTS IN CHEERS.
      
      MOMENTS LATER
      
      Hal is riding on the shoulders of TRUCKER#2 and TRUCKER#3 as
      `I'm Holding Out For A Hero' plays on the jukebox.
      
      TRUCKER#1 suddenly puts his hands in the air. The room
      quickly goes silent.
      
                          TRUCKER#1
                I want to give you something.
      
      He reaches into his pocket and takes out a medal. He holds it
      up in the air for everyone to see.
      
                          TRUCKER#1 (CONT'D)
                Lost my whole platoon. They were a
                lot a good boys, a lot of good
                boys. That was just the way things
                were in "The Grenada." I'd rather a
                real hero have this.
      
      Trucker#1 gives the medal to a speechless Hal.
      
                          ATTRACTIVE WOMAN
                Hey, you're on TV again.
      
      The crowd looks up at the Television.
      
      TELEVISION - CONTINUOUS
      
      The anchor man, BRAD HELMS (early 40's, amazing mustache),
      suddenly has a memo passed to him.
                                                                 41.
      
      
      
                          BRAD HELMS
                This just in. Upon a second look at
                that tape from this morning, which
                we'll now replay for you, it
                appears it was not the heroic act
                it first seemed to be.
      
      The tape shows Hal running in slow motion.
      
                          BRAD HELMS (O.S.) (CONT'D)
                With the tape slowed down you can
                actually see the man push the woman
                and her child out of the way in an
                effort to save his own life.
      
      The tape shows Hal, in a clear act of self-preservation,
      pushing the woman and child out of the way.
      
                                                CUT BACK TO:
      
      INT. BAR - CONTINUOUS
      
      In unison, everyone turns their heads back to Hal.
      
                          HAL
                I guess that looks kinda bad.
      
      Trucker#1 snatches his medal back.
      
      EXT. NEARBY ROOF - NIGHT
      
      Master Mind, Da Vinci and Plato look down, spotting Hal
      cutting through a dark alley.
      
                          DA VINCI
                There he is, boss.
      
      Da Vinci hands Master Mind a fantastic looking silver rifle.
      
                          MASTER MIND
                Now, we're sure this won't kill
                him?
      
                          PLATO
                Yes, sir. He'll just feel a slight
                electrical shock.
      
                          MASTER MIND
                Good.
      
      Master Mind raises the rifle and aims it at Hal.
                                                                42.
      
      
      
      EXT. ALLEY - NIGHT
      
      Hal wipes the blood from his nose with his shirtsleeve.
      
      A LIGHTENING BOLT suddenly zaps Hal in the back. His teeth
      spark and arc electrons as his entire body shakes and
      shudders violently. He finally collapses, knocking over a row
      of garbage cans.
      
      EXT. NEARBY ROOF - NIGHT
      
      An angry Master Mind slaps Plato.
      
                          MASTER MIND
                Slight electrical shock?
      
      EXT. ALLEY - NIGHT
      
      Hal lies flat on his back, his jacket smoldering.
      
      Dazed, he slowly rises to his feet and looks up at the sky.
      
                          HAL
                God, I hate the weather in this
                city.
      
      Hal walks off into the night as he attempts to slap the
      emitting smoke from his jacket.
      
      EXT. NEARBY ROOF - NIGHT
      
      Master Mind turns to Da Vinci.
      
                          MASTER MIND
                Follow him.
      
      INT. HAL'S APARTMENT - NIGHT
      
      It's a dirty, small studio. Laundry lies everywhere, dishes
      are piled in the sink and the litter box looks like a
      minefield.
      
      Hal comes staggering in. Through his POV we see the lights
      wobble and streak like a hallucination.
      
      He shakes his head trying to clear thing up, but it looks
      worse.
      
      Hal makes his way to the kitchen table and plops down on a
      chair. The room begins to swim.
      
      His CAT jumps on the table and sits down in front of him.
                                                                 43.
      
      
      
      From Hal's POV the cat's face looks like we're seeing it
      through a kaleidoscope. Hal seems fascinated by it.
      
                           CAT
                 You don't look so good, man.
      
                           HAL
                 I don't feel good. I was struck by
                 freaking lightening.
      
      Suddenly Hal realizes his cat's talking to him.
      
                           HAL (CONT'D)
                 AAAAAAHHHHH! You can talk?
      
                           CAT
                 No, you're just hallucinating. By
                 the way, we're out of orange juice.
      
                           HAL
                 AAAAAAHHHHH!
      
      Hal jumps up, trips over a cardboard box and knocks himself
      out on the coffee table.
      
      INT. HAL'S APARTMENT - MORNING
      
      Hal lies in the same position we left him last night.
      
      He sits up and grabs his head. He looks like he has the worst
      hangover in the world.
      
      Finally, he remembers last night. He looks around, but not
      really sure what he's looking for.
      
                           HAL
                 Man...
      
      Shaking his head, he walks to the kitchen and opens the
      refrigerator.
      
      He pulls out an orange juice container and puts it to his
      mouth. It's empty.
      
      As if suddenly remembering something he looks from the carton
      to the cat, who is busy cleaning himself.
      
      He shakes the thought from his mind.
      
      BATHROOM
      
      Hal lifts the seat and unbuckles his pants.
                                                              44.
      
      
      
      HAL'S FACE
      
      He stares at the ceiling with half closed eyes. The
      inevitable sound of urine hitting water starts. A content
      look washes over his face.
      
      There is a distinct sound of porcelain CRACKING and
      SPLINTERING.
      
      The sound intensifies. Hal looks down to see his URINE STREAM
      SMASHING THE TOILET.
      
                              HAL (CONT'D)
                   Oh, God!
      
      He whips his stream away only to cut a LONG RIP IN THE WALL.
      
                              HAL (CONT'D)
                   Oh, God!
      
      He freaks out and begins to lose control of his flow as it
      destroys everything he accidently aims at; the bathroom
      mirror, a bottle of cheap cologne, the bathroom window.
      
                              HAL (CONT'D)
                   Oh, God!
      
      He aims back for the toilet, which is pretty much rubble now,
      to see the floor give way.
      
      Finally, the pee stops and he glances down the hole.
      
      He sees his downstairs NEIGHBOR sitting at his breakfast
      table. He has a fork halfway to his mouth as he stares at the
      smashed toilet on his pancakes.
      
      EXT. STREET - DAY
      
      Hal turns the corner to see his bus pulling away from the
      stop.
      
                              HAL
                   Wait!
      
      He starts running after it.
      
      ZOOM - HE TAKES OFF LIKE LIGHTENING.
      
                             HAL (CONT'D)
                   Whoa, whoa, whoa!
      
      Unable to stop, he SLAMS INTO THE BACK OF THE BUS and falls
      back to the ground.
                                                                 45.
      
      
      
      As the bus continues on he sees an INDENTATION of his torso
      right below the rear window.
      
      Stunned, to say the least, he rises to his feet.
      
                          HAL (CONT'D)
                Something's not right here.
      
      He slaps himself in the face as hard as he can.
      
                          HAL (CONT'D)
                Wake up! Wake up, Hal!
      
      HONK!
      
      Hal spins around to see a car barreling toward him.
      
      He goes to jump out of the way - ZOOM - he FLIES TWO STORIES
      UP, nails a building and comes crashing back down to the
      sidewalk.
      
      Hal sits up, disheveled and scared.
      
                          HAL (CONT'D)
                Okay, okay. Let's get it together,
                man.
      
      He closes his eyes in an attempt to will back his sanity.
      
                          HAL (CONT'D)
                This is just some sort
                of...episode. It will pass, it will
                pass.
      
      He opens his eyes and looks down the street. A BEAUTIFUL
      NAKED WOMAN is coming toward him.
      
                          HAL (CONT'D)
                Well, not too fast I hope.
      
      As she passes him and turns the corner out of his view he
      catches ANOTHER NAKED WOMAN - an old disgusting one.
      
                          HAL (CONT'D)
                Yes, fast, fast!
      
      He turns away from her in horror only to see AN ENTIRE BLOCK
      OF NAKED PEOPLE going about their business.
      
      He rubs his eyes and looks down the street again. Everyone
      has returned to a clothed state.
                                                              46.
      
      
      
      He relaxes a little until he looks down and notices that he's
      floating a foot off the ground.
      
                          HAL (CONT'D)
                I think I need to go home.
      
      INT. HAL'S APARTMENT - DAY
      
      Hal's front door CREAKS as it slowly opens, revealing Master
      Mind.
      
      He walks over to the bathroom and smiles to himself as he
      notices the giant hole in the floor.
      
                          MASTER MIND
                Welcome to your second birth, Hal
                Stewart.
      
      Master Mind continues to survey the room. He stops to look
      over a "KARATE KID" POSTER on Hal's living room wall.
      
      He focuses on the majestic image of Pat Morita teaching a
      young Ralph Macchio to kick.
      
                          MASTER MIND (CONT'D)
                Instruction is very important in
                the formative years. Every hero
                needs a mentor, a father figure to
                look up to.
      
      He presses his special watch, causing his body to MORPH INTO
      THE SPITTING-IMAGE OF PAT MORITA.
      
                           "PAT MORITA"
                Perfect.
      
      INT. HAL'S APARTMENT - DAY
      
      Hal enters, grabs a bottle of vodka from atop of the fridge
      and takes a long pull from it.
      
                          VOICE (O.S.)
                A man will usually find that if he
                drinks from a bottle, eventually,
                the bottle drinks from him.
      
      Hal does a SPIT TAKE. In the corner a darkened figure stands.
      
                          HAL
                Who are you!?
                                                                47.
      
      
      
                          VOICE
                I am the guide on your journey.
                Fate has chosen you to be it's
                champion.
      
      Pat Morita steps out from the shadows.
      
      Hal passes out again.
      
      LATER
      
      We are close on Hal's face as his eyes flutter open. He
      appears to be lying on the couch.
      
      He hunches up on his elbows, looks around, but everything is
      as it seems.
      
      He lays his head back down.
      
                          HAL
                Thank God. It was a dream. Man, I
                must be losing it.
      
      A voice sounds right next to his ear.
      
                          "PAT MORITA" (O.S.)
                You know you're out of orange
                juice?
      
      Hal leaps up to find he's been resting his head on Pat's lap.
      
                          HAL
                Jesus! This isn't happening, this
                isn't happening.
      
      Hal backs away and trips over a box.
      
                          "PAT MORITA"
                Calm. All things must be filtered
                through calmness.
      
                           HAL
                Bullshit! Sometimes it's best to
                freak out.
      
                          "PAT MORITA"
                I think we must work on your
                attitude first.
      
                          HAL
                Look I'm gonna call the cops in
                about two seconds if you don't get
                out of here.
                                                              48.
      
      
      
      Pat rises and walks to Hal. He's so calm it makes Hal calm.
      
                          "PAT MORITA"
                Are you calm now?
      
                          HAL
                Yeah, I'm okay.
      
      Pat slaps him across the face hard.
      
                          "PAT MORITA"
                Good, because we've got a lot of
                work to do.
      
      Hal grabs his jaw.
      
                          HAL
                What the hell was that for?
      
                          "PAT MORITA"
                Rule number one: expect the
                unexpected.
      
                           HAL
                Can you just tell me what this is
                all about?
      
                          "PAT MORITA"
                The heavens are not in the habit of
                bestowing a gift such as this to
                just anyone. You are being rewarded
                for being a man of great moral
                fortitude with an unwavering belief
                in humanity.
      
                          HAL
                That's me alright.
      
                          "PAT MORITA"
                I am to train you so you may
                fulfill your destiny to defeat the
                great menace to Metro City: Master
                Mind.
      
      Pat gets up and walks toward the door.
      
                           "PAT MORITA" (CONT'D)
                Come.
      
                          HAL
                We're are we going?
                                                              49.
      
      
      
                             "PAT MORITA"
                To train.
      
      EXT. PAT'S CAR - DAY
      
      Pat is sitting in the driver's seat. The car is bumping up
      and down.
      
                          "PAT MORITA"
                Strength is just as much in the
                mind as it is the muscle. Remember,
                both need to be exercised.
      
      We PULL BACK to see Hal lifting the car up over his head.
      He's hardly straining.
      
                          HAL
                I'M LIFTING A FREAKING CAR!!!
      
      Pat leans on the HORN.
      
                          "PAT MORITA"
                Hey, Corky? You listening?
      
      Two highly attractive female joggers run by. They're clearly
      impressed with Hal's show of strength. He smiles and mouths a
      "hello."
      
                          HAL
                Yeah, work both muscles.
      
      EXT. DESERT - DAY
      
      Pat cocks back the chamber of a .357 MAGNUM. He holds it up
      and carefully takes aim...at Hal's chest.
      
                             "PAT MORITA"
                Trust me.
      
                          HAL
                What are you doing!?
      
                          "PAT MORITA"
                An invulnerability test. Something
                wrong?
      
                          HAL
                Uh...yeah. I would prefer not to
                get shot. Do not fire that thing!
      
      Frustrated, Pat lowers the gun.
                                                               50.
      
      
      
                          "PAT MORITA"
                You're bulletproof.
      
                          HAL
                Okay, do you know that for sure?
      
      Pat quickly aims and fires.
      
      Hal lets out a high pitched scream as the bullet ricochets
      off his chest.
      
                            "PAT MORITA"
                I do now.
      
      Hal looks down at his chest, not so much as a scratch.
      
                            HAL
                You suck.
      
      EXT. SKY - DAY
      
      Hal is in the air flying in a sitting position. He's weaving
      back and forth.
      
                          HAL
                Ice Man, I got a bogie on my tail.
                Two Russian Migs coming in hard and
                fast.
      
                            "PAT MORITA"
                Hey!
      
                            HAL
                What?
      
      Hal looks down to see Pat Morita yelling at him from the roof
      of a building down below.
      
                          "PAT MORITA"
                What did I tell you? Stomach down,
                hands up.
      
      Hal sighs and assumes the proper superhero in-flight
      position.
      
                          HAL
                God, I feel so gay.
      
      Pat's CELL PHONE begins to RING. He answers it.
      
                          "PAT MORITA"
                    (in Master Mind voice)
                What is it?
                                                              51.
      
      
      
                          ROXANNE (V.O.)
                John?
      
      Pat panics. He looks up to make sure no one is in earshot.
      
      He sees Hal now doing somersaults in the air.
      
                          HAL
                YEEEE HAWWWW!
      
      Pat turns his attention back to the phone, talking in his
      John Cusack voice.
      
                          "PAT MORITA"
                    (in Cusack voice)
                Yes, it's John Cusack.
      
                           ROXANNE (V.O.)
                Hi, it's Roxanne. Listen, I...I
                really enjoyed talking with you the
                other day.
      
                          "PAT MORITA"
                ...As did I.
      
                          ROXANNE (V.O.)
                Great. God, I feel really silly,
                and if you have a lot going on I
                totally understand. But, I was
                wondering if you maybe wanted to
                have lunch.
      
      He can't believe what he's hearing.
      
                          "PAT MORITA"
                    (excited)
                I'd love to!
      
      He quickly recovers his composure.
      
                          "PAT MORITA" (CONT'D)
                I mean, I AM a little hungry.
      
                          ROXANNE (V.O.)
                Great. How does the park sound,
                around noon-ish?
      
                          "PAT MORITA"
                Sure!
      
                          ROXANNE (V.O.)
                Great, see you then.
                                                              52.
      
      
      
      Pat hangs up the phone and returns it to his pocket as Hal
      lands behind him.
      
                          HAL
                WHOOOOA! Man, that is so cool. It's
                like fly - Oh my God, I almost said
                it was like flying.
      
                          "PAT MORITA"
                For the rest of the day I want you
                to continue to practice your flying
                posture.
      
                          HAL
                Why, where're ya going?
      
                          "PAT MORITA"
                ...To do something...mysterious
                ...and Asian.
      
                          HAL
                Say no more, bro. I'll just keep at
                it, then.
      
      EXT. PARK - DAY
      
      John Cusack and Roxanne eat WRAPPED SANDWICHES while walking
      through Metro City Park.
      
                          ROXANNE
                How's your sandwich?
      
                          "JOHN CUSACK"
                It's quite delicious.
      
                          ROXANNE
                Hope you don't think I'm too
                forward. Some men are intimidated
                when a woman asks them out. I just
                find you really easy to talk to.
      
                             "JOHN CUSACK"
                And I you.
      
                          ROXANNE
                You know, you're not at all like
                you are in the movies.
      
                             "JOHN CUSACK"
                I'm not?
                                                              53.
      
      
      
                          ROXANNE
                Yeah. I don't know - You have this
                strange, refined way of speaking.
      
                          "JOHN CUSACK"
                I do? That is most interesting.
      
                           ROXANNE
                Anyway, when we were talking the
                other day I just felt, even though
                we only talked for a couple of
                hours, that we've known each other
                for years.
      
                          "JOHN CUSACK"
                I know just what you mean.
      
      Roxanne bites into her sandwich.
      
                          ROXANNE
                You know what? This sandwich is
                disgusting.
      
      She tosses it in a nearby garbage can.
      
                           ROXANNE (CONT'D)
                Of course I already ate half of it.
                I wonder what that says about my
                character?
      
                          "JOHN CUSACK"
                It means you don't give up on a
                sandwich. You see that it has
                potential, and you give it every
                chance to be all it can be.
      
      Roxanne smiles at his analogy.
      
                          ROXANNE
                Thanks, but knowing me, I was
                probably projecting my expectations
                of what a lunch should be on the
                sandwich. It might have been okay
                at first, but I just made it
                bitter.
      
      John Cusack notices Roxanne's smile starting to fade.
      
                          "JOHN CUSACK"
                Is that what happened with your
                last sandwich - I mean, boyfriend?
                                                              54.
      
      
      
                          ROXANNE
                When I look back, I probably
                shouldn't of expected so much from
                him. He was already a giving
                person. You know, one of those go
                out and save the world types.
      
                          "JOHN CUSACK"
                I've run into a few.
      
                          ROXANNE
                I was selfish, I guess. I didn't
                want to share him with anybody
                else.
      
                          "JOHN CUSACK"
                It sounds like he was a special
                man.
      
                          ROXANNE
                They broke the mold.
      
      John Cusack arches his eyebrow in a very familiar manner.
      
                          "JOHN CUSACK"
                Perhaps not.
      
      INT. ABANDONED WAREHOUSE - DAY
      
      Hal walks up to Pat Morita sporting a Lone Ranger-type mask
      and wearing a purple and red superhero costume. It's not
      unlike Uberman's except for a giant "T" on his chest. (From
      here on, Hal is referred to as TITAN)
      
                          TITAN
                What's the "T" stand for?
      
                          "PAT MORITA"
                Titan.
      
                          TITAN
                What's that supposed to mean?
      
                          "PAT MORITA"
                It's from Roman mythology. Zeus's
                father...oh, just go with it. You
                look perfect.
      
                          TITAN
                I don't think this mask is big
                enough. Are you sure no one is
                gonna recognize me?
                                                               55.
      
      
      
                          "PAT MORITA"
                It's fine, just don't slouch. It's
                all in the posture.
      
      He grabs Titan's shoulders like a proud papa.
      
                          "PAT MORITA" (CONT'D)
                It is time.
      
      INT. BANK - DAY
      
      There is a long line of people snaked around the velvet
      ropes. They're all waiting for their chance at the one open
      teller window.
      
      Four men wearing BEATLES MASKS(JOHN,PAUL,GEORGE,AND RINGO)and
      CARRYING SHOTGUNS enter the bank.
      
      John fires a shot in the air, sending everyone into an
      immediate panic.
      
                          JOHN
                Alright folks, this is a robbery.
                Nobody moves - yadda, yadda,
                yadda...
      
      Ringo jumps over the teller wall and starts stuffing bills
      into a bag.
      
      As John and Paul cover the crowd, George goes to the corner
      office and puts a gun to the BANK MANAGER'S head.
      
                          GEORGE
                The safe. Let's go.
      
                          BANK MANAGER
                Okay, just don't hurt anyone.
      
                          GEORGE
                Yeah, yeah, yeah.
      
      George leads him out by the collar.
      
      CRASH - Titan smashes through the window and lands in a bold
      superhero stance with hands on hips.
      
                          TITAN
                Well, boys, there's no need for all
                this just to get the free toaster.
      
      Paul cocks his gun.
                                                                 56.
      
      
      
                          PAUL
                What are you suppose to be?
      
      We move in for a nice dramatic close up.
      
                            TITAN
                Justice.
      
                          GEORGE
                Well, justice, suck on this...
      
      George, John and Paul open fire on Titan.
      
      He just stands there and yawns as the bullets bounce off him.
      
      With their guns empty the three just stare at him in
      amazement.
      
                          TITAN
                Now it's my turn.
      
      He turns to George.
      
                          TITAN (CONT'D)
                Hey, George, here comes the sun.
      
      Titan grabs George and throws him into a fluorescent light
      fixture in the ceiling.
      
      Paul tries to run for the door. Titan snatches the collar of
      his jacket.
      
                          TITAN (CONT'D)
                Say, Paul, your mother should
                know...that you're a scumbag.
      
      He tosses Paul out the window and into a parked DELIVERY
      TRUCK.
      
      Titan turns around just as John hits him with the butt of his
      shotgun. It instantly breaks apart in his hands.
      
      Titan lifts him like a rag doll up into the air.
      
                          TITAN (CONT'D)
                John, all you need is love...
      
      He throws John who lands on top of a cubical wall - GROIN
      FIRST.
      
                          TITAN (CONT'D)
                ...and a good urologist.
                                                              57.
      
      
      
      Titan effortlessly hops over the teller wall to find Ringo
      cowering on the floor.
      
      He grabs him by the shirt and lifts him up.
      
                          HAL
                Well, Ringo...um...um...you're
                under arrest.
      
      EXT. BANK - DAY
      
      Titan walks out of the bank with Ringo and George under his
      arm. He's suddenly swarmed by a group of television
      reporters, including Roxanne.
      
      Across the street is Pat Morita. He watches Titan's first
      news conference with great anxiety.
      
                          BANK MANAGER
                    (to Hal)
                On behalf of the First National
                Bank of Metro City, I'd like to
                offer you a reward for your act of
                bravery.
      
      He hands Titan a check.
      
                          TITAN
                    (reading)
                Ten thousand dollars!
      
      Titan looks over to Pat, who violently shakes his head no.
      
                          TITAN (CONT'D)
                    (unenthusiastically)
                I...can't except this. Law and
                order is it's own...um...reward.
      
      Pat gives him the thumbs up. Pat turns, suddenly seeing
      Roxanne with her camera crew. Captivated, his eyes lock on
      her.
      
      Meanwhile, Roxanne and her cameraman, SETH, are maneuvering
      around the crowd to get closer to Titan.
      
                          BRAD HELMS (O.S.)
                Not so fast, Roxanne.
      
      They both turn to see Roxanne's reporter rival Brad Helms,
      Geraldo without the class, and his cameraman, FRANK.
      
                          BRAD HELMS
                This story's mine.
                                                                 58.
      
      
      
                          ROXANNE
                Listen, Brad. We were just in the
                area. I was just trying to -
      
                          BRAD HELMS
                I've been in this business long
                enough to know pretty well what you
                were "just trying to do." Besides,
                I heard you couldn't take the big
                game anymore and were put on fluff
                detail?
      
      Dejected, Roxanne turns and motions for Seth to turn the
      camera off.
      
                          SETH
                You're not gonna take that from
                him, are you?
      
                          ROXANNE
                He's right. Old habit, I guess.
                    (to Brad)
                We'll get out of your way.
      
      As they walk off, Brad makes a comment to Frank loud enough
      for her to hear.
      
                          BRAD HELMS
                Besides, I'm sure there's a pancake
                supper somewhere that needs
                covering.
      
      INT. ABANDONED METRO CITY LIBRARY   - OFFICE - DAY
      
      ON TELEVISION
      
      We see the news conference on the bank's steps. In the corner
      of the screen is written: "recorded earlier."
      
                          BRAD HELMS
                For months now, since the death of
                Uberman, the citizens of Metro City
                have been holding out for a hero.
                Well, it appears they won't have to
                hold out for much longer as a new
                costumed crusader has suddenly
                stormed onto the scene. Today, at
                the Metro Savings and Trust, a
                masked mystery man single-handedly
                defeated "The Fab Four Gang." Just
                who is this new caped avenger?
      
      Brad holds the microphone to Titan's face.
                                                               59.
      
      
      
                          BRAD HELMS
                I'm sure all of our viewers are now
                wondering, what's the "T" stand
                for?
      
                          TITAN
                It's a message to all the scum out
                there. Uberman may be gone, but
                Metro City has a new protector, and
                his name is "Tighten!"
      
      Another reporter leans in.
      
                          REPORTER
                How do you spell that?
      
      We PULL BACK to see Plato and Da Vinci watching this
      spectacle. Master Mind is sitting with them, reading a
      NEWSPAPER.
      
                          MASTER MIND
                    (reading paper)
                Oh, for heaven's sake. I can't
                believe it. He misspelled his name.
      
      Master Mind holds up the newspaper. The headline reads
      "Metro's New Hero: Tighten."
      
                          MASTER MIND (CONT'D)
                No matter, I suppose.
      
      Master Mind throws the paper on the floor and begins to pace
      around the room with his arms folded behind his back.
      
                          MASTER MIND (CONT'D)
                We've now fully established Titan
                as Metro City's hero. They will
                love him just as they loved
                Uberman. Everything is going
                according to plan.
      
      Einstein leans over and whispers in Plato's ear.
      
                          EINSTEIN
                    (whispering)
                Yeah, if the plan is getting us in
                jail.
      
      Master Mind turns around, facing Einstein. He walks over,
      standing face to face with the rebellious henchmen.
                                                              60.
      
      
      
                          MASTER MIND
                You know, Einstein, maybe I should
                have called you Socrates. He also
                didn't know when to keep his
                thoughts to himself.
      
                           EINSTEIN
                I just fail to see the point in all
                of this. I mean, why are we
                creating another superhero when it
                was such a pain in the ass for you
                to get rid of the other one? I
                mean, Uberman is destroyed, we
                should be using this opportunity
                to...to...
      
                            MASTER MIND
                To what?
      
                          EINSTEIN
                I don't know. To take over the
                weather, space, the world -
                whatever super villains are
                SUPPOSED to do.
      
                          MASTER MIND
                The reason someone like you will
                always be a minion is because you
                have no foresight. We take over the
                earth, like you said. Then what?
                Women? Cars? Money? Even the
                grandest treasures will lose their
                lustre if you don't have someone to
                hold them over.
      
      Einstein throws up his hands. He's had enough. He pulls off
      his wig and throws it to the floor.
      
                          EINSTEIN
                That's it! This balance of the
                force bullshit is getting way too
                Oprah for me. I'm blowing. Who's
                with me?
      
                            MASTER MIND
                You dare?
      
                          EINSTEIN
                Yeah, I dare. I'm sick of wearing
                stupid costumes, and I'm sick of
                working for a super villain who's
                turning into a softie.
                                                              61.
      
      
      
      Plato and Da Vinci's mouths drop to the floor. They turn to
      Master Mind for his rebuttal.
      
                          MASTER MIND
                What - did - you - call me?
      
                          EINSTEIN
                You heard me. You used to be an
                inhuman monster, now look at you.
                You're creating super heroes, you
                don't go with us on robberies
                anymore, it's been days since you
                threatened anyone, oh, and not to
                mention this Roxanne Ritchi thing.
      
                          MASTER MIND
                THAT is none of your business,
                knave!
      
                          EINSTEIN
                Hey, you guys haven't sealed the
                deal yet, have you?
      
                           MASTER MIND
                Silence!
      
                          EINSTEIN
                    (In a woman's voice)
                Oh, Master, your head is so big.
      
                          MASTER MIND
                I'm warning you, Einstein.
      
                          EINSTEIN
                    (In a woman's voice)
                Take me!
      
                          MASTER MIND
                I said silence!
      
      With his metal gauntlet Master Mind grabs Einstein by the
      throat and lifts him into the air.
      
      Einstein looks frightened as he tries to pry himself free of
      Master Mind's grip.
      
      Master Mind's eyes soften as if his heart is suddenly not
      into what he's about to do. He let's Einstein drop to the
      floor.
      
                          MASTER MIND (CONT'D)
                Get out of my sight.
                                                               62.
      
      
      
      EXT. RESTAURANT - NIGHT
      
      Roxanne and John Cusack are eating on the outside patio of a
      fancy restaurant.
      
                          ROXANNE
                Don't get me wrong, I love being a
                reporter. I don't think I could do
                anything else. It's the
                consequences of what we do that I'm
                having a problem with.
      
      He listens intently as he refills her glass with wine.
      
                          "JOHN CUSACK"
                That's where journalistic
                responsibility comes in, no?
      
                          ROXANNE
                It's supposed to.
      
                          "JOHN CUSACK"
                Sounds to me like you're running
                from something.
      
                          ROXANNE
                I got someone I cared about killed.
                If it wasn't for me, he wouldn't
                have been involved.
      
      John suddenly gets a disturbed look in his eye, realizing
      what she's talking about.
      
      He reaches across the table and takes her hand.
      
                          "JOHN CUSACK"
                You can't blame yourself. My father
                used to say each of us must answer
                the great call to truly feel alive.
      
                          ROXANNE
                Was he an actor?
      
                          "JOHN CUSACK"
                ...No. He was...a landscaper. And a
                horrible one. I mean he would fail
                time and time again at
                his...landscaping. And sometimes
                he'd get pretty beaten up or thrown
                in jail -
      
                          ROXANNE
                Jail?
                                                              63.
      
      
      
                          "JOHN CUSACK"
                My point is he took the good with
                the bad. He grew a little each
                time. Improved, learned.
      
                          ROXANNE
                Was he ever successful?
      
                          "JOHN CUSACK"
                God, no...but don't let deter you.
      
      Roxanne LAUGHS.
      
                          ROXANNE
                Thanks for this. You know, this is
                embarrassing, but it's been a long
                time since I -
      
      It's starting to lightly sprinkle. Roxanne looks up.
      
                          ROXANNE (CONT'D)
                I think it's starting to rain. We
                might want to find a table inside.
      
                          "JOHN CUSACK"
                What were you gonna say?
      
                          ROXANNE
                Oh, I was gonna say...It's been a
                long time since...well, I've been
                with someone I...enjoy being with.
      
      John Cusack smiles warmly and raises his glass for a toast.
      
                          "JOHN CUSACK"
                To people who enjoy being with each
                other.
      
      They go to clang glasses, when the rain suddenly causes John
      Cusack's disguise generator to short.
      
      His true form of Master Mind is briefly revealed to Roxanne
      as a BOLT OF ELECTRICITY encircles his body.
      
      Roxanne drops her glass and jumps out of her seat.
      
                          MASTER MIND (CONT'D)
                Oh, no. Don't look at me.
      
      LIKE A BROKEN TV the image keeps switching between MASTER
      MIND AND JOHN CUSACK.
                                                              64.
      
      
      
      As Master Mind starts to franticly slap at his watch, the
      Cusack disguise begins to hold steady.
      
      He nonchalantly returns to cutting his steak.
      
                          "JOHN CUSACK"
                Okay, never mind that. Now, where
                were we?
      
      Roxanne grabs his glass and throws the drink in his face,
      causing the generator to short out permanently.
      
      Master Mind now sits in his true blue form.
      
                             ROXANNE
                Oh my God.
      
                          MASTER MIND
                You're not gonna get all freaky
                about this, are you?
      
                          ROXANNE
                This...this is too much, even for
                you. God, I go out with you, tell
                you my innermost thoughts.
      
                          MASTER MIND
                I only did this because I wanted to
                talk to you on the same level. You
                know, without all the baggage?
      
                          ROXANNE
                Baggage? You burned my boyfriend
                alive, you sick son-of-a-bitch!
      
                          MASTER MIND
                You see, that's exactly what I'm
                talking about.
      
      Roxanne starts to walk away.
      
                             MASTER MIND (CONT'D)
                Roxanne!
      
                          ROXANNE
                Stay away from me.
      
      Master Mind sinks back down to his chair. Despite the now
      heavy rain bombarding him, he returns to his food.
      
      Several resturaunt patron's are looking at him through the
      window.
                                                                 65.
      
      
      
      Our villain turns to them, giving them a villainous glare.
      
                          MASTER MIND
                What?
      
      INT. MASTER MIND'S BEDROOM - NIGHT
      
      Master Mind is lying on his back, wide awake.
      
                          MASTER MIND
                    (mumbling to himself)
                Stupid. What was I thinking? Plato,
                it's his fault. He's the one who
                sent me on this weak-willed path.
                I'll filet his scrotum for this.
                Me, a creature of evil, in love
                with Roxanne Ritchi. Preposterous.
                I hardly give such matters thought
      
      He rolls onto his side. He yawns and closes his eyes.
      
      Suddenly, they shoot back open.
      
                                               CUT TO:
      
      EXT. ROXANNE'S APARTMENT - NIGHT
      
      Master Mind pulls up in a blue Rolls Royce, across the street
      from Roxanne's apartment
      
      He stares up at the building, hoping to catch a glimpse of
      her.
      
      Finally, she appears, primping her hair in her apartment
      window's reflection.
      
                          MASTER MIND
                I should just go up there and just
                lay it all out to her. "Roxanne, I
                like you - I always have. Oh, and
                I'm sorry I blew up your ex.
                (realizing the absurdity of his
                words) Yeah, that would go over
                like a pants-less clown at a
                child's birthday party. What the
                hell am I even doing here? Who
                cares what she thinks? I'm a
                supervillain and here I am acting
                like a love struck schoolboy.
                Forget this. I control my own
                destiny!
                                                                66.
      
      
      
      He turns the ignition key - NOTHING HAPPENS. He repeats but
      gets the same results.
      
                          MASTER MIND (CONT'D)
                    (disgusted)
                Perfect.
      
      INT. ROXANNE'S APARTMENT - NIGHT
      
      She pulls a pack of smokes off her night stand. Empty.
      
                             ROXANNE
                Damn.
      
      She grabs her long coat and throws it over her robe.
      
      EXT. ROXANNE'S APARTMENT BUILDING
      
      Roxanne steps outside.
      
                          ROXANNE
                Please be open.
      
      Across the street is a liquor store. The light is still on.
      
                             ROXANNE (CONT'D)
                Thank God.
      
      She walks across the street, passing in front of Master
      Mind's car.
      
      Spotting her, he sinks down in his seat.
      
      Roxanne walks by, totally unaware of his presence.
      
      Relieved, Master Mind sits back up and watches her go into
      the store.
      
      INT. LIQUOR STORE - NIGHT
      
      Roxanne walks up to an elderly Korean SHOPKEEPER at the
      counter.
      
                          ROXANNE
                A pack of Lady Strikes, please.
      
      EXT. MASTER MIND'S CAR - NIGHT
      
      Master Mind is talking on his cell phone.
      
                          MASTER MIND
                Hello, Triple A?
                                                                 67.
      
      
      
      He suddenly spots something across the street.
      
      EXT. LIQUOR STORE - NIGHT
      
      A HOODLUM walks up to the entrance of the store and pulls out
      a gun from under his coat.
      
      EXT. MASTER MIND'S CAR - NIGHT
      
      Master Mind stares in shock.
      
                          MASTER MIND
                I'll call you back.
      
      He hangs up the phone and watches the Hoodlum go inside the
      store.
      
      INT. LIQUOR STORE - NIGHT
      
      The Hoodlum reaches across the counter and grabs a fist full
      of cash from the register.
      
                          SHOPKEEPER
                Hey!
      
                          SHOTGUN HOODLUM
                Shut up, Gramps.
      
      He turns to Roxanne, spotting a GOLD NECKLACE around her
      neck.
      
                          SHOTGUN HOODLUM (CONT'D)
                Gimme that necklace!
      
                          ROXANNE
                I don't think so.
      
      The Hoodlum cocks his shotgun.
      
                          SHOTGUN HOODLUM
                I said give it to me!
      
                          MASTER MIND (O.S.)
                The lady said no.
      
      The hoodlum turns around to see Master Mind in the doorway
      holding a STRANGE-LOOKING HAND CANNON (GOO GUN) with knobs
      and blinking lights.
      
      The hoodlum starts to laugh.
                                                              68.
      
      
      
                          SHOTGUN HOODLUM
                What the hell's that? A super
                soaker?
      
                          MASTER MIND
                No, it's a goo gun.
      
      The hoodlum turns his gun to Master Mind.
      
                          SHOTGUN HOODLUM
                Yeah, what's it do?
      
                           MASTER MIND
                It goos.
      
      Master Mind fires the cannon. It instantly covers the store
      in a cloud of SMOKE.
      
      The smoke clears to reveal the hoodlum STUCK TO THE WALL,
      covered in a thick, GREEN GUNK.
      
      Roxanne stares at him, dumbfounded.
      
                          MASTER MIND (CONT'D)
                It's...a prototype.
      
      Master Mind starts to walk out when he's suddenly confronted
      by the shopkeeper.
      
                          SHOPKEEPER
                I know you! You Master Brain guy.
                You a hero.
      
      Master Mind points the goo gun at him.
      
                          MASTER MIND
                Don't - EVER - say that again.
      
      EXT. LIQUOR STORE - NIGHT
      
      Master Mind walks out with the cannon resting on his shoulder
      like he's a short timer in Da Nang. Roxanne follows shortly
      behind him.
      
                           ROXANNE
                Hey!
      
      Master Mind turns around.
      
                          ROXANNE (CONT'D)
                Are you following me or something?
                                                               69.
      
      
      
                          MASTER MIND
                Don't flatter yourself.
      
      He turns away and continues walking. Roxanne runs in front of
      him blocking his way.
      
                          ROXANNE
                Don't walk away from me when I'm
                talking to you.
      
      Finally it occurs to her what's going on.
      
                          ROXANNE (CONT'D)
                What a minute...all that stuff you
                use to say to me when Uberman was
                alive - about me being the loyal
                queen by your side as you rule over
                Metro City. That wasn't just super
                villain rhetoric, was it? You
                actually meant it!
      
                          MASTER MIND
                My, someone has a rather high
                opinion of themselves.
      
      They stare at each other in silence, their glares locked in
      conflict.
      
                          ROXANNE
                    (coldly)
                Do you really think I would be with
                someone like you?
      
      This stings Master Mind to the bone. And after a brief
      contemplation, he reaches the only logical, painful
      conclusion.
      
                          MASTER MIND
                No.
      
      With that, Master Mind exits into the night, leaving Roxanne
      with a baffled expression on her face.
      
      INT. ABANDONED METRO CITY LIBRARY    - NIGHT
      
      Master Mind enters in a huff. Da Vinci closes the door behind
      him as Plato notices his master's agitated state.
      
                          PLATO
                Everything alright, sir?
      
      Master Mind GRABS PLATO BY THE GROIN with his metal gauntlet
      causing Plato's eyes to bulge in pain.
                                                              70.
      
      
      
                          MASTER MIND
                    (overly calm)
                Fine, why do you ask?
      
                          PLATO
                You...just...seem...
      
      Master Mind tightens his grip.
      
                            MASTER MIND
                Go on.
      
                          PLATO
                ...distracted.
      
      Master Mind releases him.
      
                          MASTER MIND
                Just with business, my minion. Just
                with business. I've decided it is
                time.
      
                            PLATO
                You mean?
      
                          MASTER MIND
                Yes, we've created our hero, now
                it's time to give him a little
                motivation.
      
                          DA VINCI
                How do we do that?
      
                          MASTER MIND
                To be simply good is not enough. A
                hero must be driven by an almost
                relentless desire to right a wrong
                that can never be corrected.
      
                            PLATO
                You mean?
      
                          MASTER MIND
                Yes, he must lose someone near and
                dear to him - his father figure.
                Gentlemen, it's time for Operation
                Mentor Kill!
      
      EXT. SKY OVER METRO CITY - DAY
      
      Titan flies high over and through the city, under bridges,
      between buildings, etc. He's not really working, just
      enjoying himself.
                                                                 71.
      
      
      
      INT. WOMAN'S APARTMENT - NIGHT
      
      A PRETTY WOMAN sits at her makeup table wearing nothing but
      her bra and panties. Through the reflection in her mirror we
      see a large window directly behind her.
      
      As she applies lipstick we see Titan fly quickly by in the
      background. After a moment he slowly slides back in view and
      begins ogling the girl.
      
      She sees him in the mirror and quickly covers herself with a
      robe.
      
      Titan tries to hide his face as he zooms off.
      
      MOMENTS LATER
      
      Titan looks down to see an APARTMENT BUILDING IN RUIN.
      Emergency lights flash around it as swarms of people run
      around in chaos.
      
                          TITAN
                Man, what the hell happened down
                there? Wait a sec -
      
      He stops in mid-air as he comes to the striking realization.
      
                          TITAN (CONT'D)
                THAT'S MY APARTMENT!!!
      
      EXT. HAL'S APARTMENT BUILDING - DAY
      
      Titan lands in front of the rubble that was once his home.
      Reporters stand just beyond the police line.
      
                            TITAN
                Crap.
      
      From the wreckage crawls a dying Pat Morita.
      
                            TITAN (CONT'D)
                PAT!
      
      Titan goes and kneels beside Pat, holding him in his arms.
      
                            TITAN (CONT'D)
                You okay?
      
                          "PAT MORITA"
                I'm dying, kid. There is just one
                last lesson I have for you. It is
                the most important of all.
                                                                72.
      
      
      
                          TITAN
                What's that?
      
                           "PAT MORITA"
                Master Mind did this, you must
                avenge me.
      
                          TITAN
                Master Mind? Why?
      
                          "PAT MORITA"
                Because he's evil. You must stop
                the evil Hal - stop the...
      
      Pat's body goes limp.
      
      The cameras begin to pop and flash around them.
      
      Titan gently lays Pat's body down and stands respectfully
      over him. The reporters rush over.
      
                          REPORTER 1
                Tighten, Is this the work of Master
                Mind?
      
                          REPORTER 2
                How will the death of your mentor
                affect your resolve?
      
                          REPORTER 3
                Was that Pat Morita?
      
      Titan walks up to one of the cameras.
      
                          TITAN
                This injustice will not go
                unpunished. Master Mind, if you can
                hear me, Tighten is coming for you.
      
      In the background we see Plato and Da Vinci, DRESSED AS
      PARAMEDICS, load pat's body onto a stretcher.
      
      PLATO ACCIDENTALLY DROPS HIS SIDE. As he bends down to pick
      it back up, Pat quickly slaps him, then goes back to playing
      dead.
      
      INT. ABANDONED METRO CITY LIBRARY   - NIGHT
      
      Master Mind and the boys prepare the fortress for Hal's
      revenge attack. Master Mind is as giddy as a schoolboy.
                                                              73.
      
      
      
                          MASTER MIND
                Alright, people, we don't have much
                time. Titan should be here any
                minute, so let's get the lead out.
      
      There is a GIANT MOUNTED DEATH RAY in the middle of the hall
      being tinkered with by Da Vinci.
      
                          MASTER MIND (CONT'D)
                How's the death ray coming?
      
                          DA VINCI
                Nearly up to full power, sir.
      
                          MASTER MIND
                Hum. Let's turn it down a few
                notches. It's his first time and
                we don't want to get in a lucky
                shot, now do we?
      
      Plato enters the room.
      
                          MASTER MIND (CONT'D)
                Anything on the radar yet?
      
                          PLATO
                Not yet, sir.
      
                          MASTER MIND
                I see. Well, he must be planning
                something big. Are the flame
                androids deployed?
      
                          PLATO
                All twelve.
      
      Master Mind rubs his hands in anticipation as he sits down on
      his throne.
      
                          MASTER MIND
                Wonderful, wonderful. Plato, Da
                Vinci, take your places next to me.
      
      They move to either side of the chair.
      
                          MASTER MIND (CONT'D)
                No slouching.
      
      Da Vinci straightens up and sucks in his gut.
      
      They remain this way for several long moments. Master Mind
      occasionally glances at a DIGITAL CLOCK on the wall. Still no
      Titan.
                                                               74.
      
      
      
      LATER
      
      Apparently quite some time has passed. The bold stances have
      degraded to fatigue.
      
                          PLATO
                He's certainly taking his time.
      
                          MASTER MIND
                He'll be here. That's the way it
                works.
      
      STILL LATER
      
      Master Mind reclines in his chair and taps his metal gauntlet
      impatiently on the armrest.
      
      Plato has squatted down, resting his chin on his hand.
      
                          MASTER MIND (CONT'D)
                Unprofessional, that's what this
                is. No, it's disrespect for the
                craft.
      
      Master Mind rises and begins to pace back and forth.
      
                          MASTER MIND (CONT'D)
                Would Uberman have kept us waiting
                like this? Of course not. He was a
                pro who knew the score. It's time
                we spelled out a few things for
                this Titan. I will not be made a
                fool of.
      
      He storms out of the room.
      
      INT. HAL'S NEW APARTMENT - DAY
      
      Titan's sitting on the floor in a barren apartment wearing
      his costume top and some tighty whities. He sips his beer as
      he watches a basketball game on a tiny TV.
      
      Much to his annoyance, there's a KNOCK at the door.
      
                          TITAN
                Oh, for crying out loud.
      
      He gets up and opens the door. It's Master Mind.
      
                          MASTER MIND
                Do you know who I am?
                                                                 75.
      
      
      
      It takes a few moments to register, but Titan's suddenly
      excited.
      
                          TITAN
                Yeah, you're Master Mind. Yeah!
                You're actually the guy I want to
                see!
      
                          MASTER MIND
                Oh, so NOW you want to get down to
                it. Well, I want to get a few
                things off my chest first.
      
      Master Mind walks past Titan into the apartment. He spins
      around, pointing at him accusingly with one of his metal
      fingers.
      
                          MASTER MIND (CONT'D)
                Of all the inconsiderate - Do you
                have any idea how long we waited
                for you? We're you even planning on
                coming to me and getting revenge?
      
      Titan shuts the apartment door, and turns back toward his
      guest.
      
                          TITAN
                Well, at first I was going to. You
                know, because that's what I figured
                I was supposed to do. But then I
                got to thinking-
      
                          MASTER MIND
                    (interrupting)
                -You got to thinking? There's
                nothing to think about. I'm the
                villain. I do something bad, you
                come and get me.
      
                          TITAN
                - I got to thinking...what's the
                point?
      
      Master Mind throws up his hands.
      
                          MASTER MIND
                Maybe you're right. What's the
                point?
      
      He suddenly notices something in the corner of his eye. He
      walks over to a futon in the living room. On top of it is a
      LARGE SACK OVERFLOWING WITH GOLD WATCHES,RINGS AND OTHER
      VALUABLES.
                                                              76.
      
      
      
                          MASTER MIND (CONT'D)
                What are these?
      
                          TITAN
                That's what I wanted to talk to you
                about.
      
                          MASTER MIND
                    (baffled)
                Where did you get all this?
      
                          TITAN
                    (proudly)
                Get this: I stole them.
      
                          MASTER MIND
                From where?
      
                          TITAN
                From all over. You see, once you
                killed Pat and ruined my other
                apartment building I was pretty
                pissed off, so I figured I'd go,
                find you and kick some ass. Then I
                thought to myself: "Okay,then
                what?" I mean, if we were to fight,
                what would I get out of it? Would I
                get my apartment back? Would I be
                able to pay the bills?
      
                          MASTER MIND
                Well, what about your mentor?
      
                          TITAN
                Tell you the truth? He was kind of
                a dick. I mean, being a hero is
                dandy and all, but it's volunteer
                work. Now you've always had the
                right take on all this. I mean,
                when you rob a bank or take over
                the diamond exchange you get
                something out of it. I mean, when
                you don't get caught, which, no
                offense, isn't very often. And that
                brings me to what I wanted to
                propose to you: Who could catch you
                if I'm by your side?
      
      Perplexed by his proposal, Master Mind just stares at Titan
      awe-struck.
      
                          MASTER MIND
                You want to team-up?
                                                                 77.
      
      
      
                          TITAN
                You got the brains, I got the
                brawn. We could even call ourselves
                that: `Brain' and `Brawn'. Look at
                this.
      
      Titan picks up a piece of POSTER BOARD off the floor and
      shows it to Master Mind.
      
                          TITAN (CONT'D)
                I even designed us some new
                costumes.
      
      The picture is crudely drawn with magic markers and crayons.
      A big headed man (Master Mind) is standing on a plate of
      grass in a blue costume with a picture of a brain on his
      chest.
      
      Next to him, is a picture of Titan in a red costume with a
      black cape, but his chest is mysteriously blank.
      
      Titan proudly points to the two figures.
      
                          TITAN (CONT'D)
                See, you'd be brain, so you got a
                little one on your costume, and
                then I'll have brawn on mine...once
                I figure out the best, you know,
                visual interpretation of it. What
                do you think?
      
                          MASTER MIND
                What do I think?
      
      Master Mind shakes his head tiredly.
      
                          MASTER MIND (CONT'D)
                I think you're probably the biggest
                idiot I've ever met. I mean, I
                can't believe you. All your gifts,
                all your powers, and all you want
                to use them for is your own
                financial fulfillment. You know
                what? Your kind of people make me
                sick.
      
      Titan puts down his drawing.
      
                          TITAN
                I worked hard on this.
      
                          MASTER MIND
                Oh - gee - I am so sorry!
                                                              78.
      
      
      
      Master Mind looks to Heaven in disgust.
      
                          MASTER MIND (CONT'D)
                    (under his breath)
                Of all the people to pick, it had
                to be this loser.
      
      This strikes a cord with Titan.
      
                          TITAN
                Now, hold on. You're going a little
                too far.
      
                          MASTER MIND
                I wish your mother said that to
                your father the night of your
                conception, they would have saved
                me a whole lot of heartache.
      
                          TITAN
                Hey, I mean it.
      
      Master Mind gets right in his face.
      
                          MASTER MIND
                Oh, yeah? What are you gonna do?
      
      EXT. HAL'S APARTMENT BUILDING - DAY
      
      We see Master Mind's body CRASH through the building and land
      in a DUMPSTER across the street.
      
      A car pulls up. The driver's door opens. Da Vinci gets out
      and runs to help his master.
      
                            DA VINCI
                Master!
      
                            MASTER MIND (O.S.)
                It hurts.
      
      Da Vinci peeks into the dumpster to see Master Mind's body
      cushioned by a stack of trash bags.
      
                          DA VINCI
                What hurts?
      
                            MASTER MIND
                It!
      
      The overly large henchmen starts to pull his master from the
      dumpster when they suddenly hear a voice from above. It's
      Titan peeking through the hole in his apartment wall.
                                                                 79.
      
      
      
                          TITAN
                I don't need you, I don't need
                anybody. I have the power to do and
                take anything I want. And now, I'm
                gonna take back everything this
                city owes me. Beware Metro City,
                it's time for Titan to collect.
      
      Titan shoots up into the air.
      
                          TITAN (CONT'D)
                Oh, and from now on - I'M GONNA FLY
                THE WAY I WANT TO FLY!
      
      He takes a sitting position and flies away as if he were
      piloting an invisible jet.
      
      Master Mind climbs out of the dumpster and watches Titan
      disappear into the distance.
      
                          DA VINCI
                How'd the plan go, boss?
      
                          MASTER MIND
                I just made myself redundant, old
                friend.
      
      Da Vinci gives Master Mind a whiff.
      
                          DA VINCI
                It's not that bad.
      
      INT. BANK - DAY
      
      Titan, with a happy bounce in his step, enters the bank. The
      last time he was here he thwarted a robbery. He looks
      nostalgic.
      
      A SECURITY GUARD shyly walks up to him like a kid meeting his
      TV idol.
      
                          SECURITY GUARD
                Morning, Tighten.
      
                           TITAN
                Morning.
      
                          SECURITY GUARD
                Is there something we can do for
                you?
                                                                 80.
      
      
      
                             TITAN
                   Oh, don't bother about me. I'm just
                   here to make a withdrawal.
      
      Titan walks across the lobby, drawing stares of admiration
      from all.
      
      A little girl waves to him sweetly. He gives her a good-
      natured WINK as he heads straight for the vault.
      
      The security guard watches him enter and come out with a SACK
      OF CASH.
      
      Sure he must be misunderstanding what's going on, the
      security guard just stares at Titan as he passes by and out
      the door.
      
      The bank manager comes over to the guard.
      
                             BANK MANAGER
                   Say, did he just rob us?
      
                             SECURITY GUARD
                   Not sure. Sort of looks it, don't
                   it?
      
                             BANK MANAGER
                   Yeah.
      
                             SECURITY GUARD
                   Should I, you know, stop him?
      
                             BANK MANAGER
                   Umm...Yeah.
      
      As the security guard exits the bank, the manager stares out
      the window. His eyes suddenly grow wide with terror.
      
      The guard's body suddenly smashes through the window, landing
      at the startled bank manager's feet.
      
                             BANK MANAGER (CONT'D)
                       (looking down at the
                        guard)
                   He did rob us, didn't he?

                "Absolute power corrupts

                that, in a letter to Bishop Mandell
                Creighton in 1887, no one thought
                much about it, but today Metro City
                is reeling from that very prophecy.
                Tighten, who many thought of as our

      Titan flies through the window of the building. He emerges
      seconds later laughing with his shirt full of booty.
      
      EXT. CITY STREET - DAY
      
      A woman screams from the window of a BURNING BUILDING. Titan
      flies up to her, grabs her fur coat and zooms off again,
      leaving the woman behind, slightly confused.
      
      EXT. OUTSIDE MARKET - DAY
      
      Titan steals a little boy's lollipop and gooses his mother.
      
      EXT. CITY STREET - DAY
      
      Dozens of people run through the streets apparently to get
      out of a downpour. We cut to the top of a building and see
      Titan ZIPPING UP HIS PANTS and laughing.
      
      INT. ABANDONED METRO CITY LIBRARY   - NIGHT
      
      Master Mind paces back and forth in front of Plato and Da
      Vinci.
      
                          PLATO
                I don't understand it. He seemed to
                have every characteristic we were
                looking for in a superhero.
      
                          MASTER MIND
                Well, there's no use crying about
                it now, we must take action. I'm
                not going to play second fiddle to
                that crass buffoon. We must destroy
                Tighten.
                                                                 82.
      
      
      
                          PLATO
                It won't be easy. Uberman had a
                sense of decency and genuine love
                for the people. That was his
                weakness and was easily used
                against him.
      
                          MASTER MIND
                Yes, but he possesses the same
                flaws present in Uberman's DNA -
                copper. It's like Benjamin Franklin
                always said: "If something works
                don't dick with it."
      
      EXT. BAR - DAY
      
      It looks like a war zone passed through here. Smashed police
      cars and debris lay everywhere. This seems to be the only
      building left untouched.
      
      INT. BAR - DAY
      
      A very tipsy Titan is sitting at the bar, looking deep into
      the bottom of his beer glass for answers.
      
                          TITAN
                I can have anything I want. I'm
                like a god.
      
      The BARTENDER just listens as he wipes down a glass with a
      dirty rag.
      
                          TITAN
                Point to any woman in this bar. I
                could have her in a second.
      
      He follows the bartender's gaze to THE ONLY OTHER PERSON
      THERE - A passed out, MIDDLE AGED HAG OF A BARFLY.
      
                          TITAN
                    (to Old Barfly)
                Hey, you wanna get with this?
      
                          BARTENDER
                Buddy, what do you want?
      
      Titan carefully considers this for a moment.
      
                          TITAN
                What do you want? That's the
                question, isn't it. I mean, what do
                you want when you can have
                everything?
                          (MORE)
                                                                83.
                          TITAN(cont'd)
                I suppose what I really want is to
                never be forgotten again. I want to
                do something that can never be cast
                aside or one-upped. I want a -
                what's it called? - A legacy. I
                want a legacy. Yeah, that's it. I
                like the sound that.
      
                          BARTENDER
                I meant, what do you want to drink?
      
                          TITAN
                Oh.
      
      EXT. BAR - LATER
      
      Titan stumbles out of the bar, carrying a large sack of
      money.
      
                          MASTER MIND (O.S.)
                Your time has come to an end,
                Titan!
      
      He looks up to see Master Mind suddenly standing before him.
      
                          TITAN
                What?
      
                          MASTER MIND
                There can be only one master
                criminal in this city - and it's
                me.
      
                          TITAN
                Really?
      
      Titan melodramatically throws up his arms.
      
                          TITAN (CONT'D)
                I guess I should leave town then,
                huh?
      
                          MASTER MIND
                I have a better idea - NOW!
      
      Two floors up Da Vinci releases a rope. A COPPER CAGE, like
      the one that caged Uberman, drops down on top of Titan.
      
      Titan nonchalantly surveys the cage. He walks to the bars,
      tries to pull them apart but can't.
      
                          MASTER MIND (CONT'D)
                That's copper my good man. Your one
                weakness.
                          (MORE)
                                                                84.
                          MASTER MIND(cont'd)
                For all your amazing gifts of brawn
                you are no match for my intellect.
      
      Titan thinks for a moment. Suddenly, he starts to SPIN like a
      human top, DRILLING HIMSELF INTO THE STREET BELOW.
      
      As he disappears beneath the surface, we see a shocked look
      on Master Mind's face until Titan suddenly explodes out from
      under the street in front of him.
      
      Master Mind stares up at him, dumbfounded.
      
      Titan makes like he's going to strike him down, but stops.
      
                          TITAN
                You know what? You're nothing but a
                bug. Not even worth my effort.
      
      He turns his back to Master Mind and continues down the
      street.
      
      Plato makes his way from the shadows to join his master. They
      watch Titan shrink into the distance.
      
                          MASTER MIND
                He's not as dumb as I thought.
      
                          PLATO
                I guess not...Funny, though.
      
                          MASTER MIND
                What's funny?
      
                          PLATO
                Funny Uberman didn't think of the
                same thing.
      
      EXT. HIGH ABOVE METRO CITY - DAY
      
      As Titan flies, he looks down at the rooftops of the city
      below.
      
      Suddenly, something catches his attention.
      
                             HAL
                That's it!
      
      He stops, hovering in place as he looks down below.
      
      The buildings, which make up the heart of downtown Metro, are
      in a PERFECT TRIANGLE with a long strip of street leading up
      to it. It sorta looks like a bowling lane.
                                                                85.
      
      
      
                          HAL
                Hello, Legacy.
      
      EXT. KINGPIN BOWLING - DAY
      
      Vinnie and his goons come running out as the hear a
      COMMOTION.
      
      They look up to see Titan ripping off THE GIANT BOWLING BALL
      from the top of the establishment.
      
                          VINNIE
                Hey, that's my ball!
      
      INT. ROXANNE'S APARTMENT BUILDING - DAY
      
      Roxanne enters the building's elevator. Just before the door
      closes an ELDERLY WOMAN slides in.
      
                          ELDERLY WOMAN
                That was a close one. Sixth floor,
                please.
      
      Roxanne smiles and goes to press the button.
      
      The elderly woman suddenly pulls out a SPRAY CAN, shooting a
      MYSTERIOUS-LOOKING MIST into Roxanne's face. She falls to the
      floor unconscious.
      
      INT. ROXANNE'S APARTMENT - DAY
      
      Roxanne awakens, finding herself tied to a chair in her
      living room.
      
      We hear NOISE from a TV in the background as she tries to
      adjust her vision.
      
      Slowly, the blurry figure before her becomes clear.
      
      It's Master Mind. He sits on her Lazy-Boy, reading what looks
      to be some kind of JOURNAL.
      
                          MASTER MIND
                Wow, I always thought Uberman was
                your first superhero - but it looks
                like our little Roxanne dated a
                linebacker in college.
      
                          ROXANNE
                That's my diary.
      
                            MASTER MIND
                So it is.
                                                                 86.
      
      
      
                          ROXANNE
                It's personal.
      
                          MASTER MIND
                Well, then I wouldn't leave it in
                your underwear drawer for just
                anyone to find.
      
      He throws the diary over his shoulder.
      
                          ROXANNE
                What do you want?
      
                          MASTER MIND
                I need your help.
      
                          ROXANNE
                So you knock me out and tie me to a
                chair?
      
                          MASTER MIND
                You're not going to like what I'm
                about to tell you.
      
      As she tries to shake off her headache from being knocked
      unconscious, Roxanne spots something on the TV.
      
      ON TELEVISION
      
      Brad Helms is huddled behind a van.
      
                          BRAD HELMS
                It's chaos here in city square as
                city police -
      
      Behind him, Titan picks up a POLICE CAR and throws it at a
      PADDY WAGON. Both vehicles EXPLODE on impact.
      
      BACK TO SCENE
      
                          ROXANNE
                He's really out of control.
      
                          MASTER MIND
                Tell me about it.
      
      As if finally realizing something, Roxanne looks back at
      Master Mind.
      
                          ROXANNE
                I should have known. You have
                something to do with this, don't
                you? - With Titan turning evil.
                                                              87.
      
      
      
                          MASTER MIND
                Well, the evil thing he did by
                himself. My goal was to give MYSELF
                purpose by creating an intellectual
                sparring partner.
      
                          ROXANNE
                    (confused)
                You're talking like you made him.
      
                          MASTER MIND
                And they call me Master Mind.
      
                          ROXANNE
                Let me get this straight. You
                missed getting your ass kicked, so
                you made a new guy to kick your
                ass. That's pathetic.
      
                          MASTER MIND
                In hindsight...
      
      Roxanne turns back to the TV to see a group of POLICE
      OFFICERS open fire on Titan. The bullets just deflect off his
      chest.
      
                          ROXANNE
                And his powers, they're just like
                Uberman's. Why would he have his
                powers?
      
                          MASTER MIND
                    (almost ashamed)
                I had some left over from
                something. I infused him with it.
      
                          ROXANNE
                YOU DID WHAT!?
      
      Driven by rage, she struggles to tear out of her bonds. She
      finally relents, giving Master Mind a look fueled by pure
      hatred.
      
                          MASTER MIND
                Yeah, that's why I decided to tie
                you up.
      
                          ROXANNE
                You did all this because you wanted
                purpose?
      
                          MASTER MIND
                He seemed nice.
                                                                 88.

      Titan is standing on top of a destroyed police car. He waves
      for the camera to zoom in on him.
      
                             TITAN
                   Closer. I want to show the people
                   my real face.
      
      He pulls off his mask, revealing himself as Hal Stewart to
      the public for the first time.
      
                             TITAN (CONT'D)

                   Hal Stewart. He's the guy we
                   thought saved that woman and kid.
                   Turned out he was just trying to
                   save his own ass.
      
                             MASTER MIND
                   Yeah, good to know - NOW!

      Titan throws the mask over this shoulder and hops off the
      car.
      
                             TITAN
                   That's right, I'm really Hal
                   Stewart. Former hero and bowling
                   teacher at Kingpin's Bowling.
      
      BACK TO SCENE
      
      Roxanne turns to Master Mind, condescending him with her
      eyes.
      
                              ROXANNE
                   You picked a bowler to give super
                   powers to?
      
                             MASTER MIND
                   It's a modest profession!
      
      TELEVISION
                                                              89.
      
      
      
                          TITAN
                With my new found power, I've
                recently started to wonder what
                sort of legacy I should leave.
                Should I be a hero? I tried that
                once before - even saved a lady and
                her baby from being squashed. I was
                treated like a god until everyone
                started to shit on me - Okay, so
                what if I didn't "purposely" save
                them!
      
      He walks over and puts his hand on a large circular concrete
      shape just off camera.
      
                          TITAN
                Well, I'm going to make something
                that can't be taken away from me.
                I'm going to create a permanent
                monument to my greatness. One that
                won't be so easily forgotten or
                erased.
      
      The camera pulls back revealing THE GIANT CONCRETE BOWLING
      BALL from Kingpin's.
      
                          TITAN
                I intend to create a new category
                in the Guinness Book of World's
                Records by rolling the biggest
                strike in the history of bowling.
      
      He grabs the camera and points it to the DOWNTOWN BUILDINGS.
      We realize they are PERFECTLY ALIGNED IN BOWLING PIN
      FORMATION.
      
                          TITAN
                My thanks to the city planning
                commission. This wouldn't have been
                possible without them.
      
      Titan grabs the camera so it's pointing back at him again.
      
                          TITAN
                Tell your friends and family to
                tune in right here to this station
                at noon tomorrow.

                My god, he's nuts. That'll destroy
                the whole business triangle.
                                                              90.
      
      
      
      Master Mind seems to be contemplating something - something
      bad.
      
                             ROXANNE
                What?
      
                          MASTER MIND
                My lair is in the direct path of
                the ball.
      
                          ROXANNE
                Oh, real nice. Wouldn't want
                anything to happen to your hideout,
                would we?
      
                          MASTER MIND
                You don't understand. I have
                certain equipment that's - that's
                highly unstable.
      
                          ROXANNE
                What do you mean?
      
                          MASTER MIND
                I sort of have a hydrogen reactor,
                okay?
      
                          ROXANNE
                A HYDROGEN reactor?
      
                          MASTER MIND
                It's experimental - only one in the
                world...Well, how do you think I
                power all my inventions? Someone
                like me can't pay for electricity.
                The bills would be outrageous.
      
                             ROXANNE
                A REACTOR?
      
                          MASTER MIND
                It creates 100 times the output of
                a nuclear one...If destroyed it
                could...
      
                          ROXANNE
                - Vaporize the entire city!
      
                          MASTER MIND
                    (proudly)
                Pshaw...the whole eastern seaboard,
                actually. That little baby is
                amazing. I'm quite proud of it.

                I mean...we'd better find a way to
                stop him.
      
      Master Mind thinks a moment.
      
                          MASTER MIND
                Did Uberman have a hideout?
      
                          ROXANNE
                What?
      
                          MASTER MIND
                A cave, a solitary fortress of some
                kind. C'mon, all heros have a place
                to hang their capes up in. Roxanne,
                it may be our only chance to find
                something, a clue, anything that
                could give us a fighting chance.
      
                          ROXANNE
                It's under his house.
      
                          MASTER MIND
                Whose house?
      
      Roxanne can hardly believe what she's telling him.
      
                          ROXANNE
                Wayne Scott's.
      
      Master Mind shoots up out of his chair.
      
                          MASTER MIND
                Wayne Scott? Uberman was Wayne
                Scott!? Wayne Scott, the wealthy
                philanthropist? But he disappeared -
      
                           ROXANNE
                     (interrupting)
                He disappeared just over two months
                ago when you killed him. Not only
                did you rid the world of a hero,
                you killed a kind, noble, generous
                man.
      
      Perhaps ashamed, the super villain hangs his head.
      
      Master Mind walks behind Roxanne and undoes her bonds.
      
      Rubbing her wrists, she watches him as he walks over to the
      door.
                                                                 92.
      
      
      
                          ROXANNE (CONT'D)
                Looks like you got what you always
                wanted. Uberman is out of the
                picture and Metro City is doomed.
      
      He grabs the door knob and stops, considering her words.
      
                          MASTER MIND
                "Metro City doomed." You know, I
                never thought I'd say something
                like this, but here it goes -
      
      He slowly turns to her, CUE HEROIC MUSIC.
      
                          MASTER MIND (CONT'D)
                Not if I have anything to say about
                it.
      
      EXT. WAYNE SCOTT'S MANSION - NIGHT
      
      Master Mind stands before the huge, Gothic structure in awe.
      
                          MASTER MIND
                Such a dark place for one such as
                you. I wonder, underneath your
                noble deeds, what inner demons
                drove you to your endless crusade
                for justice?
      
      He walks to the front entrance. The double doors have been
      sealed shut with boards and nails. Master Mind begins to tear
      them off with his metal hand.
      
      INT. WAYNE SCOTT'S MANSION - NIGHT
      
      The doors opens. A beam of moonlight immediately pierces the
      darkness, forming an illuminated path into the heart of the
      manor.
      
      Master Mind enters.
      
      Covered in dust and cobwebs, the hall looks like a gigantic
      crypt.
      
                          MASTER MIND
                Good lord, man. You've only been
                dead for two months.
      
      Master Mind walks, coming to a gigantic painted PORTRAIT OF
      WAYNE SCOTT. He stops to reverently admire the image of his
      fallen foe.
                                                                 93.
      
      
      
                           MASTER MIND (CONT'D)
                 A disguise so simple, it's
                 ingenious. No wonder I never caught
                 on.
      
      Besides the Armani suit, there's nothing to hide the fact
      that this is the same person as Uberman. In the picture, he's
      even standing in the same cheesy, heroic pose with his fists
      on his hips.
      
                           MASTER MIND (CONT'D)
                 Two lives, yet in both you were an
                 ideal. Perhaps it was you who was
                 victorious in the end, old friend.
      
      A BONGING sound suddenly bellows through the dark halls.
      
      Master Mind comes to a grandfather clock standing next to a
      gigantic BOOKCASE.
      
      On the twelfth bong it falls silent.
      
      Master Mind begins to slide it across the floor until he
      hears a loud CLICK.
      
      The bookcase slides into the wall, REVEALING A HIDDEN
      PASSAGE.
      
                           MASTER MIND (CONT'D)
                 I'll miss how predictable you were.
      
      The passage way leads Master Mind to a WORKING ESCALATOR.
      
      Master Mind gets off the escalator to see a long hallway with
      stone walls.
      
      He begins to hear strange SOUNDS, almost like MUFFLED
      SCREAMS, coming from a doorway at the end of the hallway.
      
      Master Mind starts walking towards it. As he steps closer, he
      begins to notice a light cracking through the bottom of the
      door.
      
                           MASTER MIND (CONT'D)
                 Hello? Anyone here...besides..all
                 the BIG MEN who are with me now?
      
      Nothing.
      
                           MASTER MIND (CONT'D)

                          MASTER MIND(cont'd)
                The man was a boy scout, not a
                serial killer.
      
      He opens the door to his immediate amazement.
      
      It's some kind of screening room. A PROJECTOR shoots an image
      onto A DIRTY WHITE SCREEN hanging on the wall. BEER CANS
      litter the floor; a table in front of a ripped-up couch is
      covered in discarded snack goods; and a Kiss Pinball machine
      stands in the far corner next to a CLOSED DOOR.
      
      Master Mind turns his attention to the action on the screen.
      
      SCREEN
      
      A woman dressed in a leather DOMINATRIX OUTFIT is whipping an
      overweight man lying on a swing-like device with his butt
      sticking out.

                YOU ARE A WORM!
      
      She whips him three times. The man CRIES out in pain.

                PINEAPPLE!!! PINEAPPLE!!!
      
      Master Mind's eyes are transfixed on the disturbing imagery.
      
      The door by the pinball machine suddenly swings open.
      
      WAYNE SCOTT, dressed in raggedy sweats, steps into the room
      carrying a CAN OF BEER and a bowl of JIFFY-POP.
      
      Master Mind cannot believe his horrified eyes.
      
                           MASTER MIND
                Ahhhhhh!
      
      Wayne Scott is just as startled.
      
                           WAYNE SCOTT
                Jesus!
      
      He drop his drink and snack to the floor.
      
      The two men stare at each other as they struggle to regain
      their normal breathing patterns.
      
      Wayne Scott walks over to the couch, brushes off a thick
      layer of chip crumbs, and sits down.
      
                          WAYNE SCOTT (CONT'D)
                What the hell are you doing here?
                                                                 95.
      
      
      
                          MASTER MIND
                I might just ask you the same
                question. I had thought I
                incinerated you.
      
                           WAYNE SCOTT
                You scared the bejesus out of me.
                How'd you figure out I was still
                alive? Wait, how do you know my
                identity!?
      
                          MASTER MIND
                Roxanne told me. As for your ruse,
                I forgot to line the bottom of the
                copper cage - Somebody pointed that
                out to me recently. Figured if they
                could do it, so could you. But one
                thing I couldn't figure out -
      
                          WAYNE SCOTT
                The skeleton? Something I
                "borrowed" from a medical school a
                few months before.
      
                          MASTER MIND
                A few months? How long had you been
                planning this?
      
                          WAYNE SCOTT
                I always planned to retire -
                eventually. I mean, come on, you
                can't do this sort of thing in your
                fifties. You'd just look
                ridiculous.
      
      The pieces of the puzzle appear to be coming together in
      Master Mind's head.
      
                          MASTER MIND
                I see it all so clearly now.
      
      INT. MASTER MIND'S HYDROFOIL - FLASHBACK
      
      Master Mind and his minions cover their eyes as the
      observatory explodes.
      
                          MASTER MIND (CONT'D - V.O.)
                You must have done it just seconds
                before the observatory exploded.
                                                                96.
      
      
      
      INT. OBSERVATORY - FLASHBACK
      
      Similar to what Titan did, Uberman bores out from under the
      cage.
      
                          MASTER MIND (CONT'D - V.O.)
                You bore out from under the cage.
                Then, using your Uber-Speed, -
      
      EXT. OBSERVATORY - FLASHBACK
      
      Running in a blur-like haze, Uberman screeches to a halt in
      front of some bushes.
      
                          MASTER MIND (CONT'D - V.O.)
                - you made your way to safety,
                where you had the skeleton safely
                hidden away somewhere.
      
      EXT OBSERVATORY - SKY - DAY
      
      Uberman soars high above the clouds. He looks down at the
      observatory, which is a mere speck in the distance.
      
                          MASTER MIND (CONT'D - V.O) (CONT'D)
                Then you must have flown to a safe
                distance and waited for the
                explosion, then...
      
      Just as the observatory explodes Uberman aims and throws the
      SKELETON like a javelin.
      
      It soars through the air like a missile, tearing through the
      flames of the explosion, and crashing right into the
      windshield of Master Mind's hydrofoil.
      
      END OF FLASHBACK
      
      Wayne stares at Master Mind, clearly impressed.
      
                          WAYNE
                Man, you ARE smart.
      
                           MASTER MIND
                But why fake your death? Why go
                through all of it? You could have
                just quit.
      
                          WAYNE SCOTT
                But the responsibility would still
                be there.
                          (MORE)
                                                              97.
                          WAYNE SCOTT(cont'd)
                A cop can retire and stop handing
                out speeding tickets - but people
                expect more from superheroes. I
                tell you, a volcano couldn't erupt
                in Zimbabwe without everyone
                expecting me to do something about
                it. I figured, out of sight, out of
                mind.
      
                           MASTER MIND
                And Wayne Scott? Why did he have to
                disappear?
      
                          WAYNE SCOTT
                Both of my lives have so much
                baggage. It's time for new baggage,
                you know?
      
      Master Mind's is absolutely flabbergasted.
      
                          MASTER MIND
                I just can't believe it. This whole
                time you've been in hiding while a
                force of great evil is tearing your
                city apart?
      
      Wayne rises to his feet, waving his hands for Master Mind to
      say no more.
      
                          WAYNE SCOTT
                I don't want to hear about it.
                That's why I don't have a
                television in here to remind me of
                all the things I SHOULD be doing.
                Hell, I could get a wife to do
                that.
      
                          MASTER MIND
                There's a demented supervillain out
                there about to destroy our - I
                mean, your city.
      
      Wayne shrugs indifferently.
      
                          MASTER MIND
                You're really going to do nothing?
      
                          WAYNE SCOTT
                Good and evil have a way of
                balancing themselves out. If this
                guy is as bad as you say, somebody
                will rise up to fight him. It's
                just the order of things. You found
                me, didn't you?
                                                                98.
      
      
      
      Wayne puts a condescending hand on Master Mind's shoulder.
      
                          WAYNE SCOTT (CONT'D)
                I know it's hard, but you'll find
                someone else someday.
      
      He then starts walking to the door.
      
                          MASTER MIND
                You're the only one who can stop
                him.
      
      Wayne turns around.
      
                          WAYNE SCOTT
                Couldn't if I wanted to. Gotta a
                plane to catch.
      
                            MASTER MIND
                A plane?
      
                          WAYNE SCOTT
                Going to Barbados for a little
                change in climate. Now, if you'll
                excuse me, I got to go pack.
      
      He reads the still defeated look on Master Mind's face.
      
                          WAYNE SCOTT (CONT'D)
                You were a good foe. I'm sorry if
                I've let you down. If it makes a
                difference, you were the best foe a
                hero could ask for.
      
                          MASTER MIND
                Not smart enough to come up with a
                full-proof trap.
      
                          WAYNE SCOTT
                Well, you did almost have me when
                you figured out my weakness was
                copper. Now that made me sweat a
                little. Took me way too long to
                drill out from under that cage.
      
                          MASTER MIND
                I got lucky.
      
                          WAYNE SCOTT
                Anyway, it's a good thing for my
                sake that I could always count on
                you for an out.
                                                              99.
      
      
      
                          MASTER MIND
                    (suddenly confused)
                What do you mean?
      
                          WAYNE SCOTT
                C'mon, we always threw each other a
                couple of bones. You would always
                leave me an out in one of your
                `full-proof' traps, and I'd never
                had you incarcerated at a
                penitentiary that you couldn't
                eventually escape from. It kept our
                little game going.
      
      Master Mind seems deflated.
      
                          MASTER MIND
                Game? - Was that all this ever was
                to you? You know, I was trying my
                best every time I fought you. Those
                `outs' as you call them were
                unintentional.
      
                          WAYNE SCOTT
                Oh.
      
                          MASTER MIND
                I guess I was never really a match
                for you, was I?
      
      Wayne shrugs.
      
                          MASTER MIND (CONT'D)
                    (thoughtfully)
                Then how can I expect to be one for
                Titan?
      
      A beaten man, Master Mind heads for the door, but stops and
      turns around.
      
                          MASTER MIND (CONT'D)
                What about Roxanne?
      
      Wayne unleashes an exhausted sigh.
      
                          WAYNE SCOTT
                I think we both got what we wanted
                out of our relationship. She got a
                career out of me, and I got plenty
                of other things out of her. But I'm
                ready to move on to greener
                pastures.
                                                                100.
      
      
      
      Master Mind's steel hand clinches into a fist at his side.
      Wayne's oblivious to this.
      
                          MASTER MIND
                I guess I wasn't the villain I
                thought I was, and you...you
                weren't the hero I thought you
                were.
      
      He turns to make his exit when he suddenly sees ROXANNE
      STANDING IN THE DOOR FRAME.
      
      Wayne is almost at a loss for words.
      
                          WAYNE SCOTT
                Roxanne! How long have you been...
      
                          ROXANNE
                Long enough.
      
      Roxanne looks at Master Mind.
      
                           ROXANNE (CONT'D)
                Don't you have something else you
                can go do?
      
      Master Mind leaves Roxanne and Wayne facing each other in
      silence.
      
      EXT. ANOTHER BAR - DAY
      
      Titan emerges with Brad and Frank. He's holding a BEER CAN
      and a bag of PORK RINDS.
      
                          TITAN
                Alright, I want this whole thing to
                look ESPN professional, understand?
      
      A distant MECHANIZED RUMBLE can be heard. The noise rises,
      signaling the approach of something powerful.
      
      Titan and his crew walk out to the center of the plaza as the
      sound becomes almost deafening.
      
      A TANK TRACK
      
      as it moves over the street. We PULL BACK to see a whole line
      of TANKS rolling along the street.
      
      PLAZA
      
      From the five streets branching off the plaza, a dozen tanks
      roll toward Titan.
                                                                101.
      
      
      
      Titan turns to Brad and Frank.
      
                             TITAN (CONT'D)
                   You guys are about to get some good
                   footage. I might need a little
                   room, though.
      
      Brad and Frank look at each other and run to take cover
      behind a nearby building.
      
      Meanwhile, Titan nonchalantly sips from his beer as the tanks
      begin to surround them.
      
      FEEDBACK belts out of one of the tank's loudspeaker's,
      causing Titan to do a mock wince.
      
                              TANK LOUDSPEAKER
                   Titan, we have orders from the city
                   of Metro to take you into custody.
                   If you do not give your self up
                   willingly, we will be forced to
                   open fire.
      
      There's a long pause as no one says anything.
      
                             TANK LOUDSPEAKER
                   What is your answer?
      
      Titan takes a sip of his beverage and UNLEASHES A GIGANTIC
      BURP - The shockwave of which sends several of the tanks
      flying into a nearby building.
      
      Two of the remaining tanks close in on the villain. Both have
      him dead to rights at point-blank range with their massive
      guns.
      
      Titan sets down his beer, then calmly plugs a fist into each
      barrel.
      
      They FIRE.
      
      The FORCE OF THE BLAST SENDS THEM BOTH FLYING IN OPPOSITE
      DIRECTIONS where they CRASH into nearby buildings.
      
      Titan bends down and pick his beet back up.
      
                             TITAN
                       (to beer)
                   Miss me?
      
      Titan is suddenly bombarded by a massive barrage of machine-
      gun fire. The force sends him flying into the windshield of a
      nearby car.
                                                                102.
      
      
      
      He looks up to see an APACHE ASSAULT COPTER. It's nose-
      mounted GATLING-GUN is turning toward him.
      
      Titan gets up to his feet and looks down at his beer can. The
      bottom of it was blown apart in the blast.
      
                          TITAN (CONT'D)
                Didn't mean to get you involved in
                all of this.
      
      He stared daggers up at the helicopter pilot just as the gun
      gets a bead on him.
      
                          TITAN (CONT'D)
                Hey, man! You killed my suds!
      
      Titan throws the can up and slaps it with the palm of his
      hand.
      
      It flies with so much force it knocks the helicopter blade
      clean off. The rest of the Apache crashes to the street like
      a car dropped off a building.
      
                          TITAN (CONT'D)
                That's one was for you, beer.
      
      Titan salutes the wreckage and walks away to find Brad and
      Frank still hiding behind the building.
      
                          TITAN
                Guys, please tell me you got that
                last bit.
      
                          BRAD HELMS
                Huh?
      
                          TITAN
                You're kidding me. I give you my
                sexiest moves and you mean to tell
                me it was for nothing?
      
                          BRAD HELMS
                We were afraid something might hit
                us.
      
                          TITAN
                Looks like I've given the story of
                the century to the wrong man.
      
      He thinks about this for a moment, then it hits him.
                                                             103.
      
      
      
                          TITAN
                Wait. What about that other
                reporter. Blond. Not so lumpy on
                the topper half, but killer legs.
      
                          BRAD HELMS
                Roxanne. You want Roxanne. She's a
                much better reporter than I am. You
                want her.
      
                          TITAN
                Where can I find her.
      
                          FRANK
                We're actually not supposed to give
                out that sort of information.
      
                          BRAD HELMS
                1314 Mockingbird Lane. I believe
                she lives in a penthouse.
      
                          TITAN
                You've been very helpful.
      
      He tosses Brad over his shoulder like a discarded ice cream
      cone.
      
      In the faint distance we see him splash down in the middle of
      the Metro City river.
      
      INT. ABANDONED METRO CITY LIBRARY   - DAY
      
      Master Mind, pacing anxiously as Plato and Da Vinci pack
      boxes. Obviously Master Mind is going on the lamb.
      
                          MASTER MIND
                Hurry, we must be on our way as
                soon as possible.
      
                          DA VINCI
                Master, why must we flee?
      
                          MASTER MIND
                I told you, Titan is too powerful.
                If he's set on destroying us,
                there's precious little we could do
                about it.
      
                          DA VINCI
                Where are we going?
                                                             104.
      
      
      
                          MASTER MIND
                To another city, someplace with a
                shitload of superheroes to fight.
                We'll start over, we'll go back to
                doing what we do best.
      
                          PLATO
                With our tails between our legs?
      
      The old Master Mind would never have let this comment slip
      by, but as we have seen, he's not the same man.
      
                          MASTER MIND
                Plato, do you have a better plan?!
      
      Master Mind's cell phone rings. He turns in shame from his
      men and answers it.
      
                          MASTER MIND (CONT'D)
                Hello...Roxanne?
      
      INT. ROXANNE'S APARTMENT
      
      Roxanne paces back and forth on the phone.
      
                          ROXANNE
                What are you going to do about
                Tighten?
      
      INTERCUT between Master Mind and Roxanne on phone.
      
                          MASTER MIND
                Right now I'm packing, later I'll
                have a snack on the train.
      
                          ROXANNE
                You're running away?
      
                          MASTER MIND
                In a word - yes.
      
                          ROXANNE
                You created this monster...
      
                          MASTER MIND
                I didn't create this - the god's of
                irony did and I am eating the crow
                I so richly deserve.
      
                          ROXANNE
                There's no time for self pity.
                                                             105.
      
      
      
                          MASTER MIND
                I'll make the time.
      
      Roxanne can't believe what she's hearing.
      
                          MASTER MIND (CONT'D)
                You can leave with us. You'll be
                safe.
      
                          ROXANNE
                I'm not going anywhere.
      
                          MASTER MIND
                Will you listen to me, no one can
                stop him.
      
                           ROXANNE
                You have to try. The city needs
                your help.
      
                          MASTER MIND
                I'm afraid you have an inflated
                opinion of me.
      
                          ROXANNE
                What the hell's happened to you?
                The Master Mind I knew would never
                have run from a fight even though
                he knew deep in his heart that he
                didn't have a chance in hell of
                winning it. It was your best
                quality. You need to be that man
                right now...I...
      
                          MASTER MIND
                What?
      
                          ROXANNE
                    (heart felt)
                I believe in you.
      
      Master Mind is taken aback, in a good way. But he catches
      himself before the words swell his heart.
      
                          MASTER MIND
                Sweet words, but that man is dead.
                Please, Roxanne, just come with me.
      
                          ROXANNE
                No...I guess you are a coward after
                all.
      
      Suddenly, there's a loud crash.
                                                               106.
      
      
      
      Roxanne looks up to see a huge hunk of her ceiling has been
      completely ripped off.
      
      Titan is flying above, holding the debris as casually as if
      it were a paper plate at a barbecue.
      
      He looks down at her and smiles.
      
                          TITAN
                Man, have I got a story for you.
      
      Master Mind can hears Titan's familiar laugh from his side of
      the line.
      
                          MASTER MIND
                Roxanne? Roxanne?
      
      EXT. KINGPIN BOWLING - DAY
      
      Titan is standing in front of the bowling alley, trying to
      decide on an appropriate pose for the occasion.
      
                          TITAN
                What pose would be best? The corny
                folded arms thing?
      
      He demonstrates, arching his chin proudly in the air.
      
                          TITAN
                Or maybe on the hips, like this.
      
      It's the classic Superman pose, only not as masculine.
      
                          TITAN
                No, makes me look like a flamer
                pirate.
      
      As Titan starts to fix his hair in the window, Frank pretends
      to fix the lens on his camera as he speaks to Roxanne.
      
                          FRANK
                    (whispering)
                Shouldn't we be making a run for it
                right about now?
      
                          ROXANNE
                    (whispering)
                The guy can outrun bullets. I don't
                think either one of us is in that
                kind of shape.
      
                          TITAN
                She's right, Frank.
                                                             107.
      
      
      
      Frank looks up, stunned that Titan could have possibly heard
      him.
      
                          TITAN
                Also got super hearing. I promise
                not to keep the both of you long,
                but you'll thank me when this is
                all over.
      
      Frank and Roxanne exchange helpless expressions.
      
      INT. ABANDONED METRO CITY LIBRARY   - DAY
      
      Master Mind reverently stares up at the painted portrait of
      his father.
      
                          MASTER MIND
                Dad, it's me...
                    (he looks around to make
                     sure no one can hear)
                ...Bubsy. I know we haven't talked
                in a while, and I'm sorry. It's
                been a little crazy trying to live
                up to a legacy.
      
      The painting's menacing stare seems to reach into his very
      soul.
      
                          MASTER MIND
                Anyway...You raised me to be the
                worst that I could possibly be. And
                I've tried to live up to that as
                best as I could - even dropping out
                of dentistry school like you wanted
                me to. But I'm about to do
                something now that would really
                piss you off. I'm going to go
                against everything you ever taught
                me. I hope...I hope that maybe
                you'll look down at what I'm about
                to do as not so much a good deed,
                but more like the outright defiance
                of a hateful and ungrateful, son.
                If you could do that, then maybe -
                in your own little way - you could -
                for probably the first time - find
                a reason to be proud of me.
      
      He looks back up at the picture. Is it our imagination, or
      does the painting's stare suddenly seem even angrier?
                                                             108.
      
      
      
                              MASTER MIND
                   Well...either way, you're probably
                   going to see me real soon.
                        (calling over his
                         shoulder)
                   Men?
      
      Plato and Da Vinci suddenly stop what they're doing and look
      up at him.
      
                              PLATO AND DA VINCI
                   Yes Sir?

                   Stop packing. Our work is not

                   footage of a potential dangerous
                   situation in downtown Metro. The
                   former hero knows as Titan is
                   placing what appears to be a giant
                   ball...

      Da Vinci stops in front of a television set, seeing the news
      report in progress.
      
                             REPORTER
                   Hold on...It appears our own
                   Roxanne Ritchi is somehow at the
                   scene. We now go to her with a live
                   report.
      
                             DA VINCI

                                                   CUT TO:

      EXT. CITY STREET - DAY
      
      Roxanne is standing in front of a camera with a mike in her
      hand.
      
                          ROXANNE
                I'm here with the cause of the
                destruction in Metro City. He has
                kidnapped me and a cameraman to
                chronicle what he refers to as the
                creation of a monument to his
                invincibility and overall
                "Asskickiness." He will use this
                giant concrete bowling ball to play
                the largest game of bowling ever
                using the buildings of downtown
                Metro City as his pins.
      
      Titan suddenly steps into the shot.
      
                          TITAN
                And I'm going for the biggest
                strike ever.
      
      He leans into the camera.
      
                          TITAN
                And you, Metro City, have a
                ringside seat as I cement my name
                in the anal of history.

                             TITAN
                What?
      
                             ROXANNE
                Nevermind.
      
      EXT. CITY STREET - MOMENTS LATER
      
      Titan holds up the massive bowling ball, lining up his shot.
      
                          TITAN
                    (in quiet professional
                     bowler announcer voice)
                Like Tiger before him, a young
                savior has come to raise a sport
                from the ashes. Rookie Hal Stewart,
                a young man with a dream, realizing
                that dream here today, folks.

                          TITAN(cont'd)
                One might click there heels and say
                "There's no place like home" upon
                finding themselves in such a
                fantasy. Well, Hal looks very much
                at home right were he is - with a
                ball in hand and glory in his
                sights.
      
      INT. METRO CITY LIBRARY - CONTINUOUS
      
      In the bowels of Master Mind's hideout, the HYDROGEN REACTOR
      glows and HUMS MENACINGLY.
      
      BACK TO SCENE
      
      Roxanne just stand helpless as Frank films away.
      
                          ROXANNE
                Hal, I know everyone treated you
                like shit, but you don't have to do
                this.
      
                          TITAN
                You're right. I don't HAVE to do
                anything. Isn't that cool?
      
      Titan lines up his shot.
      
                          TITAN
                Here's one for the record books!
      
      Titan flies a few feet and rolls the ball down the main
      street.
      
      ROXANNE
      
      Her face is utter horror as she watches the inevitable
      destruction of Metro City.
      
      As the ball rolls - it demolishes everything in it's wake;
      cars, street lamps - windows shatter as the giant concrete
      sphere brushes along side buildings.
      
      TITAN
      
      He smiles in anticipation and uses "body English" to direct
      the ball.
      
      GIANT BOWLING BALL POV
      
      It's nearly halfway to its target.
      
      ROXANNE
                                                             111.
      
      
      
      She closes her eyes.
      
      Titan's smile fades. He looks around as if he hears something
      we don't.
      
      About two hundred feet in front of the first building a GIANT
      SPIDER WEB flies across the path of the ball, creating a
      defensive barrier. An enormous letter "M" is etched in the
      web's center.
      
                          TITAN (CONT'D)
                What the...?
      
      The ball breaks through the web, but it's speed is greatly
      reduced.
      
                          FRANK
                Look, what's that flying in the
                air?
      
      We suddenly see MASTER MIND FLYING OVER THE ROLLING BALL IN A
      JET PACK.
      
      He quickly pulls out his goo gun and starts laying down a
      path of sticky plasm to stop the destructive sphere's path.
      
                          MASTER MIND
                C'mon, slow down
      
      Master Mind looks down to see the meter of the gun close to
      empty.
      
                             MASTER MIND
                C'mon.
      
      The ball slows drastically then starts rolling to the side.
      It heads off an embankment and rolls harmlessly into a CANAL.
      
                          MASTER MIND
                Gutterball!
      
      TITAN
      
      He's furious to say the least.
      
                             TITAN
                YOU!
      
      Master Mind gives him a mocking grin.
      
                          MASTER MIND
                Bowling? What other trailer park
                sports can you play?
                                                                112.
      
      
      
                            TITAN
                  You are becoming a real pain in my
                  ass. I should have done this a long
                  time ago.
      
      Titan lunges at his tormentor. Master Mind hits the BOOSTER
      on his jet pack and heads back toward the other side of the
      city with Titan in hot pursuit.
      
                            MASTER   MIND (CONT'D)
                      (into walkie   talkie)
                  Plato, Da Vinci.   Secure Roxanne,
                  he's falling for   it.
      
      ELSEWHERE
      
      A flustered Titan lands. He begins searching the city
      streets, but Master Mind is nowhere in sight.
      
      He turns upon hearing an EEKING sound to his left.
      
      Sitting on the ground is a CHIMPANZEE wearing a strange
      collar. It smiles at him.
      
                            TITAN
                  What the hell?
      
      From behind, Titan is immediately set upon by five more RADIO
      CONTROLLED APES.
      
                              TITAN (CONT'D)
                  GODAMNIT!
      
      The critters bite hop and hit Titan. As soon as he throws one
      off two more jump him.
      
      Titan breaks free and with his mighty breath blows them
      across the street into a fruit stand. With Titan out of their
      sight they begin to attack the fruit.
      
      MASTER MIND
      
      He's a block away frantically hitting his remote.
      
                            MASTER MIND
                  Shit! Stupid monkeys and their
                  fruit.
      
      Titan flies away from the mad monkeys and lands to find
      Master Mind sitting on the ground wrapped in a long cape with
      only his head sticking out.
                                                             113.
      
      
      
                          TITAN (CONT'D)
                No more games.
      
      Titan FIRES HIS LASER VISION AT MASTER MIND's CHEST.
      
      Master Mind pulls the cloak away to reveal a FIRE HYDRANT.
      Titan's EYE LASERS burn through the hydrant releasing a high
      pressure stream of water.
      
      Master Mind uses the last remote which dumps two tons of
      CEMENT mix into the truck.
      
      The crowd, police and news crews move in closer when Titan
      doesn't emerge.
      
      Master Mind drops his last remote and walks toward the truck
      cautiously.
      
                          MASTER MIND
                Could it really be that easy--
      
      - BOOM - The back of the truck explodes, throwing dust and
      concrete everywhere. When the dust clears we see and enraged
      Titan.
      
                          MASTER MIND (CONT'D)
                Didn't think so.
      
      As the villain walks toward him, he pulls back his fist to
      give Master Mind the killing blow.
      
                          TITAN
                If you don't mind, I'm going to
                punch trough your face now.
      
      Preparing himself for the end, Master Mind shuts his eyes as
      a SUDDEN GUST OF WIND BEGINS TO PICK UP.
      
      AS Titan goes to strike, a BLURRY FIGURE RUNS IN AND SNATCHES
      MASTER MIND OUT OF THE AWAY.
      
      Stunned, Master Mind begins to feel around his body as if to
      make sure everything's still in place.
      
                             MASTER MIND
                I'm alive.
      
      He turns to see UBERMAN standing next to him.
      
                             MASTER MIND
                Uberman?
                                                             114.
      
      
      
      The terrified bystanders start to notice the figure standing
      next to Master Mind.
      
                          BYSTANDER 1
                It's Uberman!
      
                          BYSTANDER 2
                Uberman's alive!
      
                          BYSTANDER 3
                We're saved!
      
      As the CROWD CHEERS, A confused Master Mind turns to Metro
      City's newly resurrected champion.
      
                             MASTER MIND
                I thought.
      
                             UBERMAN
                So did I.
      
      He puts a hand on Master Mind's shoulder.
      
                          UBERMAN
                Thank you, old enemy.
      
                             MASTER MIND
                For what?
      
                          UBERMAN
                Showing me the error of my ways,
                Showing me I'm meant to be this
                city's savior, showing me that,
                while we can try, there is no
                running away from our true destiny.
      
      With that, UBERMAN IS STRICKEN BY A LASER BLAST, INSTANTLY
      TURNING HIM INTO A CHARRED HUMAN SKELETON.
      
      Master Mind turns to see Titan smiling with his STILL SMOKING
      EYES.
      
                          TITAN
                Oh...Did I interrupt something?
      
      Master Mind turns to run, but, suddenly Titan is before him.
      
                          TITAN
                Where you going, buddy?
      
      Titan grabs Master Mind by the collar and throws him across
      the street into a parked car.
                                                                115.
      
      
      
                          TITAN (CONT'D)
                Welcome to Paintown. Population:
                you.
      
      Master Mind manages to stand on shaky legs. He seems in a
      daze, unable to move.
      
      Titan flies up in the air.
      
                          TITAN (CONT'D)
                Time to finish this.
      
      With his fist front and center, Titan speeds toward Master
      Mind. He's like a human torpedo, coming in for the killing
      blow.
      
      Master Mind comes to his senses and puts up his hands.
      
                          MASTER MIND
                WAIT!!!
      
      Titan screeches to a halt and stops just in front of him like
      an old Warner Bros cartoon.
      
                          TITAN
                What?
      
                          MASTER MIND
                Quick joke - What's the capital of
                Thailand?
      
                          TITAN
                Huh - I don't know.
      
                          MASTER MIND
                It's bang cock!
      
      In a sudden surge of strength, MASTER MIND PUNCHES TITAN IN
      THE GROIN.
      
      The once mighty man instantly drops to his knees, searching,
      with tears in his eyes, for the proper word to express the
      pain suddenly surging through his member.
      
                          TITAN (CONT'D)
                Ow.
      
      Baffled, he looks up at Master Mind's hand and sees his
      gauntlet is now made ENTIRELY OUT OF COPPER.
      
                           MASTER MIND
                So, I guess pennies are good for
                something.
                                                             116.
      
      
      
      He punches Titan in the face, knocking him out cold.
      
      Master Mind looks down on Titan with more than a little
      pride. Suddenly he hears something behind him. He spins to
      see the crowd making a strange noise - APPLAUSE.
      
      Roxanne comes up to him.
      
      The crowd starts to go wild and cheers for Master Mind. He's
      not sure what to make of it.
      
                          ROXANNE
                Pretty strange, huh?
      
                          MASTER MIND
                They're cheering for me.
      
                          ROXANNE
                You saved them. You saved
                everybody. How's it feel?
      
      Master Mind looks at the smiles all around him. He begins to
      well up a little.
      
                          MASTER MIND
                It's a...it's nice, you know? I
                usually don't get a lot of
                feedback.
                    (whispering)
                But I also kind of caused all this.
                What happens when they find that
                out I was the cause of some of
                this?
      
      Roxanne looks at the cheering crowd, then back at Master
      Mind.
      
                          ROXANNE
                What they don't know won't hurt
                them.
      
                          MASTER MIND
                I guess that is all in the past.
      
                          ROXANNE
                You're the hero.
      
                          MASTER MIND
                I don't think I'd go that far...I
                mean I just...er...
      
                          ROXANNE
                Master Mind?
                                                             117.
      
      
      
                             MASTER MIND
                   Yes?
      
                             ROXANNE
                   Stop talking.
      
      She kisses him.
      
      The crowd erupts in a cheer.
      
      TELEVISION
      
      The channel 7 he channel 7 logo zooms in followed by the
      title "Eye on Metro City."
      
      A picture of Master Mind smiling appears on the screen behind
      her.
      
                             SAMANTHA SUMMERS
                   Who's bad? Well, not Master Mind.
                   It seems the former villain has
                   done a career 180 after defeating
                   Tighten and saving Metro City from
                   certain enslavement. And here he is
                   getting a full pardon by Metro
                   City's Mayor, Steve Dent.
      
      Cut to ceremony on capital steps. The MAYOR is shaking Master
      Mind's metal gauntlet when it suddenly STARTS TO CRUSH HIS
      HAND.
      
                             MAYOR
                   Ahhh!
      
      Secret service men quickly start to draw their weapons and
      take aim at Master Mind.
      
      Realizing what's happening, he quickly lets the mayor's hand
      go and puts his arms in the air.
      
                             MASTER MIND
                   Sorry - Metal hand. Force of habit.
      
      He elbows the mayor.
      
                             MASTER MIND (CONT'D)
                    We're okay, right?
      
      Wincing, the mayor signals the men to put their guns down.
      
      WE CUT to video of Titan behind bars in a regular prison.
                                                             118.
      
      
      
                          BRAD HELMS
                And what about Tighten? Is there a
                prison in existence that can hold
                this super powered menace? Well,
                the answer we found is no.
      
      A man in a white lab coat stands in front of Titan's cell
      just out of reach.
      
                          PRISON SCIENTIST
                Of course normally he could break
                out of there anytime, but as you
                can see we've taken some special
                precautions.
      
      The news camera pans over see Titan in his cell wearing a
      copper JOCK STRAP with electrical cables hooked to it.
      
      Back to Samantha at the desk.
      
                          BRAD HELMS
                What is a Hero? It seems never has
                that question needed to be asked
                more than it does tonight. We go to
                our very own Roxanne Ritchi, making
                her triumphant return to our news
                desk for the answer.
      
      Brad turns. The camera pans over to Roxanne who we now see
      has been sitting beside him.
      
                          ROXANNE
                What is a hero? Well, there are
                many different kinds. There are
                those who hear a call, like the
                policeman or doctor, then there's
                the kind the public creates in
                their search for meaning and hope.
                Then, there are those who have the
                courage to change.
      
      DARK ALLEY - NIGHT
      
      A woman is being chased by two large thugs. They're gaining
      on her.
      
      She comes to a brick wall - a dead end.
      
      The thugs laugh.
      
                          THUG #1
                Hey, gimme that purse?
                                                             119.
      
      
      
                          MASTER MIND (O.S)
                I don't think it would go with your
                outfit.
      
      The thugs turn around to see Master Mind, standing with his
      arms folded across his chest.
      
                          THUG #2
                It's Master Mind!
      
      Thug #1 draws a knife.
      
                          THUG #1
                So? It's not like he has any
                superpowers.
      
      Thug #1 puts his fingers to his mouth and whistles.
      
      Suddenly two more Thugs appear behind Master Mind.
      
                           MASTER MIND
                I'm gonna give you a chance to
                surrender.
      
                          THUG #1
                Four against one. For a Master
                Mind, you're really bad at math.
      
      Master Mind throws a hand signal up in the air.
      
      Suddenly a giant robotic foot crashes down on the two men
      behind him.
      
      Thug #1 and Thug #2 drop their knives and raise their hands
      in the air.
      
      Master Mind looks up and waves.
      
                          MASTER MIND
                Way to take out those two goons,
                guys!
      
      We see Da Vinci and Plato at the wheel of a gigantic robot.
      
                          DA VINCI
                What two goons?
      
      The giant robot lifts its foot to check the bottom of it's
      sole. It KNOCKS OVER WATER TOWER in the process.
      
      The woman looks at Master Mind, horrified.
                                            120.
      
      
      
                          MASTER MIND
                    (apologetically)
                Sorry, we're new at this.

EXT. ROAD -- TEXAS/MEXICO BORDER -- NIGHT

A million stars wink in the night desert sky. Down here on earth, an
insect, one of those big, beautiful, multicolored four-winged jobs, glides
effortlessly on the breeze, wafting along through the crisp Texas air.

The insect dips, it banks, it does loop-the-loops -- and then SPLATS
unceremoniously against the windshield of a white van that's tearing down
the road.

INT. VAN -- TEXAS/MEXICO BORDER -- NIGHT

The DRIVER of the van, a fifty-year-old American, turns on the wipers,
smearing the remains all over.

				DRIVER
		Goddamn bugs.

He squirts some wiper fluid onto the glass, which clears it up a bit, but
now he sees something worse up ahead. It's a grouping of headlights, eight
of them, all pointed at him, sealing off the road.

He bites his lip and calls over his shoulder, to the back of the van. He
speaks in Spanish, which is subtitled.

				DRIVER (CONT'D)
		Deja me hablar.
			(Let me do the talking.)

EXT. ROAD -- TEXAS/MEXICO BORDER -- NIGHT

The van slows to a stop in front of the parked cars, all government-issue
four doors with "INS" stenciled on the sides. Seven or eight INS AGENTS
stand in front of the cars imposingly. Their apparent leader steps forward
and comes to the window.

The DRIVER rolls it down. AGENT JANUS, blonde-haired, blue-eyed, also
government issue, looks at him and sighs.

				AGENT JANUS
		Well. Nick the Dick. What a surprise. Where
		you comin' from?

				DRIVER
		I was fishing in Cuernavaca.

				AGENT JANUS
		Sure you were. What do you say we have a
		look at your catch?

AT THE BACK OF THE VAN,

the Agents fling open the rear doors, revealing a DOZEN FRIGHTENED
MEXICANS, hopeful immigrants without official permission. Agent Janus
looks at the Driver, who's now held by two other Agents, and shakes his
head.

				AGENT JANUS
		Me, I woulda thrown 'em back.
			(to the passengers, in Spanish)
		Vamanos. Fuera. Hagan una lina!
			(Let's go. Out. Form a line!)

They pile out of the van. Some are parents with small children.

				AGENT JANUS (CONT'D)
		What do you get, Nick? Hundred bucks a
		head?  Two hundred? I hope you saved it all
		for your lawyer, pal, 'cause you're gonna
		need --

He stops in the middle of his sentence, as another car is approaching,
fast, its engine WHINING as it barrels down the road toward them. Several
Agents pull their weapons.

The new car pulls a hard right, goes off the road, spins around the INS
cars, and SQUEALS to a sideways halt, silhouetted in front of their
headlights. It's a boxy, black 1986 Ford LTD.

TWO MEN get out, dressed in plain black suits, crisp white shirts, simple
black ties, shiny black shoes. KAY, fiftyish, is the apotheosis of
world-weary; his partner, DEE, mid-sixties, is just weary. They approach
the INS agents.

				KAY
		We'll take it from here.

				AGENT JANUS
		Who the hell are you?

Kay and Dee flash some form of ID.

				KAY
		INS Division 6.

				AGENT JANUS
		Division 6? I never heard of Division 6.

				KAY
		Really?

Kay and Dee move past him and approach the row of nervous immigrants.

				KAY (CONT'D)
		What're we thinking, Dee?

				DEE
		Tough call, Kay.

He walks down the row, studying the faces, greeting each one cheerily in
Spanish.

				KAY
		!Oye! Que pasa, coma estas? Hey!
			(What's up, how are you?)
		No se preocupe, abuela. Bienvenida a los
		Estados Unidos.
			(Don't worry grandma.
			Welcome to the United
			States.)
				(next)
		A donde vas? San Antonio? Buscando trabajo,
		no? Buena suerta.
			(Where are you going? San
			Antonio?  Looking for
			work, aren't you?  Good
			luck.)
				(next)
		Es un placer verle aqui.
			(It's a pleasure seeing
			you here.)

One by one, their faces relax, reassured by Kay's calm demeanor. When he
reaches the fifth Guy, he keeps the same cheery tone, but:

				KAY (CONT'D)
		Que dices si te rompo la cara?
			(What do you say if I
			break your face?)

The Guy smiles and nods. Kay stops. His own smile broadens and he drops a
hand on the Guy's shoulder.

				KAY (CONT'D)
		No hablas ni una palabra del Espanol,
		verdad, amigo?
			(You don't speak a word
			of Spanish, right, friend?)

Again, the Guy smiles and nods. Kay looks back at Dee.

				KAY (CONT'D)
		We got a winner.
			(to the others)
		Los restos estan libres a irse. Largense!
			(The rest of you are free
			to go. Scram!)

				AGENT JANUS
		Sir!

				KAY
		Tomen el camion, y vayeuse.
			(Get on the road and go.)

				AGENT JANUS
		Sir, you can't just --

				KAY
		Don't "Sir" me! You have no idea who you're
		dealing with!

Silence on the road. The Driver grins, jumps back in the front seat of the
van. The others pile into the rear and they tear out of there.

				KAY (CONT'D)
			(to Janus)
		We're gonna have a little chat with our
		friend here. You boys can hit the road ...
		and keep on protecting us from dangerous
		aliens.

Kay and Dee escort their captive across the road and over a small rise,
leaving the stunned INS agents standing alone in the roadway.

				AGENT JANUS
		You ever heard of Division 6?

				2ND INS AGENT
		There is no Division 6.

				3RD INS AGENT
		Who are those guys?

EXT. DESERT CLEARING - NIGHT

Kay and Dee lead their captive into a clearing in the desert brush. Dee
pulls an enormous handgun from a shoulder holster and stays a pace or two
off, covering him. Kay has an arm draped around the man's shoulders.

				KAY
		I think you jumped off the bus in the wrong
		part of town, amigo. In fact, I'll bet
		dollars to pesos that you're not --

He pulls out a small laser device, which he ZIPS neatly down the front of
the man's clothes.

				KAY (CONT'D)
		-- from anywhere near here.

The man's clothes fall to the ground, revealing what he really is
underneath -- A SCALY SPACE BASTARD, about four-and-a-half feet tall, with
a snouth, snail-like tentacles, and independently moving eyes on stalks at
the top of his head.

The only part of his camouflage not crumpled to the ground is the
humanesque "head," which he still lamely holds in one of his hands. It's
propped up by a stick, like a puppet, and it continues to make expressions
as he holds it.

				KAY (CONT'D)
		Mikey?! When did they let you out of jail?

MIKEY replies -- an unfathomable combination of GRUNTS, SQUEAKS, and
saliva.

				KAY (CONT'D)
		Political refugee. Right.

				DEE
		You know how many treaty articles you've
		just violated?

Mikey makes a lame SQUEAK.

				KAY
		One, my ass. Try seven.

				DEE
		From unauthorized immigration to failure to
		properly inoculate prior to landing.

				KAY
			(off Mikey's objections)
		Okay, that's enough. Hand me your head and
		put up your arms.

From behind Mikey, they hear a terrified GASP.

Kay and Dee both look over quickly. One of the alien's eyes, on a tall
stalk, whips around too. All three of them see AGENT JANUS, standing just
over the rise, staring in frozen amazement.

				KAY (CONT'D)
		Ah, shit.

Agent Janus SCREAMS. Mikey rips free of the rest of the "Mexican"
disguise, knocks Dee out of the way, and takes off straight at Janus,
SCREECHING a horrible Space Bastard screech. Janus freezes, terrified.

				KAY (CONT'D)
		Dee! Shoot him!

Dee struggles to roll over and change the controls on his gun, which fell
out of his hand as he hit the ground.

				KAY (CONT'D)
		Dee, for Christ's --

Mikey keeps moving, covering the last few yards to Janus quickly. He steps
on a rock, launches himself into the air, his dripping jaws cranked wide
open --

-- there is a SIZZLING sound, a brilliant white flash --

-- and Mikey ERUPTS in a geyser of blue goo that splatters all over the
ground, the trees, and Agent Janus' face. Behind where Mikey was, Kay
stands, smoking weapon in hand.

EXT. ROAD -- TEXAS/MEXICO BORDER -- NIGHT

On the road, the INS AGENTS pull their guns and run toward the rise.

EXT. DESERT CLEARING -- NIGHT

Kay has an arm around Janus, whom he is leading further into the clearing.
Janus is white, shaking, eyes like silver dollars.

				AGENT JANUS
		Th -- th -- th --

				KAY
			(helping)
		"That."

				AGENT JANUS
		That wasn't -- wasn't -- wasn't --

				KAY
		Human, I know. Oops. Got some entrails on
		you.

He takes out a handkerchief and wipes off the Agent's face. As he does,
Janus looks back to where Mikey blew up. Then at Kay. And then up at the
stars.

The other INS Agents burst over the rise, SHOUTING questions.

				KAY
		Okay, everybody, situation's under control,
		calm down. If you'll just give me your
		attention for a moment I'll tell you what
		happened.

From over the rise, car engines WHINE in the distance and headlights start
to flash around them. Kay reaches into his pocket and pulls out a tubular
metallic device the size of a pocket recorder. He checks his watch,
figures in his head, then dials an electronic counter on the side of the
device up to "08."

				KAY (CONT'D)
		This is called a "neuralyzer." A gift from
		some friends from out of town. The red eye
		here isolates and measures the electronic
		impulses in your brain. More specifically,
		the ones for memory.

Behind him, six more MEN IN BLACK, all wearing black suits and sunglasses,
come over the hill. Kay barks a few orders to them.

				KAY (CONT'D)
		Gimme a splay burn on the perimeter, please;
		holes at 40, 60, and 80.

				2ND INS AGENT
		What in the hell is going on?!

				KAY
		Exactly the right question. And the answer
		lies right -- here. Pay attention.

				JANUS
		Who are you, really?

				KAY
		Really? I'm just a figment of your
		imagination.

He holds up the neuralyzer. The Agents peer closely at it.  Kay reaches
into his pocket, puts on his own black sunglasses --

-- and pushes a button on the side of the neuralyzer.  A BLINDING FLASH a
tenth of a second long sears the Agents' eyeballs. They stare blankly.

				KAY (CONT'D)
		God, we're a gullible breed.

Behind him, TONGUES OF FIRE blast from a flame thrower held by one of the
Men in Black. Kay looks back at the INS Agents, who are just coming
around, as if awakening from a concussion.

				KAY (CONT'D)
		I mean it, fellas, you are lucky to be
		alive after a blast like that.

The Agents look around, confused.

				AGENT JANUS
		What -- blast?

Kay gestures behind him, where the Men in Black are now using fire
extinguishers to douse the flames they themselves started.

				KAY
		Underground gas vein, genius. You guys need
		to exercise more caution before discharging
		your firearms.

He jabs a finger into Janus' chest.

				KAY (CONT'D)
		Especially you.

Dee has moved away from them all and is sitting on a rock, staring up at
the night sky, his sunglasses dangling idly from one hand. Kay steps away
from the group and finds him. He sits down next to him.

				DEE
		I'm sorry. About...back there.

				KAY
		Happens.

				DEE
		Didn't used to.

He holds up his hands, which tremble with age.

				DEE (CONT'D)
		The spirit's willing, Kay, but the rest of
		me...

He looks up, at the million stars shining overhead.

				DEE (CONT'D)
		They're beautiful, aren't they?

				KAY
		What?

				DEE
		The stars. We never just -- look. Anymore.
			(back to Kay)
		I'll tell ya, Kay. I will miss the chase.

Kay pulls his neuralyzer from his pocket and looks down at it.

				KAY
		No. You won't.

EXT. GRAND CENTRAL STATION -- SOUTHERN EXPOSURE -- NIGHT

A shot of the clock on the Station's stately southern exposure. WE PAN
DOWN TO...

A pair of feet running. They belong to a man we will know as the
PERPETRATOR. As we track with him, he SPEEDS UP and OUT OF FRAME.

A new set of feet come into frame. These belong to JAMES EDWARDS, a NYC
COP in undercover street clothes. In the BACKGROUND, about ten feet
behind, are two other cops, trying to keep up.

Edwards is a lot faster, though. He pulls out his badge that hangs from a
chain under his shirt.

				EDWARDS
		Stop! NYPD!

He continues running, out of frame, and we stay on one of the other COPS,
overweight, who gives up the chase and drops to his knees, heaving air.

				COP
		All yours, Edwards!

The Cop fumbles in his pocket for a pack of cigarettes.

TRACK WITH EDWARDS AND THE PERP

As they run down the bridge that traverses Park Avenue in the low Forties.
The Perp veers to the left and, seemingly oblivious to the fact that it's
a thirty-foot drop, he hurdles the guard rail, and drops to Forty-first
Street below.

EDWARDS is surprised by this maneuver, but doesn't waste a second. He,
too, hurdles the guard rail and lands on...

EXT. 41ST STREET AND PARK AVENUE - NIGHT

A DOUBLE-DECKER BUS, one of those cheesy sightseers that hold up midtown
traffic. The bus, of course, is completely filled with JAPANESE TOURISTS,
and it seems like every single one of them has a video camera.

EDWARDS pushes through the crowd...

				EDWARDS
		Grand Central Station off to your left,
		folks...

With the bus still moving, he scrambles down the circular stairs and runs
out through the side door.

He spots the Perp, sailing east on Forty-first Street.

				EDWARDS
		Dammit, man, you're making me sweat up my
		gear!

Edwards spots one of those New York Post delivery trucks, the kind with
the open back door, rumbling by.  He runs and jumps into the back.

EXT. FIFTH AVENUE -- NIGHT

THE PERP, meanwhile, is running at top speed, when Edwards glides into
frame, leaning off the back of the truck.

				EDWARDS
		Yo, man, your luck just ran out.

He leaps from the back of the moving truck and tackles the Perp.

The Perp, now straddled by Edwards, is terrified.

				PERP
		He's coming! He's coming!

				EDWARDS
		And when he gets here, I'll kick his ass
		too.

Edwards is about to slap the cuffs on him, when the Perp blinks. Nothing
unusual about that, but then another set of translucent, milky white
eyelids, underneath his regular eyelids, blinks also.

Edwards is thrown for a moment, which is all the time the Perp needs to
pull out...

His WEAPON, which is the strangest looking gun you've ever seen. Reacting
quickly, Edwards bats it out of the Perp's hand.

THE WEAPON smashes into the stone wall surrounding Central Park and
SHATTERS into a million pieces.

				EDWARDS
		What the...

WHOMP! The Perp kicks him in the nuts, then scrambles to his feet and
takes off again. Edwards staggers after him, in pain.

The Perp leaps over a moving car, towards the GUGGENHEIM MUSEUM. Edwards
tries to follow, but a bus pulls in front of him. After it passes, the
Perp is gone.

EXT. GUGGENHEIM MUSEUM -- NIGHT

Edwards runs over to the Museum, leans over the wall that surrounds it,
and in the next instant...

The Perp flies past him, having leapt from twenty feet down to the top of
the Guggenheim. He scrambles up and over the ledge.

Edward reacts. He runs to the front door of the Museum, shoots it open and
runs inside.

He runs from the rotunda up the grand ramp of the Guggenheim.

EXT. GUGGENHEIM MUSEUM -- ROOF -- NIGHT

On the roof, the PERP reaches the top, climbs over the edge, and CRUNCHES
to the gravel surface. He leaps to his feet and races over to a door. It's
locked.

He tugs on another. It's locked too. He pulls on a third. It swings open --

-- revealing EDWARDS on the other side, breathing hard. He aims his weapon
at the Perp.

				EDWARDS
		Wassup?

The Perp SCREAMS inhumanly and panics. He backpedals, toward the edge of
the roof.

				PERP
		He's coming! He's coming because I failed,
		and now he'll kill me too!

				EDWARDS
		Stop!

				PERP
		You don't understand. Your world is gonna
		end.

But the Perp has backed right into the edge of the roof, and now he starts
to fall over. The Perp blinks.

				EDWARDS
		What are you?!

The Perp looks down. He decides.

-- and he falls, SCREAMING, to his death.

								CUT TO:

INT. INTERROGATION ROOM -- NIGHT

EDWARDS sits on one side of the table, a POLICE INSPECTOR and a UNIFORMED
SERGEANT (the one who gave up the chase and lit a cigarette earlier), sit
across from him.

				INSPECTOR
		Perpetrator then blinked two sets of
		eyelids. You mean blinked with both eyes?

				EDWARDS
		No, sir. He blinked once with one set, then
		again with another completely different set.

				SERGEANT
		Sort of a low beam, high beam.

				INSPECTOR
		Was that before or after he drew the weapon
		which you claim evaporated into a million
		pieces?

				EDWARDS
		After, sir.

				INSPECTOR
		And why do you suppose none of the other
		officers saw either of these two events?

				EDWARDS
		'Cause some of the other officers are a
		little soggy in the midsection. And they
		couldn't keep up, sir.

				SERGEANT
		Hey, Edwards, if you were half the man I
		am --

				EDWARDS
		What do you mean? I am half the man you are.

				SERGEANT
		What the hell is your problem?

				EDWARDS
		My problem is you being all up in my damn
		face all the time.

				SERGEANT
		I think he threw him off the roof. Ten
		minutes -- your best shot.

				INSPECTOR
			(cutting off the Sergeant)
		Sergeant. I want to talk to you outside.
		Now.

				EDWARDS
		You need ten minutes on a Stairmaster, you
		pudgy bastard.

INT. INTERROGATION ROOM -- LATER -- NIGHT

A woman sneaks into the room. DOCTOR LAUREL WEAVER, thirtyish,
dark-haired, dark-eyed, general aura of darkness around her, stands above
him. Laurel looks like she was just dragged out of bed (which she was) and
saw a spaceman (which she did).  She looks over her shoulder once, then
whispers to him.

				LAUREL
		Laurel Weaver. Deputy Medical Examiner. I
		believe you. I opened him up. Find me at
		the morgue. On 26th. I'll tell you what I
		found.

				EDWARDS
		Hey...Wait a minute. Wait a minute.

				LAUREL
			(turning at the door)
		You have really pretty eyes.

She hurries to turn the corner, but is STOPPED by someone who remains just
offscreen.

				VOICE (O.S.)
		Dr. Weaver, from the coroner's office?
		Working on the John Doe?

Edwards twists in his chair, to get a better look. All he sees is Laurel,
facing whoever it is in the hallway.

				LAUREL
		Yes. That's right.

				VOICE (O.S.)
		Would you look right here, please.

The Someone says something else and Laurel steps forward, now also out of
Edwards's line of vision.

				LAUREL (O.S.)
		Look where?

Edwards stretches even further in his seat, when there is a blinding FLASH
from the corridor. Really curious now, he starts to get up --

-- when KAY steps into the room and closes the door behind him. Edwards
rolls his eyes.

				KAY
		Some night, huh?

				EDWARDS
		Oh, yeah, some night.

He crosses to the door.

				KAY
		They were gills.

Edwards stops.

				KAY
		Not eyelids.

				EDWARDS
		Who are you?

				KAY
		Did he say anything to you?

				EDWARDS
			(scoffing)
		Yeah, sure. He said the world was coming to
		an end.

				KAY
		Did he say when?

				EDWARDS
		You're kidding, right?

				KAY
		Would you recognize his weapon if you saw
		it again?

				EDWARDS
		Absolutely.

				KAY
		Let's take a ride.

				EDWARDS
		Wait a minute. I got a ton of paperwork.

				KAY
		It's all done.

At that point, the INSPECTOR sticks his head in, smiles and gives Edwards
the thumbs up.

				INSPECTOR
		Good work, Edwards.

Edwards looks at the Inspector, then at Kay. As they leave.

				KAY
		You ran that guy down on foot? That's tough.
		That's double tough.

								CUT TO:

INT. FORD LTD - A MOMENT LATER - DRIVING

In a plain, boxy Ford, Kay drives, silent. He raises his hand and nods to
a black MIB truck coming in the opposite direction.Edwards, in the
passenger seat, is still in his undercover outfit.

				EDWARDS
		So who you with?

Kay says nothing.

				EDWARDS (CONT'D)
		You got the plain clothes, the
		government-issued wheels. Secret Service?
		CIA?

Kay remains utterly silent.

				EDWARDS (CONT'D)
			(referring to the car)
		Yeah, well, whoever it is, you're short on
		funding.

				KAY
		Nothing is what it seems, kid.

				EDWARDS
		Oh, yeah, my bad '86 Ford LTD. That's a
		luxury ride. C'mon, who ya with?

Kay pulls the car to a stop.

				KAY
		I'm part of a secret organization that
		monitors and polices alien activity on earth.

Kay opens the door and gets out of the car. Edwards follows.

EXT. PAWN SHOP - NIGHT

Edwards looks around. Sees they're standing in front of a PAWN SHOP.

				EDWARDS
		This is where we're going?

They get out of the car.

				EDWARDS (CONT'D)
		Jack Jeebs? Guy buys from chain snatchers.
		Doesn't even sell guns.

				KAY
		Really?

				EDWARDS
		All right, you think it's worth shaking him
		up, fine. I'll do my thing. Then I want some
		answers.

				KAY
		Do your "thing," kid.  Edwards goes inside.

INT. PAWN SHOP - NIGHT

JACK JEEBS is the sleazy, sarcastic proprietor of the Pawn Shop. He's not
easily intimidated.

				JEEBS
		Officer Edwards. Oh, hey, geez, how'd these
		get here? I thought I turned 'em in to the
		proper authorities.

He casually brushes some Rolexes off the counter.

				EDWARDS
		Way I hear it, Jeebs, you into something a
		little hotter than some stolen Rolexes.

				JEEBS
		Sure -- I'm a big crack dealer now. I just
		work here because I love the hours.

This pisses Edwards off. He grabs Jeebs by the collar.

				EDWARDS
			(getting angry)
		I'm talking about guns, Jeebs. High-tech
		stuff.

				JEEBS
		C'mon, Edwards, whatcha see is what I got.

				KAY (O.S.)
		Why don't you show him the imports, Jeebs.

At the sound of Kay's voice, Jeebs suddenly pales, a look of fear coming
over his face.

				JEEBS
		H-hiya Kay, how are you?

				KAY
		The imports, Jeebs. Now.

				JEEBS
		You know I got outta that business a long
		time ago, Kay.

				KAY
		Why do you lie to me? I hate it when you
		lie.

He pulls his own gun and aims it at Jeebs' forehead.

				JEEBS
		Whoa, whoa, Kay, hold on a minute here...

				KAY
		I'm going to count to three.

Edwards, seeing that Kay is getting somewhere, joins in the routine.

				EDWARDS
		He'll do it, Jeebs.

				KAY
		One.

				EDWARDS
		I've seen him do it.

				KAY
		Two.

				EDWARDS
		Talk to me, Jeebs, he's crazy when he's
		like this.

				JEEBS
		He's always crazy.
			(to Kay)
		Take a cruise. Get a massage --

				KAY
		Three.

KA-BOOM! Kay blows Jeebs' head off and Jeebs' body collapses to the floor.
Edwards is shocked.

Edwards pulls his own weapon and points it at Kay's head.

				EDWARDS
		Put down the gun and put your hands on the
		counter!

				KAY
		I warned him.

				EDWARDS
		Drop the weapon!

				KAY
		You warned him.

				EDWARDS
		You are under arrest. You have the right to
		remain silent.

				KAY
		Will you relax?

				JEEBS (O.S.)
			(irritated)
		Don't do that.

Edwards whirls around to see Jeebs' BODY, growing another head. Only takes
four or five seconds. Kay calmly shoves his gun up against Jeebs'
baby-soft new cheek.

				JEEBS (CONT'D)
		Do you know how much that hurts?

				KAY
		Show us what you got, Jeebs. Or I'll use up
		another one.

Jeebs, panicked, hits a button on the underside of the counter, which
promptly flips over, revealing yet another dusty shelf, piled high with
junk --

-- but this is all alien junk. Weapons, mostly, bizarre, otherworldly
weapons of all shapes and sizes.

				KAY
		Edwards?

Edwards, still dazed by Jeebs' regrown head, glances down at all the
weapons.

				EDWARDS
		Uh, this. This is what I saw.

Kay looks at Jeebs, pissed off.

				KAY
		You sold a carbonizer with implosion capacity
		to an unlicensed cephlapoid.

				JEEBS
		He looked all right to me.

				KAY
		A carbonizer is an assassin's weapon, Jeebs.
		Who was the target?

				JEEBS
		I don't know.

Kay raises the weapon again, threatening.

				KAY
		Jeebs!

				JEEBS
		I don't know!

Kay lowers his gun, gestures to the shelf full of weapons.

				KAY
		This is all confiscated. All of it. I want
		you on the next transport off this rock. Or
		I'll shoot you where it doesn't grow back.

Jeebs nods, point taken. Kay leaves.

				EDWARDS
		Yeah. I'll be by tomorrow for those Rolexes.

Shaken, Edwards follows.

EXT. PAWN SHOP -- NIGHT

Edwards staggers out of the shop, trying to get the day's events straight
in his head.

				EDWARDS
		The eyelids, fine ... and the jumping thing
		... and the gun ... okay, but the head?

				KAY
		Searching for a handle on the moment here?
		A place to file all this.

				EDWARDS
		See a head doesn't do that, it doesn't just
		grow back.
			(looking up)
		What's going on?

				KAY
		Can't help you, kid. Only comfort I can
		offer is that tomorrow, you won't remember
		a thing.

				EDWARDS
		Oh, no. This I'm gonna remember for a long,
		long time.

Kay pulls the neuralyzer from his pocket. He hesitates for the briefest of
moments -- as if this particular neuralyzation is different than all the
others.

Then he puts on his sunglasses.

				KAY
		Ever see one of these?

								CUT TO:

INT. CHINESE RESTAURANT - NIGHT

-- the flash dims on EDWARDS and KAY, sitting at a table in a Chinese
restaurant.

				KAY
			(finishing a joke)
		-- and the wife says yeah, Harry, I know,
		but this one's eating my popcorn!

He busts out laughing. Edwards, across from him, is completely
disoriented. He looks down. There's a half-eaten order of broccoli beef
and several empty bottles of beer on the table in front of him.

				EDWARDS
		Huh?

Kay checks his watch.

				KAY
		Whoops. Gotta run. Thanks for the egg rolls.

				EDWARDS
		Where am I?

				KAY
		See what I mean about tequila? You're a
		bright young man, James. Just lay off the
		sauce. I'll see you tomorrow, nine a.m.
		sharp.

He turns and walks out. Edwards checks his watch. A WAITRESS appears.

				WAITRESS
		Another beer?

				EDWARDS
		Coffee. Please.

She walks off. Edwards looks at the table. There is a business card lying
next to his plate, on which Kay has handwritten "James D. Edwards,
Saturday, 9 a.m., 504 Battery Drive."

Edwards looks at it, puzzled. He turns the card over and looks at the
other side. There's not much there, no name, no phone or fax number, no
e-mail address. Just three little letters, dead in the middle of the card:

				MIB

								CUT TO:

EXT. FARMHOUSE - NIGHT

A lonely farmhouse stands amid the fields of upstate New York farm
country. Several lights are on and through a window we can see the
silhouette of a MAN sitting at the kitchen table, the silhouette of a
WOMAN hovering over him, bringing things to him.

The Man (EDGAR) waves his arms, ranting.

				EDGAR (O.S.)
		I go out, I work my butt off to make a
		living, all I want is to come home to a
		nice clean house with a nice fat steak on
		the table, but instead I get this -- this
		-- I don't even know what you call this!

In the sky above, it's one of those brilliant star fields. But something
strange is happening with one of those stars -- it's getting bigger.

				EDGAR (O.S.)
		I'll tell you what it looks like, it looks
		like poison. Don't you take that away, I'm
		eating that, damn it! It is poison, isn't
		it?!

No, that star isn't getting bigger, it's moving. Toward us. Fast. It goes
from a pinpoint to a dime, to a nickel, to a quarter, and works its way
into fruit metaphors.

				EDGAR (O.S.)
		I swear to God, I would not be surprised if
		it was, the way you skulk around here like
		a dog been hit too much -- or ain't been
		hit enough, I can't make up my mind.

Okay, we're way past watermelon now, that thing is huge, and it's starting
to glow hot red as it enters the earth's atmosphere, headed straight
toward us, coming here, to Beatrice and Edgar's place.

The blazing fireball barrels through the sky, SNAPS off a couple trees --

				EDGAR (O.S.)
		You're useless, Beatrice! The only thing
		that pulls its weight around here is my
		goddamn truck!

-- and SLAMS right through a pickup truck parked in the driveway. A
concussive BLAST follows, then a geyser of smoke and flame erupts.

				EDGAR (O.S.)
		Stay here!

The silhouette of Edgar leaps to its feet, races to the door, and throws
it open. Edgar is everything his voice led us to expect -- a nasty,
bug-eyed redneck carrying a twelve-gauge shotgun. His mouth agape, he
walks across the yard and stares at the hulking shell that was his truck.
The skeleton of the truck is still there, but there's a huge, smoldering
hole in it, a hole that goes at least ten feet down into the ground.

				EDGAR
		Figures.

He walks to the truck and touches the door handle. Hot. Using his shirt
tail, he opens the door and peers down into the hole.

IN THE HOLE, he sees a smooth curve of metal and a few blinking lights.
Embedded into the ground is, indeed, a spaceship, maybe eight feet across.

BEATRICE calls from behind him, standing in the doorway fearfully.

				BEATRICE
		What is it, Edgar?!

				EDGAR
			(turns to her)
		Get your big butt back in that house!

Beatrice does as she's told, closing the door behind her. Edgar turns back
to the smoldering rock, raising his shotgun in defense. AN OTHERWORLDLY
VOICE comes from deep in the hole.

				VOICE (O.S.)
		Place projectile weapon on ground.

Edgar staggers back a step, terrified. But then he regains himself, raises
the weapon, and steps forward, pointing it menacingly down into the hole.

				EDGAR
		You can have my gun when you pry it from my
		cold, dead fingers!

There is a pause while the voice thinks about this offer. Finally, it
responds, in a voice and cadence remarkably similar to Edgar's.

				VOICE (O.S.)
		Your proposal is acceptable.

A long, hairy pincer flashes out of the hole, grabs Edgar by the head, and
pulls him down into the hole.

From deep in the hole, we hear a terrible RIPPING sound, like a bedsheet
being torn in half. There are some disgusting GUSHY sounds, then a moment
later, something flies out of the hole and FLOPS onto the ground next to
the truck.

It's Edgar. Well, sort of. His body parts still hang together -- face,
arms, legs, even clothes -- but everything inside has been removed and now
he just lies there, flat and empty, like a tuxedo on the floor after the
prom.

The shotgun flies out and lands beside him.

								CUT TO:

INT. FARMHOUSE - KITCHEN - NIGHT

BEATRICE sits at the kitchen table, terrified, still wiping away tears
from Edgar's diatribe. The door opens and EDGAR comes back into the
kitchen, seemingly fleshed out again, leaving the door hanging open behind
him. He carries the shotgun.

She looks up at him, anxious. But his face is a blank.

				BEATRICE
		What on earth was it?!

He looks at her strangely. When he speaks, his voice is different than
before. More refined.

				EDGAR
		Sugar.

Pause. She looks out the window, at the smoking truck.

				BEATRICE
		I've never seen sugar do that.

				EDGAR
		Give me sugar.

Puzzled, Beatrice gets up, goes to the cabinet, and grabs a bag of sugar.
She holds it out to him.

				EDGAR (CONT'D)
		In water.

Frightened, she takes a glass of water from the table. She dumps some of
the sugar into it.

				EDGAR (CONT'D)
		More.

She puts more, till the glass is brimming. She stirs it quickly with a
knife and hands it to him, her hand trembling.

Edgar takes it and downs it in a single gulp. Beatrice stares at Edgar, no
idea what to think. She notices something odd about the skin on his neck.

				BEATRICE
		Edgar, your skin! It's -- it's -- just
		hanging off your bones!

Edgar drops the glass and looks in a window, to catch his reflection. He
reaches up --

-- and twists his whole face, as if adjusting a ski mask, then tucks the
skin of his neck back into his shirt collar.  He looks at her.

				EDGAR
		That better?

Beatrice faints.

EXT. FARMHOUSE - NIGHT

Stillness. Silence. A loud SCRAPING sound comes from the pit left by the
spaceship.

The nose of the ship itself rises up out of the pit, wavers, keeps moving,
and finally CRUNCHES to the ground outside the pit.

EDGAR climbs out of the pit, breathing heavily. He dusts himself off and
continues pushing the ship, along the ground, off into the darkness.

								CUT TO:

EXT. MIB BUILDING - DAY

The next morning. EDWARDS, holding the small MIB business card in his
hand, compares the address written down by Kay to the address on the
utterly nondescript building in front of him. It's seven stories high,
gray, windowless, perfectly square, squatting on a bridge over a road like
a fat guy on the john.
			   "504 Battery Drive."

INT. MIB BUILDING - TUNNEL VENT ROOM - DAY

EDWARDS steps through a heavily barred metal door and into long, bizarre
room. One wall is entirely dominated by the enormous blades of a tunnel
vent air intake. There is an elevator at the far end of the room and an
OLD SECURITY GUARD, the rent-a-cop kind, reading a comic book on a folding
metal chair halfway across.

Edwards walks across the room, his footsteps ECHOING. The Guard looks up.

				GUARD
		Help you?

				EDWARDS
		Maybe, I'm not sure, see, I got this card --

				GUARD
		Elevator. Push the "call" button.

And he goes back to his comic book. Edwards, maybe out of nothing more
than curiosity at this point, walks across the room, toward the elevator.
As he draws close, the elevator doors WHOOSH open, expecting him.

INT. MIB BUILDING - ENTRANCE ELEVATOR - DAY

Edwards steps inside and turns around. The doors close. He pushes the
"call" button and waits, but the elevator doesn't move. Instead, doors on
the other side of the elevator slide open silently behind him. Edwards
waits, unaware.

From behind him, somebody clears their throat. Edwards turns around, and
finds himself standing in --

INT. MIB BUILDING - INTERVIEW ROOM - DAY

This back room is every bit as mysterious and unfamiliar as the entryway.
Standing at the front of the room is ZED, a wire-haired career G-man, an
old school bureaucrat, wearing the exact same kind of suit Kay had on last
night. SIX OTHER HOT RECRUITS sit in egg-shaped chairs, staring at
Edwards.

One chair is empty.

				ZED
		You're late. Sit down.

Edwards takes the remaining chair. The elevator doors slide shut. Zed
continues addressing the Recruits.

				ZED (CONT'D)
		My name is Zed. You're all here because
		you're the best of the best. Marines, Navy
		SEALS, Army Rangers...NYPD.

They all turn and regard Edwards a little smugly. He gives it back.

				ZED (CONT'D)
		And we're looking for one of you. Just one.
		What will follow is a series of simple
		tests designed to quantify motor skills,
		hand-eye coordination, concentration,
		stamina -- I see we have a question.

Edwards's hand is, indeed, up.

				EDWARDS
		Why, uh -- I'm sorry, it's just no one
		really asked this, but -- why, exactly, are
		we doing this?

Silence. Then one of the young recruits eagerly raises his hand. Zed calls
on him.

				ZED
		Son?

				AMBITIOUS RECRUIT
			(loud and formal)
		Jake Jensen, West Point, graduate with
		honors. We're here because you're looking
		for the best of the best of the best, sir!

Edwards tries to stifle a laugh, but can't.

				ZED
		What's so funny, Edwards?

				EDWARDS
		I -- I don't know, sir. This guy. "Best of
		the best of the best of the best of the --"
			(realizing nobody is with
			him on this)
		It just struck me as --
			(totally serious)
		Humorous. Sir.

Short pause. Then Zed continues.

				ZED
		Okay. Let's get going.

INT. MIB BUILDING - INTERVIEW ROOM - LATER - DAY

The recruits scribble away at the written test. It's a thick document --
reasoning skills, general knowledge, diagrams.  The RECRUITS seem to be
really powering through it, filling in answer after answer.

But no desks have been provided for them, and they're all still in their
chairs, writing uncomfortably on their thighs or knees.

EDWARDS is really struggling. He writes two words on one answer, then
decides to erase it. The lack of a writing surface is driving him crazy;
his pencil even TEARS through the page.

He looks up. In the middle of the tile floor, there is an unused table.
Edwards gets up, goes to it, grabs hold --

-- and drags it, SCREECHING DEAFENINGLY, back to his chair. Everybody
looks up, wincing at the horrible sound that fills the room.

Edwards sits back down, now writing on the table.  That's better.

Zed raises an eyebrow. He stares at Edwards, then looks up, toward a
smoked glass window. Behind the dark glass, a FIGURE stands, staring,
unemotional.

								CUT TO:

INT. MIB BUILDING -- SHOOTING GALLERY -- DAY

SEVEN WEAPONS rest on a table in the middle of an otherwise empty,
triangular room. The SEVEN RECRUITS stand in front of the table.

There's an odd moment -- where everyone sort of looks around: at each
other, at the blank walls...

				EDWARDS
		Anyone, uh...any of you guys know what we're
		doing here?

				MARINE
			(clipped, unquestioning)
		Looking for the best of the best of the best.

				EDWARDS
			(can't help but smile)
		Well, yeah, I know, but...

And then .. suddenly --

The two far walls pull apart. The whole room pulsates and the air is
suddenly filled with a bewildering swirl of stroboscopic images, both
human and alien. Everywhere is color, light and movement -- a holographic
mass of strange shapes and characters moving simultaneously.

The Recruits lunge for the weapons, snapping them up and taking aim. SIX
SHOTS are fired at once. And then, a second later, a SEVENTH SHOT is
fired. Everyone sort of looks at Edwards, who puts his gun down last.

There's an awkward silence. Then the door opens. Light pours in, and ZED
with it. Even the highly competitive cadets can't help but feel some
sympathy as Zed walks straight to Edwards.

				ZED
		The hell happened?

				EDWARDS
		Hesitated, sir.

Zed looks into the gallery. Most obvious in the frozen tableau of
creatures is a lunging, snarling beast, which has three bullet holes in
its chest. Next to it is a massively deformed humanoid creature with a
large hook for a head, which also has three holes in it. In the back
corner of the gallery, there is a single bullet hole in a pretty
eight-year-old girl.

				ZED
		May I ask why you felt little Tiffany
		deserved to die?

				EDWARDS
		She was the only one who actually seemed
		dangerous. At the time.

				ZED
		And how did you come to that conclusion?

				EDWARDS
		Hook-head guy. You explain to me how he can
		think with a hook for a head. Answer; it's
		not his head. His head is that butt-ugly
		bean-bag thing over there. 'Cause if you
		look at the snarling beast-guy, he's not
		snarling, he's sneezing -- he's got tissues
		in his hand. No threat there, and anyhow,
		the girl's books were way too advanced for
		an eight-year-old's. And besides, from
		where I'm looking, she was the only one who
		appeared to have a motive. And I don't
		appreciate your jumping down my throat about
		it.

Sideways glances from the other recruits. Zed sighs.

				EDWARDS (CONT'D)
		Or, uh -- do I owe her an apology?

								CUT TO:

INT. MIB BUILDING - OBSERVATION ROOM/INTERVIEW ROOM - DAY

ZED and KAY stand behind smoked glass, staring at the RECRUITS, who are
still in the shooting gallery, waiting for a decision.

				ZED
		He's got a real problem with authority.

				KAY
		So do I. The guy ran down a cephlapoid, Zed.
		On foot. Tenacity. That I can use.

				ZED
		I hope you know what you're doing.

Zed turns and walks away. Kay stares through the glass, at EDWARDS, who
stands alone on one side of the room, apart from the rest of the group.

Zed reappears on the other side of the glass, coming through a door and
into the shooting gallery. As he talks, Kay turns and walks off.

				ZED (CONT'D)
		Congratulations, you're everything we've
		come to expect from years of government
		training. Now, if you'll just follow me, we
		have one more test to administer, an eye
		exam.

INT. MIB BUILDING - HALLWAY - DAY

The RECRUITS follow ZED out of the shooting gallery and into a long
hallway. Zed motions them off to the left. EDWARDS is the last one out of
the room, but he stops as he steps into the hallway.

KAY is outside the door, waiting for him. Edwards recognizes him from last
night.

				EDWARDS
		You! Hey, what's goin' on?

The other recruits continue down the hall with Zed. Kay doesn't answer,
just gestures to Edwards to follow him down the hall, which he does.

				KAY
		Back in the mid-fifties, the government
		started a little underfunded agency with
		the simple and laughable purpose of making
		contact with a race not of this planet.

As they pass an alcove, Edwards notices the six other Recruits, who have
been herded into a corner. Zed, addressing them, pulls a neuralyzer from
his pocket.

				ZED
		Now, if you'll look directly at the end of
		this device.

He holds a neuralyzer up in front of them, and the Recruits stare
obediently at it as Zed slips on a pair of black sunglasses.

Edwards stares, fascinated, but Kay's hand reaches in and yanks him away,
just as Zed's neuralyzer FLASHES WHITE.

INT. MIB BUILDING - HALLWAY - DAY

As KAY leads EDWARDS down an impossibly long corridor, he hands him a file
folder stuffed thick with eight by ten photographs.

He hands Jay the first picture, a shot of eight or nine MEN in plain black
suits standing around a fifties-style office with metal desks and
fluorescent lights. DEE and ZED are there, much younger.

				KAY
		Everybody thought the agency was a joke.
		Except the aliens. They made contact on
		March 2nd, 1961, outside New  York City.

Another photograph, a grainy black and white image of two ships hovering
in the night sky -- classic flying saucer shapes.

				KAY (CONT'D)
		There were nine of us that night. Seven
		agents. An amateur astronomer. And one poor
		kid who got lost on the wrong back road.

Yet another photograph, this one showing a young KAY, in a shirt and tie,
holding a bouquet of flowers, staring at the open door of the landed
flying saucer. ALIEN SHAPES are visible within.

				EDWARDS
		You brought the aliens flowers?

Kay steers Edwards to the right, down another corridor, just as long as
the first.

				KAY
		They were intergalactic refugees with a
		simple request. Let us use the earth as an
		apolitical zone for people without a
		planet.  Ever see "Casablanca?" Same thing,
		no Nazis.  We agreed. So we masked all
		evidence of their landing.

Another picture, this one of the 1964 World's Fair grounds, still under
construction. Giant models of rockets mark the Fair's theme of space
travel; most prominent in the construction are two tall towers, with the
flying saucers now mounted at the top of each.

				EDWARDS
		The 1964 World's Fair was a coverup?

				KAY
		Why else would we hold it in Queens?
			(another hallway)
		Now left. More nonhumans arrive every year.
		They live among us, in secret.

				EDWARDS
		I see. Not to change the subject, but when
		was your last cat-scan?

				KAY
		Every six months; it's company policy.

				EDWARDS
		Well, thanks for the very amusing morning,
		but I'm hopin' you'll show me where I came
		in?  'Cause this is where I go out.

They have stopped next to an unmarked door. Kay throws it open and steps
inside.

				KAY
		Yeah, sure, hang on, I wanna grab a coffee
		while we're right here.

As Kay walks into the kitchenette, Edwards' jaw drops, his eyes widen, and
he stares in wonderment --

-- at THREE WORM-LIKE ALIENS standing around a water cooler. Tall,
impossibly thin, most certainly not from New York, the aliens hold an
animated conversation in a language that seems like a combination of
Esperanto and microphone feedback.

				KAY (CONT'D)
			(to the aliens)
		Don't tell me we've only got that powdered
		shit for cream again?

One of the Worm Aliens answers him in their native tongue and points to
the counter.

				KAY (CONT'D)
		Oh.

He finds the cream sitting out on the counter where the alien indicated,
dumps some in his coffee, and comes back outside, closing the door behind
him. He reaches up and gently pushes Edwards' jaw up, closing his mouth.

				KAY (CONT'D)
		For future reference, this is a better look
		for you.

								CUT TO:

EXT. BATTERY PARK - DAY

EDWARDS, thrown for a major loop, sits like a zombie alongside KAY on a
bench in Battery Park. Kay drinks his coffee while they talk.

				KAY
		Any given time, around fifteen hundred
		landed aliens are on the planet, the
		majority right here in Manhattan. Most
		aliens are decent enough, just trying to
		make a living.

				EDWARDS
		Cab drivers?

				KAY
		Not as many as you'd think. Humans, for the
		most part, don't have a clue. Don't want
		one, either. They're happy. They think
		they've got a pretty good bead on things.

				EDWARDS
		Why the big secret? People are smart, they
		can handle it.

				KAY
		A person is smart. People are dumb.
		Everything they've ever "known" has been
		proven to be wrong. A thousand years ago
		everybody knew as a fact, that the earth
		was the center of the universe. Five
		hundred years ago, they knew it was flat.
		Fifteen minutes ago, you knew we humans
		were alone on it. Imagine what you'll know
		tomorrow.

				EDWARDS
		So what's the catch?

				KAY
		What you'll gain in perspective, you'll
		lose in ways you're too young to comprehend.
		You give up everything. Sever every human
		contact. No one will know you exist. Ever.

				EDWARDS
		Nobody?

				KAY
		You're not even allowed a favorite shirt.
		There.  That's the speech I never heard.
		That's the choice I never got.

				EDWARDS
		Hold up. You track me down, put me through
		those stupid-ass tests, now you're trying
		to talk me out of it. I don't get it.

				KAY
		You got 'til sun-up.

				EDWARDS
		Is it worth it?

				KAY
		You find out, you let me know.

							DISSOLVE TO:

EXT. BATTERY PARK - DUSK

Almost nighttime now, and the park is empty. EDWARDS is still on the
bench. And still thinking. Above him, the stars are coming out.

Slowly, he looks up, into the vastness of the heavens.

							DISSOLVE TO:

INT. GARAGE - DAY

The next morning. A door opens on a garage and an ORKIN MAN steps inside,
carrying a tank of toxic gas. The morning light spills on an abundance of
spiders, crawling everywhere -- big ones, small ones, hundreds of them
have moved in and taken over this dusty place.

The Orkin Man sighs and sets down his tank.

				ORKIN MAN
		Well, well, well. Movin' right in, are we?
		Think we own the place?

He unfurls a hose from the side of the tank.

				ORKIN MAN (CONT'D)
		Got a little eviction notice for you, boys.

He raises a mask to his face and unscrews the handle on the top of the
tank. LETHAL GAS starts to HISS from the end of the hose.

				VOICE (O.S.)
		Just what exactly do you think you're doing?

The Orkin Man turns around. EDGAR stands in the doorway to the garage,
staring at him disdainfully.

				ORKIN MAN
			(shrugs)
		Takin' care of your pest problem.

				EDGAR
		"Pest" problem? "Pest?"

				ORKIN MAN
		Yeah. You got a hell of an infestation.

Edgar advances on him, slowly.

				EDGAR
		You know, I have noticed an infestation
		here. Everywhere I look, in fact. Nothing
		but undeveloped, unevolved, barely conscious
		pond scum. So convinced of their own
		superiority as they scurry about their
		short, pointless lives.

				ORKIN MAN
		Well -- yeah. Don't you want to get rid of
		'em?

				EDGAR
		In the worst way.

Edgar lashes out quickly, jerking the mask off the Orkin Man's face with
one hand --

-- and shoving the gas hose down his throat with the other.

THE ORKIN MAN'S CAR KEYS drop to the garage floor, and Edgar picks them
up.

EXT. GARAGE - DAY

A six-by-ten sheet of plywood THUDS to the driveway outside the garage.
EDGAR raises one end of it so it's hanging off the back end of the Orkin
man's van -- now it's a ramp.

He walks off and we hear that familiar SCRAPING sound again. Edgar,
GRUNTING with the effort, slowly pushes his spaceship up the ramp and into
the back of the Orkin truck.

								CUT TO:

INT. MIB BUILDING - TUNNEL VENT ROOM - DAY

EDWARDS stands in the middle of the tunnel vent room, the same one he
first came into yesterday. The elevator doors open and KAY, obviously
summoned by the OLD SECURITY GUARD, stands waiting for him.

				EDWARDS
		One thing you gotta know right now.

Edwards walks briskly forward and gets in the elevator with Kay.

INT. MIB BUILDING - ELEVATOR - DAY

Inside the elevator, the doors WHOOSH shut, KAY turns a key in a certain
floor number, and the descent begins. EDWARDS continues.

				EDWARDS
		All right. I'm in because there's some
		next-level shit going on around here, and
		I'm with that. Before you beam me up, there
		are a couple of things we need to get
		straight. You chose me 'cause you recognize
		the skills. So as of now you can cease with
		all of that calling me "son" or "kid" or
		"sport." Cool?

				KAY
		Cool, slick. Now about those skills of yours,

The elevator doors --

INT. MIB BUILDING - HEADQUARTERS - DAY

-- slide open on Men in Black headquarters.

				KAY
		As of this moment, they don't mean much.

It's unlike anything we've ever seen -- huge, multileveled, of sixties
design, polished steel and glass. The workplaces are sleek and
uncluttered, manned by both HUMANS and ALIENS. Most of the Aliens stay in
the background, like the UPSIDE-DOWN GUY who walks on the ceiling,
shuffling papers.

KAY and EDWARDS step off the elevator and onto a platform that looks out
over the whole place.

Kay leads him down into the complex. First, they walk past a sort of
passport control center, where a human BUREAUCRAT at a desk is checking
the documents of a line of ALIENS who've just arrived. There are a dozen
bizarre life forms in that line, CHATTING in half a dozen different alien
tongues.

Edwards slows as they pass, listening to the PASSPORT CONTROL OFFICER as
he addresses an ARQUILLIAN, a large, humanoid visitor.

				PASSPORT OFFICER
		Purpose of trip?

				ARQUILLIAN
		Diplomatic mission.

				PASSPORT OFFICER
		Duration of stay?

				ARQUILLIAN
		Lunch.

				PASSPORT OFFICER
		Carrying any fruits or vegetables?

Edwards just stares, fascinated, but Kay grabs him by the arm and hurries
him along.

				KAY
		Let's go. He's a little...grouchy.

Kay moves him into the central hall.

				KAY
		A couple of hours wait after a 17-light-year
		flight would get on anybody's nerves.

				EDWARDS
		What branch of the government do we report
		to?

				KAY
		None. They started asking too many questions.

				EDWARDS
		So who pays for all this?

				KAY
		Oh, we hold a few patents on gadgets we
		confiscated from our out-of-state visitors.
		Velcro. Microwave Ovens. Liposuction.

AT A STORAGE CAGE, Kay turns a key in the lock of a caged-in area and
throws the door open. Inside, there are piles of sophisticated-looking
devices stacked on shelves and tabletops.

				KAY
			(picking something up)
		Here. A new recording device to replace
		CD's.  So now I gotta buy the White Album
		again?
			(something else)
		This is amusing. Universal translator.

He holds up a cylindrical metal tube and a small wire clip that looks like
a lapel microphone.

				KAY (CONT'D)
		We're not supposed to have it. I'll tell
		you why.  Human thought is so primitive
		it's considered an infectious disease.
		Makes you proud, doesn't it?

Edwards picks up a small yellow ball from one of the shelves.

				EDWARDS
		What's this?

				KAY (CONT'D)
		Don't touch that!

THE BALL ZINGS OUT OF EDWARDS' HANDS -- it flies out into the main complex
-- hits the ceiling and ricochets around the room, faster than the eye can
follow --

VARIOUS SHOTS OF HUMANS AND ALIENS ducking, dodging, and jumping out of
its way.

ON KAY as he calmly, a little wearily, slips an odd-looking metal glove
over his right hand...

He raises his hand and the yellow ball zings into it -- Kay catches the
ball, calmly.

				KAY (CONT'D)
		Caused the '77 New York blackout. Practical
		joke by the Great Attractor. He thought it
		was funny as hell.

They leave the room.

				EDWARDS
		Sorry!

ON THE MAIN FLOOR, they walk briskly across the room, reaching a giant
screen on the far wall.

				KAY
		Observation, the heart of our little
		endeavor.

The screen displays a map of the world on which thousands of tiny lights
blink in all parts of the globe, log lines of data flashing next to them.

				KAY (CONT'D)
		This map shows the location of every
		registered alien on earth at any given
		time. Some of them we keep under constant
		surveillance.

He hits a button on the console and the map is replaced by hundreds of
boxes, each with smaller video images.

				KAY (CONT'D)
		Everyone on these screens is an alien. In
		public -- normal. In private -- you'll get
		the idea.

ON THE SCREENS, we see live images of aliens. Aliens who look alien are in
spots where they can't be seen.  Aliens who look human are functioning
right out in public -- including SAM DONALDSON. MICHAEL JACKSON. And TONY
ROBBINS.

				KAY (CONT'D)
		Meet the twins.

Kay gestures to two small, bony CREATURES with eight arms each and a
single eye growing out of a central stalk in their heads. They turn around
and wave two or three arms each.

				EDWARDS
		I gotta be honest about something.

				KAY
		It makes no sense?

				EDWARDS
		It makes perfect sense. When I was a third
		grader in Philadelphia, they told me I was
		crazy 'cause I swore that our teacher was
		from, like, Venus or something.

				KAY
		Mrs. Edelson.

Edwards, stunned, looks at Kay as 4-Eyes boots her onto the screen: Mean
face, cat glasses. Bony fingers. Extremely well-hidden tail.

				KAY
		Jupiter, actually. Well, one of the moons.

With their remaining arms, they punch button after button on the enormous
console. ZED, who was standing up close to the screen, walks over to
Edwards, sizing him up.

				ZED
		What's your jacket size, Edwards?

				EDWARDS
		Uh -- forty regular.

				ZED
		Then let's put it on.

				EDWARDS
		Put what on?

				ZED
		The last suit you'll ever wear.

								CUT TO:

INT. MIB BUILDING - LOCKER ROOM - DAY

Like the rest of the place, the MIB locker room is all white. White walls,
white floor, white ceiling, white lockers. ZED'S VOICE comes over:

				ZED (O.S.)
		From now on, you'll dress only in attire
		specially sanctioned by MIB Special
		Services.

EDWARDS reaches out and opens a white locker, revealing a BLACK SUIT hung
from a hanger in the middle. Above it, on the shelf, a BLACK HAT and a
pair of BLACK SUNGLASSES. On the bottom, a pair of SHINY BLACK SHOES.

INT. MIB BUILDING - HEADQUARTERS - DAY

KAY is at a computer terminal. On screen are Edwards's birth certificate,
driver's license, social security card, library card, everything. ZED'S
VOICE continues:

				ZED (O.S.)
		You'll conform to the identity we give you,
		eat where we tell you, live where we tell
		you, get approval for any expenditure over
		a hundred dollars.

INT. MIB BUILDING LASER BOOTH - DAY

EDWARDS stands in a cramped white booth.

He holds both his hands on a TEN-FINGERED KEYPAD, pressing down hard. The
pad glows red, a SEARING sound comes from his hands, and he grimaces as
more lasers instantly and (not at all) painlessly change his fingerprints.

				ZED (O.S.)
		You will have no identifying marks of any
		kind.  You will not stand out in any way.

INT. MIB BUILDING - HEADQUARTERS - DAY

One by one, KAY deletes Edwards's identity cards.

On the computer screen is Edwards' full name -- JAMES DARREL EDWARDS III.
Kay punches a couple keys, and the cursor begins to sweep from right to
left, starting to eliminate the rightmost letters of Edwards's name.

				ZED (O.S.)
		Your entire image is carefully crafted to
		leave no lasting memory whatsoever with
		anyone you encounter.

INT. MIB BUILDING - LOCKER ROOM - DAY

Pants come off the hanger. The white shirt is removed.

More letters are eliminated from his name. It reads "JAMES DARREL ED..."
then "JAMES DARR..."

				ZED (O.S.)
		You're a rumor, recognizable only as deja
		vu and dismissed just as quickly. You don't
		exist; you were never even born.

The coat is removed. The hat comes off the shelf.

				ZED (O.S.)
		Anonymity is your name. Silence your native
		tongue.

"JAMES..." "JAM..."

				ZED (O.S.)
		You are no longer part of "the system."
		We're above the system. Over it. Beyond it.

Feet slip into black shoes. A belt is buckled. A tie pushed up.

				ZED (O.S.)
		We're "them." We're "they."

On screen, all that's left is the letter "J."

As the coat is buttoned, we notice the sleeve. Monogrammed on the cuff is,
simply, the letter "J."

				ZED (O.S.)
		We are the Men in Black.

INT. MIB BUILDING - HEADQUARTERS - DAY

Looking slick and handsome in his extremely sharp suit, JAMES D EDWARDS
III -- or, rather, JAY -- steps into the doorway from the locker room. He
reaches into his pocket, takes out the sunglasses, and looks at KAY.

				JAY
		The difference between you and me?

He slips on the sunglasses.

				JAY (CONT'D)
		I make this look good.

								CUT TO:

EXT. NEW JERSEY - EARLY MORNING

We are looking at a telephoto shot of Manhattan in all its splendor.

We see the Orkin van topping a hill, heading towards Manhattan.

INT. MIB BUILDING - ZED'S OFFICE - DAY

Zed's office is a circular, windowed room elevated above the main floor of
MIB headquarters. JAY and KAY sit across the desk from Zed. There are five
video monitors on a wall behind Zed's desk, and on each monitor is another
Man in Black, in different parts of the world, the city name and a clock
ticking in a corner of the image.

While Zed talks, he goes through paperwork on his desk.

				ZED
		Okay, let's see.
			(to one of the monitors)
		Bee, we got the deposed sur-prefect of
		Sinalee touching down in the forest outside
		Portland tonight. I'm pulling you down from
		Anchorage to do a meet-and-greet.

BEE, an agent on one of the monitors, nods.

				BEE
		Humanoid?

				ZED
		You wish. Bring a sponge.
			(going through memos)
		What else -- everybody, we gotta keep
		Rolling Fish-Goat out of the sewer system,
		he's scaring the rats. And Bobo the Squat
		wants to reveal himself on "Unsolved
		Mysteries." Bee, make sure he doesn't.

He turns a page, coming across a red memo.

				ZED (CONT'D)
		Red-letter from last night -- we had an
		un-authorized landing somewhere in upstate
		New York farm country. Keep your ears open
		for this one, Kay, we're not hosting a
		galactic kegger down here.

Next to him, his computer screen BEEPS importantly.  Zed looks over at it.

				ZED
		Well, well, well -- we got a skimmer.

				KAY
			(to Jay)
		Landed alien out of zone.
			(to Zed)
		Who is it?

				ZED
		Redgick. He's not cleared to leave Manhattan
		but he's way out of town right now, stuck in
		traffic on the New Jersey Turnpike. Why
		don't you take Jay? This is a good one for
		him to warm up on.

EXT. MIB BUILDING - BATTERY PARK - DAY

JAY and KAY come out the front of MIB headquarters.

				JAY
		Yo, wussup with Zed?
			(imitating him)
		"Go get em, tiger. We're not hosting an
		intergalactic kegger..."

				KAY
		Zed was saving the world before you were
		born, son. Show some respect.

An MIB MECHANIC pulls up in Kay's black LTD and hops out, leaving the door
open. Jay sizes up the car.

				JAY
		We got the use of unlimited technology from
		the entire universe and we cruise around in
		this?

Kay glares at Jay. He's getting annoyed.

INT. MIB LTD - DAY

They get in and slam the doors. Kay starts the car and the engine HUMS
quietly.

				KAY
		Seat belt.

				JAY
		You know, ya'll gotta learn how to talk to
		people. You could be a little kinder and
		gentler.

Kay grits his teeth.

				KAY
		Buckle up, please.

				JAY
		Now did that hurt?

Kay shifts the car into reverse. The awesome power of the car kicks in and
Jay sails forward, THWACKING into the dash. Kay shifts into forward and
taps the gas, SLAMMING Jay back into his seat.

				KAY
		Makin' fun of my ride...

A LIGHTED PANEL rotates into place between the two front seats.  Jay's
hand falls by accident on a flashing red button in the panel.

				KAY
		Jay. The button?

				JAY
		Yeah?

				KAY
		Never push the button, Jay.

Jay jerks his hand away.

								CUT TO:

EXT. HIGHWAY - SIDE OF THE ROAD - DAY

The LTD is now stopped by the side of the road, dust swirling around it.
Ahead of it, another car has pulled over. KAY gets out, JAY follows a
moment later, shaky-legged. Kay walks up to the window of the car they've
stopped. The DRIVER, a guy in his mid-thirties with a WIFE in her
mid-thirties, rolls the window down.

				KAY
		License and registration, please.

The Driver hands over some documents. Kay flips through them.

				KAY (CONT'D)
		Other license and registration, please.

The guy digs out two other cards and hands those over. Jay peers over
Kay's shoulder.

The photographs on the "RESIDENT ALIEN ID"cards are of two
friendly-looking reptile types, husband and wife, smiling atthe camera,
their long, skinny tongues dangling in a friendly sort of way.

Kay hands them back.

				KAY (CONT'D)
		Your resident card has you restricted to
		the five boroughs only. Where do you think
		you're going?

				REDGICK
		It's my wife! She's -- she's -- well, look!

Kay leans down and looks in the window. MRS. REDGICK is in front, MOANING
in pain, holding her swollen belly. Kay straightens up, fast.

				KAY
		Oh God. How soon?

Mrs. Redgick SCREAMS in pain. Real soon. For the first time since we've
seen him, Kay is nervous.

				KAY (CONT'D)
		Okay. All right. No big deal.
			(to Jay)
		You handle it.

				JAY
		Me?

				KAY
		Sure, it's easy, you just sorta -- catch.

Mrs. Redgick SCREAMS again. Redgick gets out of the car, worried.

				REDGICK
		Are you sure he knows what he's doing?

				KAY
		Yeah, hell, sure, he does this all the time.
		C'mon, let him work, Redgick, I wanna ask
		you something.

Kay gives Jay a supportive SLAP on the back and leads Redgick away, to the
rear of the car. Jay stays in the background and opens the rear door,
tentatively. He leans down, into the car.

				JAY
		Oh God! I see it I see it I see it!

A few yards from the car, Kay turns Redgick to face him.

				KAY
		Croagg the Midwife's back on 64th and 8th.
		You were headed out of town.

				REDGICK
		Well, we're, uh -- meeting someone.

Suddenly a TENTACLE whips out from between Mrs. Redgick's legs, CRACKS the
whip once, and wraps around the door post, grabbing hold.

				JAY
		Oh sweet Jesus Mother of God did you see
		that?!

				KAY
			(still to Redgick)
		So? Who you meeting?

				REDGICK
		Well, it's -- a ship.

				KAY
		Really? I didn't see a departure clearance
		for today.

				REDGICK
		You didn't? Uh, well -- it was an emergency.

Now a SECOND TENTACLE whips out, but this one wraps around Jay's neck and
pulls tight. He GASPS, choking.

				JAY
		Guys -- guys --

				KAY
		Doin' fine, Ace.
			(back to Redgick)
		What kind of emergency? What's the rush to
		get off the planet all of a sudden?

				JAY
			(choking to death)
		Help?! HELP! Hello?!

He starts tugging for all he's worth, but the fight is sort of going
against him, as the tentacles pull him in even harder than he tries to
pull the baby out.

				REDGICK
		We just don't like the neighborhood anymore.
		Some of the -- new arrivals.

Redgick looks at Kay, clearly concealing something, but darts his eyes
away.

				KAY
		What new arrivals? This have anything to do
		with the crasher from last night?

				JAY
			(Screaming)
		Can you guys do this later?!

But in that moment, Jay finally gets a foot up on the door frame, acquires
leverage, and RIPS the baby free. He falls, flat on his back in the dirt,
the multi-tentacled lizardlike baby resting squarely on his chest.

				JAY (CONT'D)
		Oh -- oh -- oh -- man.

Kay turns and claps Redgick on the back.

				KAY
		Congratulations! It's a lizard.

Jay looks down at the creature COOING and nestling on his chest.

				JAY
			(misty)
		Hey, you know, it is sorta --

It vomits on him.

								CUT TO:

EXT. HIGHWAY - SIDE OF THE ROAD - MIB LTD - DAY

Back in the car, JAY wipes the last of the puke off his suit while KAY
starts up the car.

				KAY
		Anything about that seem unusual to you?

Jay just looks at him, very Jack Benny.

				JAY
		Pick.

				KAY
		What kind of "new arrival" would scare
		Redgick so bad that he'd risk a warp jump
		with a newborn?
			(thinks)
		Let's check the hot sheets.

EXT. NEWSSTAND - DAY

CLOSE ON on various supermarket tabloids as a hand flips through them.
There are headlines like "POPE A FATHER!"and "TOP DOCTORS BAFFLED -- BABY
BORN PREGNANT!" and "MAN EATS OWN HOUSE!" (the subhead on that one is "And
That's Just the Appetizer, Says Neighbor.")

KAY and JAY are at a downtown newsstand. Kay is furiously searching
through the tabs; Jay is standing behind him, a little embarrassed.

				JAY
		These are the hot sheets?

Kay pulls a copy of the Weekly World News from the stand and gives the guy
a buck.

				KAY
		Best damn investigative reporting on the
		planet.  But hey, go ahead, read the New
		York Times if you want. They get lucky
		sometimes.

				JAY
		You're actually looking for tips in a
		supermarket tabloid?

				KAY
		Not looking for. Found.

He SMACKS the paper down on the hood in front of Jay, the pages turned
open to a headline in typeface so large one would think it reserved for
the Second Coming:

			     Farm wife says
		     "ALIEN STOLE MY HUSBAND'S SKIN!"

								CUT TO:

EXT. GEM AND JEWELRY STORE - ORKIN VAN - DAY

A flap of skin, now getting gray and crusty with age, hangs off EDGAR's
neck as he sits in the front of his Orkin van. He sucks as hard as he
possibly can on a straw stuck into a Jolt Cola ("Double the Sugar! Triple
the Caffeine!"), one of a six-pack that sits on the dashboard.

Across the street, Edgar sees a short, older man come out of one of the
jewelry shops on Thirty-Fifth Street. Edgar drops the soda and stares.

The Older Man (ROSENBERG), is carrying a cat and an ornate rosewood
jewelry box. Carefully, he sets the box down and lovingly places the cat
on top of it while he locks all five locks on the door to his distinctive
shop.

That finished, he picks up the cat, then the box, then waddles off down
the street, one under each arm.

Edgar drops the truck into gear and follows him, slowly, trolling along
behind him.

ON THE STREET, Rosenberg walks happily along, HUMMING to himself. He gives
his cat a little peck. As he rounds a corner, we recognize the tune he's
humming -- "I've Got the Whole World In My Hands."

The Orkin van rounds the corner behind him. Following.

								CUT TO:

EXT. FARMHOUSE - DAY

The LTD pulls to a stop at the end of the driveway that leads to
Beatrice's farmhouse, where the alien ship landed. The wrecked pickup
truck is still there. JAY and KAY get out, very undercover cop. Jay starts
up the driveway.

				KAY
		Not so fast. Walk up slow.

				JAY
		Why?

				KAY
		Part of the routine. Makes it look like
		we're sizing up the situation. Gives her
		time to get the wrong impression.

BEATRICE appears in the door to the house, curious.

				KAY (CONT'D)
		Puts some fear into her. Makes things go
		smoother.

Beatrice calls to them.

				BEATRICE
		Can I help you gentlemen?

Beatrice looks much better than the last time we saw her -- more nicely
dressed, a touch of makeup, a smile on her face.

Kay pulls a black card from his wallet and extends it to her as she draws
close. As she reaches for it, the card reforms into an FBI badge.

				KAY
		How do you do, ma'am, I'm Special Agent
		Manheim, this is Agent Black, FBI. Had a
		few questions about your visitor.

				BEATRICE
		Are you here to make fun of me too?

				KAY
		No ma'am. We at the FBI don't have a sense
		of humor that we're aware of. Mind if we
		come in?

				BEATRICE
		Sure. Lemonade?

								CUT TO:

INT. FARMHOUSE - LIVING ROOM - DAY

In the living room, KAY sips some of her lemonade and winces. JAY moves
through the room, checking it out as BEATRICE tells her story.

				BEATRICE
		And they said to me, "If he was murdered,
		how could he walk back in the house?" And I
		must admit, I was a little stumped by that
		one. But I know Edgar. And that wasn't him.
		It was more like something else that was
		wearing him. Like a suit. An Edgar suit.

A little GIGGLE escapes her at the thought. Jay, over by a bookcase,
notices a framed PHOTO OF EDGAR, kneeling in the woods, proudly about to
skin a deer.

				JAY
		Damn. If he was this ugly before he was an
		alien...

				BEATRICE
		Sorry?

				KAY
		Go on.

				BEATRICE
		Anyway, when I came to, he was gone.

				KAY
		Did he say anything?

				BEATRICE
		Yes! He asked for water. Sugar water, if I
		remember.

				KAY
		Sugar water.

				JAY
		Did you taste her lemonade?

Kay nods, puts on his sunglasses. Takes out another pair, hands them to
Jay.

Kay draws his neuralyzer. FLASH! Beatrice freezes, staring straight ahead
as if hypnotized. Kay takes Jay's glasses off and hands them back to him.

				KAY
		Ray Bans.
			(pulling off Jay's
			sunglasses)
		Okay, Beatrice. There was no alien, and the
		flash of light you saw in the sky wasn't a
		UFO. Swamp gas from a weather balloon was
		trapped in a thermal pocket and refracted
		the light from Venus --

				JAY
		Whoa! That thing erases her memory, and you
		give her a new one?

				KAY
		Standard issue neuralyzer.

				JAY
		And that's the best you can come up with?

				KAY
		On a more personal note, Beatrice, Edgar
		ran off with on old girlfriend. Go stay at
		your mother's for a few days and get over
		it. Decide you're better off.

				JAY
			(butting in)
		Yeah, and you're better off 'cause he never
		appreciated you anyway. In fact, you kicked
		him out, and now that he's gone, you ought
		to buy some new clothes, maybe hire a
		decorator or something...

								CUT TO:

EXT. FARMHOUSE - DAY

KAY is in the hole where the ship landed, investigating. He holds a pocket
spectral analyzer over a section of scorched earth.  The analyzer shifts
colors.  Red. Then Yellow.

				JAY
			(from up outside the hole)
		Hey. Kay...when am I gonna get one of those
		memory things?

The spectral analyzer turns blue.

				KAY
		When you're ready.
			(re: analyzer)
		Please -- not green.

Purple. And then green.

Kay closes his eyes and sits back, leaning against the dirt. Above him,
JAY leans over, staring down. Kay looks up at him.

				KAY (CONT'D)
		Do you know what alien life form leaves a
		green spectral trail?

				JAY
		Wait -- don't tell me -- that was the
		question on Final Jeopardy last night.

AT THE CAR, Kay snatches up the radio handset and keys the microphone.

				KAY
			(softly, into mic)
		Zed, we have a bug.

He turns off the radio and sighs. Jay stands next to him.

				JAY
		I'm gonna jump way past you and just guess
		that this is bad. Right?

				KAY
		Bugs thrive on carnage, Tiger.  They
		consume, infest and destroy. They live off
		the death and decay of other species.

				JAY
		So basically you have a racial problem with
		all insect-based life forms?

				KAY
		Listen, kid -- imagine a giant cockroach
		five times smarter than Albert Einstein,
		four times stronger than an ox, nine times
		meaner than hell, strutting his stuff
		around Manhattan Island in his brand new
		Edgar suit. Does that sound like fun?

				JAY
		What do we do?

				KAY
		With a bug in town? Watch the morgues.

								CUT TO:

EXT. LESHKO'S DINER - DAY

ROSENBERG, the jewelry store owner, steps out of a cab in the meat-packing
district, still carrying the ornate box and his beloved cat. He heads into
Leshko's, a Russian diner.

A moment later, the Orkin van pulls to a stop across the street.

INT. LESHKO'S DINER - DAY

ROSENBERG comes into the tiny restaurant, squinting in the relative
darkness. At a table in the middle, he sees a man eating alone -- an
enormous, dignified, yet profoundly strange-looking man in his mid
fifties.

Rosenberg walks carefully over to the table, but does not sit down. The
man (an ARQUILLIAN, and if we're eagle-eyed, we recognize him as the alien
on a "diplomatic mission" from passport control) rises from his chair. He
steps forward, to face Rosenberg, who sets the ornate box on the table.
Immediately, ROSENBERG'S CAT jumps on top of it.

Rosenberg and the Arquillian stare at each other for a long moment --

-- and then embrace each other. The embrace has an odd, formal quality to
it, like mafiosi coming to a sitdown. They hold on, long and hard, and
both seemed choked with emotion.

Finally, they break apart and take their seats. They speak in a bizarre
alien tongue, which is subtitled. Rosenberg wipes away tears.

				ROSENBERG
		Sorry I'm late. The cab drivers on this
		planet are terrible.

				ARQUILLIAN
		Your majesty, you are in grave danger.

				ROSENBERG
		Yeah, and they overcharge you every time.

				ARQUILLIAN
		Sir, a bug landed here. We must get you off
		the planet.

				ROSENBERG
		A bug? He must know why I'm here.

				ARQUILLIAN
		We think he does.
			(noticing the ornate box
			on the table)
		Is that what I think it is?

				ROSENBERG
		No, just some diamonds for your children.
		Do we have time to eat?

The Arquillian relaxes.

				ARQUILLIAN
		Sure. I ordered you some pirogi.

INT. LESHKO'S DINER - KITCHEN - DAY

In the kitchen, the Russian COOK slaps two orders of pirogi up on the
stainless steel counter --

				COOK
		Table six is up!

-- and turns away, back to the grill.

A HAND reaches in, takes the plates, and sets them on a tray. We follow
the tray, but see only the right arm and aproned midsection of the waiter
carrying it. He carries the tray along the counter toward a pair of
swinging doors that lead out into the restaurant.

The doors swing in as another WAITER sweeps into the kitchen, and our
waiter heads out into the dining area. As the doors swing closed behind
him, they reveal storage shelves crammed with bags of rice, cans of stewed
tomatoes --

-- and a DEAD WAITER, literally folded in half and stuffed in among the
shelves.

INT. LESHKO'S DINER - DAY

ROSENBERG and the ARQUILLIAN raise their glasses in a toast.

				ARQUILLIAN
		To the continued reign of the Arquillian
		Empire.

				ROSENBERG
		To the safety of the galaxy.

They CLINK glasses and drink, just as the Waiter arrives. Still, we see
only his arms and midsection as he sets the tray on a stand and lifts the
plates of pirogi. He carries them to the table and sets them down.

Rosenberg, setting his glass down next to the plate, catches a glimpse of
the Waiter's hand --

-- just as an enormous silverfish bug slithers out of the waiter's sleeve
and scurries across the table. The glass slips out of Rosenberg's hand,
dumping wine all over the table.

He looks up, slowly, and sees the Waiter's face.

It's EDGAR. Another half dozen insects of all variety tumble out of
Edgar's sleeves and scurry across the table. Rosenberg and the Arquillian
freeze, paralyzed with fear. They seem to know what dire implications
Edgar's presence holds.

				ROSENBERG
			(in English again)
		You can kill us both -- but you will not
		find it.

Edgar smiles.

				EDGAR
		You're right about one thing.

Suddenly a long STINGER whips out from under the back of Edgar's apron and
zips under the table. First Rosenberg and then the Arquillian lurch
forward their chairs, their faces contorting in pain.

They both pitch forward, their faces slogging into fresh pirogi.

The stinger SNAPS out from under the table and whips back under Edgar's
apron. He moves quickly, searching their pockets, but he doesn't find what
he's looking for. The cat, still perched on top of the ornate box, HISSES
at him.

Edgar reaches out and BATS the cat away with one vicious swipe of his
hand. The animal HOWLS and flies across the room, landing in a WOMAN's
lunch.

The Woman SCREAMS. Now other DINERS' attention is drawn to Edgar's table,
where two obviously dead men are being robbed by a waiter. There are
SHOUTS of outrage, a few MEN rise out of their seats.

Edgar grabs the ornate box and tries to open it, but finds it locked. With
the furor rising around him, he shoves the box under one arm and bolts for
the door.

Rosenberg's cat leaps back onto the table and SNARLS at him as he goes.

								CUT TO:

EXT. LESHKO'S DINER - DAY

Later, and the Russian diner is now a crime scene, clustered with COPS and
flashing lights. THREE BODIES, now on stretchers and covered with sheets,
are being loaded into the back of ambulances.

ROSENBERG'S CAT races out of a UNIFORMED COP's arms and leaps onto one of
the stretchers, MEOWING mournfully. The Uniformed Cop turns to a POLICE
INSPECTOR who is questioning the WOMAN from the diner.

				COP
		What am I supposed to do with the cat?

				INSPECTOR
		I don't know. Send it with the stiff. Let
		family claim it.

The Cop nods and follows the stretcher with Rosenberg's body into the back
of one of the ambulances, allowing the cat to ride on the chest of its
dead owner for the time being.

The doors of the wagon SLAM shut.

								CUT TO:

INT. MORGUE - CORRIDOR - DAY

The stretcher with the corpse on it is wheeled down a corridor in police
headquarters. ROSENBERG'S CAT, still on his chest, MEOWS curiously as the
stretcher approaches two doors with "City Morgue" written across them. The
words split in half as the stretcher BANGS through the doors.

INT. MORGUE - DAY

The city morgue is a crowded, brightly-lit, tiled place with corpses
parked left and right. Busy day in the Apple. The Cop wheeling the
stretcher calls out to the CORONER, who's hunched over another body.

				COP
		Where do you want contestant number three?

The coroner turns around. It's DR. LAUREL WEAVER, the woman who tried to
speak to Jay before. She sighs and waves a hand.

				LAUREL
		By the wall, I guess.
			(noticing)
		What's with the cat?

				COP
		Oh, the cat. There's a problem with the cat.
		Sign here.

Laurel signs his clipboard.

				LAUREL
		What's the problem with the cat?

				COP
		Your problem.

Laurel gives him a dirty look, but he laughs and leaves. She goes over to
the stretcher and bends down, petting Rosenberg's cat gently.

				LAUREL
		Are you having a bad day, baby?  Cheer up.
			(of Rosenberg)
		His is worse.

She sets the cat aside and wheels the stretcher under the lights.

				LAUREL (CONT'D)
		Okey-dokey. Shall we?

INT. MORGUE - LATER - DAY

Laurel is hunched over the corpse, the only light in the room coming from
the overhead spot that illuminates her work.

Fascinated by something, she digs deeper. And deeper. And looks up, her
face a mixture of alarm and excitement.

				LAUREL
		Oh, my God.

								CUT TO:

EXT. MORGUE - NIGHT

Kay's LTD pulls up in front of the morgue.

INT. MORGUE - CORRIDOR - NIGHT

Two men in black suits hurry down the stairs and into the corridor outside
the morgue. They hasten down the hallway, their shoes CLICKING in perfect
lockstep, headed for those swinging doors at the other end.

JAY and KAY. Men in Black on a mission.

INT. MORGUE - NIGHT

In the morgue, LAUREL has fallen asleep on her desk, her head in her arms.
ROSENBERG'S CAT sits on the desk next to her, licking its paws. Suddenly,
the cat looks up, MEOWING urgently.

Laurel looks up and, following the cat's gaze, turns around slowly in her
chair. JAY and KAY stand in the doorway, staring at her. Kay steps
forward, holding out that black card again. It reforms into another kind
of official ID, this time it says "DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC HEALTH"

				LAUREL
			(into recorder)
		...approximately 112 degrees at time of
		autopsy, indicating, quite impossibly, a
		post-mortem increase in body temperature.
		Examiner attempted to verify result
		rectally, only to find subject was, uh,
		without rectum. Which can only be described
		as...well...as really...

				KAY (O.S.)
		Weird? Dr. Leo Menville, Department of
		Public Health. This is Dr. White.

She looks up. Jay and Kay are standing there.

				LAUREL
		Yeah, well whoever you are, I'm afraid I'm
		going to need to see some ID.

He hands her his CARTE NOIR, which changes to read "Dr. Menville,
Department of Public Health." She hands it back.

				LAUREL
			(checking her watch)
		You boys must not have much of a home life.

				KAY
		We watch the morgues very carefully. You've
		got something unusual?

				LAUREL
		I'd say so -- triple homicide.

She gets up and goes to the Arquillian's body, which is still out on a
table under the lights.

				LAUREL (CONT'D)
		The first corpse was perfectly normal,
		except that he was broken in half, but when
		I opened up the other two -- well, look.

She throws back a sheet, revealing (to them only, not us) the fully
dissected Arquillian. Kay raises an eyebrow; Jay nearly retches.

				LAUREL (CONT'D)
		There's a skeletal structure at work here
		unlike anything I've ever seen.

Kay steps past her, going straight to the body. He begins to examine it.

				KAY
		I'll have a look at this one. Dr. White,
		why don't you and Dr. Weaver check out the
		other body?

				LAUREL
		This way, Doctor.

Jay and Laurel cross the room, to where ROSENBERG's corpse lies out on
another gurney.

				LAUREL (CONT'D)
		This one's even stranger. I did a full
		laparotomy. I started with the lesser
		curvature of the stomach -- though, if you
		want, we could begin at the gastro-esophageal
		junction.

				JAY
		I think, uh, we should start at the same
		place you did.

				LAUREL
		All right.

Jay hears a MEOW and looks down. Rosenberg's cat is rubbing up against his
leg.

				JAY
		Your cat?

				LAUREL
		Guess it is now. Came in with the bodies.

She SNAPS one of her rubber gloves and reaches down (out of frame),
sinking her hands into the body as she moves things aside. Just by the
look on Jay's face, one can imagine how disgusting it is.

Laurel digs in, up to her elbows. Jay winces. She pulls one bloody glove
out, to wipe a strand of hair out of her face. He looks at her --

-- and she winks at him. He's surprised. She laughs.

				LAUREL (CONT'D)
		Okay. Dive right in. God knows he won't
		mind.

Jay is reluctant, so she rolls her eyes and helps him, taking him by the
hand and guiding him into the thick of the corpse.

				LAUREL (CONT'D)
		You have very pretty eyes.

				JAY
		Thank-you, but is this really the time to
		uh -- you know, come on to me?

				LAUREL
		Hey, just walking the dog.
			(continuing)
		Feel that? Where the piloric junction would
		be?

				JAY
		Oh, yes. Exactly.

				LAUREL
		Now push that aside. Notice anything
		strange? Stomach? Liver? Lungs?

				JAY
		Nope. All fine.

				LAUREL
		Doctor, they're all missing.

				JAY
			(quickly)
		Well, of course they are. What I'm pointing
		out is that there are no pieces of them
		left. So they're intact, wherever they are.
		That we can be sure of.

				LAUREL
		Have we met before? I have the strangest
		feeling of deja vu.

				JAY
		You know, I was just going to ask you the
		same thing.

Laurel looks at him sideways, skeptical, but also intrigued. She whispers
to him. Confiding in him.

				LAUREL
		Okay. You wanna know what I really think?
			(re: Kay)
		But don't tell that guy. He looks like he's
		already under enough stress.
			(then)
		This body is not really a body, but it's
		actually some sort of transport unit for
		something else altogether. The question is:
		what?

Jay just looks at her intrigued.

				LAUREL
		By the way, stop me if I'm freaking you out.

				JAY
		No, no...not at all.

After a particularly gross GUSHY sound, he looks away, toward her. She's
staring at him.

Laurel leans over and lowers her voice, just for him.

				LAUREL
		You know what I like to do sometimes? When
		it's really late?

				JAY
			(freaked out)
		No...

From the other side of the room, Kay CLEARS HIS THROAT.

				JAY (CONT'D)
		Excuse me.

He walks across the morgue to Kay, who is still examining the Arquillian.
But Jay never takes his eyes off Laurel.

				KAY
		What do you think?

				JAY
			(of Laurel)
		Very interesting. Got a real Queen of the
		Undead thing goin' on.

				KAY
		Of the body.

				JAY
		Great body.

				KAY
		The dead body?

				JAY
		Not a clue.

				KAY
		All right. Keep her occupied. Try not to
		sound too dumb.

ACROSS THE MORGUE, Laurel is still examining Rosenberg, now bent down next
to his head, carefully studying his left ear. She notices something
strange, turns, and calls over her shoulder to Jay.

				LAUREL
		Dr. White.

Jay, in conversation with Kay, does not respond to what is not his name.

				LAUREL (CONT'D)
			(louder)
		Dr. White.
			(still louder)
		Dr. White.

He still doesn't answer.

				LAUREL (CONT'D)
			(shouting)
		DR. WHITE!

Kay nudges Jay.

				KAY
		You're up, Slugger.

Jay turns and races across the room to rejoin her.

				LAUREL
		Look at this.

Jay leans down. There is strange stitching around the base of Rosenberg's
ear.

				JAY
		What is that?

He reaches out, touches the ear, then he actually turns it. With a soft
CLICK --

-- it pulls away from the head. Like a latch.

Jay and Laurel look at each other, astonished. Jay pulls again, and
Rosenberg's entire face PUSHES OUT with a mechanical HUM, then HINGES
OPEN, the whole face rotating out away from the rest of the artificial
skull.

A TINY LITTLE GREEN MAN SITS INSIDE ROSENBERG'S HEAD.

Though not quite dead, the Tiny Little Green Man is gravely wounded. He
staggers up out of a small control room inside Rosenberg's head, with
gearshifts and viewing screens all around the inside of the skull.

				LAUREL
		Far -- freaking -- out.

They lean in closer. The Tiny Little Green Man (a BALTIAN) forces words
out of his mouth.

				BALTIAN
		Must -- to pre -- prevent --
			(searching for the word)
		-- contest? No...to prevent --

				JAY
		It's all right -- What are you trying to
		say? Struggle?

				LAUREL
		War?

The Baltian nods vigorously. That's it.

				BALTIAN
			(faltering)
		Galaxy on -- or -- or -- Orion's --
			(thinks)
		What is word? Be...?

				JAY
		Bed? Belt? Orion's Belt?

The Baltian nods again, falls, and dies. Jay and Laurel look at the little
dead alien, then at each other.

				JAY (CONT'D)
		"To prevent war, the galaxy is on Orion's
		Belt?"  The hell does that mean?
			(turns around)
		Hey! Kay! I mean, Dr., uh, whatever, come
		here!

Kay begins over. Laurel looks at them.

				LAUREL
		"Doctor Whatever"? You're not with the
		Department of Public Health, are you?

Jay shakes his head -- but is now paying more attention to Kay, as he
leads him toward the Little Man.

				JAY
		He's dead.

Kay looks at the mess -- the body, the little dead man.

				KAY
		Rosenberg. Damn. Good man.

				JAY
		You knew him?

				KAY
		One of the few I actually liked. Exiled
		High Prince.

				LAUREL
		I was right -- this is an alien life form,
		and you're from some government agency who
		wants to keep it under wraps...

Kay and Jay are not paying attention to Laurel.

				JAY
		He said "to prevent war, the galaxy is on
		Orion's Belt."

				LAUREL
		... This make total sense. How else do you
		explain New York? The other night I'm in a
		cab, this guy...

FLASH! Without even looking at her, Kay whips out his neuralyzer and
blanks her out.

				KAY
		He said there's a galaxy on Orion's Belt?
		That makes no sense.

				JAY
		That's what he said.
			(to the dazed Laurel)
		Didn't he? Right after he --
			(realizing)
		Oh, for Christ's sake, you did the flashy
		thing already.

				LAUREL
			(as if awakening)
		Uh, hi, whoever you guys are, I'm afraid
		I'm going to need to see some ID if you're
		going to be in the morgue, okay?

				KAY
		Sure thing, sweetheart. Here you go.

FLASH! He neuralyzes her again. Jay slaps his hand.

				JAY
		Stop that --

				KAY
			(to Laurel, ignoring Jay)
		Typical day, too much caffeine, get a life.

				JAY
		-- that thing probably gives you brain
		cancer!

				KAY
		Never hurt her before.

				JAY
		"Never hurt her before"?! How many times
		have you done the flashy thing to this poor
		woman?!

				KAY
			(evasive)
		Couple.

				JAY
		Aren't you worried about, you know, long
		term damage?

				KAY
			(more evasive)
		Little bit.

				JAY
		What the hell happened to make you such a
		callous son of a bitch?

				KAY
		I took this job.

He heads out. Jay follows.

				JAY
		Hey, you never flashed me with that thing,
		did you?

				KAY
		Nah.

EXT. MORGUE - NIGHT

Jay and Kay exit the morgue and walk towards their car.

				JAY
		Hey, Kay, I really think I should be in
		charge of the flashy memory thing
		department.

				KAY
		Not while I'm around, Slim.

				JAY
		Yeah, well you're a menace with that
		thing...

An MIB containment vehicle pulls up, and four men dressed in black suits
get out.

				KAY
			(to an MIB Agent)
		We've got two dead aliens in there, and a
		deputy medical coroner in need of a new
		memory.

								CUT TO:

EXT. NEW YORK ALLEY - NIGHT

The Orkin van is parked in an alleyway somewhere downtown. From inside,
throaty WAILS of frustration can be heard. Two PASSERSBY hear the racket
and hesitate, wondering if they should get involved.

But an inhuman GROWL rattles the whole van and they wise up, hurrying on
their way.

INT. ORKIN VAN - NEW YORK ALLEY - NIGHT

Inside the van, the ornate rosewood box is now battered and scarred, its
various locks holding tight against EDGAR's repeated attempts to claw his
way into it. Crammed into the back of the van along with his spaceship,
Edgar wedges a screwdriver into the thin opening between the top and the
rest of the box and SMACKS it with his right fist. Nothing doing.

He BELLOWS in rage and hurls the box against the side of the van, where it
finally CRACKS a hinge. Edgar snaps it up, pries the rest of the hinge off
with the screwdriver, and wrenches the top off the box.

Inside, there are dozens of precious, glittering diamonds, which he
promptly tosses aside as worthless. But the rest of the box is empty.

				EDGAR
		No. No, NO, NO, NOOOO!

He rips the box apart with his bare hands. There's nothing else there.

								CUT TO:

EXT. MIB BUILDING - MAGIC HOUR

As lower Manhattan is waking up, Jay and Kay enter the building.

INT. MIB BUILDING - HEADQUARTERS - EARLY MORNING

Despite the early hour, the headquarters is going full-blast. The large
screen displays the familiar grouping of stars that is the CONSTELLATION
ORION.

Jay and Kay hurry in -- Kay peels off to one of the monitors; Jay heads
for Zed.

				JAY
		Doesn't anybody believe in sleep around
		here?

				ZED
		The twins keep us on Alpha Centaurian time
		-- a 37-hour day. Give it a few months --
		you'll get used to it. Or you'll have a
		psychotic episode.

He points up at the screen with a laser pencil.

				ZED
		Here's Orion; the brightest grouping of
		stars in the northern sky...
			(pointing)
		and here's Orion's belt --

He indicates the three stars that make up the belt.

				JAY
		That's what the little guy was talking
		about, "To prevent war, the galaxy's on
		Orion's belt..."

				ZED
		There are no galaxies on Orion's belt. The
		belt is just these three stars; galaxies
		are huge, made up of billions of stars.
			(switches off the laser
			pointer)
		You heard wrong.

				JAY
		You're attracted to me, aren't you?

Jay starts to cross over to ANOTHER MONITOR, where Kay is sitting alone,
tie loosened, slightly disheveled. On the screen, the word "SEARCHING"
blinks, encouraging patience. The image changes to a satellite view of
North America, which quickly zooms in on the Southwest.

On screen, the satellite view zooms down to Arizona, then a city, then a
neighborhood, then a block, then a back yard. The printout changes to
"SUBJECT ACQUIRED."

The image comes into sharp focus on one back yard in particular, where we
get a good look at a MIDDLE-AGED WOMAN.
			SUBJECT: ELIZABETH ANN RESTON
			 PRESENT LOCATION: RESIDENCE
			 553 FAIRFIELD AVE./TEMPE/AZ
Whoever Elizabeth Ann Reston is, she's lovely. She's setting a picnic
table in her back yard at the moment, unaware that she's being watched by
an eye in the sky -- just as Kay is unaware that Jay is standing behind
him.

Jay notices the monitor with the Middle-aged Woman on it. He looks at
Kay's expression, then back at the monitor.

				JAY
		Pretty lady...

Kay clicks off the picture of her. Jay drags a chair and sits down.

				JAY (CONT'D)
		You were the guy with the flowers in the
		photo, (the night the aliens arrived.)
		(What, you were on your way to a dance or
		something and you got lost? And she never
		got those flowers, did she?]

Kay doesn't answer, just stares at the screen. Elizabeth looks up, as if
she knows she's being watched, but she's just looking at the sky,
wondering how many stars'll be out tonight.

				JAY (CONT'D)
		Grumpy Guy's story comes into focus. She
		ever get married?

				KAY
		No.

It's more than Kay can bear. He reaches out and flicks a switch. The
monitor goes blank, except for a data screen:
			    SUBJECT LOST
Kay sits back in the chair and eats a potato chip morosely. Jay looks at
him: "Is this me in thirty years?" A moment goes by. Finally:

				JAY
		Well, it's better to have loved and lost
		than never to have --

				KAY
		Try it.

				ZED (O.S.)
		Kay.

Jay and Kay cross back toward the LAD (Landed Alien Display), where each
of the thousand or so Aliens who live on earth are represented by a
flickering LIGHT.

Some lights are starting to go out.

				KAY
			(quietly, with dread)
		They're leaving.

				ZED
		We've had twelve jumps in the last hour.
		Redgick was just the beginning.

				JAY
		What do they know that we don't know?

Kay looks to his partner, then to the screen. Another light flickers out.

				KAY
		Why do rats desert the ship?
			(to the twins)
		Go to Lem Sat IV. Put up a forty-field view
		of Manhattan.

ON THE SCREEN New York City is just a bright spot of light on the Eastern
coast of the United States.

				KAY (CONT'D)
		Four hundred.

Now there's a view of the earth from space. Nothing unusual.

				KAY (CONT'D)
		Four thousand.

Now we're looking at earth from far, far away -- and from here we can see
something that doesn't belong in this picture:

A BATTLE CRUISER far off to one side of the earth. The words "LEVEL FOUR"
flash in red letters on one side of the map.

				KAY (CONT'D)
		That's an Arquillian battle cruiser.

				JAY
		And we've got a dead Arquillian prince.

A COMMUNICATION STARTS COMING OVER THE SPEAKERS -- a sound like a cat and
mouse caught in a blender.

				KAY
		Message coming in.

The communication continues.

				KAY (CONT'D)
		Speak of the devil.

The communication continues.

				JAY
		They sound pissed.

				ZED
			(to the twins)
		Translate that and step on it!
			(to Kay)
		Meanwhile get down to Rosenberg's store and
		see what you can turn up.

Kay and Jay walk away.

				ZED (CONT'D)
		And Kay -- take a lot of fire power.

IN THE EQUIPMENT LOCKER Kay pulls out the ENORMOUS, MANY-BARRELED HAND
GUN. A small, clear, canister sprouts from underneath it, malicious
swirling gases visible through its walls.

				JAY
		I like that.

				KAY
		Series four de-atomizer.

Kay pulls out another weapon, the TINIEST GUN WE'VE EVER SEEN.

				KAY (CONT'D)
		Here. We call this the "Noisy Cricket."

				JAY
		You get a series four de-atomizer and I get
		a "Noisy Cricket?!"
			(looks at the gun)
		I'm afraid I'm going to break it.

Jay follows Kay out, glancing back to see the huge gun turrets on the
Arquillian Battle Cruiser HUM and WHIR as they swing around into position,
pointed down at the unwitting planet below.

								CUT TO:

INT. GEM AND JEWELRY STORE - DAY

SMASH! The window in the front door of Rosenberg's jewelry shop collapses
in a shower of glass. EDGAR reaches in and fumbles with the locks, undoing
them one by one. He gets them all and steps inside. Out the window behind
him, we can see his Orkin van, double parked in the street in front.

All the gems and jewels are under glass counters. Edgar starts SMASHING
the glass, grabbing great handfuls of jewels and tossing them aside.

Outside, a New York City tow truck pulls up to the front of the Orkin van
and starts to hitch up.

Edgar, in his rage, starts to smash anything breakable, even the framed
pictures on the walls. He stops at one particular picture, staring
intently at it. It's a glamor shot of Rosenberg's cat, provocatively posed
on a satin pillow. There are a half dozen more pictures of the cat, some
posed with Rosenberg, some by itself. This animal was important to
Rosenberg.

From outside, the ROAR of an engine distracts Edgar. He turns around, in
time to see the Orkin van lurch as the tow lifts its front wheels off the
ground.

EXT. GEM AND JEWELRY STORE - DAY

EDGAR rushes outside as the tow truck DRIVER gets the van up on the hoist.

				EDGAR
		That's my truck!

				DRIVER
		And make sure you tell them that at the
		impound.

Edgar reaches into the front seat of the van and pulls out his twelve
gauge. He points it at the tow truck Driver. The tow truck driver looks at
him with disdain, and pulling back his shirt reveals a mean-looking gun.

				DRIVER (CONT'D)
		I got worse.

He keeps hitching up the van. Two pedestrians walk past the dispute, very
fast, ignoring the debate, headed right for the shop. We go with them, and
realize that it's --

-- JAY and KAY. They stop at the smashed door of the jewelry shop and
exchange a glance. Kay pulls a very menacing-looking weapon, nods, and
they step inside.

INT. GEM AND JEWELRY STORE - DAY

They look around and see the recent demolition caused by Edgar. Jay
furrows his brow.

				JAY
		Who robs a jewelry store and leaves the
		jewels?

				KAY
		Someone who's not looking for jewels.

Jay moves behind the counter. On the floor is an ornate, empty bowl and a
bag of cat food, next to a scrumptious pillow. There are several PHOTOS OF
A CAT on the wall.

There is also a pile of BEJEWELED CAT COLLARS. Jay picks up one of the
COLLARS, inspects it closely, shaking his head.

				JAY
		This guy had a serious crush on his cat.

Jay's attention is broken by something through the window. Outside,
lumbering straight for the store, is EDGAR.

Jay thinks for a moment -- where does he know that face?

Suddenly, Edgar raises his arms, pointing both the farmer's rifle and the
driver's shotgun. Before Edgar can shoot, Jay YELLS...

				JAY
		Kay! GET DOWN!

And then Jay FIRES, shattering the storefront window, and BLOWING UP A CAR
on the street. The blast hurls him up and back a good ten feet, SLAMMING
him into the wall with tremendous force. Edgar turns and rushes away down
the street as Jay picks himself up.

				JAY
		The bug in the Edgar suit! The ugly redneck
		from the picture! That's him!

Jay leaps through the broken storefront window and after Edgar.

				KAY
			(picking himself up)
		Damn it.

Kay runs out after Jay.

EXT. GEM AND JEWELRY STORE - DAY

Edgar doesn't bother sticking around to continue his fight. He jumps
behind the wheel of the tow truck, starts it up, and hits the gas. The
engine ROARS.

Jay sprints after him, FIRING his noisy cricket. He is thrown back into
some pedestrians, while his SHOT...

Hits the rigging between the Orkin Van and the town truck, separating the
two. Jay pulls himself up and sprints after the tow truck, but it
accelerates too quickly.

Edgar is just about to turn the corner when Jay leaps onto a parked CAR to
try and get some height. As Jay prepares to shoot, EDGAR DISAPPEARS AROUND
THE CORNER, and a HUGH TRUCK backs into his line of fire.

JAY FIRES, the TRUCK EXPLODES and Jay flies BACKWARDS, hurtling through
the air and CRASHING through the window of a car, his rear end right in
the woman driver's face.

When Jay looks up, Kay is standing before him. He yanks Jay out of the
car.

				KAY
		We do not discharge our weapons in view of
		the public.

				JAY
		Can we drop the cover-up bullshit?! There's
		an Alien Battle Cruiser that's gonna blow-up
		the world if we don't...

				KAY
		There's always an Alien Battle Cruiser...or
		a Korlian Death Ray, or...an intergalactic
		plague about to wipe out life on this
		planet, and the only thing that lets people
		get on with their hopeful little lives is
		that they don't know about it.

Kay gestures to a group of ONLOOKERS, drawn by the curious blasts from the
store. There's smoking rubble everywhere.

				KAY
		Don't worry about the bug. He's not leaving
		town. We've got his ship.

After gesturing to the back of the Orkin van, where Edgar's spaceship is
neatly stowed, Kay pulls out his cell phone.

				KAY
			(into phone)
		Zed, we're gonna need a containment crew
		down here at McDougal, south of Houston.

INT. MIB BUILDING - HEADQUARTERS - DAY

Back at Men in Black Headquarters, the little lights on the world map
which indicate aliens' locations are going out, one by one, about one
every five or ten seconds. A WARNING BUZZER is sounding, over and over,
and HUMAN STAFFERS are rushing left and right.

ZED is in his office.

				ZED
		Containment may be a moot point, my friend.
		The exodus continues. It's like the party's
		over and the last one to leave gets stuck
		with the check.

Zed looks down to the vast floor below and sees the four worm guys with
suitcases walking across the floor.

				ZED
		You sorry little ingrates!

				KAY (O.S.)
		What about the Arquillians?

				ZED
		We've only translated a part of the message
		so far: "Deliver the Galaxy."

				KAY (O.S.)
		No, they don't want much, do they?

				ZED
		Oh, it gets better... They're holding us
		responsible.

He looks up at the screen. It reads:
				   MIB
			   DELIVER THE GALAXY.

				ZED
		Another contestant has entered the ring.

EXT. NEW YORK STREET (OUTSIDE JEWELRY STORE)

As Kay puts away his phone, turns to Jay

				KAY
		All right, kid. The Arquillians want the
		galaxy, whatever the hell that means. We
		need help. A professional. Someone with
		years of experience in intergalactic
		politics. I just hope the little prick
		hasn't skipped town.

								CUT TO:

EXT. UPTOWN NEWSSTAND - DAY

The tow truck SQUEALS to a halt at a curb.  EDGAR gets out and walks away,
fast, CURSING under his breath. He rants, livid, thinking hard. As he
passes a newsstand, he grabs the NEWS VENDOR by the collar.

				EDGAR
		Where do you keep your dead?

				VENDOR
			(thinks)
		I don't have any dead.

				EDGAR
		Where?!

				VENDOR
		I don't know, the city morgue!

Edgar shoves him away roughly. But before he leaves, his eye catches a
postcard display marked "LANDMARKS OF THE NEW YORK CITY AREA." Edgar
stares, fascinated, but we don't see what he's looking at. He reaches out
and picks up a color postcard.

He raises it to his face, thinking, then shoves it in his pocket and
hurries off.

								CUT TO:

EXT. STREET - KEY KIOSK - DAY

Kay's LTD SCREECHES to a halt in front of the kiosk on Orchard Street. JAY
and KAY leap out and Jay spots the VENDOR, closing up the shop. He's
wearing a dirty cardigan, watch cap, and fingerless gloves, his face
aquiver with ticks and mannerisms. He has a small dog in front of him.

Jay rolls his eyes as they step up to the counter.

				JAY
		Of course that guy's an alien. That's gotta
		be the worst disguise I've ever seen.

A voice answers him, but not the Vendor's.

				FRANK THE PUG
		You don't like it, you can kiss my furry
		little butt.

Jay looks down. The voice is coming from the dog. This is FRANK THE PUG.
Kay approaches, motioning to Jay to make sure no one hears.

				KAY
		You busy, Frank?

				FRANK THE PUG
		Sorry, Kay, I can't talk right now, my
		ride's leaving in --

Kay grabs Frank. He yelps like, well, a dog.

				KAY
		Call the pound. We got a stray.

				FRANK THE PUG
		Hey! Get your paws off me!

PASSERBYS glare at Kay, who appears to be seriously mistreating this poor
little dog. Jay tries to explain.

				JAY
		The, uh...dog owes my friend some money.

				KAY
			(to Frank)
		Arquillians and bugs. What do you know?

				FRANK THE PUG
		I know nothing.

				KAY
		Not a thing?

Kay shakes Frank the Pug, trying to force an answer.

				FRANK THE PUG
		Stop it. Okay, okay. Rosenberg wasn't some
		two-bit Arquillian. He was the guardian of
		a galaxy. They thought he would be safe
		here on earth.

				KAY
		And the bug had other plans.

				FRANK THE PUG
		The galaxy is the best source for subatomic
		energy in the universe. If the bugs get
		their slimy claws on it, kiss the
		Arquillians goodbye.

				JAY
		Ask him about the belt.

				KAY
			(to Frank)
		Rosenberg said something about a galaxy on
		"Orion's belt." What's he talking about,
		Frank?

				FRANK THE PUG
		Beats me.

Kay shakes Frank the Pug once more.

				JAY
			(to a person passing by)
		They're rehearsing a ventriloquist act.

				FRANK THE PUG
		The galaxy is here.

				KAY
		Here?

				JAY
		The galaxy is hundreds of millions of stars
		and planets? How's it here?

If a dog can smirk, Frank does.

				FRANK THE PUG
		You humans, when're you gonna learn that
		size doesn't matter? Just 'cause something's
		important, doesn't mean it's not very, very
		small.

				KAY
		How small?

				FRANK THE PUG
		Tiny. Like the size of a marble. Or a jewel.
		Now if you'll excuse me, I need to be walked
		before the flight.

Kay lets go of Frank, turns to Jay, who is lost in thought.

				KAY
			(to Frank the Pug)
		Get out of here.
			(then to Jay)
		The galaxy's here. It's not on Orion's belt.

Jay suddenly notices Frank the Pug bark at a cat farther down the
sidewalk.

				JAY
		Kay...

								CUT TO:

INT. MORGUE - DAY

In the morgue, LAUREL is working at a desk when suddenly ROSENBERG'S CAT
leaps up onto it from nowhere, the way cats do, landing right in the
middle of the file she's studying.

Laurel jumps.

				LAUREL
		Boy, when you want attention --

She pets the cat. As she does, the cat's collar shines in the light.
Laurel turns the name tag to face her.

CLOSE ON A PRECIOUS JEWEL, AND THE WORD "ORION."

As it is written across the collar of the cat.

				LAUREL (O.S)
		"Orion." That's a pretty name.

From out in the corridor, a bell rings -- DING, DING.

Laurel notices something dangling from the cat's collar -- a CIRCULAR ICON
of a strange and beautiful metal. The center is some sort of hardened,
translucent material, light green in color.

				LAUREL (CONT'D)
		What's this?

She peers into the jewel, and her face washes over with amazement.

INT. ICON - DAY

It's as if Laurel is sucked into another universe. Her face goes
beatifically blank as she sails through a massive starfield, millions of
stars, billions of green, verdant planets, all racing by her at the speed
of light.

INT. MORGUE - DAY

				LAUREL
		Wow.

Outside, the bell DINGS again. Orion looks up, as if knowing who's out
there, and not liking it. She SNARLS at the door and leaps off the desk,
scurrying across the lab and disappearing under some equipment.

INT./EXT. LTD - MANHATTAN - DAY

Jay and Kay barrel through town.

				JAY
		So two galaxies have been fighting for
		years. And the only people who've been
		benefiting are a race of creatures called
		bugs. Then the two galaxies decide to make
		peace...and the bugs send this guy down to
		make sure the fighting never stops.

				KAY
		By killing the emissaries, and stealing the
		galaxy they've been fighting about.

				JAY
		And if we don't get it back before he
		leaves the planet...we're history.

				KAY
		We're not even history. 'Cause history
		implies there's someone around to remember
		it.

INT. MORGUE - CORRIDOR - DAY

On a counter in the morgue corridor, a gray, peeling hand BANGS on a bell
on a countertop, over and over. The hand belongs to EDGAR, who is carrying
his shotgun, concealing it behind one leg. The morgue attendant, TONY,
emerges from a small security cage carrying a worn paperback copy of Atlas
Shrugged and a fly swatter.

				TONY
		Thank you for making sure the bell works.

Suddenly, quick as a gunfighter, Tony SNAPS the fly swatter down on a
BUZZING FLY. Edgar winces.

				TONY (CONT'D)
			(to Edgar)
		What's up, Farmer John?

				EDGAR
		A man came in here earlier. A dead man.

				TONY
		And this means what to me?

				EDGAR
		He was a very dear friend of mine. And I
		believe he had an animal with him. A gift
		I gave him, a pet cat that means worlds to
		me. I would like it back.

				TONY
		I'll need a picture ID, written proof of
		ownership of the cat, or notarized proof of
		kinship with --

WHACK! Tony flicks the fly swatter again, sending another bug to meet its
maker. Edgar grits his teeth.

				TONY (CONT'D)
		-- the deceased.

				EDGAR
		Don't -- do that.

WHACK! Still another fly goes down.

				TONY
		Do what?

Tony looks down, to where Edgar's hands rest on the counter. Half a dozen
cockroaches stream out of his sleeve.

				TONY (CONT'D)
		Shit!

He ducks under the counter --

-- and comes up with a can of Raid. Edgar's eyes bug out.

								CUT TO:

EXT. MORGUE - DAY

Kay's LTD pulls to a stop in front of the morgue and JAY and KAY jump out.

				JAY
		I'll handle this one, you wait outside.

				KAY
		What the hell for?

				JAY
		Because all we have to do is walk in and
		get a cat, it's not that hard. But if you
		go in, you're gonna lay your Jack Webb on
		her and flash your brain ray in her face
		and she's gonna end up with leukemia or
		some shit. The woman's a doctor, she
		doesn't need you erasing half her med
		school classes. Take me five minutes.

And he continues into the morgue, leaving Kay waiting outside.

				KAY
		Two minutes!

INT. MORGUE - DAY

LAUREL SLAMS into a wall on one side of the morgue, thrown there by EDGAR.
He leans in, close, furious.

				EDGAR
		Where is the animal?!

				LAUREL
		I told you, I don't know, it ran under some
		equipment! Over there.

				EDGAR
		Get it!

He grabs her roughly and drags her across the morgue, toward the equipment
she pointed to. As they draw close, ORION the cat bolts from underneath
it, races between their legs, and leapfrogs over several small cabinets,
landing on top of a very tall one with only six inches clearance between
it and the ceiling. A very tough hiding place.

Edgar just starts to turn when they hear the BELL and a VOICE from the
corridor outside.

				JAY (O.S.)
		Hello? Anybody here?

Edgar looks up at the cat's hiding place. No time to get it. The bell
DINGS again.

				JAY (O.S.)
		Hello?

Roughly, Edgar pulls Laurel close and puts a finger to his lips --
"Shhhhhhh."

INT. MORGUE - CORRIDOR - DAY

In the corridor, JAY looks around. No Tony, no answer to the bell.  He
DINGS once more, then heads into the back.

INT. MORGUE - DAY

JAY comes into the morgue. LAUREL is in there, standing right up next to
an examination table, but there is no corpse on the table, just a sheet
draped over it. She just stands there, in the middle of the room, staring
at Jay.

				JAY
		Uh, hi.

				LAUREL
			(oddly)
		Hello.

				JAY
			(flashes a badge)
		I'm Sergeant Friday, from the Twenty-Sixth
		precinct. They brought a cat in here with a
		corpse the other day, might have said
		"Orion" on the cat's name tag?

				LAUREL
		Yes. That's right.

				JAY
		Right, well, the cat is, uh -- the cat's a
		witness in a murder case and I'm going to
		need to take it with me.

				LAUREL
		I don't know where the cat is at the moment.

				JAY
		You don't?

				LAUREL
		No.
			(lowers her voice to a
			whisper)
		Maybe you could take me with you instead.

Jay looks at her.

				JAY
		Excuse me?

				LAUREL
		I said, maybe you could take me with you
		instead.

				JAY
		Damn, you do start fast, don't you?

				LAUREL
		I'd really like to go with you. Now.

Jay just looks at her, amazed at the power he seems to have over this
woman. He looks over his shoulder, to make sure he has a few more seconds
alone.

				JAY
		And, uh, why exactly is that?

Laurel rolls her eyes. She seems irritated with him, but it doesn't go
with what she's saying.

				LAUREL
		I just do.

INT. MORGUE - CORRIDOR - DAY

KAY comes down the stairs and into the morgue corridor.  He checks his
watch, then leans against the counter and pulls out a pack of cigarettes.
Waiting.

INT. MORGUE - DAY

Jay is thoroughly enjoying himself, but Laurel seems to be going crazy.

				LAUREL
		I have something I need to show you.

She looks down, pointedly, in the direction of her waist.

				JAY
		Now slow down, you don't have to hit the
		gas like that.

She leans in and lowers her voice.

				LAUREL
		You don't understand. You really need to
		see this.

				JAY
		And I will. But we gotta get something
		straight here -- I'm gonna drive. It's not
		some kind of macho trip, it's just the way
		I'm used to doing things, okay?

INT. MORGUE - CORRIDOR - DAY

Kay pulls out a box of matches and strikes one on the side. He raises it
to his cigarette, but as it draws close, the match goes out with a sharp
SIZZLE.

Kay furrows his brow. Odd.

INT. MORGUE - DAY

Laurel is at the end of her rope.

				LAUREL
		Look, Stud, I don't know how many more
		times I'm going to get to tell you this.
		There's something --

She points, sharply, at the examination table directly in front of her.

				LAUREL (CONT'D)
		-- that you have to help me with.

Jay's smile vanishes and his jaw drops as he figures it out.  He starts to
reach for his gun.

INT. MORGUE - CORRIDOR - DAY

Kay raises another lit match to his cigarette, but as this one gets close,
a BIG GLOB OF GOO drops from the ceiling and onto the match, dousing the
flame.

Kay looks up, sharply.

Above him, TONY, the counter guy, is stuck to one high corner of the
ceiling by an enormous wad of viscous, dripping fluid. He's dead, a frozen
look of terror on his face and the can of Raid still clutched in his hand.

From inside the morgue, Laurel SCREAMS.

INT. MORGUE - DAY

Kay races into the morgue just as the examination table EXPLODES into the
air, revealing EDGAR, who was hiding beneath it.

Now everything happens at once. Jay leaps back and draws the Noisy
Cricket, Kay pulls out his series four deatomizer, and Edgar holds his
shotgun under Laurel's chin, using her body to shield his own.

				KAY
		Freeze it, Bug!

				JAY
		Don't shoot! Don't shoot!

				LAUREL
			(to Jay)
		CHRIST, are you THICK!

				JAY
		How was I supposed to know!?!

				LAUREL
		What did I have to do, SING it for you!?!

				JAY
		Maybe if you didn't come on like a drunken
		prom date!

				LAUREL
		Oh, that's SO typical. Any time a woman
		shows the slightest hint of sexual
		independence, men just --

				EDGAR
		Everybody shut UP!

				KAY
		Let her go, Shit Eater.

				EDGAR
		Listen, Monkey Boy, I may have to take that
		kind of talk in my end of the universe, but
		compared to you humans, I'm the top rung on
		the evolutionary ladder, so can it, all
		right?!

				KAY
		You're breakin' my heart. Move six inches
		to your left and I'll solve all your
		problems.

ORION the cat suddenly attacks, leaping off the top of the cabinet and
landing on Edgar, HISSING and scratching and clawing for all she's worth.
Edgar snaps an arm up and whips her off. The cat squirms in his arm, the
icon jangling. Edgar grabs the icon, holds onto it, and flings the cat
away, across the morgue. The icon comes free, remaining in his hand.

He drops it into his mouth and swallows. He shoves the gun hard against
Laurel's cheek.

				EDGAR
		That's better. Now put down your weapons.
		We're leaving.

Kay freezes, teeth clenched, gun still in front of him. Standoff.

				EDGAR (CONT'D)
		Have you ever pulled the wings off a fly?

Edgar cranks one of Laurel's arms behind her back, hard, and she CRIES OUT
in pain.

				EDGAR (CONT'D)
		Would you care to see the fly get even?

				KAY
		How far you think you'll get without your
		ship? If that's what you call that hunk of
		space crap we've got back at our office.

				EDGAR
		Put the weapons down!

				KAY
		Never gonna happen, Insect.

Edgar backs away with Laurel, further into the morgue, toward a glass
window that looks out at the base of an air shaft. Jay and Kay advance,
slowly, cornering him.

				JAY
		It's okay, Laurel!

				LAUREL
		HOW is it okay?!

				JAY
		I mean it's going to be okay!

				EDGAR
		Don't bet on it, meat sack.

And with that he turns, leaps --

-- and CRASHES right through the window, into the air shaft.

EXT. MORGUE (SIDE STREET) - DUSK

EDGAR, still clutching LAUREL, EXPLODES up over a railing.

Nobody looks twice as Edgar, dragging Laurel (with his arm over her
mouth), races toward the nearby busy Manhattan Street.

INT. MORGUE - AIR SHAFT - DUSK

Jay and Kay duck into the air shaft and look up -- too far to climb, and
the walls are smooth anyway.

				KAY
		Damn it!

They turn and run out of the morgue.

EXT. THE NEARBY BUSY MANHATTAN STREET - DUSK

EDGAR, with LAUREL, RUNS right in front of a CAB, which screeches to a
halt inches from them. The CABBIE sticks his head out and YELLS something
in an unknown language. And KEEPS yelling as --

Edgar reaches through the passenger side and pulls the Cabbie out the door
(cigarette and wooden seat-beads and all).

The Cab Driver is still yelling as Edgar leaps in, pushing Laurel in
before him, leaving her behind the wheel.

He removes a POSTCARD -- the one he took from the display on the
newsstand.

				EDGAR
		Take me here.

				LAUREL
		What???

Edgar just cranks the car into gear -- opening his mouth and swallowing
the icon -- and in so doing revealing a TRIPLE ROW OF SERRATED BUG-TEETH,
he SLAMS HIS FOOT on the gas pedal.

Laurel's head snaps back as the car rocks forward. She has no choice, but
to grab the wheel and start steering as --

The car screeches out into traffic, swerving wildly as Laurel is forced to
make a 90-degree turn. The car fishtails wildly, swiping an oncoming car
as it straightens and heads into the traffic.

The furious Cab Driver runs off after it, still yelling as he disappears
around the corner.

A second later, KAY and JAY rush out into the street. The cab is nowhere
to be seen. Jay runs into the street, noticing the wooden beads, the
ripped pine-scented green deodorizer, and the still-burning cigarette.

				JAY
		They're in a cab.

And Jay starts running down the street, where DOZENS of cabs are waiting
at the intersection.  He's running from cab to cab, pounding on windows,
scaring the living shit out of people --

				JAY
		Hey! Laurel!? Hey!

-- but Laurel and Edgar are nowhere to be found. Up ahead the light turns
green and the tide of taxis wash away, leaving Jay on the street. He turns
as a car screeches up behind him, its headlights shining in his eyes. As
it gets closer, Jay sees it's Kay in the LTD.

				KAY
		Stop wasting time. He's not getting off the
		planet in a cab.

								CUT TO:

INT. MIB BUILDING - HEADQUARTERS - NIGHT

Jay and Kay rush in from the door under the World's Fair mural, and head
toward the main display screen; all around them, the MIB staffers are in
frenetic activity in response to the threat from above.

				KAY
			(to tech at a desk)
		Come with me. Put up a bio-net all the way
		around Manhattan; if it's not human, it's
		not leaving the island.

				KAY (CONT'D)
		What've we got from our friends upstairs?

				ZED
		Same thing: "Deliver the galaxy."

				KAY
		Yeah, well the bug's got the galaxy, but
		we've got his ship. He's got to be looking
		for a way out.

Just then, a loud ALARM wails.

AT THE MAIN VIEWING SCREEN, A GREEN LINE shoots out from the Arquillian
ship, striking a region of planet earth.

INT. MIB BUILDING - HEADQUARTERS - NIGHT

-- headquarters, where every bell, whistle and light imaginable is going
off.

				JAY
		WHAT THE HELL ARE THEY SHOOTING AT US FOR?!

				ZED
		Arquillian battle rules, kid. First we get
		an ultimatum, then a warning shot, then we
		have a galactic standard week to respond.

				JAY
		A galactic standard week? How the hell long
		is that?

				KAY
		One hour.

				JAY
		One hour?

Viewing the screen, it now reads:
				    MIB
                            DELIVER THE GALAXY
                     OR THE EARTH WILL BE DESTROYED...
                                   SORRY

				ZED
		To keep the bugs from getting it, the
		Arquillians will destroy the galaxy and
		whatever planet it's on.

				JAY
		You're talking about US!

				ZED
		Sucks, doesn't it?

				KAY
		Pull up the locations of all land-based
		interstellar vehicles.

				ZED
		They're all gone. Frank the Pug took the
		last ship on the planet.

As Kay and Zed watch as the machine scrolls through the data, Jay walks
back towards the center of the room, deep in thought. Over him we hear:

				KAY
		Atlantic City?

				ZED
		Gone.

				KAY
		That landfill on the Jersey Shore?

				ZED
		Gone.

				JAY
		Uh, gentlemen.

				KAY
		Epcot?

				ZED
		Gone.

				KAY
		Miami Beach?

				ZED
		Gone.

				JAY
		Fellas.

				KAY
		Hartford?

				ZED
		Gone, thank God.

				JAY
		Hey. Old guys.

Kay and Zed both look up at once, scowling.

				JAY (CONT'D)
		Do those still work?

They follow his gaze, up, over the computer terminals. There, on the wall
in front of them, where it has loomed for the entire movie, is the
enormous mural of the 1964 World's Fair grounds. Most prominent in the
mural are two tall towers that rise dramatically from the ground, topped
by --

-- the two flying saucers from the very first alien contact. As they stand
there, wide-eyed, staring at it, we --

							DISSOLVE TO:

EXT. WORLD'S FAIR - NIGHT

-- the real-live twin towers on the actual fairgrounds in Flushing
Meadows. A taxi SCREECHES to a halt at the edge of a fence a hundred yards
away. EDGAR shoves LAUREL out through the driver's door and follows behind
her, still holding his weapon on her.

				EDGAR
		You're coming with me.

				LAUREL
		What?! Why?!

				EDGAR
		It's a long trip. I'll need a snack.

And he shoves her ahead of him, off in the direction of the space ships.

Behind him, abandoned on the front seat of the cab, we finally see the
front of the postcard he's been carrying around. "FLUSHING MEADOWS, SITE
OF THE 1964 WORLD'S FAIR," it says, with a distinctive photograph of the
spaceships.

So that's how he knew.

								CUT TO:

EXT. COLUMBUS CIRCLE - NIGHT

Nighttime now, and the city hums along, just another Thursday night.  The
clock in Columbus Circle says it's 7:45.

EXT. SIXTH AVENUE - NIGHT

TVs in the window of an appliance store show a rerun of "Cheers." PEOPLE
laugh.

EXT. TIMES SQUARE - NIGHT

The news ticker in Times Square announces the latest shattering news:
		RAIN LIKELY -- TEMPS DROP TO 60'S

EARTHLINGS pass left and right, blissfully unaware of their impending
doom.

								CUT TO:

EXT. MIB BUILDING - NIGHT

KAY and JAY leap into Kay's LTD and SLAM the doors. Kay jams the key in
the ignition, the car ROARS to life, and he turns to Jay.

				KAY
		Whaddya say we bag us some bug?

He hits the gas and the car ROCKETS away from the curb.

EXT. CITY STREETS - NIGHT

The LTD tears through the city.

INT. MIB LTD - TRAVELING - NIGHT

Kay turns sharply to the right, SMACKING Jay around. Looking up ahead, he
sees the entrance to the midtown tunnel.

				JAY
		You're taking the tunnel?!

				KAY
		You know a better way to Queens?

				JAY
		It's usually jammed?!

EXT. MIDTOWN TUNNEL - NIGHT

The LTD races through the tunnel at top speed. It's clear driving for a
few seconds, but then they round a bend --

-- and there's a traffic jam up ahead.

INT. MIB LTD - TRAVELING - NIGHT

Kay approaches the line of cars at top speed, with no intention of slowing
down. Jay, terrified, holds on for dear life.

				JAY
		I told you!

				KAY
		Jay. The button?

				JAY
		Yeah?!

				KAY
		Push the button, Jay.

A LIGHTED PANEL rotates into place between the two front seats, and that
red button flashes underneath its plastic shield again. Jay flips back the
plastic cover and JAMS his finger down on the red flashing button.

				KAY (CONT'D)
		And you may want to throw on a seat belt.

EXT. MIDTOWN TUNNEL - MIB LTD - NIGHT

As the LTD rockets toward the traffic jam up ahead, it begins to evolve,
its shape actually changing. The sides and back extend as some sort of
endoskeleton pushes the "normal" panels out. It becomes a larger, wirier
machine, held together by an elaborate series of mechanical muscles and
metallic tendons.

Kay's car hurtles toward certain death in the traffic jam, but at the last
possible moment it swerves off to the side, a SUCKING SOUND coming from
underneath it.

Instead of banging off the wall of the tunnel, the LTD actually clings to
it. It swerves up, onto the wall and hangs there, racing by the traffic
below.

It keeps going, turning all the way over and driving upside down, wheels
clinging to the roof of the tunnel.

INT. MIB LTD - TRAVELING - NIGHT

Jay falls from his seat with a CLUNK, onto the upside down ceiling of the
car. Balled up on the back of his neck, he peers out the window as they
tear through the tunnel, ZOOMING over the bottlenecked traffic underneath.

As they race through the tunnel, they have a minute to kill.

				KAY
		Mind if I smoke?

				JAY
		What?!?

				KAY
		In the car, I mean.

				JAY
		I don't care!!

				KAY
		Hey, just a common courtesy. It bothers
		some people if you smoke in a car.

He lights a cigarette and blows the smoke out leisurely, one hand on the
wheel, just waiting out the tunnel. Jay gives up struggling to right
himself and closes his eyes, suffering through this.

EXT. MIB LTD - TRAVELING - NIGHT

From outside the car, we watch it rocket along on the roof of the tunnel.
We can hear KAY'S VOICE as he goes on. And on.

				KAY
		Yeah, it's harder and harder to smoke
		anywhere these days. Hell, I suppose I
		should quit. I've tried. Never took,
		though. I'm beginning to think I lack
		self-control.

And they disappear out the other end of the tunnel --

INT. MIB LTD - TRAVELING - NIGHT

-- and flip over, BANGING back down onto the road on the other side. Jay
falls off the ceiling and SLAMS into his seat.

				KAY
		Well, back to work.

He flips his cigarette out the window and cranks the wheel to the left.

EXT. MIDTOWN TUNNEL - TOLL BOOTH - NIGHT

Approaching a toll booth, the LTD shoots across nine lanes of traffic and
through the only open booth, SHATTERING the gate. Traveling at about two
hundred miles an hour, Kay nonchalantly flips a token out the window --

-- and it CHINKS in the basket as their taillights disappear.

								CUT TO:

EXT. WORLD'S FAIR - LANDING TOWER - NIGHT

EDGAR climbs the outside of the landing tower of one of the space ships,
pushing LAUREL up ahead of him, headed for the saucer at the top.

				LAUREL
		Come on, let me go, you don't want to eat
		me. I'm a very important person on my
		planet. Like a queen. A goddess, even.
		There are those who worship me, yes. I'm
		not trying to impress you with this, I'm
		just letting you know. It could start a
		war.

				EDGAR
		Good. War means food for my family, all
		seventy-eight million of them. That's a lot
		of mouths to feed, your highness.

				LAUREL
		You're a wonderful dad.

And with that she KICKS him squarely in the face. He reels, momentarily
losing his grip on her. She takes advantage of the moment and FLINGS
HERSELF out, into the air.

Edgar flails, but she is beyond his reach. She falls, tumbling through the
air --

-- and lands in the branches of a tree. She hits hard, the branches
rattling, and reaches out and hangs on for dear life, high above the
ground.

Above, Edgar just keeps climbing.

EXT. WORLD'S FAIR - NIGHT

Over at the fence, the LTD comes to a looooong, skidding stop at the
fairgrounds.

AT THE TRUNK, JAY and KAY flip open the trunk and scarf up whatever
weapons look most dangerous. Kay grabs a black box, UNSNAPS a row of
latches, and opens it, revealing --

-- the most wicked-looking shotgun on the planet.

Three feet long, triple-barreled, over and under and under, plus a pump
action reloader on top of a storage clip for a dozen more shells. The
shells themselves are solid, glistening like polished steel. Kay loads up
the clip.

				JAY
		You know how to work that?

Kay pumps it once, with extreme confidence.

				KAY
		No idea whatsoever.

He SLAMS the trunk, revealing the flying saucers sitting atop their
columns in the distance.

				KAY (CONT'D)
		Let's bag us some bug.

As if on cue, one of the saucers begins to HUM. Then it starts to spin,
faster and faster. The ship begins to rise.

				JAY
		Oh, shit.

EXT. WORLD'S FAIR - TREE - NIGHT

Laurel sits in her tree, watching with amazement.

EXT. SHEA STADIUM - NIGHT

At Shea Stadium, a Mets game is in progress. Behind the home plate side,
the flying saucer silently rises up in the night sky, plainly visible.

But at that very moment, the batter CRACKS into a fastball, hard. The
crowd rises to its feet, SHOUTING, staring out at center field, where the
ball is headed.

All eyes in the house are on the Mets' CENTER FIELDER, except for his
eyes, which are on the flying saucer behind home plate. His eyes widen,
his jaw drops --

-- and the catchable ball sails over his head, THUDDING into the wall
behind him. The crowd BOOS viciously.

EXT. WORLD'S FAIR - NIGHT

Kay raises the weapon he took from the trunk; looks over at Jay.

				KAY
		Set it to pulsar level five, sub-sonic
		implosion factor --

				JAY
		What?

				KAY
		Press the little green button, on three.

Jay raises his weapon; they press their green buttons.

				KAY (CONT'D)
		One...two...

They pull their triggers.

For a moment, nothing happens, as if it were a misfire. But then, there is
a VACUUM WHUMP, like all the air in the immediate area being sucked into a
space the size of a dime, and a tremendous shock wave rolls out from the
barrel of the guns.

Jay and Kay are sucked to the ground by the bizarre force, THUDDING to
their stomachs like magnets to a refrigerator.

EXT. WORLD'S FAIR - NIGHT

The shock waves wrinkle across the open space between them and the ship,
then it HITS the ship --

-- and it too is sucked back down. Hurtling back toward them.

EXT. LAUREL'S TREE - NIGHT

She flinches as the flying saucer shoots overhead.

EXT. WORLD'S FAIR - NIGHT

The saucer CRASHES through the Unisphere, an enormous steel globe, and
THUDS to the earth, CRASHING through brush, dirt and rock...

Jay and Kay come to their feet...

In front of them, the dust clears... Trees uprooted, stones and dirt
thrown everywhere...a dumpster has been cast to their left...

And the saucer is there, embedded in the earth, tipped off-kilter in a
mound of debris...

A hatch comes up...revealing Edgar, walking slowly toward them, with
contained fury.

				EDGAR
		You don't get it. I've won. It's over.

				KAY
		You are under arrest for violating number
		4-1-53 of the Tycho accord. Please hand
		over any galaxy you might be carrying.

				EDGAR
		You milk-suckers! You don't matter! In a
		few seconds you won't even be matter!

				KAY
		Move away from the vehicle and put your
		hands on your head.

He pumps the gun for emphasis.

				EDGAR
		Put my hands on my head?

Edgar stares at him. Then flexes his arms, still encased in flesh. His
giant pincers RIP free of the rotting skin.

He extends both pincers to the sides, and, my God, his reach must be
twelve feet across.

Now the skin and clothes on Edgar's legs begins to CRACK and SHRED. They
BURST APART, revealing two hideous, doubled-over insect legs. The bug
raises himself aloft on his legs.

He sucks in a deep breath of air, and now the rest of the Edgar suit goes
the way of the arms and legs. The torso EXPLODES in great rendering of
cloth and skin, and finally

Edgar's head simply BURSTS apart, SPATTERING against the walls. Edgar now
reveals himself as he really is: a hairy, bug-like exoskeleton, a scaly
tail with a long stinger, a head like a cobra with elliptical eyes and a
small nose, and two horse-like feet with three toes each.

He raises his pincers in the air, resting them on his head. The GALAXY
hangs on a chain around his neck.

				BUG
		Like this?

Kay and Jay pump their guns and aim at the Bug.

Suddenly the Bug SPITS. And a HUGE, SLIMY WAD OF GOO shoots from him and
engulfs both shotguns. The Bug snorts it back, tearing them from Jay and
Kay's grasp, then swallowing them.

Jay and Kay have only a second to react before --

The Bug SWIPES at them with the back of his clawed hand, like someone
brushing aside a gnat -- and SENDS THEM FLYING FIFTEEN FEET IN THE AIR.

EXT. LAUREL'S TREE - NIGHT

She flinches as she sees them hit the ground. She starts to climb the
tree.

EXT. WORLD'S FAIR - NIGHT

Jay and Kay hit the ground with loud grunts.

				JAY
		That did not go at all like I had planned.

They look up to see the Bug moving for the second tower -- and the second
flying saucer. Kay gets to his feet.

				KAY
		This guy's really starting to bug me.

Kay starts walking after the Bug.

				KAY
		Whatever happens, Jay, don't let him get on
		that ship.

				JAY
		Where are you going?

				KAY
		Getting my gun back.

				JAY
		What!?

Kay steps forward and yells at the departing Bug.

				KAY (CONT'D)
		Hey, Bug!

The Bug just keeps moving toward the ladder.

				KAY (CONT'D)
		I'm talking to you, Bug! You know how many
		of your kind I've swatted with a newspaper?

The Bug turns toward Kay. Kay steps up to him, the small human facing off
against the giant alien hug.

EXT. LAUREL'S TREE - NIGHT

She quietly makes it to the ground -- hurries off to the darkness of the
woods.

EXT. WORLD'S FAIR - ON KAY AND THE BUG - NIGHT

Kay has himself in the Bug's face, its dripping fangs inches from Kay's
face.

				KAY
		You're just a smear on the sports page to
		me, you slimy, gut-sucking, intestinal
		parasite! Eat me!

The Bug reacts -- cranks open its massive jaws with a deafening HISS,
lunges forward, and sucks Kay into his mouth.

The Bug straightens up to its full height and throws his head back. Kay
slides down the Bug's throat, bending it sideways as he kicks and SCREAMS
his way down into its abdomen.

JAY looks on, in stunned horror...

AS THE BUG TURNS TO JAY AND STRETCHES TO ITS FULL HEIGHT and lets loose a
HIDEOUS SCREAMING HOWL OF TRIUMPH.

EXT. WOODS - NIGHT

Laurel is still watching.

EXT. WORLD'S FAIR - ON JAY AND THE BUG - NIGHT

Jay watches as the Bug continues its HOWL OF TRIUMPH...He feels totally
defeated. But...

He can hardly believe his eyes as he looks down at the Bug's stomach...

CLOSE ON BUG'S STOMACH. Through the leathery pouch of the Bug's stomach,
we can just make out the distended outline of the two atomizers...and just
a few inches from it, a HUMAN HAND is reaching toward the gun... KAY!

INT. BUG - NIGHT

Kay, swimming in the Bug's intestinal fluid, tries to make his way to the
gun, Holding his breath. Eyes stinging.

EXT. WORLD'S FAIR - NIGHT

Jay knows what he has to do. He picks up a good-sized chunk of concrete
dislodged by the crashing saucer and hurls it at the Bug.

				JAY
		Hey! Come over here and try that!

The concrete THUNKS off the Bug's shell -- he doesn't seem to notice; just
keeps moving.

Jay picks up a twisted metal pole and runs at the Bug.

				JAY
		Stop right there, or I'll start wailing on
		your waxy, pointed ass!

Jay starts pounding on the Bug with the metal pole.

INT. BUG - NIGHT

Kay almost has his fingers around the stock of the gun -- The POUNDING on
the outside distracts him and he turns -- the gun shifts away.

EXT. WORLD'S FAIR - NIGHT

The Bug grabs the metal pole and yanks it out of Jay's hands. He swings at
Jay -- Jay dodges the blow and falls to the grass.

The Bug slices down with razor-sharp claws at Jay --

-- Jay rolls out of the way, just as the mean-looking claws dig into the
grass.

Jay rolls right underneath the Bug's legs. His hand falls on something in
the grass -- another piece of debris, a sharp metal spike, gleaming like a
dagger. He grabs the metal spike and looks up at the Bug's apparently
vulnerable underbelly, right above him.

He grabs the spike with both hands and is about to thrust the spike up,
into the Bug's gut, when;

The Bug bends its head down between its legs.

BUG'S POV of Jay there, upside-down from this perspective, lurking between
the Bug's legs.

EXT. WORLD'S FAIR - NIGHT

The Bug opens its jaws and SNAPS at Jay -- who propels himself backward
out of harm's way.

The Bug starts climbing the tower. Jay howls in frustration.

				JAY
		What are you, afraid of me? Come on! Stand
		and fight like an arthropod!

In frustration, Jay screams and throws himself on the Bug, hanging onto
its back, trying to drag it down.

				JAY (CONT'D)
		You want a piece of this, huh?! Maybe
		you're a badass in your hive, but this is
		New York City. You're just another tourist
		here!

The Bug flicks him off with his tail -- sending him SAILING twenty feet
through the air.

Jay CRASHES into the dumpster, landing on a heap in front of the garbage.

But, scratched and beat-up, Jay still doesn't quit -- he stands to yell at
the Bug, extending his arm at the creature.

				JAY
		You're messing with the wrong species, Bug --

He notices something on his arm...a cockroach running down his sleeve. He
flicks it off...

Looks down at the ground...sees another roach...looks over to the dumpster
behind him...there are more of them...a whole mob, in fact...fifty or
sixty of the critters, climbing out of a rusted hole in the dumpster...

Jay has one last desperate idea...He kicks at the dumpster -- part of the
side is rusted paper thin and it kicks apart and crumbles to pieces.

TENS OF THOUSANDS OF ROACHES pouring forth from the dumpster, crawling
like a black glittering river, away from the garbage...

Jay leaps to his feet and moves to the glistening mob of insects...

				JAY
		Hey, Bug!

CLOSE ON JAY'S FOOT as he steps on the roach.  CRUNCH.

ON THE BUG as he flinches on the ladder -- he hates that sound.

ON JAY. He smiles.

				JAY (CONT'D)
		If I'm not mistaken, that was a cousin of
		yours.

He knows he's getting to him. He steps toward the Bug -- moving his foot
over another roach.

CRUNCH! He crushes another one.

				JAY (CONT'D)
		Whoa! That had to hurt. And, what d'you
		know, here's your old Uncle Bob!

He steps forward again -- CRUNCH!

ON THE BUG. He turns around, anger burning in his eyes.

INT. BUG - NIGHT

Kay's hand reaches closer and closer to the gun...

EXT. WORLD'S FAIR - ON JAY - NIGHT

Jay keeps moving toward the Bug, finding new roaches to tread on -- holds
his foot over another one.

				JAY
		What's that? Can you hear what he's saying?
		'Help me! Help me!'

CRUNCH. [ON] THE BUG as he starts climbing down the tower and moving
toward Jay.

ON JAY. They are moving toward each other in a show down -- Jay moves on,
poising his foot over another roach.

				JAY
		Ooh! There's a pretty one. That one looks
		kinda familiar, don't you think? I know who
		that is!

The Bug is right over Jay now, jaws dripping ready to gobble him up.

				BUG
		Don't do that!

Jay stares right back at the Bug. Inside, he sees Kay's hand, closing
around the trigger of the shotgun. He brings it around, pointing up,
straight at the Bug's head.

				JAY
		That's your Momma!

He moves to CRUNCH the roach -- The Bug moves to chomp Jay -- Jay stares
up at him, unflinching...

				JAY (CONT'D)
		Didn't she ever teach you not to bite off
		more than you can chew?

and at that very moment...

Kay BLASTS a hole right in the middle of the Bug's midsection. The front
of the Bug's thorax EXPLODES in a shower of bug juice all over Jay.

The Bug flies into two pieces -- the butt end sailing one way; the head
flying behind Jay.

Kay falls out of the Bug, in a mess of goo, gasping for breath, dropping
the atomizer from his slippery fingers.

The other gun sails off into the darkness.

The ICON drops to the ground, rolls over to Jay's feet, and CLATTERS to
rest like a silver dollar on a barroom floor.

He calmly bends down and picks it up. Jay is pissed and starts in on Kay.

				JAY
		You son of a --

Kay holds up a finger in a 'wait a minute' gesture -- pulls out his pocket
phone and hits a number.

				KAY
		Zed. Get a message to the Arquillians.  We
		have the galaxy.

INT. MIB HEADQUARTERS - NIGHT

Zed is standing at the console, a smile on his face. He glances over at
the console that displays alien arrivals and departures on the earth. The
red lights are coming back on.

				ZED
		I think the word's already out. Our friends
		are coming back.
			(then)
		Got an authorized landing at Times Square.
		You and Jay check it out on the way back...
		And pick me up one of those soft pretzels,
		while you're at it. Extra salt. I feel like
		celebrating.

EXT. WORLD'S FAIR - NIGHT

Kay flips the phone closed.

				KAY
		You were saying?

				JAY
		Getting eaten!? That was your plan!?

				KAY
			(shrugs)
		Worked.

As they argue, behind them, unseen, THE FRONT HALF OF THE BUG RAISES
ITSELF UP on its forearms, eyes gleaming with hate, jaws dripping -- ready
to lower itself onto Kay and Jay.

				JAY
		After I got the shit beat out of me!

				KAY
		And I almost got digested. It goes with the
		job.

				JAY
		You coulda told me what you were doing.

				KAY
		There wasn't time, sport!

HISSS! The Bug attacks, swinging its head down on them. They turn to see
it, and just before the jaws snap down on their heads...

BOOM! The Bug's head explodes into a million bits. Bug juice showers down
everywhere, bucketsful of goo drenching Kay and Jay even further.

They turn to see...

LAUREL standing behind the dead Bug, the other atomizer in her hands, the
barrel smoking, the weapon and Laurel dripping the Bug innards.

				LAUREL
		Interesting job you guys got.

ON THE SKY. Bits of Bug juice still flying through the air.

INT. A CAR ON THE ADJOINING FREEWAY - NIGHT

The driver sees something tumbling toward the windshield. He winces.

-- AND THE BUG'S REMAINS SPLAT AGAINST THE WINDSHIELD.

The driver grimaces at the mess.

				DRIVER
		Damn bugs.

He reaches down and hits a button. Wiper fluid squirts onto the windshield
and the wipers spread the bug goo everywhere.

								CUT TO:

EXT. MIB BUILDING - NIGHT

Kay's LTD is parked outside Men in Black headquarters. LAUREL leans her
back against the car.  We see JAY and KAY walking away in the distance.

				JAY
		Look, I know we got rules, but she did just
		bust the Bug for us.  And so maybe you
		don't have to flashy thing her.

Kay pulls out the neuralyzer.

				JAY
		Who's she gonna tell, anyway? She only
		hangs out with dead people.

				KAY
		Not her. Me.
			(looking up at the sky)
		They're beautiful, aren't they? The stars.
		I never just look anymore and they're
		beautiful.

				JAY
		Kay, you're scaring your partner.

				KAY
		I haven't been training a partner -- I've
		been training a replacement.

				JAY
		Oh no, I can't do this job by myself.

				LAUREL
			(walking towards them)
		Hey, guys, we're nowhere near my apartment.
		We're not even on the right island.

				KAY
		Maybe you won't have to.

Kay starts dialing back the neuralyzer.

				KAY
		Days. Months. Years. Always face it
		forwards.

He hands the neuralyzer to Jay. Taps his pocket. Indicates for him to put
his glasses on. Jay resists.

				KAY
		I've just been down the gullet of an
		interstellar cockroach. That's one of a
		hundred memories I don't want.

Jay takes the neuralyzer. Slips on his glasses.

				KAY
		See you around, sport.

Jay raises the neuralyzer. With a brilliant FLASH, the screen turns white.

				JAY
		No, you won't.

								CUT TO:

EXT. NEWSSTAND - DAY

CLOSE ON various tabloid headlines as a hand flicks through them. Here's
one:
			 Mets' Centerfielder Says:
		     "UFO MADE ME MISS HOME RUN BALL!"
And here's another one:
		    DETROIT HAS CAR THAT DEFIES GRAVITY!
			Secret Tests in N.Y.'s Tunnel
And a third:
			MAN AWAKENS FROM 30-YEAR COMA
		        Returns to Girl He Left Behind

A large photograph shows a smiling KAY, arm-in-arm with ELIZABETH RESTON,
his long-lost fiancee, in her back yard in Tempe, Arizona.

She holds a large bouquet of flowers, the same kind he brought but never
gave her thirty years ago.

JAY, who's reading the paper, smiles.

AT THE CURB, Jay hurries back to the LTD with the newspapers. ELLE,
(formerly Laurel), is waiting, leaning against the hood. Tailored black
suit. Black shoes. Short-cropped hair. The look never looked better.

				ELLE
		Zed called. The High Consulate of Regent-9
		emissary wants floor seats to the Knicks --
		Bulls game.

				JAY
		I'll talk to Dennis Rodman, it's his damn
		planet.

				ELLE
		Let's roll.

Both car doors SLAM, Jay drops it in gear, and the LTD BLASTS away from
the curb.

EXT. NEW YORK CITY BLOCK - DAY

The LTD is just one of many cars in a jam-packed Manhattan city block.

FROM UP IN THE CLOUDS

Manhattan itself is just part of a much larger urban and suburban sprawl.

FROM THE STRATOSPHERE

The east coast of the United States is just part of a much larger land
mass.

FROM THE EOSPHERE

North America is just a small portion of the planet Earth.

FROM SPACE

Earth is just a tiny ball in our solar system.

FROM THE MIDDLE OF THE MILKY WAY

Our solar system is just a few blips of light in a vast star field.

FROM OUTSIDE OUR GALAXY

The Milky Way is just a creamy spiral amid innumerable other creamy
spirals.

FROM THE OUTER REACHES OF THE UNIVERSE

There seems to be an edge to what we see, a curved border that seems to
close in on things around the perimeters, until everything that exists
seems to be contained in one tiny ball --

-- which is actually a marble resting on a strange-looking patch of red
dirt.

An ALIEN HAND reaches down and flicks the marble, sending it skittering
and bouncing across the dirt, where it CLICKS into a dozen other big blue
balls just like it.

				FADE OUT.

                           Etan Cohen & Lowell Cunningham





          CLOSE ON A PAIR OF MIRROR AVIATOR SUNGLASSES

          Standard issue throughout the south to abusive, racist prison
          guards.

          Widen to reveal that, indeed, these glasses are on the
          sneering face of just such a man.
          We follow the guard

          DOWN A DINGY PRISON HALLWAY

          Paint peeling off the rusty bars. Somewhere, someone is
          playing harmonica. Prisoners yell complaints as he passes.
          He meets them all with--

                         GUARD
          Shut up, convict! Get yer hands
          off the bars!

          The guard passes through several levels of security doors,
          deeper and deeper into the more secure bowels of the prison --
          home of the scum of the scum.
          Meanwhile...

          PRISON VISITING ROOM

          The lazy-ass guards in charge of screening visitors read
          magazines, watch TV. Footsteps -- someone's here. Which
          pisses them off, because that means they actually have to do
          their jobs.

          The unseen visitor buzzes for help. They take their time
          getting off their asses. When they finally look up, their
          gaze becomes a leer. Follow it to:
          DEVIL GIRL, the visitor. Too tall, too muscled, but hot if
          you're into that kind of thing -- an R. Crumb drawing come to
          life.

          She holds a CAKE -- the cutest, perfectly-frosted pink cake
          right off the cover of the Betty Crocker cookbook.

                         GUARD 2
          Lookie here. Yaz's visitor. I
          guess even a turd gets flies to
          land on it.

                         GUARD 3
          Me, I like a big girl.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          2.
          They smirk, hoping for a reaction. Devil girl emits a low,
          sinister growl like an angry Doberman... The guards look at
          each other and GET DOWN TO BUSINESS:

                         GUARD 2
          I.D., visitation papers.

          BACK DOWN THE HALLWAY WITH THE GUARD
          He reaches the end of the hallway. The biggest, most
          absurdly-reinforced double security door. He punches in a
          code.
          The giant door retracts -- its immense weight has it
          squeaking and groaning the whole way. Whoever's behind this
          thing must've done something REAL bad.

          WITH DEVIL GIRL
          Going through the metal detectors, waved over with security
          wands. The guards are being thorough. Maybe more thorough
          than they need to be. They check everything -- even the
          cake. The digital readout tells them NO METAL DETECTED.

                         GUARD 3
          She's clean. Well, not CLEAN, but
          you know.
          They laugh, buzz her through.

          WITH THE GUARD
          The giant door finally opens, he continues to the end of the
          hallway. Stops in front of a cell. Yells in:

                         GUARD
          Hey, Yaz! You got a visitor.
          Let's go, pretty boy.

                         VISITING ROOM
          Spare. Just a table and chairs in the middle -- poured
          concrete. Nothing a convict could, say, smash into the face
          of a guard.
          The perimeter of the room is lined with armed guards -- looks
          like they're not taking chances.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          3.
          At the lone table -- Devil Girl waits with her cake. She
          hears the door open -- her face lights up as IN STEPS HER

                         BELOVED --
          YAZ, an evil hippie/biker badass right out of Easy Rider. A
          huge mane of hair, a big handlebar moustache that frames a
          grubby unshaven face...
          Everything about him seems strangely independently alive --
          every strand of hair, every fringe on his dirty jacket -- the
          way Elvis was in his prime.
          He wears a distinctive SKULL PINKIE RING. A smirk plays on
          his mouth that says -- I'm smarter than you, asshole.
          The guards escort Yaz, who can barely walk in his CHAINS and
          MANACLES. They dump him into one of the chairs. Devil Girl
          jumps up, they lock in a kiss -- it goes on too long.
          A guard pokes them with his billy club --

                         GUARD 2
          This ain't a conjugal visit.
          quit yer conjugating.

                         YAZ
          When's the last time you conjugated
          anything?

                         DEVIL GIRL
          I brought you a cake.

                         YAZ
          Thanks, darling.

                         (TO GUARDS)
          Hey could you cut this up for us?
          It's our anniversary. I'm romantic
          like that.
          A guard picks up the cake. Smirks and takes a dirty three-
          fingered scoop of frosting.

                         GUARD 2

                         (MOUTH FULL)
          Not great. She must.be good at
          somethin' else.
          They all LAUGH. He goes back for another scoop.

                         YAZ
          I wouldn't do that.

                         GUARD 2
          Why's that, convict?

                         

                         

                         

                         

          4.

                         GUARD POV:
          Where he scraped away the frosting, REVEAL A HORRIBLE ALIEN

                         MOUTH

                         GUARD 2 (CONT'D)

                         WHAT TH--
          But in a flash, the mouth SPRINGS OUT -- IT BELONGS TO A
          VORACIOUS ALIEN -- another springs out behind it -- they
          consume the guard's entire face.

                         YAZ
          That's why.
          The aliens jump into Yaz's hands like a matching pair of
          grotesque ORGANIC SIDEARMS -- as vicious and bloodthirsty as
          their master, snarling and hungry for blood.
          The guards draw their weapons, but YAZ IS FASTER.-- he
          launches his aliens, taking them all out.
          Yaz "holsters" the aliens and...

          THE PRISON BREAK IS ON!!
          One guard, badly wounded, crawls to SOUND THE ALARM
          In the reflection of a pair of blood-spattered aviator
          glasses -- Devil Girl puts the guard down with his own
          weapon.
          She uses one of the cake-aliens like a saw to get Yaz out of
          his chains.

                         YAZ
          There's nothing sexier than a girl
          killing for me.

          She runs a hand over his bicep.

                         DEVIL GIRL
          You got so strong in prison.

          Yaz notices the almost-dead guard:

                         YAZ
          I'm not just a man of brute force,
          you know. I prefer to be known for
          my rapier wit--
          His tongue SHOOTS OUT OF HIS MOUTH -- like a rapier --
          impaling the guard--

                         

                         

                         

                         

          5.

                         YAZ (CONT'D)
          --and tongue.
          The tongue retracts -- he and Devil Girl KISS.
          They collect weapons off the guards and use the aliens to saw
          open the door.

          YAZ AND DEVIL GIRL ESCAPE
          Prisoners go nuts, guards scramble -- smoke, screaming,
          chaos.
          Yaz and Devil Girl, armed with weapons they took off the dead
          guards, BLAST THEIR WAY OUT.
          He's a sociopathic badass... and she's no slouch either.
           Along the way, Yaz shoots the door off the armory and grabs
          an armload of weapons -- Shotguns, pistols, and a Rocket-
          Propelled grenade (RPG).
          He uses and discards them as he goes.
          They head for the front gate and FREEDOM...
          But..
          They turn the corner and find 50 GUARDS in FULL RIOT GEAR --
          Plexiglass shields, helmets, shotguns -- all aimed at Yaz.
          All Yaz has left is his RPG.

          GUARD ON MEGAPHONE
          Give it up, Yaz! There's no way
          out!
          A beat of stand-off -- Yaz and Devil girl facing off against
          the 50 Guards... No one blinking...
          Prisoners. watching... what's gonna go down?

                         GUARD
          You can't win. You've only got one
          shot in there!
          Yaz lets the tension linger -- he seems to enjoy it. The
          guards SWELTER in their heavy riot gear.

                         YAZ
          You look hot. Mind if I open a
          window?

                         

                         

                         

                         

          6.
          The guards share a look - huh?? Yaz grins, turns his RPG
          towards the wall behind the guards. The guards' faces go

          WIDE WITH TERROR.

                         GUARD
          Hey! Whoa! What are you doing?
          Don't do that!

          SLAM!
          Yaz blasts a hole in the wall -- the guards are IMMEDIATELY
          SUCKED OUT like from a hole blown in an airplane.
          What the...?
          Yaz steps through the hole.

                         ON YAZ
          As he and Devil girl step through the hole, take a deep,
          satisfied breath of FREEDOM.
          Reveal we are on...

          THE SURFACE OF THE MOON
          The signage on the prison reads INTERGALACTIC DEPARTMENT OF

          CORRECTIONS, LUNAR DIVISION
          Yaz looks up at the BLUE MARBLE OF EARTH, smiles.
          As Yaz fixes his gaze on our planet, his hair, his fringes
          INDEPENDENTLY ARTICULATE YAZ'S MALEVOLENT EMOTIONS... they
          also seem drawn here. Like bees, they express a collective
          intelligence.

                         YAZ
          I'm coming for you...
          Following Yaz's gaze to the Earth, we launch into...

                         CREDITS
          MiB credits fly us through the Galaxy.
          Ending on a PARTICULARLY INHOSPITABLE LOOKING PLANET
          As it revolves, we observe its strange craters and surface,
          where steaming fissures belch geysers of noxious gases...

          KAY'S VOICE (V.0.)
          When you really think about it, the
          universe is a pretty awful place.
          Full of danger, brutality, and ten
          million kinds of scum. So the
          trick is to find one or two things
          that make life in this cesspool
          worth living.
          And reveal we are actually looking at...

                         PEKING DUCK
          Rotating on a spit.
          JAY and KAY watch this awful duck rotate.

                         JAY
          That? That nasty, greasy thing
          makes your life worth living?
          There's people eating here, younger
          than that duck.

                         KAY
          I was talking about the noodles.
          Best noodles in town.
          And we are in

          INT. CHINESE RESTAURANT - CHINATOWN, NYC - NIGHT

          Tanks everywhere filled with strange fish. An eclectic NY
          crowd eats -- Wall Street guys, hipsters, a Chinese family or
          two, a couple of NYU professor types who love the
          "authenticity" of this place.
          KAY flashes a badge to the OWNER, Chinese.

                         KAY
          Good evening, Mr. Wu.

          MR. WU
          (heavily accented, barely

                         INTELLIGIBLE)
          Kay, Jay... So happy see you... Mr.
          Wu get you regular table...

                         KAY
          Not so fast, Wu. We'd like to take
          a look in the tanks.

          MR. WU
          Yes, you see, very fresh.

                         JAY
          The tanks in the back, Wu.

          MR. WU
          Oh... so sorry... please no
          English, you come back later...

                         JAY
          Hey, save the chop socky bullshit
          for the locals, Wu. We need to see
          the kitchen.

          MR. WU

                         (PERFECT ENGLISH)
          Why are you busting my balls, Jay?

          KAY (O.S.)
          Jay, take a look at this.
          Wu protests, Jay blows by him.

                         THE KITCHEN

                         KAY
          So this is what you're passing off
          as tuna?
          Reveal a giant tank holding a HUGE ALIEN FISH.

                         JAY
          Wow, I didn't think there was
          anything uglier than a catfish.
          Jay taps on the glass -- the fish SNARLS, making Jay JUMP.

                         KAY
          Ugly AND a clear violation of

          foodstuffs.

          MR. WU
          That's an earth fish. Very
          traditional from China. You arrest
          me, that's hate crime.
          They turn their stares on him.

          I guess it would be.

          If you were Chinese!
          Reveal -- from the waist down, Wu has the BODY OF A SLUG.

          MR. WU
          C'mon, I got larvae to feed. And
          earth fish is so expensive. This
          is the only way I could stay
          afloat.

                         JAY
          Look, Wu. You can serve it to
          your... out of town guests, but
          locals get earth fish. REAL earth
          fish. The kind that doesn't jump
          out of their stomach and get
          everyone asking a lot of annoying
          questions. Like, "Why is my lunch
          eating Daddy?" You got it?
          (back to the fish)
          DAMN, that's ugly.

          MR. WU
          Yeah, yeah, thanks guys.

                         KAY
          Aren't you forgetting something?

          INT. CHINESE RESTAURANT - CONTINUOUS

          Wu walks them to a table, seats them.

          MR. WU
          (for benefit of customers)
          Allow me most honorable benefit of
          get you noodles.

                         (FOR GUYS)
          Be right back, guys.
          Wu walks off. Jay CLOCKS the other diners.

                         JAY
          Something about this strike you as
          weird?

                         KAY
          Yeah, look -- clean fork.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          10.

                         JAY
          Look at table two over there. They
          haven't ordered a thing. When's
          the last time Wu let someone sit at
          a table without ordering? And
          table five over there just drank
          his third cup of duck sauce.
          Now Kay's radar is up --

                         KAY
          Come to think of it... Why is Wu
          getting our noodles... outside?

                         JAY
          Because it's about to go down.
          Wu, at the door, closes the blinds. He catches them looking.

          MR. WU
          Sorry, guys.
          Wu leaves, quickly pulling the door behind, him. The guys
          reach for their weapons.
          And IT GOES DOWN --
          It's a SET-UP, and everyone in the restaurant is in on it --
          The hipsters, the families, the wall street guys -- all draw
          various forms of ALIEN WEAPONS and ATTACK
          It's like a close-quarters Mafia hit -- everyone pumping
          truckloads of ordnance at each other. Close hand-to-hand
          combat. Someone wants Jay and Kay dead and they're not
          taking any chances.
          Right ahead of the onslaught, JAY GIVES KAY A HAND SIGNAL --
          He nods, and they dive in opposite directions, SAVING

          THEMSELVES FROM GETTING HIT.
          But not for long...
          An explosive lands between them --
          Kay gets BLOWN OUT THE FRONT WINDOW, rolls to a stop in the
          middle of the

                         DESERTED STREET
          Silhouetted at the top of the block -- a biker on a
          motorcycle. As he pulls into the light -- YAZI

                         

                         

                         

                         

          11.
          Kay's eyes go wide with recognition.
          Yaz grins a murderous grin...

                         YAZ
          Some things are worth waiting for.

                         KAY
          Then come get it, you worthless

                         PIECE OF--
          Yaz guns the engine and BEARS DOWN ON KAY.

          INSIDE WITH JAY
          Getting the worst of it.
          A messy battle THROUGH THE KITCHEN.
          The Giant fish's tank gets shot -- the FISH IS FREE! And he
          goes RIGHT AFTER JAY!

                         JAY
          You probably took that whole
          catfish thing the wrong way --
          The fish SNARLS AFTER HIM -- lunges and BITES!

                         JAY (CONT'D)
          I was jealous, you know? Because
          you're so pretty!
          Jay BATTLES THE FISH-- throwing pots and pans in its mouth,
          squirting hot sauce -- working like a lion tamer to keep it

                         AT BAY--

                         JAY (CONT'D)
          Kay! KAY!!! Little help! Little
          help!

          OUTSIDE WITH KAY
          Yaz getting closer. He pulls out a CANNON of a gun, fires
          into the air.

                         YAZ
          This time you don't have your
          friends to tell you what happens
          next.

          All I wanted was justice, Kay.
          Justice for my brothers. But you
          had to meddle, didn't you?

                         KAY
          They deserved what they got.

                         YAZ
          Why don't you say that to their
          faces when you see them...
          Puts the barrel in Kay's face and BOOM!!!
          Yaz goes up in a GIANT EXPLOSION!!
          Reveal Jay, just fired the shot.
           Jay looks like total hell, beaten up, covered with 8 kinds of
          slime and alien guts.
          He stumbles over to Kay, who in contrast looks perfectly
          pressed.

                         JAY
          So I was thinking about making a
          chart for each time I save your
          ass. And when I do it ten times,
          you buy me lunch.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          13.
          Kay lets out a long, weary sigh.

                         KAY
          Will you settle for a drink?

          INT. DESTROYED CHINESE RESTAURANT

          Kay reaches behind the counter for a couple of beers. Jay is
          on his phone.

                         JAY

                         (INTO PHONE)
          We're gonna need a cleanup on the
          corner of Canal and Mott. And
          bring a net. Biggest one you've
          got.
          Follow Jay's gaze -- the giant fish flops its way down Canal.
          Jay and Kay back in their booth, Jay grabs a couple noodles
          off another table and starts eating.
          Through the scene, various MiB clean-up crew people work the
          crime scene.

                         JAY (CONT'D)

                         (MOUTH FULL)
          Why aren't you eating?

                         (GETS NOTHING)
          So what the hell was that guy?
          Kay's quiet. Ominously quiet. Weighing his words:

                         KAY
          Yaz. Put him away a long time ago.
          Biggest mistake I ever made.

                         JAY
          Why? Was he the wrong guy?

                         KAY
          No. Should've killed him.

                         JAY
          Yeah, well, don't worry, I think I
          took care of him.

                         KAY
          That was too easy.

                         JAY
          I make it look easy. That's the
          problem with being my partner.

                         (MORE)

                         

                         

                         

                         

          14.

                         JAY (CONTD)
          You get used to my game. It's what
          Dr. Phil would call taking for
          granted.

                         KAY
          You don't get it, hoss. This guy
          is different. Worse than anyone.
          He tried to blow up the Earth but I
          stopped him. He developed a
          dislike for me and for certain
          behaviors of mine, such as being
          alive.

                         JAY
          C'mon, you know better {than anyone.
          What does an MiB agent call it when
          12 alien species try to kill him?
          Tuesday.
          Jay laughs at his own joke. Kay just stares.

                         KAY
          Maybe.
          (calling off to cleanup

                         GUYS)
          Make sure you get all of him, I
          mean it! He's an assembler!

                         CLEANUP GUY
          Yes, sir, Agent Kay.

                         JAY
          Seriously, man, those noodles'll
          kill you before he does. I got
          your back.

                         KAY
          I know you do.
          Stares at his noodles a while, like there's answers in there:

                         KAY (CONT'D)
          I used to play a game with my
          daddy. What would you want for
          your last meal. Could do worse
          than this.

                         JAY
          Oh, yeah? I used to play a game
          with my dad, too. Called catch.
          I'd throw the ball, and then it'd
          hit the house `cause he WASN'T

          THERE.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          15.

                         KAY
          Do me a favor, don't badmouth your
          old man.

                         JAY
          Hard to badmouth someone you don't
          know.

                         (CHECKS HIMSELF)
          Alright, forget it. The past is
          the past. And right now we have
          something much more important to
          talk about. Bowling Night.

                         KAY
          I'm tired.

                         JAY
          Tired? What -- you afraid I'm
          gonna take that MVP trophy away
          from you?

                         KAY
          Petrified. See you later.
          Kay takes a few tired steps and turns back --

                         KAY (CONT'D)
          And slick? Watch yourself. A guy
          like Yaz can come after you when
          you least expect it. Anywhere,
          anytime.
          Jay watches Kay walk away. Looks like he's carrying a heavy
          load. Turns his attention to the clean up crew:

                         KAY (CONT'D)
          What part of clean up everything
          don't you understand? There's a
          spleen on that car!

                         CLEANUP GUY
          On it, sir.

                         DARK ALLEY
          A glow of a cigarette illuminates the face of... Devil Girl!
          She reaches down. We see -- a finger with the distinctive
          Skull, inching its way along the road.

                         DEVIL GIRL
          You okay, baby? Momma's got you.
          now.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          16.

          MIB HQ - LATER THAT NIGHT
          Jay at his desk -- papers and folders everywhere -- SEARCHING

          FOR SOMETHING.
          We see what he's looking through -- KAY'S OLD CASE FILES.

                         JAY
          Yaz... Yaz... Yaz... Where are you,
          Yaz...?
          And he FINDS IT!

                         JAY (CONT'D)
          Here we go...
          Jay opens the YAZ INCIDENT REPORT

                         INSIDE:
          - Pictures of Yaz
          - A type-written report telling us YAZ APPREHENDED BY AGENT

          KAY... JULY 16, 1969
          - Farther down on the page, a CASUALTY REPORT: ONE

          CASUALTY... HUMAN DEAD AT THE SCENE...

          ZED (O.S.)
          Ready to bring the pain?
          Reveal Zed in his ridiculous bowling outfit.

          BOWLING ALLEY - LATER THAT NIGHT
          A sign says: CLOSED FOR LEAGUE NIGHT
          We follow a couple normal-looking BOWLERS into

          INT. BOWLING ALLEY

          Safely inside, the Bowlers remove their heads -- which become
          their bowling balls.
          It's the LEAGUE CHAMPIONSHIP GAME -- ALIENS VS. MIB AGENTS
          MiB agents and aliens say hi, exchange trash-talk.
          We see shots of games in progress:
          An alien rolls a ball -- when it gets to the end of the lane,
          it sticks out arms, taking down all the pins.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          17.
          The aliens cheer, slap tentacles, clink beers and swallow
          them whole. A many-armed alien re-sets the pins.
          A giant alien with perfect dainty form approaches the foul
          line... and -- gutter ball! He gets mad and shoots the pins
          with his laser-eyes.
          We end up with JAY AND THE MIB TEAM, NOT BOWLING BECAUSE

          THEY'RE WAITING FOR KAY --
          Zed paces, wearing way too much bowling regalia.

                         ZED
          Where's Kay? We either roll or
          forfeit -- and I didn't put this on
          to forfeit!

                         JAY
          Alright, Bowling Robot, do what we
          built you for.
          Reveal an incredibly high-tech robot wearing one of those
          white trash T-shirts that reads "10 reasons why Bowling is
          better than Women."

                         ROBOT

                         (ROBOT VOICE)
          This is my time to shine.
          Robot fires a ball directly down into the floor. An awkward
          beat as we hear the ball puncture four floors. Then a car
          alarm.

                         ROBOT (CONT'D)
          There goes my perfect game.

                         (ROBOT LAUGH)
          Ha ha ha.

                         JAY
          Guess it's on me.
          Jay rolls -- perfect spin -- Jay watches, willing it towards
          the pins -- which SCRAMBLE OUT OF THE WAY! But Jay's roll is
          too good -- it spins from fleeing pin to fleeing pin -- a

          STRIKE!
          Jay and his teammates triumphant! The frame of a lifetime!
          Jay looks around --

                         JAY (CONT'D)
          Of course -- the one time Kay isn't
          here...

                         

                         

                         

                         

          18.

          MIB HQ - TUNNEL VENT ROOM
          Jay enters -- looks a little worse for wear, like somebody
          who did some celebrating last night.
          We see why -- when he hoists his GIANT, RIDICULOUS MIB

          BOWLING TROPHY.

                         JAY
          Check it out--
          The trophy raises a triumphant fist -- we realize it is in
          fact AN ALIEN.

                         TROPHY
          We're number one! In your face!
          Suck it!

                         JAY
          Look who's league MVP.

                         GUARD
          Big surprise, you win every year.
          That's weird...

                         JAY
          I... huh?

          MIB HQ - HEADQUARTERS
          Jay, in a good mood, flaunts his trophy to everyone in the
          office. The trophy continues its stream of obnoxious trash
          talk.

                         JAY
          Where are you, Kay? I think you
          want to see this. It's the bowling
          MVP trophy with MY name on it.
          Jay works his way to his desk.
          Kay's already at his own adjacent desk -- bent over his work,
          his back to Jay.

                         JAY (CONT'D)
          Maybe you want to think twice next
          time you ditch me.
          Kay, absorbed in work, doesn't answer.

                         JAY (CONT'D)
          Kay?

                         

                         

                         

                         

          19.

          KAY (O.S.)
          (back still to camera)
          Yeah?

                         JAY
          Yeah, I just wanted to show you
          this so I could say--

                         (SEEING HIM)
          Who the hell are YOU???
          Reveal -- CLINT EASTWOOD
          I'm agent Kay.

                         JAY
          You new around here?

                         " KAY"

                         (LAUGHS)
          Good one, partner.

                         JAY
          Yeah, okay, but I need the other
          Kay. You know, craggy old white
          guy... well, DIFFERENT craggy old
          white guy.
          I got you something.
          He hands over a "World's Best Partner" mug --

                         "KAY" (CONT'D)
          Have I told you today how much I
          appreciate working together?

                         JAY
          What the HELL is going on here?
          Why are you pretending to be Kay?

                         " KAY FR
          You seem upset. Let's go get some
          coffee and talk about our feelings.

                         JAY
          How about instead, you go find me
          THIS guy?
          Jay opens the YAZ file and pulls out a picture of KAY. But
          now, splashed across Kay's photo, the words:

          KILLED IN ACTION -- JULY 16, 1969

                         

                         

                         

                         

          20.
          Jay stares at the photo --- in it, we notice Kay is NOW

          WEARING A STRANGE MEDALLION

                         JAY (CONT'D)
          Killed? In 1969?
          Jay grabs the YAZ FILE -- the one he looked through last
          night -- but now everything is different.
          We see -- the incident report stating ONE CASUALTY - AGENT

          KAY, DEAD AT SCENE...
          Jay can't believe it, he keeps reading...
          Snatches of the typewritten incident report
          The casualty report

          ONE CASUALTY... AGENT KAY, DEAD AT SCENE...
          A photo of Kay WEARING A STRANGE MEDALLION.
          Jay stares, struck by this --

                         JAY (CONT'D)
          Kay's dead? How? Why?
          The Men in Black Computer/Big Board sounds the alarm!

          Damn. Welp, looks like we're all
          done for. Sorry, kid, it's been a
          good ride.

          A GENERAL FREAK-OUT ENSUES
          Jay remains calm:

                         JAY
          Whoa, what's everyone freaking out
          about? We had one of these last
          week.
          "Kay" hides under a desk, weeping.

                         "KAY"
          We're all gonna die!

                         JAY
          Wait - what is everyone's problem?
          What about that pan-galactic
          missile shield thing?

          Sure, great idea, if we had one.

           COMPUTER (V.0.)
           Now running pan-galactic shield
          simulation.
          We see the missiles being shot down.

          Conclusion: 6.72 billion lives
          saved. With shield...
          (shows Earth saved)
          without shield...
          (shows Earth destroyed)
          Sorry to say I told you so.

                         ZED
          I wanted to build one years ago,
          but Kay talked me out of it.

                         JAY
          Kay talked you out of it? Kay
          wouldn't do that. He's the most
          distrustful person in the galaxy.
          He personally set up that system to
          defend our planet from the scum of
          the universe.

          I thought we didn't have any
          enemies anymore. A stranger's just
          a friend you haven't met.

                         JAY
          Yeah, that's working out great.
          Look, I don't know what's frying
          everyone's brains, but I remember
          the missile shield --- Kay -- the
          real Kay -- loved that thing. He
          wouldn't shut up about it. I mean,
          that thing was all Kay.

                         (REALIZING)
          But Kay's dead. He's been dead for
          years. But I knew him yesterday.
           Jay looks at the YAZ file. Gears turning. He grabs a
          picture of Yaz --

                         JAY (CONT'D)
          Where the hell did he.get an iPhone
          in 1969?

          EXTREME CLOSE UP ON PICTURE --
          Peeking out of Yaz's jacket -- an iPhone.
          Something clicks --

                         JAY (CONT'D)

                         (REMEMBERING)
          Kay said Yaz can get you anywhere,
          anytime. Any TIME. So Yaz killed
          Kay in 1969 and now there's no
          missile shield.
          Jay realizes something and RUNS OFF

                         OKAY"
          I love you, Jay!

                         JAY
          You're definitely not Kay!

          JAY RUNS THROUGH MIB
          He runs by people dealing with the world coming to an end:

          COMPUTER (V.0.)
          Nine minutes to impact. I always
          loved you, microwave...

                         

                         

                         

                         

          23.
          On the microwave -- it beeps plaintively.
          Jay runs off with purpose...

          STREETS OF NYC
          July in the city. A perfect summer day. Kids eat ice cream.
          Old ladies head to matinees. The streets of New York team
          with humanity, blissfully unaware that they are about to die.
          In other words, a Tuesday.
          Jay runs through Time Square, where guys sell stuff on
          blankets.
          Desperately looking for someone...
          Among the sellers, a suspicious-looking guy wearing a strange
          mixture of anachronistic clothing -- tri-cornered hat.
          As soon as he sees Jay, his eyes go wide and HE FLEES.
          Jay grabs something off the blanket and smacks him -- lays
          him out.

                         JAY
          Where you going in such a hurry,
          Obadiah? The past?

                         OBADIAH
          What are you talking about?
          He throws his arms up, revealing a pocket watch and a
          telescope.

                         JAY
          I know you've been time-travelling.

                         OBADIAH
          No way, man. I've just been here,
          totally legit, here in New
          Amsterdam. I mean -- Manahatta ... n
          I'm legit.

                         JAY
          Yeah? What's this?
          Reveal the thing he just hit him with -- a ship's bell with
          S.S. TITANIC on it.

                         OBADIAH
          I swear, I'm out of that. That's
          my grandmother's.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          24.

                         JAY
          What else you got here?

                         OBADIAH
          Nothing, nothing man.

                         JAY
          Oh, yeah?
          Off a Dodo in a cage.

                         JAY (CONT'D)
          Is that a dodo bird?

                         OBADIAH
          Family pet.

                         JAY
          I think he'd be happier free.
          Jay frees the bird -- it runs, squawking...

                         OBADIAH
          Oh, come on, man!

                         JAY
          Interesting.
          Jay picks up Spider-Man 8 off the blanket. Featuring
          chubby, bald 50-year-old Tobey Maguire.

                         OBADIAH
          That's pirated, man. That ain't
          nothing.
          Jay rips open his jacket --

                         JAY
          And this?
          Reveal a copy of the Declaration of Independence..

                         OBADIAH
          Okay, okay, maybe I've been time
          travelling a little -- just for
          personal use, man, just enough to

                         GET BY--

                         JAY
          Listen -- I'll look the other way
          if you tell me who's selling time
          travel these days. I just want
          your supplier.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          25.

                         OBADIAH
          No way, man. You don't mess with
          that guy. He'll kill you, me, and
          then he'll go after our families!

                         JAY
          Don't worry, he won't have time.

                         OBADIAH
          What do you mean?
          Jay forces the guy to look up-- we see the missiles.

                         JAY
          Those hit the sun in 8 minutes.
          You want to live out those minutes?
          Or you want me to take you out of
          your misery?
          Jay picks up an ancient weapon -- crossbow, blunderbuss --
          off the blanket and puts it to the criminal's head.

                         OBADIAH
          Okay, okay, but don't say I didn't
          warn you, man. You just signed
          your own death warrant.

                         JAY
          I just want a name.

                         OBADIAH
          Fine, but it's the last one you'll
          ever hear.

          back tomorrow.

                         JAY
          Yeah, well, the thing about
          tomorrow is, we'll all be busy
          being dead.

                         TREVOR

          Everyone thinks their computer
          problem is the world coming to an
          end.

                         JAY
          Right. Take a look at this.
          Jay directs Cera's sightline to the sky--

                         TREVOR
          Ahhh! What is THAT?

                         JAY
          That, is We're all dead in... Seven

          You only need seven minutes, get
          the cheap one.
          He grabs Trevor-

          Okay, okay, I'll show you. But
          this is incredibly powerful
          technology, so it must remain
          absolutely secret. Follow me.
          Trevor LEAVES HIS POST --- Jay follows:

                         TREVOR (CONT'D)
          Absolutely secret, do you
          understand?

                         JAY
          Yes, but we're running out of time--

          AFFLUENT WESTSIDE MOM
          Hey! Excuse me!

                         TREVOR
          With you in a second, ma'am.

          AFFLUENT WESTSIDE MOM
          It'll only take a minute. You see,
          my nanny's phone number got erased
          from my favorites and I have to ask
          her what my daughter wants for her
          birthday.
          Jay takes the phone.

                         JAY
          Oh, I see the problem.
          He CHUCKS THE PHONE across the store, where it SMASHES TO
          PIECES. She leaves in a huff.

                         TREVOR
          I've always wanted to do that.
          okay, so here's what you do...
          Trevor pulls Jay in, ready to lay this top secret information
          on him...

                         TREVOR (CONT'D)
          Okay, so go to the clock app. And
          shake it.

                         JAY
          That's it?
          Jay does it.

          Now you just type in the year you
          want to travel to...
          On the phone -- it's "augmented reality" -- the image through
          the phone is the image of the targeted time period.

                         JAY
          Okay, thanks.

                         TREVOR
          Now listen. This is highly
          crucial: Time travel is nothing to
          mess with. You can't change
          anything, you can't use new
          technology or all of space-time can
          just -- kablooey!

                         JAY

                         (OFF MISSILES)
          Yeah, well, is it ok if I change

          THAT?

                         TREVOR
          Yeah. Right. Yeah, that's cool.
          Jay is about to "enter" time travel...

                         TREVOR (CONT'D)
          Wait -- hold on a second. If you
          go -- I'm just gonna stay... and be
          dead?

                         JAY
          Don't worry, I'll fix it. You'll
          only be dead for a little while.
          Jay DISSOLVES INTO A TIME TRAVEL EFFECT...
          Cera is left alone. The missiles get EVER CLOSER...
          Trevor opens a "Voice Recorder" app:

                         TREVOR

                         (INTO PHONE)
          Trevor's last words. Dear
          posterity... Should anyone find
          this, let history remember that
          Trevor was a man of noble bearing,
          quiet dignity --

          (IMPACT!)

                         OH FUUUUUU-----

                         

                         

                         

                         

          29.
          And the world is vapor.

          EVERYTHING GOES WHITE...

                         WHITE
          Pure white.
          Jay comes to, groggy, like he has the worst hangover of all
          time, brain bigger than his skull, trying to make his eyes
          focus.
          Trying to make sense of his strange blinding white
          environment -- Is this the afterlife?
          The reverie disrupted by a TOILET FLUSH
          The white resolves into

          INT. BATHROOM

          Jay realizes he's in a men's room, sitting in a urinal. The
          music transitions: Whatever hip-hop featuring a 60s sample
          was playing in the Apple store -- now continues as the 60s
          song itself, played over a tinny portable radio.
          He hops up just as a young white office worker comes out of
          one of the stalls, washes his hands... and flips Jay a
          quarter.
          Jay stares at it a beat, confused. Misreading his confusion,
          the office worker awkwardly digs out another quarter.

                         OFFICE WORKER
          What the heck, you're doing a great
          job.
          The kid leaves.
          Jay ventures out of the bathroom and finds himself in...

          INT. HIGH 60'S OFFICE

          White guys on IBM Selectric typewriters as far as the eye can
          see -- like the office in the Apartment.
          Jay stops in his tracks, taking in the 1969-ness of it all.
          An officious guy, annoyed, runs up--

                         

                         

                         

                         

          30.

                         OFFICIOUS GUY
          You're late! Where's Mr. Watkins'
          lunch?

                         JAY

                         OH--

                         OFFICIOUS GUY
          Did his girl not put in the order?
          The officious guy glares at the "girl" -- in her 60s.

                         HAND)
          Run down to Woolworth's -- Two
          hamburger sandwiches, fries, egg
          cream, and a pack of luckies. If
          you're back in half an hour, you
          can keep the change.
          Jay looks at the SINGLE DOLLAR BILL.

          OFFICIOUS GUY (CONT'D)
          On the double, OK?

                         JAY
          Yeah.
          Jay's moves to the elevator, waits for it. Pockets the
          profits of the racist misunderstandings.
          Elevator opens, the elevator operator opens the door -- Jay
          climbs in with a car full of older executives.
          Jay shakes his head, just taking this all in.

                          JAY (CONT'D)
          Wow. 1969. You're all dead now.
          Just as the elevator's about to close, a leggy blonde tosses
          him a set of keys.

                         BLONDE
          The Big Man wants his caddy. Chop-
          chop.
          The doors close.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          31.

          EXT. PARKING LOT NEXT DOOR

          Jay's got the keys. He looks at the parking tag, walks down
          a row of beautiful classic cars, looking for the right car --
          stops and smiles.

          THE BIG MAN'S CADDY - JAY DRIVING
          Reveal Jay cruising in the most gorgeous 1964 Coupe deVille
          convertible. Fins, chrome, a thing of beauty.
          From the seat next to him -- a fedora. He puts it on,
          completing the look.
          In the background we notice the Leggy Blond getting yelled at
          by the guy who must be "The Big Man" Jay HONKS and waves --
          thank you!
          Jay finds some classic 60s music and enjoys himself for a
          minute -- a sweet ride through 60s New York.
          A GREAT 1969 HIT -- THE TEMPTATIONS' "Can't Get Next to You"
          comes on the radio. Jay is swept up in the music and soon is

          SINGING ALONG AT FULL BLAST.
          At a light, he pulls even with an older Brooklyn Italian
          couple. They give him a disapproving look. The woman
          clutches her pearls just a little more protectively.
          He smiles and leans towards them.

                         JAY
          Guess what? Black president!
          He laughs and drives off.
          Pulls up at...

          EXT. MIB HQ ENTRANCE/VENTILATION BUILDING

          The secret entrance to MiB HQ, familiar from the first movie.
          Jay strides up to the entrance and... can't open the door.
          Bangs on the door -- nothing. Shaking the knob, calling to
          the guard... nothing. From behind him:

          VOICE (O.S.)
          Help you? Look a little lost.

                         JAY
          Yeah, thanks, listen--

                         

                         

                         

                         

          32.
          Jay turns and is face-to-face with two grinning Staten Island
          cops. He instantly realizes what's about to go down.

                         JAY (CONT'D)

                         (SIGHS)
          Yeah, guess I knew this wasn't
          gonna be just people handing me
          money and Cadillacs.

                         COP 1
          'Scuse me?

                         JAY
          Nothing, officer. I'll be on my
          way.

                         COP 2
          That's an awful nice car.

                         JAY
          Thanks.

                         COP 1
          Kind of work you do, individual of
          your particular... ethnic
          persuasion... to buy a car like
          that?

                         COP 2
          Wouldn't be anything illegal, would
          it?

                         COP 1
          You an athlete or something?

                         JAY
          Yeah, I'm the North American
          champion of kiss my ass.
          The cop loses his smile, turns to his partner:

                         COP 1
          That sound like resisting arrest to
          you?

                         COP 2
          Sure did.
          They grab him, start to frisk him --

                         COP 2 (CONT'D)
          Well, well. Boy, you're gonna have
          a little problem explaining THIS.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          33.
          The cop holds up Jay's HIGH-TECH GUN -- the NOISY CRICKET
          and his NEURALIZER.
          A BLACK CROWN VIC SCREECHES UP between the cops and JAY.
          Out steps KAY -- but 40+ years younger.

                         KAY
          (flashes a badge)
          I'll take it from here.

                         COP
          Who the hell are you?

                         KAY
          Agent Kay, Division 2, special...
          (gives Jay a look)
          .black ops. Thank you for your
          cooperation, if I could ask you to
          look here for a moment --
          Kay pulls out what looks like a NEURALIZER -- and swiftly
          beats each one over the head -- it's just a BLACKJACK -- they
          crumple.

                         JAY
          Kay? Kay, is that you? Oh, man
          it's good to see you, buddy!
          Jay hugs Kay -- who remains stony-faced. Jay gets a little
          choked up to see his friend alive -- Kay is a rock.

                         JAY (CONT'D)
          Look at you, all... sort-of-
          young... Kay!

                         KAY
          That's got to be the first time an
          unregistered alien caught sneaking
          onto Earth was happy to see me.
          Jay pulls away, realizing--

                         JAY
          Oh! You think -- aw,that's funny.
          No, it's not like that. You see,
          I'm your partner.

                         KAY
          If I had a partner I'd know it.

                         JAY
          There's a simple explanation for
          that.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          34.

                         KAY
          I'm all ears.

                         JAY
          You see I'm your partner...
          (knows he's about to sound

                         CRAZY)
          In the future. And I came back to
          save you.
          A longdry stare.

                         KAY
          Well, thank you very much.

                         JAY -
          Hey, no problem, man. I got you--

                         KAY
          Yeah, thought I'd heard them all.
          Usually, they offer a great gift to
          the people of Earth in exchange for
          refuge. Time-travelling partner
          from the future -- that's some
          extra-credit right there, and I do
          appreciate you bringing some much-
          needed variety to what can be a
          very dull job. But I'm still gonna
          have to bring you in.

                         JAY
          Yeah, ok, I know it sounds a little-

                         KAY
          It sounds a LOT--

                         JAY
          That's why I'm going to prove it to
          you... Because if I weren't from
          the future, would I know about --
          your little top-secret headquarters
          right HERE??
          He tries to force the door open. Nothing.

                         JAY (CONT'D)
          I said -- HERE?
          (tries - nothing)

          HERE??!?
          Jay finally kicks the door open --
          And inside... we SEE...

                         

                         

                         

                         

          35.
          An abandoned building, filled with spiders, etc.

                         JAY (CONT'D)
          Right. Not here yet. But it will
          be. Gonna need to get rid of the
          raccoons and bats and stuff, but...
          it'll be real nice. Game room over
          there for your pinball, you love
          your pinball. Lotta good times
          there -- I'm going for an extra
          ball, Jay! you'd say. And I'd be
          there. With you. Partners.
          Long stare from Kay.

                         KAY
          Let's go. And word of advice -= I
          don't know what it's like on your
          planet, but around here, a guy with
          your... complexion in a car like
          that is gonna get some attention he
          doesn't want.

          EXT. NEW JERSEY STATE PARKWAY

          We hear the way-too-loud death-rattle exhaust note of what
          sounds like ten Harleys at once.
          Reveal -- Yaz, the nightmare biker, looking like Dennis
          Hopper meets Satan, riding a badass custom skull-themed rig
          that might have dropped out of the brain of Stanley Mouse.
          His skull ring gleams on his pinkie. Devil Girl sits behind
          him, hands on his shoulders.
          We ride with them a beat, tearing down the highway...
          They STOP AT A LIGHT -- even with a brightly-painted microbus
          full of hippies.
          One of the hippies leans out --

                         HIPPIE
          Hey, you guys like to party? Care
          to make a trade for the mama?
          Yaz pulls out his alien "guns." The stoned hippie smiles
          serenely and puts a flower in one of the mouths. Makes a
          peace sign.

                         HIPPIE (CONT'D)
          Make love, not war.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          36.
          Yaz "fires" the alien -- it launches into the microbus --
          followed by its brother.
          The microbus rocks, hippies scream, the bus dents from the
          inside-out. On a bumper sticker: If This Van's a-rockin',
          don't come a knockin'.
          The guns, finished, return to Yaz.
          Yaz surveys the carnage, picks up a medallion off one of the
          hippies. But looking at it more closely, frowns and throws
          it away.
          The head back on their way... Blood drips over the Ass, Gas
          or Grass bumper sticker...
          We dissolve from the blood to a deep red STRAWBERRY SUNDAE.
          Widen to reveal we are in...

          INT. HORN AND HARDART'S

          A great NYC automat...
          The kind of place you go when you like to be alone.
          Loners and weirdos populate the tables, minding their own
          business. Immigrants read foreign papers.
          Jay follows Kay as they walk by the glorious deco machines
          offering pies... pastries.., beverages...

                         JAY
          Is this your favorite place? Makes.
          sense. Zero human interaction.
          Kay ignores him.

                         JAY (CONT'D)
          So how old are you?

                         KAY
          Twenty-six.

                         JAY
          Really? Wow, you got some city
          miles on you.
          Jay laughs. Kay ignores him, stops in front of a machine
          offering "SPECIALS".
          Jay grabs a paper off a nearby table: We see headlines about
          Nixon, Vietnam, the Apollo Launch.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          37.
          Jay looks at the date: July 14, 1969.

                         JAY (CONT'D)
          The fourteenth. Then we have two
          days.
          Kay really takes his time, picking out the right sandwich.

                         JAY (CONT'D)
          Hey, look, I know your lunch is
          important, but like I said, we only
          have two days here.

                         KAY
          Here we go...
          Kay puts some money in the machine -- is about to make his
          selection. Jay reacts to it -- GROSS!
          We see -- the most unappealing ham sandwich ever. The meat
          is tinged with green and beginning to get a little fuzzy. No
          one in their right mind would buy this sandwich.

                         JAY
          No way, man. I am not letting you
          eat that. I didn't come all the
          way here to have you die before I
          can tell you--
          Kay reaches for the button. Jay slaps his hand away.
          A BEAT of undignified hand-slap-fighting--

                         JAY (CONT'D)
          No way, man. No way the world ends
          because you had to eat that thing--
          Kay SUCCEEDS IN HITTING THE BUTTON and

                         FWOOOOOOPI
          A SECRET DOOR instantly spins them around and Jay and Kay are

          INT. MIB 1969 HQ

          A cloud of smoke... It clears and reveals
          Mid-century futurism with a martini lunch office vibe. It's
          how Isaac Asimov and Ray Bradbury would have imagined the MiB
          offices.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          38.
          The cloud of smoke comes from everyone smoking. Aliens run
          around with ashtrays, cocktail shakers and cigarettes. The
          alien smokers smoke from surprising orifices.
          The !liB agents have the feel of ivy league privilege. Very
          male and very white. Women are there to be secretaries and
          eye candy.
          Two many-armed aliens stock the automat. Kay tosses one the
          sandwich, it goes right back into the automat.
          Jay recognizes the aliens -- it's the twins!

                         JAY
          Hey! [long alien name] and Bob!
           Don't worry, you guys get a big
          promotion in, like, 20 years.
          Kay takes Jay down an escalator. Quick atmospheric
          establishing shots of MiB '69:
          - A wall of Black and White TVs monitoring the aliens of the
          times: Castro... Yoko... Hendrix...
          - A cluster of agents use a joystick to manipulate a very
          high-tech camera. Reveal they're using it to watch a
          secretary's ass. She gets wise, turns -- they raise their
          martinis and she giggles at them: You're incorrigible!
          - Aliens work switchboards, work in the steno pool.
          - Someone barks at an alien to grab a couple Mooners and go
          clean something up.
          - An MiB barbershop quartet practices.

                         MIB QUARTET

                         (SINGING)
          The men in blaaaaaaack...
          Jay can't help laughing --

                         JAY
          What planet are they from?

                         KAY
          The Hamptons. Let's go somewhere
          we can talk.

                         JAY
          Finally.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          39.

          INT. HOLDING ROOM

          Typical interrogation room table in the middle.
          Kay pulls out a giant form -- it looks like 10 tax returns
          stacked together. He fits sheets of carbon between the
          pages.

          There's a killer out there. Goes

          You told me your one regret was not
          killing him when you had the

          Never heard of any Yaz.

          You will. Here's what to look for.
          Long hair, leather, looks kind of
          like a biker. You'll know him from
          the skull ring on his pinky. He's
          trying to blow up the Earth and you
          get in his way somehow so he kills
          you. This Friday. In Florida.
          So, if you want to live -- do not
          go to Florida.

                         KAY
          Florida? I hate Florida. I hate

          Man, you're as stubborn as you
          always were. I mean -- always will
          be. Look, It's not just about you.
          Because he kills you, you don't
          live long enough to build the
          defense shield. And without a
          defense shield, the Earth gets
          destroyed. You get it? He kills
          you, the Earth gets destroyed. I
          have to save you from him so we can
          save the planet.

          Kay and the orderlies are on him. The pissed-off orderlies
          grab him roughly, force him onto the gurney. Jay keeps
          flailing.

          Damn. You will! I swear!
          Kay signals -- the Neuralizer powers up.
          And Jay is on the conveyor belt into the machine. This is
          all about to be over. Jay thinks desperately for a way out,
          THEN-- Eureka!!

          But this being TUBE TECHNOLOGY -- we stay with JAY'S
          TERRIFYING POV -- as he slides through the claustrophobic
          Neuralizer chamber -- the tubes powering down just in time,
          inches away from him.
          Jay crawls out of the Neuralizer, shaken.

          You see, Kay? It's me--

          In the center, a GIANT ROCKET, all chrome and Flash Gordon.
          It formed the crater on landing.

                         KAY
          We're going in.
          Kay draws his weapon.

                         JAY
          Aren't you gonna give me a.gun?

                         KAY
          Right.
          He pulls out a Smith and Wesson, dumps the bullets, and hands
          it over.

                         KAY (CONT'D)
          Try not to get in my way.

                         JAY
          You try not to get in MY way.
          Jay and Kay move towards the building... BAM! BAM! BAM!!
          Someone's firing at them -- they dive for cover.
          More GUNSHOTS --
          Jay gives Kay THE SIGNAL, WE SAW IN THE CHINESE RESTAURANT

                         KAY
          What the hell is that?

                         JAY
          Stay behind me. You need to stay
          alive.

                         KAY
          The hell I will.
          Jay tries to go in -- Kay pushes him out of the way and goes
          in first.

                         VINCENZI BROTHERS
          Jay and Kay bust in -- almost fall into the room because
          they're squabbling over who's first --
          Then - BAM!

                         

                         

                         

                         

          49.
          Someone's hiding under a desk, holding a gun over his head,
          firing randomly.
          Kay gets GRAZED --
          They dive for cover. Kay's right hand is bleeding.

                         JAY
          Huh. So that's how you got the
          scar.
          Jay tosses his EMPTY GUN into the corner -- the guy under the
          desk fires FIVE TIMES - EMPTYING HIS GUN!
          Jay sprints at him, flips the table -- it's a terrified,
          quivering WISEGUY. Jay grabs him and DISARMS HIM.
          The guy is FREAKED OUT.

                         WISEGUY

                         [TERRIFIED BLUBBERING]

          Jay SLAPS THE GUY.

                         JAY (CONT'D)
          The guy who did this --- what'd he
          look like?

          Looked like a biker... And he had

          Jay and Kay share a look.

          He walks to the trunk, pops it open.
          He flips a switch, revealing a HIDDEN ARSENAL.
          He grabs a COOL GUN and gives it to Jay. Jay admires the

          They laugh.
          Yaz smiles sadly.

          Have you ever lost someone close to

          He gives the cops a picture, they take it grudgingly -- we
          see it: a half dozen hippies wearing medallions.
          The cops look at each other and raise eyebrows.

          A WAY-OUT 60'S PARTY
          Kay's on the hunt for someone. They weave their way through
          the far-out types, hear snippets of high-60s party
          conversations.
          Someone notices Jay's suit --

          We need to talk.
          Reveal ANDY WARHOL -- and this is the Factory, and this is
          one of Warhols' famous parties.
          Draped on Warhol -- a bunch of strange hangers-on, his
          "stars."

          Yum, pigs are getting cute.

          I meant the young one.
          Warhol speaks with his strange -- yes, almost alien --
          affect.

          WIG, lights a cigarette, and talks like a hard-nosed cop.

          I thought you made that up.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          57.

                         KAY
          C'mon, W, I got a feeling on this
          one. Like we should take it
          serious. And we don't have much
          time.
          Jay checks his watch.

                         JAY
          33 hours.

                         WARHOL
          Yeah, yeah, alright.

                         (THINKS)
          Okay, talk to Prell and Vidal.
          C'mon.

          IN THE PARTY
          ON TWO BEAUTIFUL WOMEN - in very 60s fashion with incredibly
          giant hair - one with a big afro, one with big chignon
          hairdo.

          WARHOL (O.S.)
          (back in "character")
          Vidal, Prell, can you please talk
          to these nice men?
          The women's LIPS DON'T MOVE -- they respond in incongruously

                         GRUFF VOICES:

                         PRELL
          Whadaya want?

                         VIDAL
          They look like cops to me.
          ain't talking.

                         PRELL
          We're not rats.
          We swing around them to REVEAL that Warhol/Kay/Jay are not
          talking to the women's faces --
          They're STANDING BEHIND THE WOMEN -- TALKING TO THEIR HAIR-
          DO'S which we realize are two COMPLETE HAIR ALIENS, VIDAL and
          PRELL, perched atop these women.

                         KAY
          Start talking, you two, before you
          end up on a barber's floor.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          58.

                         PRELL
          Ah, you don't scare me.

                         KAY
          Yeah?
          Kay reaches into a passing woman's purse, pulls out
          HAIRSPRAY. Grab some of Prell and holds up the spray.

                         PRELL
          You wouldn't!
          He sprays the hair, it starts to SCREAM IN PAIN.

                         VIDAL
          Stop, you bastard!

                         PRELL
          I'm telling you, we don't know
          anything!

                         KAY
          You wanna play tough? How about we
          take a ride to the barber college,
          see how tough you are?
          Kay keeps shaking them down, but Jay is distracted...
          On Jay... something is making him think...
          A sound... it. grows louder... we start to be able to make out
          the distinct bip... bip... bip... of PONG
          Jay FOLLOWS THE SOUND...
          To a group of people -- that incredible Factory mix from
          slumming socialites to Black Panthers to the freakiest
          freaks...
          They surround a SKANKY GUY -- and whatever they're watching
          on TV is so mesmerizing it's like they're seeing the face of
          God...

                         BROOKE ASTOR
          It's too beautiful.
          Someone takes a picture of the screen.
          Jay walks around the TV -- REVEAL:
          They're watching CLASSIC EARLY 70S PONG.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          59.
          The SKANKY GUY controls it via a BIG MEDALLION hooked up to
          the TV antennae terminals. He's playing against a young
          clean-cut square.
          Jay grabs the wires and rips them out, cutting off the game.
          Everyone JEERS him.
          ON KAY, hearing the noise, turns to see what's going on.

                         SKANKY GUY
          What the hell, man?

                         JAY
          Just wondering where you got that.

                         SKANKY GUY
          Your mother.
          The crowd laughs.

                         JAY
          Really. So my mother gave you a
          technology that hasn't been

          INVENTED FOR SEVEN YEARS?
          Jay grabs him by the throat.
          Partygoers react. Someone takes pictures. Someone claps in
          delight.

                         JAY (CONT'D)
          Now how about you tell me where you
          really got it?
          The skanky guy knows he's in trouble.

                         SKANKY GUY
          Oh... uh... okay, no hassles,
          man... I got it from that dude over
          there... With the beard.
          Jay turns, lets go just long enough for the guy to LEAP OUT

                         THE WINDOW
          Jay takes off after him -- Kay joins
          And the CHASE IS ON

          CHASE THROUGH THE VILLAGE
          Jay and Kay chase the guy through various 60s locations - a
          commune, an ashram, a folk club, a protest.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          60.
          Everywhere they are mistaken for "pigs" - people get in their
          way.
          To Jay's surprise, young Kay is a hell of a runner, in
          incredible shape. It gets competitive between them...
          Until Jay can't keep up -- Kay takes off...
          Kay runs the Skanky Guy down -
          Jay huffs and puffs his way over, grabs the medallion.

                         JAY
          Alright, one more time. Where'd
          you get this?

                         SKANKY GUY
          It was a gift--

                         JAY
          Bullshit.
          Kay puts a gun on him.

                         JAY (CONT'D)
          Oh, hey. This is my partner. He's
          about to get fired for excessive
          violence and he doesn't have much
          left to lose.

                         SKANKY GUY
          I borrowed it!
          CLICK! Kay cocks the gun.

          SKANKY GUY (CONT'D
          I stole it, okay?

                         JAY
          That's what I like. A nice, honest
          thief. Stole it from who?

                         SKANKY GUY
          They don't even care, man. They
          leave their money everywhere.

                         JAY
          Who?

                         SKANKY GUY
          I don't know who they are--

                         

                         

                         

                         

          61.

                         KAY
          Then you're not worth much to us,
          are you?
          The gun comes back out.

                         SKANKY GUY
          I heard they were Archanans.

                         JAY
          Archanans? They're pretty far out
          of their neighborhood. I didn't
          think we'd ever had one on Earth
          before.

                         SKANKY GUY
          I can tell you where they live!
          Southwest corner of 3rd and Avenue
          C. Top floor. Apartment 12.
          Jay rips the medallion off his neck.

          SKANKY GUY (CONT'D)
          Ow!

                         JAY
          I'll do a lot worse. Get the hell
          out of here.
          The guy runs off.

                         KAY
          What's the deal with the necklace?

                         JAY
          You were wearing one just like it
          when you died. Come on.

          SOUTHWEST CORNER OF 3RD AND AVENUE C
          Jay and Kay pull up in front of the building.

                         KAY
          That address. It's familiar.
          He pulls out a notebook.

                         KAY (CONT'D)
          I was going to come by here
          tomorrow to check out a lead on the
          dry ice case.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          62.

                         JAY
          So you come here tomorrow, get
          tangled up with these Archanans...
          And...

                         KAY
          And Yaz kills me?

                         JAY
          Something like that. So do me and
          the people of Earth a favor and be
          careful.

                         KAY
          Aw, put on your big girl panties
          and let's go.

                         JAY
          Hey, I've always got my big girl
          panties on.
          Huh. That didn't sound right.

          INT. FREIGHT ELEVATOR

          Jay and Kay ride up...

                         KAY
          That thing back at the party, what
          was it? Some kind of game?

                         JAY
          Not just any game, PONG. Game of
          kings. But it wasn't invented
          until 1974.

                         KAY
          How do you know that?

                         JAY
          Because I was the only kid on my
          block who didn't have one.

                         KAY
          Aw, what's the matter? Daddy
          didn't buy you the toy you wanted?

                         JAY
          Didn't have a daddy to not buy me
          toys. Here's the only thing I ever
          got from him--
          He holds up his key chain.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          63.

                         KAY
          That's rough.

                         JAY
          It gets worse. You're the closest
          thing I have to a dad.

          DOORS OPEN...

          DOWN THE RATTY HALLWAY
          Jay and Kay move carefully, ready for trouble.
          They get to the door -- Apartment 12.
          Jay points to the door -- THIS IS IT!
          They see -- THE DOOR IS SMASHED IN, PUNCHED OFF ITS HINGES
          And punched into the door -- THE IMPRESSION OF A SKULL RING

                         JAY
          That's from Yaz's ring. He was
          here. Or is here.
          Jay SIGNALS KAY

                         KAY
          Why do you keep doing that?

          INT. STUDIO APARTMENT

          They move into the room on high alert...
          But it's empty.
          They realize the strangeness of the room - alien technology
          (including a TV hooked up to something strange with tons of
          wires hanging out) and lots of money.. LOTS of money...
          Not just piles -- the actual furniture is MADE OF STACKS OF
          MONEY. They've been using it for scrap paper, for napkins.

                         JAY
          So Yaz was never after you... he
          was after the Archanans. You just
          got in the way.

                         KAY
          Which must make them damn
          important. But what does he want
          with them?

                         

                         

                         

                         

          64.

                         JAY
          'No sign of struggle. They must've
          cleared out before he got here.
          Like they knew he was coming.

                         KAY
          And he's probably on their trail
          now. But where the hell did they
          go?
          They look around, puzzling over this place. Jay picks up a
          $100 bill off a table made out of stacks of money.

                         JAY
          Think this might tell us something?
          On the $100 bill:
           A strange series of words and numbers: 3 2... 5 1... 7 5..

                         KAY
          Looks like some kind of code.
          We'll take it to HQ, run it through
          the computer. Figure out where
          they went.

          BACK THROUGH THE HALLWAY
          Jay and Kay walk down the dark hallway --
          Yaz steps out of the shadows --

          BACK IN THE CAR
          Jay and Kay head back to HQ. Kay drives, Jay stares at the
          $100 bill, squinting at it, turning it over --

                         JAY
          How about bible verses?
          Coordinates? Airplane flights?
          Shoe sizes?

                         KAY
          So this is how you do it in the
          future, huh? You just keep
          guessing until you figure it out?

                         JAY

                         (EUREKA)
          Phone numbers!
          They stop at a light.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          65.
          Suddenly -- WHAM! WHAM! Someone FRANTICALLY POUNDS on the
          trunk -- a frightened 12-year-old prostitute wearing what is
          basically Jodi Foster's Taxi Driver hooker costume --
          hotpants, mary janes, halter top. There's something familiar
          about her face...

          HOT PANTS GIRL
          For God's sake! Help me, would
          you? There's some maniac after me -

                         JAY
          Slow down -- who's after you?

          HOT PANTS GIRL
          He was like nothing I ever saw --
          crazy eyes, and this freaky skull
          ring.
          Jay and Kay look at each other:

                         JAY
          Get in.

          HOT PANTS GIRL
          Thank you so much. This is a
          dangerous city for a girl.
          The light turns green -- we're on the girl's face. Jay and
          Kay looking straight ahead.

                         JAY
          So where can we take you?

          HOT PANTS GIRL
          Just make a left up here.
          Kay does it... There's a rushing noise...
          In the back seat, Hot Pants Girl IS "INFLATING" AND BECOMING

          DEVIL GIRL!
          The car turns down a dark, deserted alley.

                         JAY
          Are you sure? Seems dangerous.

                         DEVIL GIRL
          Not for me.
          Reveal -- the girl has fully "inflated" into her natural form
          -- DEVIL GIRL! The outfit is grotesque on her.

          DEVIL GIRL ATTACKS

                         

                         

                         

                         

          66.
          SET PIECE FIGHT in the car. Employing cool MiB tech built
          into the car.
          Devil Girl subdued, locked into the trunk in a "CONTAINMENT
          SACK" -- like what you'd use to stuff a raccoon into.
          The fight's over, the guys slump against the car.

                         JAY
          What the hell was that?

                         KAY
          I don't know, but I'd bet you two
          to one Yaz sent her.
          Beat. Light bulb moment for Jay --

                         JAY
          Say that again!

                         KAY
          I think Yaz sent her.

                         JAY
          No, the whole thing!

                         KAY
          I'd bet you two to one Yaz sent
          her.
          On Jay, realizing--
          He grabs the $100 bill --

                         JAY
          I know where they are!

          ON JAY AND KAY
          Walking -- we hear sounds of crowds, of cheering, REVEAL we

                         ARE AT--

          EXT. AQUEDUCT RACETRACK


                         JAY
          How are we going to find them? Any
          idea what an Archanan looks like?
          And then -- they see --

          AMID THE SEA OF GUYS IN SUITS, HATS, AND SKINNY TIES...

                         

                         

                         

                         

          67.
          A circle of what looks like Tibetan monks -- colorful,
          playful, dressed in robes.
          They could only be -- the Archanans.
          The group comprises one older Archanan -- the LAMA -- and
          three younger ATTENDANTS.

                         KAY
          I think I found them.
          They step into

          THE ARCHANANS' AURA
          Within the space around the Archanans, the chaos and noise of
          the crowd melts away. Deflected.
          There are three Archanans and one distinctive older one --

          THE LAMA.
          In the middle -- a giant pile of winnings.
          All is peaceful within this space. Faint chimes.
          They greet Jay and Kay happily, chant a strange mantra:

                         ARCHANANS

                         (CHANTING)
          King Lady Big Trouble Classy...
          The faint sound of an announcer:

          ANNOUNCER (V.0.)
          Results for the sixth race: King,
          Sweet Sophie, Big Trouble and Red
          Gent!

                         ARCHANANS

                         (CHANTING)
          Superba pays 3200 to one...

                         JAY
          You're in danger--

                         ARCHANANS
          You're in danger... you're in
          danger...
          Jay thinks they're playing the "echo game" like little kids:

                         JAY
          Very cute, but--

                         

                         

                         

                         

          68.

                         LAMA
          In eight seconds, please do us the
          kindness of ducking.

                         JAY
          Huh?

                         KAY
          Yaz!
          They turn to see YAZ -- he levels a WEAPON AT THEM -- FIRES!
          Jay and Kay DUCK -- the weapon just misses.

                         JAY
          Thanks.

                         KAY
          Let's get into trouble.
          Jay and Kay engage him --
          As they run off, the Lama calls --

                         LAMA
          Remember, please, to take the
          bridge.
          And we begin

          BIG FIGHT SET PIECE.
          Try to include motorcycle and horse elements. Could also
          involve the actual aqueduct, which is close by.
          At one point, Jay and Kay seem stuck, they remember...

                         JAY
          Take the bridge...
          They take the bridge, which gives them an advantage on Yaz.
          At one point, Jay corners Yaz -- Yaz BLASTS HIM -- Jay is
          knocked down. Looks DEAD! But he shakes it off reveal
          the PONG medallion blocked the shot.
          Culminating at a toxic waste dump in Staten Island, with Yaz
          compressed into .a six inch cube - hauled away in the back of
          a garbage truck.
          The guys give chase -- they want him captured, but no luck.
          The truck drives off...

                         

                         

                         

                         

          69.

                         KAY
          He's gone.

                         JAY
          Only a matter of time before he
          comes back. And this time he might
          be really mad.

          AQUEDUCT RACE TRACK
          Jay and Kay return to an EMPTY RACE TRACK...
          It's like a ghost town.
          No Archanans to be found...

                         JAY
          Damn, we lost them. They come all
          the way across the universe and
          just when we're about to figure out
          what all of this is about--
          Then, faintly... a CHEER

                         KAY
          Hold that thought.
          They follow it out to

                         THE TRACK
          Which is empty. No spectators, no horses. Just the
          Archanans...
          Who stand near the track watching... nothing.
          And yet --
          They cheer and clap as if watching the most exciting race
          ever.
          Jay and Kay exchange a "what the hell?" Look and approach
          them.

                         JAY
          Everybody OK?

                         ARCHANANS
          Everybody is everybody.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          70.

                         JAY
          Yeah... guess I can't argue with
          that. So listen up -- Yaz is down
          but he won't be for long, so we
          need to start coming up with some
          answers. First of all--
          The Archanans CHEER. Jay shakes it off.

                         JAY (CONT'D)

                         FIRST
          The Archanans CHEER AGAIN.

                         JAY (CONT'D)
          What are you cheering about?!

                         ARCHANANS
          The races.
          Jay and Kay keep approaching... Puzzled -- the track is
          empty...

                         JAY
          What races?
          Jay and Kay cross the threshold into their aura... and now--
          The empty stands are FILLED WITH CHEERING SPECTATORS WATCHING

          AN INCREDIBLY EXCITING RACE.

                         JAY (CONT'D)
          Where are we?

          LAMA.
          We are tomorrow.
          Jay steps backwards, out of the aura -- back to empty ghost
          town.
          Steps back in -- tomorrow's rabid fans, cheering the race.
          From the Archanans' POV -- we see ALL VERSIONS/ALL AGES OF

          JAY AND KAY..
          The effect is -- THEY SEE ALL TIME AT ONCE.

                         JAY
          You... can see the future.

                         LAMA
          It is what you call the future.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          71.

                         ATTENDANT
          Ah, the future. An illusion of the
          time-bound, borne of the fallacy
          that one moment follows another.

                         LAMA
          Yaz suffers from this greatly. And
          so he must have revenge on your
          planet.

                         JAY
          Revenge?, For what?

                         LAMA
          He mourns the past because he can
          not see the dead are still as alive
          as they ever were. Just not now.

                         JAY
          Okay, someday you're gonna explain
          that to me, but right now you need
          to stop the riddles because there's
          about two minutes until Yaz crawls
          out of his hole and gets back to
          trying to kill you. So help me
          out. I need to know IN ENGLISH why
          Yaz is trying to kill you and what
          that has to do with saving the
          Earth.

                         ATTENDANT
          We know what he will know.

                         JAY
          You know what... he will know...
          (figuring it out)
          You know his plans.

                         (REALIZING)
          And you're going to stop him. He
          wants to kill you because you stop
          him.

                         LAMA

                         (CHEERFUL)
          Yes, if he does not kill us first.

                         KAY
          Don't you know if he's going to?

                         LAMA
          Sometimes he kills us, sometimes he
          does not. There are many futures.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          72.

                         JAY
          Okay, which future is the one where
          you live and the Earth doesn't blow
          up?

                         LAMA
          The one where you take us home.
          Jay and Kay exchange a look --

                         KAY
          Alright, let's get these freaks
          home, and pronto.

                         LAMA
          You must let go of your. attachment
          to time, beginning with your
          concept of "pronto."
          And on that -- THUP THUP THUP --
          12 Blacked-out helicopters...

           EX (V.0.)

                         (MEGAPHONE)
          Illegal aliens -- you are
          surrounded... Do not attempt to
          flee...
          Jay and Kay YELL INTO THE BACKWASH OF THE ROTORS:

                         JAY
          No! We need to get them home!
          But it's all drowned out in the wind and dust...
          MiB "squad cars" -- pull up and surround them.
          Jay and Kay look for an escape route -- but MiB cars and
          trucks seem to be pouring in from everywhere.
          MiB agents descend on ropes, round up the Archanans--

          EX (V.0.)

                         (MEGAPHONE)
          Agent Kay! Return to your vehicle!
          Rendezvous at headquarters in 20
          minutes! We will escort you by
          air!
          And from the noise and chaos of the choppers...
          To silence...

                         

                         

                         

                         

          73.

          INT. MIB HQ - BENCH OUTSIDE THE CONFERENCE ROOM

          Jay and Kay watch through a glass wall.
          Inside the conference room -- the Archanans sit around a
          table.
          Ex paces, clearly talking ABOUT the Archanans to the other
          agents.
          Body language tells us the MiB reach some kind of consensus.
          Ex comes out -- Jay and Kay hop up.
          Ex notices Jay for the first time --

                         EX
          What's he doing here? Didn't we
          just bust you?

                         KAY
          That was someone else. All these
          mooners look alike, right?
          A beat -- and Ex buys it completely.

                         EX
          Yeah... So look. We've talked
          about it. And you are to be
          commended, Agent Kay. You did a
          fine job bringing these illegals
          in. Now it's our job to get them
          out of the city for containment.
          Somewhere where if someone decides
          to blow them off the map, the
          collateral damage will be
          insignificant. Toronto.

                         KAY
          But they're in danger. One of the
          most dangerous beings in the
          universe is out to kill them--
          (looks to Jay)
          And if that happens, we're all
          going with them, because they're
          our only hope of survival.

                         EX
          Christ, if we listened to every
          Mooner who showed up telling us how
          they were gonna save the world,
          that's all we'd do. Do you know
          why Earth is still standing?

          74.

                         EX (CONT'D)
          Why we're not a smoldering chunk of
          nothing? Because we don't stick
          our nose into other people's
          business. Especially people in
          danger, because they have enemies,
          and those enemies destroy Earth.
          Now. Are you going to execute my
          order or not?

                         KAY

                         (COLD)
          I thought we were supposed to be
          the good guys.

                         EX
          Careful, Agent Kay. That sounds
          like insubordination.
          Kay walks up to Ex, looks him DEAD IN THE EYE

                         KAY
          It sounds like you need to cut some
          eyeholes in your stomach, because
          your head is so far up your ass,
          that's the only way you could
          possibly see.

                         EX
          That's it. You're off this case.
          Stick to dry ice. If I catch you
          near them -- or him -- again, I'll
          have your badge.
          (to a bunch of other

                         AGENTS)
          You four -- take the Archanans to
          transpo.
          One of the agents looks up--

                         YOUNG AGENT
          Me? I'm just an accountant---

                         EX
          Go!!!

                         (TO JAY)
          And you... You just get out of
          here!
          The MiB agents GRAB the Archanans and hustle them out.
          Kay leans in to them--

                         KAY
          Don't worry, we'll--

                         

                         

                         

                         

          75.

                         LAMA
          Yes, we know.
          Kay looks up -- sees Jay smiling at him.

                         KAY
          What?

                         JAY
          I knew Agent Kay wasn't just gonna
          lie down. So what's the plan?

                         KAY
          You heard the man. We've got dry
          ice to investigate.

          GARBAGE COMPACTOR TRUCK
          It's the truck that "compacted" Yaz. We follow it to the

                         MIDDLE OF

          GIANT STATEN ISLAND DUMP
          Where the truck dumps its load... Including YAZ...
          Who gets PROCESSED AND PRESSED INTO A CUBE.
          On the cube -- it begins to swell and force itself back into
          its natural shape.
          Around the piles of garbage, other Yaz parts SEEK EACH OTHER

          OUT...

                         DUMP EXIT
          Workers stop what they're doing -- get out of the way of
          something, disturbed.
          We see Yaz and understand the reaction -- Yaz might be back
          together, but NOT AT ALL RIGHT -- a leg stuck in the wrong
          place, the head at a weird angle.
          He catches his reflection in a hubcap and adjusts himself...
          Pops out an eye, swaps an arm...
          He unfurls his tongue, smells the air --

                         YAZ
          Where did you go...

                         

                         

                         

                         

          76.

                         SHOWWORLD CENTER
          A SLEAZY GUY is suprised to see not just an agent... but four
          agents and four Hare-Krishna-looking guys come out of his
          peep show window.
          One of the Archanan attendants smiles at him:

                         ATTENDANT

                         (CHEERFUL)
          You will die alone.

                         SLEAZY GUY
          Yeah, I know.
          The agents lead the Archanans through the world's greatest
          emporium of sleaze.

          EXT. GRAND CENTRAL STATION

          The hustle and bustle -- cabs picking up and dropping off

                         PASSENGERS --
           We find a LONG LINE OF UNHAPPY KIDS, MAKING UNHAPPY PARENTS --
          Kids crying, pulling on Mom's dress...
          We see -- it's the line to an ICE CREAM TRUCK.
          And the line isn't moving because KAY IS QUESTIONING THE

          PAPER-HATTED VENDOR.
          DRY ICE SMOKE rises from the freezer:

                         KAY
          Just a few more questions about dry
          ice and I'll be out of your hair...
          A BIRD CALL makes Kay turn --.he sees Jay waving him over,
          pointing at something -- The MiB agents lead the Archanans
          into the Station!

                         VENDOR
          I told you ten times -- I got no
          idea what dry ice is!

                         KAY
          (not listening).
          Thanks, you've been very helpful.
          Jay and Kay peel off, follow the MiB agents, leaving the
          Vendor scratching his head. He turns back to the kids.
          Jay and Kay follow the MiBers and Archanans inside...

                         

                         

                         

                         

          77.

          INT. GRAND CENTRAL STATION

          The Men in Black blend in easily with the guys going home to
          Greenwich, but the Archanans are easy to spot.
          Jay and Kay tail them -- and lose them for an instant!
          They spot a glimpse of robe, run after them, turn a corner --
          And it's just some Hare Krishnas.

                         KAY
          Damn. Wrong freaks.
          But Jay spots the Archanans...

                         JAY
          Over there, Kay!
          As they run off --

                         HARE KRISHNA
          Perhaps you'd like to join us for a
          vegetarian meal?
          Jay and Kay chase after the MiB agents and Archanans --
          The MiB agents approach a cordoned-off area with signs
          warning WET PAINT!
          The agents look around, then slip pass the ropes and through
          a NARROW DOOR marked "WET PAINT" or "MEN WORKING"
          Jay and Kay follow...
          Through the skinny half-painted door...

          THROUGH THE.SKINNY DOOR
          An EQUALLY SKINNY ESCALATOR descends 100s of feet. A
          problem: it's going the WRONG WAY -- bringing incognito
          aliens and MiB agents UP INTO GRAND CENTRAL.
          Jay and Kay muscle their way down -- lots of 'scuse me --
          pardon me -- hey, don't grab that!
          But once they power past the crowds, Jay's jaw drops as we
          reveal...

                         

                         

                         

                         

          78.

          SECRET TRAIN STATION
          A MUCH-BIGGER station under Grand Central, a secret hub for
          sending aliens back and forth all over the country.
          It's basically a series of GIANT PNEUMATIC TUBES --people-
          sized versions of the vacuum tubes that used to beeverywhere
          in banks, offices, etc.
          A mix of ALIENS and MIB AGENTS put on helmets and pads, board
          the tubes and FWOOP off...
          Quick shots -- a shoeshine stand set up for many-limbed
          aliens... a newsstand with strange papers... The Beatles in
          line for Liverpool with a blue meanie... Kareem Abdul-
          Jabbar...

                         KAY
          On your 2 o'clock.
          They spot the MiBers and the Archanans next to the TUBE TO

          CANADA.

          TUBE TO CANADA
          The MiB agents put helmets and pads on the Archanans.
          They're about to load them into the tubes --
          Jay and Kay approach:

                         KAY
          Hold up.

                         MIB
          You're off this case, Kay.

                         MIB 2
          Yeah, but I heard there's some dry
          ice in Queens. Magic show at a
          kid's birthday party. Better
          hustle, you can get there before.
          the cake.
          They all LAUGH at Kay.

                         KAY
          Change in plans.

                         MIB
          What? We didn't hear about any
          change in plans.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          79.

                         KAY
          Yeah, Ex just gave us the new
          orders -- check this out --
          Kay gestures them closer -- he reaches for something in his
          jacket pocket...
          The MiBers lean in...
          And Kay GRABS THEM AND SHOVES THEM BACKWARDS TOWARDS THE

          TUBE!
          The MiB agents stumble, surprised --
          The Archanans, not surprised, step deftly out of the way, the
          MiBers FWOOP FWOOP FWOOP into the tube...
          Jay and Kay exchange a smile and realize... One last VERY
          YOUNG agent is still standing there, wide-eyed:

                         YOUNG AGENT
          Don't hurt me! I'm just the
          accountant!
          He reaches for his radio... Jay talks him down:

                         JAY
          I know you're a little freaked out
          and you want to call for backup,
          but listen: When you've done this
          job for a while, you realize
          there's one rule -- things aren't
          what they seem. These are innocent
          beings that need our protection.
          Are you gonna do the right thing or
          are you gonna be a company man and
          send them off to die in Toronto?
          The young agent thinks -- puts down the radio.

                         JAY (CONT'D)
          Good, good. What's your name?

                         YOUNG AGENT
          Agent Zed, sir.

                         KAY
          You're gonna be okay, kid.
          Jay can't help laughing --

                         

                         

                         

                         

          80.

                         JAY
          He's gonna be better than OK. I'm
          not gonna give you so much shit
          anymore.
          The radio CRACKLES --

          EX (V.0.)

                         (ON RADIO)
          Zed, what's your status?

                         ZED
          Detainees are on the tube to
          Toronto. No sign of Kay. Over.

          EX (V.0.)
          Copy that, good work, Zed.
          Zed crosses off...

                         JAY
          Be nice to him. Trust me.
          Jay, Kay and the Archanans regroup.

                         JAY (CONT'D)
          Okay, you all wanted to go home.
          Well here we are. So how do you
          want to get off this rock? You
          guys have the spaceport on Long
          Island yet?
          Kay just looks at him.

                         JAY (CONT'D)
          That place is a dump anyway. Best
          Margaritas in the Universe, my ass.
          What about the one in Ohio?
          The Archanans smile.

                         ATTENDANT
          Here is the way home.
          The Lama removes a postcard-sized card from his robe and
          hands it to one of his attendants.
          The attendant bows, and RITUALLY PASSES IT... it passes
          through all the attendants and then to JAY.
          Jay gives it a look.

                         JAY
          Here, huh? You're sure?

                         

                         

                         

                         

          81.

                         LAMA
          The only future that ends with life
          begins there.

                         JAY
          I'll take that as a strong "yes."
          Okay, then. Follow me.
          Jay pockets the card and starts herding them across the
          terminal. Kay catches up --

                         KAY
          Where are we going?
          Jay looks at him a beat.

                         JAY
          Omaha. And I'm gonna buy you the
          biggest T-bone you ever saw when we
          get there. So -- you head over to
          the Omaha tube and I'm gonna help
          these guys over here for a second.
          But I'll meet you in a minute. By
          the Omaha tube.
          They stare at each other --

                         KAY
          Sounds good. See you there.
          Kay turns to head off -- then, lightening fast, spins and
          reaches into Jay's pocket, snatches out the card --

                         KAY (CONT'D)
          Omaha, my ass.
          Kay looks at the card: GREETINGS FROM SUNNY FLORIDA -- a
          tourist post card with palm trees, oranges and beaches.

                         KAY (CONT'D)
          Let's go.

                         JAY
          No, no, no. No way. Florida, Kay.

                         KAY
          That's what it says.

                         JAY
          Don't you get it?

                         KAY
          Yeah, it's hot and muggy. The old
          people drive slow.

                         (MORE)

                         

                         

                         

                         

          82.

                         KAY (CONT'D)
          We'll stay somewhere air-
          conditioned and only drive after
          three when they're at dinner.

                         JAY
          This is why you were there. In
          Florida. Because of them. You
          were helping them and that's why...
          that's why you get killed. Today,
          July 16. I saw the report myself.
          Agent Kay, dead at the scene.
          Killed by Yaz.

                         KAY
          You know what an MiB agent calls it
          when he faces death? Besides I got
          you to watch my back, right?
          They walk to the FLORIDA TUBE

                         JAY
          I just want you to know, I'm doing
          this out of love, man.

                         KAY
          Doing what?
          He gets his answer -- Jay DECKS HIM.

                         JAY
          You stay home and stay alive.
          But Kay isn't down.

                         KAY
          I told them I'd help them -- I'm
          honor-bound to do it.
          Kay throws a DIRTY SUCKER-PUNCH to Jay's kidney.
          Jay recovers and throws an UPPERCUT to Kay's solar plexus.
          Jay winces -- like he just hit something hard.

                         JAY
          Damn, you used to have some abs.
          They continue to pound each other. As they trade punches:

                         JAY (CONT'D)
          I can't let you go to Florida.

                         KAY
          I make my own future! Besides --
          I'm younger and stronger than you!

                         

                         

                         

                         

          83.
          They both attempt an identical spin kick at the same time --
          feet collide.

                         JAY
          Bet you're sorry you taught me
          that.
          The fight continues... They're wearing down, circling each
          other...
          And then Kay fakes a left ---

                         JAY (CONT'D)
          You always lead with your--
          But this time Kay connects with his right, knocking Jay down
          hard.

                         KAY
          Had enough yet?
          On Jay -- gasping, spent -- using every last reserve of
          strength to lift himself off that floor.

                         JAY
          I can't let you go -- I love you!
          Jay KICKS KAY SAVAGELY IN THE GROIN. Kay LUNGES AT JAY.
          They CLINCH... it's a stalemate...

                         KAY
          Aw, hell, look at that-- behind you-

                         JAY
          I'm not falling for that.

                         KAY
          I'm not kidding --
          Kay rotates their clinch towards the tube so Jay can see...
          The ARCHANANS -- very cheerfully, benignly hopping into the

          FLORIDA TUBE.
          Jay and Kay share a look -- and both run INTO THE TUBE!

          THROUGH THE TUBES
          Jay, Kay and the Archanans hurtle through the MiB system of
          pneumatic tubes.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          84.
          The Archanans fly through the tubes, relaxed and happy,
          moving gracefully, like fish through water...
          Kay is in perfect controlled tube position -- everything
          clenched, hands by his sides, looking like he's in an "air
          luge"...
          Jay is SCREAMING and ricocheting off the sides of the tube
          like a pinball...
          They shoot SOUTH, passing landmarks of the Eastern
          seaboard...
          Intercut with Jay's face -- blown back like Right Stuff
          astronauts in a G-Force simulator.
          Jay FLAILS towards the Archanans, grabs onto the Lama's robe:

                         JAY
          (yelling over the wind

                         NOISE)
          I have to know -- can I really
          prevent Kay's murder?

                         LAMA
          Yes.

                         JAY
          Oh. Okay, then. Thanks, good to
          hear.

                         LAMA
          But where there was death, there
          will be death.

                         JAY
          What does that mean?
          The Lama smiles and zips ahead through the current. Jay gets
          CLOBBERED by a bend in the tube.

          EXT. FIELD

          Sugar cane workers pick crops next to a GIANT IRRIGATION

          PIPE.
          They look up as SCREAMS DOPPLER THROUGH THE PIPE -- what the
          hell was that?
          We follow the SCREAM...

                         

                         

                         

                         

          85.

          BACK IN THE TUBE
          Jay CONTINUES TO SCREAM --

          TUBE P.A. (V.0.)
          All passengers, prepare to de-tube.

                         JAY
          De-tube?

          TUBE P.A. (V.0.)
          Please make sure all helmet and
          crash suit straps are securely
          fastened.
          On Jay -- no helmet, no crash suit.

                         JAY
          Helmet? No one said anything about

                         A--

          POOP!

          EXT. FLORIDA SWAMP/MANATEE PRESERVE - END OF THE TUBE

          Jay, Kay and the Archanans are launched from the tube like
          human cannonballs...
          The Archanans land gracefully, floating down air currents
          like kung fu masters...
          Kay hits with both feet and rolls...
          Jay face plants into the water.
          Jay looks up -- FIVE MANATEES STARE HIM DOWN. The ALPHA
          MANATEE emits along, lowing manatee song which RESOLVES INTO

                         COUGHING --

                         ALPHA MANATEE
          Sorry, I have something in my
          throat. They went that way...

                         JAY
          Thanks.
          Surrounded by thick brush, trees. Jay staggers out of the
          water, looking beat to hell.

                         JAY (CONT'D)
          Kay? Archanans? Everyone OK?

                         

                         

                         

                         

          86.
          Reveal -- Everyone else looks clean and pressed. Jay looks
          around -- nothing but brush and swamp.

                         JAY (CONT'D)
          Listen, your, uh...
          Arachaness...ness? I don't think
          this here is the way back to your
          planet.
          The Archanans smile and WALK OFF... Jay and Kay follow --

                         JAY (CONT'D)
          Hey wait -- we can't help you get
          home, if you don't tell us how...
          He trails off as they EMERGE FROM THE BRUSH
          And stop dead...

                         JAY (CONT'D)
          Whoa. So that's how you're getting
          home.
          Reveal -- A GLORIOUS SHOT OF THE APOLLO ROCKET
          And they head towards destiny...

          CAPE CANAVERAL - LAUNCH SITE
          Jay and Kay take in the MASSIVE SCENE...
          The huge crowd, the security, the press. HISTORY IN THE

          MAKING.
          T-Minus 30 minutes.

                         JAY
          Okay. So we've got... 30 minutes
          to get past security. Get into
          Mission Control. Reprogram the
          flight path, pull the Astronauts
          off the launch and get them in that
          rocket.

                         KAY
          Well, then. Better get started.

                         JAY
          Weird. I feel like I've been here.

                         (BEAT)
          Okay, I've got a plan to get
          through security. We just need to
          be invisible.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          87.

          YAZ ON HIS BIKE
          Hurtling down the highway on his superfast bike, kicking up a

          HUGE DUSTSTORM...
          He gets STUCK BEHIND AN 18-WHEELER. Yaz REVS -- and SPEEDS

          RIGHT THROUGH THE TRUCK, SPLITTING IT IN HALF.
          Down the CAUSEWAY -- the rocket in the distance...

          EXT. MISSION CONTROL STRUCTURE ENTRANCE

          Heavily guarded by AIR FORCE SECURITY -- people with a lot of
          guns and very little sense of humor.
          And up steps Jay, leading Kay and the Archanans.

          JAY (O.S.)
          'Scuse me... I need to get
          inside... I've got the big man's
          Cadillac... all washed and ready to-
          Before the words are out of Jay's mouth, he's down on the
          ground with a submachine gun stuck in his neck.

                         GUARD
          Move and it's the last thing you
          do!
          The security is on Kay and the Archanans, forcing them down.
          Kay gives Jay a look --

                         KAY
          Good work. It's like we're not
          even here.

                         GUARD

                         (INTO RADIO)
          Sir, this is unit 3 bravo -- we
          have an attempted perimeter breach
          into mission control subhallway
          Charlie. One caucasian, one
          negroid, four... other. Yes, sir.
          We'll hold them here, sir.

                         JAY
          You've got it wrong, let me explain-

                         

                         

                         

                         

          88.

                         GUARD
          Shut up! Anything you have to say,
          you can say to my superior officer!
          And boy does he hate your kind...
          A click... click... click... Someone is approaching. Someone
          who walks like they mean business.

                         GUARD (CONT'D)
          Lt. Colonel! Here are the
          intruders, sir!
          Jay cranes to see the Colonel -- he's African American. Jay
          grins, relieved --

                         JAY
          Finally, someone I can talk to--
          But the Colonel is on him before you can blink, an equal-
          opportunity hardass to the extreme:

                         COLONEL
          The only thing we're gonna talk
          about is what specific breed of
          dumbass you have to be to try to
          penetrate my launch site!
          He begins patting Jay down. Eyes widen --

                         COLONEL
          Weapon! You are going away for a
          long time...
          (to his men)
          Get them into holding. We'll
          interrogate them after the launch.
          A beat... and Jay goes for it:

                         JAY
          Sir, before you do that --- my name
          is Agent Jay. I appreciate your
          position, but I'm from a top-secret
          government agency in charge of
          protecting the world from the scum
          of the universe and right now, on
          behalf of the people of Earth, I.:
          need to commandeer your rocket so

                         THEY--
          (points to Archanans)
          --can board it. Can we count on
          your help?
          The Colonel stares at him for a beat..

                         

                         

                         

                         

          89.

                         COLONEL
          So you want us to stop the most
          massive endeavor in American
          history, an event being watched by
          the entire world, the moment that
          will be the culmination of a
          challenge put to us by President
          John F. Kennedy himself... so a
          bunch of Hare Krishnas can take a
          joy ride?

                         JAY
          Would it help if I told you I'm
          from the future?

                         COLONEL
          Get them out of here!
          He motions to the other MPs, who move to roust the group...
          But the Lama takes the Colonel by the arm--

                         COLONEL (CONT'D)
          Hey!
          --and PULLS HIM INTO HIS AURA.
          On THE COLONEL'S face... He sees something POWERFUL
          The Lama releases him...
          The officer is stunned for a moment. Blinks back into focus
          and turns to the other guards --

                         COLONEL (CONT'D)
          You men are no longer needed here.
          Report to delta gate.

                         GUARD
          Sir?

                         COLONEL
          Go!

                         GUARD
          Yes, sir...
          The Colonel turns to Jay, Kay and the Archanans:

                         COLONEL
          The rest of you, come with me.
          The Colonel heads into the building. They follow.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          90.

                         JAY
          Things change when you can see the
          future, right?

                         COLONEL
          They sure do. This is definitely
          about some next-level shit.
          The PA crackles:

          P.A. (V.0.)
          T-minus seven minutes to launch...

          MISSION CONTROL STRUCTURE - UNDERGROUND HALLWAY
          Mission control is an underground hub with hallway "spokes".
          Jay, Kay and the Archanans follow the Colonel down the
          hallway towards the main Mission Control center.

                         MISSION CONTROL
          A hive of activity leading up to the launch.. Miles and
          miles of white guys in buzzcuts and shortsleeve button-down
          shirts. Thick glasses, slide rules, pocket protectors -- a
          sea of IBM men.
          Everyone smoking, RUSHING AROUND, LAST-MINUTE CHAOS...
          Hunkered over computer monitors... reel-to-reel data tapes
          spinning. Less computing power than an iPhone, but we put a
          man on the moon.

          P.A. (V.0.)
          T-minus six minutes...

                         JAY
          Attention, everyone! We've got a
          change in plans!
          Everyone's consumed with the launch and wearing headsets --
          they ignore him -- he keeps trying --

                         JAY (CONT'D)
          Hey! Attention over here! I need
          to talk to the man who can re-
          program this rocket!
          Still nothing --

                         JAY (CONT'D)
          Can anyone hear me? Hey! You in
          the glasses!

                         

                         

                         

                         

          91.
          25 people in identical giant black plastic glasses turn.

           COLONEL (O.S.)
          Agent Jay! Over here!
          They see the Colonel with an Engineer at a workstation.

                         COLONEL (CONT'D)
          This is your man.
          The guys approach the Engineer --

                         ENGINEER
          You see this card? The rocket's
          flight path is all on cards just
          like this one. Right here --
          He indicates a long metal rack, like a mail-sorting machine,
          that holds many 1000s of cards and feeds them into a
          processor.
          An Archanan approaches and BLOWS ON THE CARDS -- it hits the
          cards like a mini-whirlwind. The cards spiral everywhere
          like bats pouring out of a cave -- chads fly off -- they're
          magically re-programmed! And fly back into the rack.
          The engineers are STUNNED. And then PANIC:

                         ENGINEER (CONT'D)
          The trajectory has been altered!
          A BIG LOW-TECH GRAPHIC APPEARS on the BIG LOW-RES MONITOR:

          TRAJECTORY CHANGE.

                         ENGINEER (CONT'D)
          Abort launch! Abort launch!

                         JAY
          Slow down there! Everyone be cool!

                         ENGINEER
          Coolness is an inappropriate
          response!
          The Engineer flips the SAFETY off a red button marked "ABORT"

                         ENGINEER (CONT'D)
          Aborting in 5...

                         JAY
          No! Stop! Do not abort!

                         ENGINEER

          4...

                         

                         

                         

                         

          92.
          The Engineer raises his ABORTING HAND -- About to slam it
          down in the button!

                         - KAY
          This might help.
          Kay reaches into his jacket, takes out WHAT APPEARS TO BE A

                         NEURALIZER

                         JAY
          What's that? You been holding out
          on me?

                         KAY
          Little something I've been working
          on. Glasses if you've got 'em.
          Jay and Kay put on their glasses...

                         ENGINEER

          2.
          Jay and Kay in sunglasses -- for a moment, it's the iconic
          look of the posters...

                         JAY
          Ha ha, just like old times...

                         KAY
          Oh, and you might want to get under
          a desk.

                         JAY
          Get under a--?

                         ENGINEER
          One!
          The engineers hand comes down... but before he can hit the

                         BUTTON --
          Kay hits the trigger --
          But instead of a FLASH --
          A MILLION PELLETS EXPLODE OUT OF THE NEURALIZER -- bouncing
          everywhere, knocking out the engineers.
          The pellets KEEP WHIZZING EVERYWHERE THROUGH THE FOLLOWING:
          Jay and Kay have to talk over the sounds of people getting
          KO'd.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          93.

                         JAY
          What the hell was that??

                         KAY
          It's a high-velocity non-lethal
          pellet-gun. The boys in the lab
          call it the "hiv-nol-pog."

                         JAY
          Catchy.
          The Archanans deftly step out of the way -- or the pellets
          swerve around them.
          EX RUNS IN, flanked by security and/or MiB agents.

                         EX
          It's Kay! There he is! Take him
          down! Shoot him if you have to!
          EX catches a PELLET TO THE GROIN, crumples.
          The pellets settle... quiet...

          P.A. (V.0.)
          T-minus... Five minutes.
          The engineers start COMING TO, dazed, wondering WHAT THE HELL
          JUST HAPPENED -- Kay and Jay give them a "neuralizer" cover

                         STORY:

                         JAY

                         (TO CROWD)
          What the hell is wrong with you
          people? Raquel Welch comes by for
          a personal tour of Mission Control
          and you faint like a bunch of
          schoolgirls!

                         KAY
          What a waste.

                         ENGINEER
          Raquel Welch was here?

                         JAY
          Five minutes to get to the rocket.
          And keep your eyes open for Yaz.
          They head out.

                         CUT TO:

                         

                         

                         

                         

          94.

          ON THE TARMAC
          With only a few minutes to go, service trucks CLEAR THE
          TARMAC -- dozens of fuel trucks, etc., Driving to get a safe
          distance away from the blast.
          The all SWERVE OUT OF THE WAY
          As one car cuts through them GOING THE OPPOSITE WAY, parting
          the waters -- it's a military jeep -- THE COLONEL at the
          wheel, Jay, Kay and the rest, barely hanging on.

                         CUT TO:

          ASTRONAUT TRANSPORT -- DRIVING
          The apollo astronauts ride across the tarmac towards the
          rocket. The only car. Looking up at that rocket.
          On NEIL ARMSTRONG, practicing:

                         NEIL ARMSTRONG

                         (GRANDIOSE)
          That's one little step that I did,
          one big step for the rest of you...
          Wait, that's not it. Did that
          sound weird to you guys?
          The driver SLAMS ON THE BRAKES

                         BUZZ ALDRIN
          What in Sam Hill is going on?
          Reveal the Jeep, pulled in front of the Astronauts, cutting
          them off.

                         KAY
          No disrespect meant, [major]. I'm
          a big fan. (Especially of the
          haircut.)

                         JAY
          But we've got some bigger fish to
          fry. Hand over the flight suits.
          They start pulling the astronauts off the truck.
          The astronauts protest.

                         JAY (CONT'D)
          Let's go, people. Why don't you
          take one giant leap out of there.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          95.
          They look at Jay and Kay... at the Colonel...

                         COLONEL
          That's right, gentlemen. You need
          to listen to them. We're going to
          protocol twelve.
          The astronauts acquiesce.

                         BUZZ ALDRIN
          I didn't want to get in that death
          trap anyways.

                         NEIL ARMSTRONG
          I'm still getting my parade, right?

                         CUT TO:

          EXT. MISSION CONTROL STRUCTURE ENTRANCE

          The same guards who stopped Jay and Kay are back on duty.
          They hear something -- they draw weapons --
          And it's Yaz. Still looking like evil incarnate. The guards
          take in this unholy picture...

                         GUARD

                         WHAT THE--

                         YAZ
          I want in.
          The guards look at each other --

                         GUARD
          Should we radio the Colonel?

                         GUARD (CONT'D)
          You wanna get yelled at again?
          They wave him by.

                         GUARD (CONT'D)
          Go ahead.

                         LAUNCH PLATFORM
          Kay loads the Archanans into the capsule., Technicians in
          clean suits assist.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          96.
          Jay works like a secret service agent -- scanning for all
          possible threats.
          Jay checks his stop watch -- Four minutes to go...
          Kay works'with the Archanans--

                         JAY
          We good yet, Kay? I don't like
          being out here in the open -- too
          many ways for Yaz to get to you...

                         KAY
          I'm almost there.
          Kay's got them inside, but having problems with the hatch.

                         KAY (CONT'D)
          Hey, tech guys -- get back here and
          help me with the door.

                         TECH
          It's called-a hatch.

                         KAY
          Whatever, just get over here.

                         JAY
          Oh, come on -- what's going on?

                         KAY
          This door is complicated.

                         JAY
          Oh, for...

                         KAY
          What? It's an Apollo rocket, not a
          Plymouth Valiant, OK? It's
          complicated.
          Jay goes over to help Kay with the door.
          They both fuss and fight over the door.

                         JAY
          Lift it. You have to lift it.

                         KAY
          No, I am lifting it. You have to
          hold the lever.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          97.

                         JAY
          No, if I hold the lever, the rubber
          thingie won't... go in the thing
          where the thingie goes...
          Kay notices something in the reflection of the hatch glass.

                         KAY
          Jay... Why do you think a highly
          trained NASA technician would leave
          the back of his suit unzipped?
          They exchange a look that parallels the opening scene in the
          Chinese restaurant...

                         JAY
          Because it's about to go down.
          They turn around, draw weapons on the tech -- it's YAZ!

          NOTE TO READER:
          Welcome to the good stuff
          From here, we launch into a GIANT SET PIECE that will take us
          up and around the Apollo Rocket...
          As Jay and Kay battle Yaz and Devil Girl in a super-high-
          stakes confrontation to protect the Archanans...
           We will pay off that YAZ ISAVIRUS, bentonDESTROYINGTHE
          EARTH to avenge the deaths ofhis brothers --smallpoxand
          bubonic plague.
          The launch clock ticks down -- the action moves around pipes
          breathing fire, the gigantic scaffolding, liquid oxygen
          spewing from the rocket... All on top of a rocket taller than
          a 30-story skyscraper.
          With T-minus 25 seconds to go, Jay and Kay corner Yaz against
          the lunar capsule.

          BACK TO SCENE:
          Yaz laughs at Jay and Kay.

                         YAZ
          You can't stop me! Nothing on
          Earth can stop me!

                         JAY
          Nothing now.
          Yaz raises an eyebrow...

                         

                         

                         

                         

          98.
          Jay draws his NOISY CRICKET -- the gun he brought from the
          future.

                         KAY
          What's that?

                         JAY
          Little something I brought with me.
          Jay points the gun at Yaz -- but Yaz just LAUGHS --
          As the clock ticks down to T-minus 5... 4...

                         YAZ
          Try it! You wouldn't dare! One
          false shot and you'll rip space and
          time!

                         JAY
          That's a chance I'll have to take.
          Jay BLASTS YAZ
          Yaz stumbles BACK INTO THE CAPSULE... The hatch SLAMS him in!
          Just as the ROCKET BEGINS LIFTOFF--

          HUGE FLAMES - HUGE CLOUDS OF SMOKE THREATEN TO ENGULF JAY AND

                         KAY -

                         KAY
          Uh oh --
          But the Archanans surround them with their aura -- where the
          flames and smoke flow harmlessly around them...
          And then it's over...

          BIG VICTORY MOMENT
          As they watch the rocket carry Yaz off...

                         JAY
          We did it, partner. I hope you
          remember this when you recruit me --
          you won't give me such a hard time.

                         KAY
          You know I will.

                         JAY
          Yeah.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          99.

                         KAY
          I guess we'll have to build a
          prison on the moon or something.
          Jay realizes -- grabs Kay --

                         JAY
          Do a better job this time, OK?
          That needs to be one hell of a
          prison. You don't want that guy
          coming back, or I'm coming back.
          Look, once was enough, OK?
          Jay turns to The Colonel --

                         JAY (CONT'D)
          Thank you for your help, sir. Hope
          we don't get you fired.

                         COLONEL
          Not too worried about that.

                         JAY
          Can I ask you -- what did the Lama
          show you in there that made you
          help us? Was it the Earth being
          destroyed?

                         COLONEL
          No -- it was my son. All grown up.
          As a matter of fact, I'm late to
          see him -- I promised I'd watch the
          launch with him.

                         JAY
          Oh. Thanks. He's a lucky kid.

                         COLONEL
          I'm a lucky dad. Take care.
          Jay offers him a handshake. The officer takes it -- and
          pulls Jay into a hug.

                         JAY
          Okay...
          The Colonel leaves. Jay and Kay congratulate each other,
          smile over a job well done...
          But then they see the Archanans... And realize...

                         

                         

                         

                         

          100.

                         KAY
          We're sorry we didn't get you home,
          guys. It was the only way to get
          rid of Yaz.

                         JAY
          But we'll make sure you're safe
          here. And the next rocket out...

                         LAMA
          All is well. You have done well.

                         JAY
          No we didn't. You wanted to go
          home...

                         LAMA
          There is what we desire and what
          must be... And now our gift to
          you...

                         JAY
          Gift? But we didn't get you home.

                         ARCHANANS
          There is the action and there is
          the intention. It is the intention
          we reward.

                         LAMA
          You did the right thing. And if
          humans are capable of such
          sacrifice, such friendship...
          perhaps we ARE already home.

                         JAY
          So then what's the gift?

                         LAMA
          You already have it.
          Jay looks at pong.

                         JAY
          This? Pong?

                         LAMA
          Yes. PONG. The Pan-Galactic
          Ordnance Negation Grid. Agent Kay
          will use this technology...

                         JAY
          To make the missile defense system.
          You use this to save the world.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          101.

                         ARCHANANS
          Yes. Don't drop it.
          They take the PONG and drape it around Kay's neck
          The Archanans leave, chanting...

                         ARCHANANS (CONT'D)

                         (CHANTING)
          Bip... Bip... Bip...
          And it's just Jay and Kay.
          Jay looks at Kay wearing the PONG... just like in the case
          file picture...

                         JAY
          Hey. My watch stopped.
          We see -- a minute to go. Jay looks at the watch. Something
          about it bothers him...

                         KAY
          C'mon. Let's go watch that bastard
          leave the atmosphere.

                         JAY
          Yeah, I'll catch up with you in a
          second.

          KAY GETS INTO THE ELEVATOR
          Jay hangs back, approaches the Archanans, walks them down the
          scaffolding.

                         JAY
          So you guys understand all this
          time stuff, right? So is
          everything going to be okay now? I
          mean, if I saved everything, and
          Yaz is really gone, why am I even
          here? Shouldn't I not have come in
          the first place? And why do I
          still have time left on my watch?

                         UNDERGROUND
          The scaffolding leads Jay and the Archanans into the maze of
          underground hallways.
          Jay walks, looking at his watch, thinking...

                         

                         

                         

                         

          102.
          ,He sees a WALL CLOCK -- 3:59.

                         JAY
          3:59. But Kay didn't get killed
          until...
          And then the AWFUL REALIZATION --

                         JAY (CONT'D)
          He didn't come yet! Kay, he didn't
          come yet!!!
          Jay races to find Kay.

                         WITH KAY
          Unaware that his appointment with death is near...

          WITH YAZ AND DEVIL GIRL
          Racing down a hallway... hunting Kay...

                         WITH JAY
          Running... running... searching... where is Kay?

          INTERCUT BETWEEN KAY... YAZ... JAY...
          All converging on destiny...

                         WITH JAY
          Running... more frantic now...
          And then he sees him!
          Kay -- at the end of the hallway!. Backlit by the door to
          the outside...

                         JAY
          Kay!
          And then Jay sees -- Yazl Already there!
          Jay goes for his weapon, but he doesn't have the shot!
          Yaz pulls his guns...

                         

                         

                         

                         

          103.
          Kay turns to see Yaz -- there's no time to react, only to
          know HE'S ABOUT TO DIE!
          Yaz FIRES!!
          But -- THE COLONEL is somehow there instead! He catches the
          bullet for Kay -- his body dematerializes.
          And it gives Jay the split-second he needs to FIRE ON YAZ AND
          KILL HIM, blowing him OUTSIDE -- where he is INCINERATED BY
          LIQUID OXYGEN leftover from the launch.
          They look at each other -- it's over.

                         KAY
          See? I knew you had my back.
          Jay hears footsteps. Looks up and sees the SHADOW OF A TALL

          MAN -- REMARKABLY SIMILAR TO JAY'S OWN SILHOUETTE.
          As the footsteps approach, the shadow grows smaller,
          shrinking to KID SIZE. It's a boy.

                         KID'S VOICE
          Dad? What's going on?
          The kid steps into the light -- backlit -- but from the shape
          of his head and Jay's reaction, this kid could only be YOUNG

          JAY.

                         JAY
          Where there is death, there will
          always be death. He saved your
          life. He swapped his for yours.
          He saved the world.
          Kay puts a firm hand on Jay --

                         KAY
          I'll take it from here.
          Kay steps away... but turns back.
          In a replay of the moment from the first movie, Jay tosses
          Kay a modern Neuralizer.

                         JAY
          Leave me some memories this time,

          OK?

                         KAY
          Sure, partner. I'll see you
          around.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          104.

                         JAY
          Yes you will.
          Kay turns back to the boy, takes his hand.
          Jay watches them from a distance:
          Kay takes something off the ground where The Colonel's body
          was -- hands it to the son.

                         KAY
          Hey, look -- your Dad wanted you to
          have this.
          Kay gives the kid a shiny new commemorative Apollo key chain.
          Jay looks in his pocket -- the same key chain, scratched and
          worn.

                         YOUNG JAY
          Where is he?

                         KAY
          Your daddy had to go -- he's part
          of the space program, now. He's
          okay, he just had to take a trip up
          to the stars, but you'll be just
          fine. I'll keep an eye on you...
          They are silhouetted by the bright light of the Apollo
          launch...
          Jay takes out his iPhone and ALL GOES WHITE...

          PURE WHITE LIGHT...
          And it resolves into...

          NEW YORK - BACK TO PRESENT DAY...
          Jay comes to in the Apple Store, looks to the sky and

          THE MISSILES ARE STILL COMING!!!

                         JAY
          Noo!!!!
          And then...
          A giant PONG PADDLE rises over the horizon and

          PONGS THE MISSILES BACK INTO SPACE

                         

                         

                         

                         

          105.

          EXT. MIB HQ ENTRANCE/VENTILATION BUILDING

          Jay is walking on air -- thrilled to see the deadpan security
          guard.

                         JAY
          It's good to see you, man.
          He gives him a hug-- gets a "what the hell?" face.

          INT. MIB HQ

          Jay is thrilled to be back -- hugging everyone he can.
          No one else knows what he's talking about -- from their POV
          he never left... It all seems the same except for quick shots
          of Ex the bitter janitor, aged Devil Girl pushing the coffee
          cart...
          Jay bounces through the MiB HQ -- it's just a regular day to
          everyone else, but it's HOME SWEET HOME to Jay.
          He even gives the worm guys a big, gushy hug.
          A crowd of people gathers around Kay, congratulating him on
          winning the Bowling trophy... AGAIN.
          Kay looks up -- SMILES BIG when he sees Jay.

                         KAY
          Alright, everyone, give me and my
          partner here a minute.
          They leave the guys alone. A beat -- and Jay just wraps him
          in THE BIGGEST HUG EVER.

                         JAY
          It's good to see you, man. So
          good. I just... do you remember...
          I mean, do you know what I've been
          through?
          Kay just stares at him.

                         KAY
          You mean, do I remember that you
          travelled back in time to save my
          life and the world? Not bad,
          slick. Not bad.

                         JAY
          No problem. You'd do the same for
          me. I just have one question...

                         (MORE)

                         

                         

                         

                         

          106.

                         JAY (CONT'D)
          When you disappeared... Why didn't
          I forget you when everyone else
          did?

                         KAY
          Well, I don't know exactly.
          Because I was dead. But in a
          quantum reality, objects can exist
          in contradictory states... So
          multiple timelines with varying
          probabilities can exist, and the
          one you're closest to

                         MATHEMATICALLY--

                         JAY
          Oh, you're talking about our
          closeness... you're talking about
          our love... Across timelines!
          You're saying our love will go on!
          Kay swats him away -- but the love couldn't be more clear.
          Jay feels something in his pocket -- the keychain. Takes it
          out.

                         JAY (CONT'D)
          He was a good man.

                         KAY
          Yes he was.

                         JAY
          I'm glad I know that.

                         KAY
          So you travelled back in time, huh?

                         JAY
          Yep.

                         KAY
          Wow. And you didn't change
          anything?

                         JAY
          No.

                         KAY
          You're sure? Because the littlest
          thing can have huge repercussions.

                         JAY
          I was very careful.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          107.

                         KAY
          Good man, good man. Well, let's
          get you a uniform.

                         JAY
          Excuse me?
          We PULL BACK --
          Revealing PRESENT DAY MIB IN ALL ITS KICKASS GRANDEUR.
          Eternally vigilant in the struggle to protect the Earth and
          all its inhabitants...
          And every one of those agents wearing BLUE SUITS WITH SHORTS.

                         JAY (CONT'D)
          Even I can't make that look good.

                                                     June 19th 1996







     NOTE: THE HARD COPY OF THIS SCRIPT CONTAINED SCENE NUMBERS.
     THEY HAVE BEEN REMOVED FOR THIS SOFT COPY.




                                                           FADE IN:

     THE SCREEN

     Stygean darkness.

     Wet CLICKING SOUNDS. A BEAM of purplish ULTRA-VIOLET LIGHT
     reveals a mosaic of moving forms... COCKROACHES. They skitter
     restlessly under the beam's intensity. SERIES OF SHOTS -- the
     UV Beam passing over various parts of the space. Pipe webs,
     walls, girders -- all covered with the insects. Thousands of
     them.

     PULL BACK TO REVEAL

     INT. SEWER SYSTEM

     Innards of steel. A vast maze of tunnels.

     A GROUP OF FIGURES advances through the tunnels with handheld
     UV lamps.

     The figures are dressed in gray air-tight NEOPRENE SUITS,
     their faces hidden by skin tight MASKS and bug-like NIGHT
     VISION GOGGLES. In the dense silence, respirator valves HISS-
     CLICK at the corner of their lips in mechanical rhythm.

     The scene has a dream-like, choreographed quality.

     NIGHT-VISION POV

     Eerie, aquatic green.  The horde of insects appear to be some
     kind of sea-life, crawling over the floor of a dead ocean.

     THE TEAM OF FIGURES

     From their midst appears another FIGURE, its neoprene suit a
     flat WHITE.  Female, clearly the TEAM LEADER.

     She carries a stainless steel CONTAINER filled with twenty
     small compartments, each bearing a large, heavy-shelled roach
     with a different BARCODE on their back.

     JUDAS ROACHES.

     She kneels and opens the

     CASE

     TCHK!! A dozen of the Judas roaches are released.  They slide
     through into the area.

     THE NEARBY ROACHES

     react instantaneously.  In a rustle of tiny legs, they begin
     to stream toward the Judases.

     Jostle and fight each other for position to mate with them.

     They even crawl over the Team Leader in an effort to reach
     the Judases.  The Team Leader makes no effort to brush them
     off.  Patient, almost godlike, she watches the MATING.

     LATER

     A MANHOLE has been opened above. CHAINS are dropped down and
     attached by a Team Member to A 100-GALLON DISPOSAL DRUM.

     REVEAL the floor of the tunnel, carpeted with the still forms
     of the roaches, now all DEAD.

     The Team Members quietly shovel the tiny corpses into other
     disposal drums.

     At their feet skitter the only survivors of the massacre:
     the bar-coded Judas Roaches.

     In a crunch of machinery, the first disposal drum is lifted
     by the chains through the manhole to

     EXT. A CITY STREET - DAY

     MIDTOWN MANHATTAN.  A cacophony of SOUND and LIGHT.

     Dirty snow drifts over Bryant Park. Emergency lights blink
     everywhere. A wall of cars sits on Sixth Avenue, stopped
     dead. Exhaust fumes hang in the air. Jaded TRAFFIC COPS send
     the cars on crosstown detours.

     Mounted policemen patrol a line of yellow sawhorses near
     dozens of Department of Public Health vehicles, angle-parked
     in a military phalanx.

     A monumental ribcage-like scaffolding has been erected in the
     middle of the street, "sealing" the area with amber plastic.

     Inside, UNIFORMED WORKERS take the disposal drum of roaches
     and toss it into one of a number of huge DUMPSTERS.

     The Team Leader watches from nearby, exhauster.  Her mask is
     off. We see her face: Enthomologist SUSAN WYETH, 28.

     An ARM gently drapes over her shoulder.

                          PETER (OS)
                How we doing?

     She looks over at DR. PETER TYLER, 34, bespectacled.  A
     HEADSET around his neck, a coat emblazoned with the
     DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH logo.  He has the look of a man who's
     just fought a long battle and come out victorious.

                          SUSAN
                We'll see...

     He offers her a bite of a PAY DAY CANDYBAR.  Susan smiles,
     shakes her head.  She wearily leans against him.

     Peter looks out as the dumpster filled with roaches is raised
     by MECHANICAL ARMS into the waiting maw of the dump truck.

     THE SCREEN. DARKNESS.

     A voice, a somber bas-relief in the darkness.

                          ANCHORMAN (VO)
                Strickler's Disease crept into Manhattan
                like a thief in the night, claiming its
                first hundred victims before it was even
                classified.

     INT. HOSPITAL - NIGHT - FLOATING SHOT

     We FLOAT through a long hospital ward.

     Past ROWS of illuminated oxygen tents, pulsating softly in
     the dark like cocoons of light.

                          ANCHORMAN (VO)
                Most were children under ten.

     TRACK past tents.  BODIES OF SMALL CHILDREN inside, wrapped
     in white sheets, hooked up to IVs or breathing apparatus.
     Skeletal hands, parched lips, glazed eyes.

     BELLOWS of respirators push in and out, labored, failing.

     IMAGE RESOLVES TO A VIDEO ON A SCREEN.

     PULL BACK to reveal a number of SCREENS, each with a
     different set of images.  We are in a NEWS VAN.   A
     TECHNICIAN and DIRECTOR sit watching.

     The voice belongs to an ANCHORMAN who's now overimposed.

                          ANCHORMAN
                Only after the numbers had reached into
                the thousands were officials able to
                identify the carrier of the deadly
                infection...

                          DIRECTOR
                Cut to three.

     The Technician manipulates the controls.  On another screen
     we see them cut to STOCK NEWS FOOTAGE: regular cockroaches,
     crawling on garbage.

                          ANCHORMAN
                Blattida Germanica.  The common
                cockroach.

                          DIRECTOR
                     (To a RUNNER)
                Tell them we're ready for a live feed.

     EXT. OUTSIDE VAN - CITY HALL - DUSK

     The runner exits the News Van.  Other such vehicles parked
     nearby.  A CROWD of ONLOOKERS, REPORTERS and a gaggle of
     PROTESTERS with handpainted signs.

     Gliding past them, we pick up sound bites...

                          REPORTER 1
                ...an insect that has proven virtually
                immune to chemical control...

                          REPORTER 2
                ...the announcement by the Health
                Department that an end to the nightmare
                has finally...

     REPORTER 3 is interviewing a Greenpeace PROTESTER who is
     holding up a photograph of Susan.

                          REPORTER 3
                ...an ex-colleague of Doctor Susan
                Wyeth...

                          PROTESTER
                ...Susan has always been opposed to
                biological tampering. A real advocate
                for ecological causes, it's not...

     MOVE past them to further inside of the perimeter...

     INT. AUDITORIUM - CITY HALL

     A NEWS CONFERENCE in progress.  A packed house.  T.V.
     monitors spaced ever 10 seats or so. In the audience, the
     MAYOR OF NEW YORK and various CITY OFFICIALS, listening to

     Peter, speaking at the podium with the ease and enthusiasm of
     a public servant still untainted by bureaucracy.

     ON A TV MONITOR

     While Peter talks, a news title appears at the bottom of the
     screen: PETER TYLER. DEPUTY DIRECTOR, DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH.

                          PETER
                     (wrapping up)
                ...in Nature, evolution is a long,
                leisurely conversation between an
                organism and its environment. We,
                however, did not have the luxury of
                time...

     Susan is waiting in the wings. She observes the audience.

     She notices that the entire front row is composed of CHILDREN
     who have survived Strickler's.  Leg and arm braces, facial
     scarring...

     He nods at Susan, who takes the podium, adjusting her jacket,
     slightly ill at ease in her business suit.  She clears her
     throat, speaks softly.

                          SUSAN
                With the aid of genetic labs throughout
                the country, we recombined cockroach DNA
                with genetic information from termites
                and mantids. We were able to create a
                biological counter-agent.  A new ally, if
                you will...

     She places a clear container on the podium for all to see.

                          SUSAN
                Blattida Traditor.

     CU CONTAINER

     One of the Judas roaches skitters about in the container.

                          SUSAN (OS)
                The "Judas Roach".

     Cameras FLASH.  MURMURS from the audience.

                          SUSAN
                The Judas is a non-carrier of Stricklers,
                with a short life-span and heightened
                pheromone emission.

     On the back row she can see some ecological hand-painted
     signs being raised in silent protest. She stumbles for a
     second, then resumes her speech.

                          SUSAN
                The female is basically a sexual magnet;
                common males travelled miles and fought
                for the right to mate with them.

     The audience is rapt.

                          SUSAN
                When they did, they took away something
                else we added -- a hormone, passed
                through sexual congress that causes their
                metabolism to go into overdrive.  No
                matter what their food intake, they
                starved to death in a matter of hours.

     Now Peter takes the mic.

                          PETER
                We've achieved almost total eradication
                of the roach population.  As of today,
                the disease has been officially
                contained.

     A STANDING OVATION starts and is carried on as we...

                                                            CUT TO:

     INT. TYLER APARTMENT - BATHROOM - SUSAN

     in a tub in a dark bathroom. Her business suit crumpled
     on the bathroom floor.  SOUND of a TV outside.

                          PETER (OS)
                Sus, come on.  You're missing it.

     INT. LIVING ROOM

     Nothing grand.  Peter in his shorts at a TV with shitty
     reception.  He adjusts the disgruntled cable box.

     He is seen over the TV, giving his address.

                          PETER
                Fucking thing! I hope someone's taping
                this.
                     (Out.)
                Susan, come on.  It's really good this
                time. I got most of the lines out.
                     (No response.)
                Sus?

     Peter sighs. He picks up an open bottle of champagne and
     two mis-matched ceramic cups, then heads for the bathroom.

     INT. BATHROOM

                          PETER
                Life's a bitch. Our 15 minutes came
                and went and all we got was bad
                cable...

     Susan doesn't answer, clearly not in the same high spirits.

                          PETER
                Hiding from the hard glare of publicity?

     He notices her crumpled garment on the floor.  He picks it
     up, puts it up on the hanger.

                          PETER
                A shame.  You looked great tonight.

                          SUSAN
                Please.

                          PETER
                You did!

     He sits by the tub.

                          SUSAN
                Do you think we did the right thing?

                          PETER
                Taking a cab instead of hiring a limo?

                          SUSAN
                You know what I mean...

     Peter pours some champagne into the cups.

                          SUSAN
                We did no impact evaluation.  The
                consequences of...

                          PETER
                     (sighs)
                Is this a Catholic guilt thing...?

     We hear a NEWSREADER on the TV.

                          NEWSREADER (TV)
                ...a flawless strategy which has stopped
                a potential epidemic in its tracks...

                          PETER
                You hear that?  Flawless.

                          SUSAN
                We just don't know.

     He offers one cup to Susan.  She doesn't take it.

                          PETER
                We know we saved lives.

     He sits closer to her.

                          PETER
                There're gonna be a lot of kids running
                around next year because of you.

     Beat.  Susan starts to relax. He kisses her.

                          PETER
                Who know?  We get lucky, maybe a couple
                of 'em'll be ours.

                          SUSAN
                     (smiling now)
                We're down to a "couple" now, huh?

     She pats the water, beckoning.

                          PETER
                Oh, I don't know. People are beginning
                to talk about us...

     Still partially clothed, he steps into the bathtub. Susan
     shakes her head, laughs ruefully.

                          SUSAN
                Don't worry, I'll save your honor.
                Maybe I'll even marry you.

     She reaches over, kisses him.

                                                          FADE OUT:

                                                        FADE IN TO:

     EXT. ALPHABET CITY - NIGHT

     The WILLIAMSBURG BRIDGE dimly visible through the rain.

     ALPHABET CITY STREETS

     Empty warehouses. Closed businesses. Traffic lights blinking
     on empty streets. Everything seems doomed under the heavy
     layer of rain.

     SUPERIMPOSE:  TWO YEARS LATER

     A DILAPIDATED BUILDING before us. A blazing NEON CROSS made
     of the words 'JESUS SAVES' hangs askew from its facade.

     CRANE to see the ROOFTOP.

     WHAM! The door to the interior stairs FLIES OPEN and a tall,
     thin CHINESE PREACHER in his sixties lurches out, eyes wild
     with terror.

     He looks back down the steps.

     Something's climbing up fast, casting ominous, complex
     shadows on the wall.

     Too many FOOTSTEPS for it to be just one person.

     The man hurriedly shuts the door and slides a bolt home.

     Trembling, he backs away as a booming THUD makes the door
     shudder. Raw, frenzied pounding and scratching follows...
     something inhuman, determined to break through.

     The metal surface suddenly buckles and bulges.

     On the man's white undershirt, a blotch of blood starts to
     grow.  Needles of rain stab his flesh.

     He searches wildly for a possible escape.

     He reaches the edge of the roof: it's five floors down to the
     sidewalk.

     Two of the hinges on the door come loose, pulverizing the
     surrounding concrete.

     WHAM!  The door to the stairs bulges outward as something
     SMASHES against it again and again.  Frenzied SCRATCHING.

     The man sprints to the other end of the roof. There, on the
     adjoining building...

     THE CHINESE PREACHER'S POV

     Just one floor below on the building across the alley is a
     suspended PAINTERS' PLATFORM, crowded with paint cans under a
     tarp.  A two-story old EYEWEAR ADVERTISEMENT from the 40's is
     being painted over.

     THE CHINESE PREACHER

     Looks back to the door.  BAM! a tremendous SHATTERING sound.
     LIGHT spills from inside. Two bolts fly in the air, a hinge
     gives.

     He CRIES OUT in terror.

     The man gauges the distance between buildings; can he make
     it?

     He takes a few steps back, a few more...

     Panting hard, he closes his eyes, his chest soaked in blood
     and rain.

     THE DOOR EXPLODES OUTWARD AND SKIDS ACROSS THE SLIPPERY ROOF.

     Light from inside projects the shadow of wild, busy things
     onto the curtain of rain.

     Weeping with fear, the man desperately tries to hurl himself
     to the catwalk.

     It's too far.

     He FALLS...CRASH!  he hits the platform, knocking boards
     loose and sending paint cans onto their sides, rolling.  He
     bounces, slides off the edge, barely able to grab onto a
     loose board to save himself from falling.

     The RAIN blasts down.  The scaffold CREAKS.  He hits the
     edge, upsetting the cans of paint there.

     He holds onto the planks with all his might, trying to push
     with his feet, but they slide on the wet wall.

     BELOW

     Cans bounce off the pavement. White pain blasts all over.

     CU HANDS

     The man's hands slip on the planks, tiring.

     FEET

     The Chinese Preacher's FEET bicycle in the air, unable to
     find a purchase on the wet brick wall-

     THE CHINESE PREACHER

     is hanging just in front of the painted EYE of the forties'
     model.  He looks up above him, sees something-

                          CHINESE PREACHER
                No.  Please, God, no!

     A SHADOW crosses his face as something looms above him.
     Suddenly there is a CRACK and the platform tilts completely
     on one end.

     HANDS

     The Chinese Preacher's fingernails dig in, then slip on the
     wet wood.

     His hands paw the air.

     WIDER

     For a moment his body, silhouetted in the rain, seems
     suspended in a void. Then he falls backwards.

     THE GROUND

     Impact. His body cracks the pavement.

     Small pools of rain form on his dead, open eyes.

     We CRANE to reveal

     A WINDOW ON A BUILDING ACROSS THE STREET

     CHUY, a young Latino boy. He stares out the window at the
     Chinese Preacher's body with no discernable emotion.

     He works a small WIRE SCULPTURE in his hands.

     APARTMENT

     It's a small one-bedroom apartment.

     An old man sleeps peacefully on a cot: Chuy's grandfather.
     MANNY GAVIOLA, mid 60's, white hair haloes his handsome,
     benign face.

     All around him: SHOES, shoes everywhere you look, on the
     table, on the chairs, on the kitchen counter, on the floor.

     A small altar is illuminated by votive candles. Next to it,
     standing by the window is

     CHUY

     HIS P.O.V.

     We see a blurry vision of The Chinese Preacher's splayed
     figure in a swirl of color.

     Chuy's attention focuses on the Preacher's shoes.

     CHUY

                          CHUY
                     (a whisper)
                Oxfords, 8 1/2. Black...

     He looks away from the body and goes back to twisting the
     wire into shape.

     THE PUDDLE OF PAINT

     around the preacher, reflects large shadows moving above,
     and across the neon sign...

     CHUY

     hears a strange sound, a rhythmic clicking.

     His head lifts and what he sees causes his expression to
     change--there is an uncharacteristic flicker of excitement in
     his eyes.

     ACROSS THE ROOFTOP

     We are behind whatever it is that has captured Chuy's
     attention.

     TICKETY-TACKETY-TOCK...

     The strange clicking sound grows louder.  The figure begins
     moving in some weird, preparatory fashion. Then it steps
     forward and drops out of frame.

     CHUY

     His eyes follow the figure down to the pavement in a slow
     arc.

     Chuy puts down the wire miniature and opens the window to get
     a better view.

     GROUND LEVEL

     The Chinese Preacher's body is now being dragged toward the
     rear of the alley, leaving colored paint smears in its wake.

     CHUY

     We isolate the boy's face and, on the soundtrack, every other
     noise FADES AWAY.

     Chuy reaches for a pair of SPOONS nearby.

     He begins to click them together.

     Imitating the strange clicking sound heard a moment ago.

     THE CHINESE PREACHER

     is being pulled into a small, ground-level vent. The only
     problem is that no human is small enough to squeeze through
     this hole.

     CHUY

     watches, still clicking with his spoons.

     THE CHINESE PREACHER'S BODY

     is stuck. One of his legs is through the hole up to the
     thigh, but the other is folded up unnaturally and pressing
     against the wall next to the vent. Impossible.

     There is a silent beat, and then a series of INCREDIBLY
     VIOLENT TUGS, BAM! BAM! BAM! shaking the Paint-soaked body
     like a rag doll.

     CHUY

     His spoons stop. His jaw tightens a little as we hear
     terrible cracking and scraping sounds.

     THE WINDOW

     The Chinese Preacher's head and hands disappear into the
     hole. Bits of clothing, paint and blood stick to the edges of
     the opening.

     CHUY

     watches, still fascinated.

                          CHUY
                     (very low)
                Funny, funny shoes...

     He starts a new wire sculpture.

                                                            CUT TO:

     EXT. JOGGING PATH - CENTRAL PARK - DAWN

     Peter is covered in sweat, running at a good clip around the
     Central Park reservoir. A beautiful day dawns behind him; the
     windows of the Beresford sparkle in the morning sun.

     Peter outperforms most of the other RUNNERS in the track, his
     steady rhythm evidence of years of practice. Keeping his
     stride, he runs off the track and past a flock of OLD NUNS.

                          PETER
                Excuse me, ladies...

     Without slowing down, Peter retakes the path and moves past
     them.

     EXT. JOGGER'S PATH - NEAR FIFTH AVENUE - LATER

     Peter finally slows down. He checks his pulse and stops at a
     water fountain.

     As he drinks, he sees a DERELICT drawing a figure on the
     sidewalk.

     The derelict spots Peter.  He picks up his chalk, drifts off.

     Intrigued, Peter goes closer to the drawing. An arrow points
     to a manhole cover set among the bushes.

     Peter circles around, trying to make sense out of the lines.

     Then the painted motif finally reveals itself.

     GRAFFITI

     A talismanic figure of raw, archetypal power. A few jagged
     lines form the shape of a MAN IN AN OVERCOAT. His face is
     little more than a malignant blotch.

                                                            CUT TO:

     INT. MUSEUM - EXHIBIT ROOM - DAY

     A room of half-finished exhibits. A group of SCULPTORS --
     most of them undergraduates -- work on a gigantic piece
     representing a termite mound.  They're supervised by SIRI, a
     punkish young Indian research assistant.

     Susan talks to some of the sculptors about a 100-1 scale
     clay model of an insect's head.  She gestures to the
     model's mandible set.

                          SUSAN
                ...no, guys, these have to fit
                perfectly.  No spaces in between. Let
                me tell you why. Insects have no
                hands. All they have is this set of
                mandibles.

     She grabs the outer mandible set.

                          SUSAN
                See?  This little piggy will grab the
                prey.

     Then unfolds a second set...

                          SUSAN
                Then this little piggy will tear it
                in half...

     And a third!!!

                          SUSAN
                ...and this little one will grind it
                to a pulp and push it in... all the
                way into the mouth.  These are
                precision tools here. Can you
                remember that?

     The guys nod.

                          SUSAN
                Good.  Then get it right.

     A piece of the termite mound is raised above their heads,
     revealing...

     ...Peter, at the entrance, still dressed in his jogging
     sweats. He smiles at Susan.

                                                            CUT TO:

     EXHIBITS

     Peter and Susan walk through.  Peter pulls something from a
     KNAPSACK.  A bottle of medicine marked: METALLININ.

                          PETER
                     (teasing)
                "Baby in a bottle..."

     He gives it to Susan.

                          SUSAN
                Don't tease.

     Around them, WORKMEN begin unloading crates of display stuff,
     as a MAN on a ladder tacks up an "ARCHITECTS OF NATURE"
     banner. Susan proceeds behind an exhibit representing a
     honeycomb.  Peter follows as she begins to arrange some tools.

                          PETER
                You know where they get this
                fertility stuff?  They extract it
                from the urine of menopausal Italian
                nuns.

                          SUSAN
                     (laughs)
                Monks bottle their own wine. Don't
                they?

     She gently touches her belly.

                          SUSAN
                Trust me. I've never been this late.
                Never.

     She shakes the bottle.

                          SUSAN
                If nun's pee is what it takes...

     Peter's cellular RINGS from his knapsack. Susan grabs a
     larvae model from a pile on the floor.

                          SUSAN
                You were the one who ran around with
                ice in his underwear, don't forget
                that.

                          PETER
                Don't get kinky here...

     Peter takes the call. Susan cuts away the excess plastic on
     the lid around the honeycomb moldings. The larvae fits
     perfectly inside.

                          PETER
                Okay, meet me out front.
                     (to Susan)
                I gotta go. Josh's picking me up in five.
                see you tonight.

                          SUSAN
                I'll be late.

     He kisses her and leaves. Susan turns to Siri and the group
     working on that sculpture.

                          SUSAN
                Siri, sandblast that thing. It looks
                like Trump Tower.  Those mounds are
                supposed to be made of dirt and
                excretions...

                          SIRI
                     (a wicked smile)
                Just like Trump Tower, then.

     EXT. STREET

     A Department of Health VAN honks its way through a traffic
     jam.

     INT. VAN

     Peter's right hand man, JOSH MASLOW -- a young, good-natured,
     can-do guy -- drives.

                          JOSH
                ...So I say "buddy, you have every
                violation in the book.  Gimme one
                good reason not to close you down."
                You know what the Kraut says to me?

     In the back, Peter finishes changing out of his jogging
     sweats and into his worksuit.

                          JOSH
                The blintzes!  "Try the blintzes..."

                     (distractedly)
                Selling your sould for a fistful of

                Not just any carbohydrates, mind you.
                It was like being on the receiving
                end of some kind of transcendent oral
                sex.
                     (honks furiously)
                We should get a strobe on this thing.
                Maybe even a siren.

                          PETER
                Yeah, and a loudspeaker so you can
                yell "Epidemic! Epidemic! You're all
                going to die!"

     EXT. FLOPHOUSE - DAY

     The Department of Health van pulls up outside the flophouse
     where the Chinese Preacher died. Peter and Josh get out.

     COPS push back a few ONLOOKERS. Josh proudly flashes his DOH
     badge.

                          JOSH
                Health Department...

     The cops let them pass.

                          PETER
                You really love flashing that thing,
                don't you?

                          JOSH
                Hey. I'm a short guy. Waddaya want?

     Two cops -- WOYCHEK and RICE -- approach, in no real hurry.

                          PETER
                Peter Tyler, DOH. You gentlemen were
                the first on the scene?

                          WOYCHEK
                     (gestures to Rice)
                We were both on patrol, saw this paint
                mess. Then I looked through that cellar
                window. We both did...

                          PETER
                You gone in?

                          WOYCHEK
                No. We waited.

                          PETER
                Good.

     Peter peeks through a narrow cellar window on the floor.

     Through the oily, smeared window, a ghostly array of PALE
     FACE AND HANDS appears, startling him.

                          PETER
                     (to Josh)
                Get the EMT's in there, now.

                                                            CUT TO:

     LATER

     PARAMEDIC AMBULANCES rush in. Sirens at full blast.

     Stepping out of the building across, Manny walks next to
     Chuy, who holds his hand. The old man carries a box full of
     shoes.

     Chuy looks back at the cop circus, amused.

                          MANNY
                C'mon Chuy, we're gonna be late.
                     (discreetly crossing himself)
                Cops are bad news. Don't look at them.

     He gently pulls his grandson's hand and moves briskly away.

     JOSH

     uses an iron bar, and breaks a padlocked cellar door. A heavy
     stench emanates from inside. The cops cover their noses.

     INT. CELLAR

     Peter and Josh enter a dingy, dungeon-like cellar,
     illuminated only by bug zappers and emergency lights. Every
     door and window has been nailed shut or sports a heavy-duty
     padlock. Peter and Josh walk through the dismal scene.

     In sharp contrast with the dirt-smeared walls, we see shiny
     metallic SEWING MACHINES and swatches of cloth appliqued with
     a FUNNY BUNNY cartoon character.

     Josh examines the label stitched into the collar. It reads:
     PROUDLY MADE IN USA.

                          PETER
                Jesus.

     His light hits a group of quivering, skeletal CHINESE
     IMMIGRANTS, standing in a tight group against a wall.

                          WOYCHEK
                     (from the outside)
                They look real sick, don't they?

                                                            CUT TO:

     INT. STAIRWELL, MUSEUM - DUSK

     Carrying boxes full of terrarium material, Susan and Siri
     ride an antiquated cage-steel elevator.  No floor buttons,
     just an old-fashioned hand-activated lever.

                          SUSAN
                ...as long as they're ready for the
                opening I don't care, just tell them
                that.

                          SIRI
                I'm on it.  Don't worry.
                     (Beat)
                Look, Susan...I don't mean to pry,
                but... I kinda overheard you and
                Peter.

                          SUSAN
                     (Smiles ironically)
                Watch your step, Siri.  Your grant
                could be on the line here.

                          SIRI
                I just...well, I had this cousin in
                Delhi.  She was having problems, too.
                She, ah...

                          SUSAN
                What?

                          SIRI
                She used a baster.

     Susan looks at her.

                          SIRI
                Not a big one.  I mean, it was like a
                turkey baster.

                          SUSAN
                Oh, Jesus.

     She tries to stop the elevator at the fourth floor, but
     it rises just a little too far.

                          SUSAN
                Come on, darlin'...

     Susan has to jimmy the lever till the elevator falls
     level to the floor.

                          SIRI
                     (continues)
                She kept it under her bed. Thing is,
                it kinda worked.  I mean, she had to
                hide it from her husband, but...

     A pair of young boys, RICKY and DAVIS, sit on the floor
     outside Susan's lab door.  A crumpled paper bag and a shoe
     box sit beside them.

                          SUSAN
                What's this?

                          SIRI
                Oh, right... They been here since noon.
                I told them you're real busy.

     Susan smiles at the boys, who stand when they see her.

                          SUSAN
                Hello.

                          RICKY
                You the bug lady, right?

     Siri chuckles.

                          SUSAN
                     (smiles)
                I suppose so.

     Ricky raises and shakes the paper bag.

                          RICKY
                We're here to deal.

     INT. MOUNTING ROOM - DUSK

     SUNLIGHT slants in to illuminate an incredible array of live
     and mounted dead INSECTS, trapped in turn-of-the-century
     glass fronted cabinets. Davis puts his nose up against one,
     fascinated.

                          SUSAN
                Metaxonycha Godmani, Trigonopelastes
                Delta.  Field Butterflies.  Have you been
                upstate?

     She examines the boys' findings, mostly rag-tag specimens
     of battered butterflies.

                          DAVIS
                Avenue B.

                          SUSAN
                     (sadly)
                I guess they got lost in this city.

                          RICKY
                So, you wanna buy em?

                          DAVIS
                There's extra wings in the bag.

     Siri lingers in the background.

                          SUSAN
                You guys have done a nice job.  How bout
                five dollars?

                          RICKY
                     (dismayed)
                That's it?

                          DAVIS
                     (to Ricky)
                Show her the weirdbug.

     He indicates the shoebox-

                          RICKY
                Cost a dollar just to look.

                          DAVIS
                It's a great bug.  We kinda broke it a
                little...

     Siri impatiently points at the wall clock-

                          SUSAN
                Fellas, I'll tell you what...ten dollars
                for everything.  Plus a killing jar, some
                tweezers and mounts so the next bunch you
                catch will be in better shape.

                          DAVIS
                Deal!

                          RICKY
                You crazy! That's the best!!

                          DAVIS
                Bug's almost dead anyway.

     Susan holds out two five dollar bills.  The boys can't
     resist.  Davis grabs the money-

                          DAVIS
                Thanks, lady.

     Ricky gives a last possessive look to the shoe box, then
     follows Davis out.

     Siri crosses to the window and wrestles to close it.

                          SIRI
                Ten dollars?

     Susan places all the kid's items -including the shoebox- in
     a wastebasket.

                          SUSAN
                Alphabet City kids- there's much worse
                things they could be selling.

     Siri hits the window frame with a paperweight, gets it half
     way down.

                          SIRI
                I hate this fucking window...

     EXT. ACROSS STREET FROM MUSEUM - NIGHTFALL

     CRANE TO a nearby alley.

     A GAUNT MAN IN AN OVERCOAT stands in the shadows, looking up
     at Siri working on the window.

     As a streetlamp lights up, he backs up into the shadows.

                                                            CUT TO:

     INT. FLOPHOUSE. LOBBY - NIGHTFALL

     Religious slogans and posters are hung everywhere in what
     used to be the lobby of a men's hotel.  A hand-lettered sign:
     "NO LIQUOR, NO DRUGS, NO PROFANITY"

     PARAMEDICS are leading a number of ill CHINESE IMMIGRANTS up
     from the cellar door seen earlier.  Many are brought out on
     STRETCHERS. DOH staff put tags on their wrists.

     Peter examines a PALE OLD MAN on a stretcher while
     simultaneously talking to Josh.

                          PETER
                     (to Josh)
                There's plenty of systemic infection
                already, so as soon as we get a
                preliminary reading, start them on
                anti-biotics. You saw this?

     Peter flicks on his penlight, examines the Old Man's eyes.
     One of them is completely bloodshot. Then he shows Josh
     the gums. They're bleeding.

                          PETER
                Internal hemorrage. 2 our of 5 have
                it.  No definite signs of TB, but we'll
                quarantine them a week just to make sure.

                          JOSH
                Immigration's gonna love you for that.

                          PETER
                Tell them to send flowers to the
                usual address.

     INT. SWEAT SHOP. BASEMENT

     Peter pushes back a sheet hung across a doorway.

     BASEMENT SHOWERS

     A tiled nightmare. Concentration camp-cozy. A pile of old,
     rusting sewing machines clutter the floor, spilling
     oxide to a central grate.

                          JOSH
                Two shifts, people rotating from bed to
                work.  One toilet. We're in Wal-Mart
                hell, here.

     Josh swats a fly.

                          PETER
                Did they get the sleazebag who owns this
                place?

                          JOSH
                Triad, Chinese Mafia. They bring people
                from Yunan. Slave labor...
                     (eyes his notebook)
                Reverend Harry Wong, a preacher had the
                flophouse fronting for them. No sign of
                him.

     An overhead door is opened. Daylight streams in. Peter spots
     YANG, an Asian cop, talking to a CHINESE WOMAN lying on a
     stretcher which hasn't been moved yet.  She is hollow-eyed,
     near death.  Her hand weakly hangs on to the cop as if for
     dear life.

                          PETER
                Tell her she's going to be alright.
                We'll take care of her.

     Peter kneels next to her, looking at her and nodding while
     Yang translates. The woman mutters again, tears of fear in
     her eyes.  Yang shakes his head.

                          YANG
                She's delirious.  Keeps saying the "Dark
                Angels" are coming for her. She says
                they took some of her people away.

                          PETER
                Dark Angels?

                          YANG
                     (Shrugs.)
                Probably a gang.  Chinese people, man.
                They come up with some wacky stuff.

     They pull the stretcher out through the open overhead door
     and into an

     ALLEY

     The stretcher is rolled into a waiting vehicle, its lights
     flashing. Unseen by them, on a brick wall, nearly buried by
     graffiti, is a crude DRAWING.

     It is of the same, odd figure Peter saw drawn earlier.  The
     OVERCOAT MAN.

     INT. LAB - NIGHT - MONTAGE

     Susan and Siri, both wearing Walkman headsets, deftly mount
     BUTTERFLIES and other INSECTS onto display boards for the
     exhibit. Rain is blowing in through the half-open window.

     Their movements are precise and lyrical, the colors and
     designs of the insects are beautiful.

     We understand how you can get lost in this world.  Susan
     works steadily, a partially-eaten PAY-DAY BAR and the
     wrappers of several others are evidence of her dinner.

     A PAGER goes off in Susan's lab coat.

     She takes off her headset; CLASSICAL MUSIC leaks from her
     headphones.

     On the PAGER's LCD screen the message reads: LATE
     TONIGHT. PETE.

     Susan puts the pager down. Goes to close the window.

     There is a loud, angry BUZZING sound.

                          SUSAN
                Siri?
                     (louder)
                Siri?!

     Siri pulls her headset off; HEAVY METAL MUSIC leaks from her
     headphones.

     The BUZZING sound again. We PAN across the various bugs and
     mounting implements till we come to rest...

     ...on the SHOEBOX the boys gave Susan. Something rattles
     wildly inside.

                          SIRI
                ...the fuck?

     Susan crosses to the trash bin, picks the box out. It
     vibrates on her hand, then becomes quiet, something moves
     inside.

     She slowly opens the lid.

     The bottom of the box is littered with two inches of shredded
     newspaper. Crumbs of bread and some rice-krispies can be
     spotted here and there: a kid's idea of a comfy critter's
     nest. She moves her free hand closer.

                          SUSAN
                     (To Siri)
                Can you...?

     Suddenly and INSECT big as her hand springs out of the
     shredded paper nest and tries to grab on to her! Minute
     pieces of paper fly through the air!!

     Susan slaps the lid back down.

                          SUSAN
                     (a scared whisper)
                Could you...help me...?

                                                            CUT TO:

     LATER

     Siri comes over as Susan grabs steel tongs and a cork
     dissecting board.

                          SUSAN
                I'm gonna pull it out and I want you to
                pin it down, okay?

                          SIRI
                What is it?

                          SUSAN
                I have no idea.  Are you ready?

     Siri nods, pins in hand.  Susan opens the lid and grabs the
     nymph with the tongs.  The creature goes berserk, flailing
     its spindly limbs, BUZZING and CROAKING, a milky substance
     FOAMING out of its body.

                          SIRI
                Oh my God...

     Susan deposits the insect onto the corkboard.

     Siri tries to get a hold of it; but it twists out of the
     tongs and wraps its coarse legs around her hand!! A spider
     trapping a sparrow.

                          SIRI
                Shit!! Get it!  Get it!

     SNAP!  It bites her hand between index and forefinger.

     Susan pins the insect into the corkboard. It spins furiously,
     like a crazy LP record.

     Susan gets a grip on it again with the tongs.  Siri uses more
     pins to secure it down.

                          SUSAN
                     (Noticing Siri's hand)
                It bit you.

                          SIRI
                No shit.

     SUSAN

     leans to get a closer look at the NYMPH: Deep dark brown,
     flat as a pancake, one rear leg broken, lower tail smashed.

     It squirms helplessly now, looking pitiful under the harsh
     overhead light.

                          SUSAN
                This wing configuration. I've
                never...

                          SIRI
                     (looking at her injury)
                Fuck! It broke the skin...

                          SUSAN
                And they're not fully developed.  This
                thing's not even an adult.

     The nymph continues to HISS and FOAM, struggling against the
     steel pins. Susan looks closely at the insect's belly.

                          SUSAN
                My God.

                          SIRI
                What?

     Susan gestures to look.  Siri stares down at

     THE NYMPH'S TORSO

     where a SET OF VALVES on its underside click in and out.

                          SUSAN (OS)
                It's breathing.

     SIRI

     shakes her head.

                          SIRI
                That's impossible.  Insects don't...

                          SUSAN
                I know.
                     (Picks up a SCALPEL)
                Help me get a sample.

     Susan touches her scalpel to the nymph's leg.

     The nymph CLICKS nervously.

                          SUSAN
                Hold on, big guy, hold on...

     She traps the nymph down and CUTS THE LEG OFF.

     A painful, agonized BUZZ echoes around the room.

                                                            CUT TO:

     MONITOR

     Susan attaches the insect's leg to a samll holder. It is
     frozen in a swirl of dry ice.

     The brittle leg is then mounted in a LASER MICROTOME. Bit by
     bit, the machine executes MICROSCOPIC WAFER CUTS. Siri is
     making slides out of each section.

     A series of MICROPHOTOGRAPHIC IMAGES flash onto the screen.
     In the background we hear the high-pitched BUZZ-

     We see the lights from the mounting room through a glass
     brick wall.

     INT. MOUNTING ROOM - NIGHT

     We see the nymph slowly squirming in the FG, then RACK FOCUS
     to the rain-spattered WINDOW.

     Suddenly the OVERCOAT MAN is standing on the windowsill!

     The window is lifted effortlesly from the outside.

     SUSAN

     prepares a blue solution and places two drops on each smear
     slide.

     Reflected in the glass brick behind her we see the man moving
     across the room.

     THE OVERCOAT MAN

     seen only through rippled glass and reflections, moves
     through the lab.

     His body STEAMS lightly from the rain. His movements are
     quirky, spastic.

     The man observes the imprisoned insects with curiosity.

     He comes to the nymph, pinned and mutilated on the worktable.
     The nymph CLICKS and CHITTERS excitedly, as if communicating
     with the man.

     He looks up at the worklight.  It seems to bother him.

     WHUMP!!! In a blur of motion, he SMASHES the light bulb.

     SUSAN

     watches the smear slide.  The blue droplets begin to CHANGE
     COLOR once in contact with the leg section...

                          SUSAN
                Hold on a second...

     ...slowly turning a deep green.

                          SIRI
                What?

     Then, THREE LARGE BEETLES fly into the room.

     Siri looks at Susan. Susan gets up, hesitant, signals for
     Siri to stay.

     We FOLLOW Susan into the mounting room.

     SUSAN'S POV

     She walks in, barely able to see her hand in front of her
     face.

     The window facing the street is wide open, rain blowing in.

     Something CRUNCHES under her feet.  She bends down, looks.

     She's stepped on the broken glass of the lightbulb.

     The floor is alive with various INSECTS -- crawling, hopping,
     flying away from their displays, which have been opened.

     The nymph is gone from the board!

     She looks under the work table the nymph was on.

     We LOWER as we TRACK BACK with her.  Something is folded up
     in the corner of the ceiling behind her, camouflaged in the
     shadows, clinging impossibly to the wall.

     THE OVERCOAT MAN.

     He lowers himself with silent grace.

     Susan whirls.

     WHOOSH! A GUST OF WIND! A FLUTTERING SHADOW OFF THE WINDOW!

     Silence.

                          SIRI (O.S.)
                Susan?

     Susan GASPS, startled.  We SHIFT to see Siri at the door.

                          SUSAN
                Call security.

                                                            CUT TO:

     EXT. FLOPHOUSE - NIGHT

     The last DOH van takes off under the heavy rain.

     Across the street, Chuy looks down from his apartment window.

     INT. MANNY'S APARTMENT - SAME

     Chuy sits at the window, twisting wire into a human-like
     figure.  MOVING past him, we see a group of other WIRE
     FIGURES on the table, backs of chairs, lamps, everywhere.

     Manny sits at the kitchen table. He IGNITES a can of shoe
     polish with a match, then lights a cigarette off the flame.

     He puts the cigarette in his mouth and proceeds to polish a
     pair of shoes. A SILLY SHOW plays over the TV.

                          MANNY
                Not too little, not too much. You rub it
                in, around and around like this. Let the
                leather take it.

     Manny leans tiredly against the table. He looks fatigued
     and in pain. He takes a small pill and places it under
     his tongue.

                          MANNY
                You watching? You should learn to
                work the shoes. You're good with your
                hands...

     Manny shoots a glance over to his grandson.

                          MANNY
                Chuy...you gonna get all wet.

     Chuy doesn't pay attention, just stares out at the street.

                          MANNY
                Did you look at the story book I got you?

     Manny lifts a brightly colored CHILDREN'S BOOK.

                          MANNY
                Our Animal Friends.  Can you say that,
                Chico?  "Friends"?

     Nothing from Chuy.

     CHUY'S POV - STREET

     The building across the street. Yellow DOH tape at the
     entrance.

                          MANNY (OS)
                A friend is the one you can trust.  When
                you are with a friend, no matter where in
                the world, you are at home.

     A FIGURE moves out of the shadows and totters in the rain
     toward the entrance.  It is the OVERCOAT MAN, barely visible
     in the rain.

                          MANNY
                In this city. A friend is a hard thing to
                find...

     CHUY

     His face shows a bit of animation.

                          CHUY
                Funny Shoes...

     Manny looks up from the book.

                          CHUY
                Alli.  Mr. Funny Shoes.

     Manny comes over, looks out.

     THEIR POV

     The figure has disappeared into the dark front of the
     boarded-up building.

     MANNY AND CHUY

                          MANNY
                No one is there. Is empty.

     Chuy doesn't respond.  Manny turns the boy's face to his.

                          MANNY
                Chuy, listen to me.  They have Jesus on
                the cross, but that is not a holy place.
                You understand?

     Chuy looks at him blankly.  Manny sighs; he knows he doesn't.

                          MANNY
                Ah, Nino.  God only knows what goes on in
                your head, eh?

     He pats the boy on the head, then goes back to work. Chuy
     turns back to stare at the street.

                          CHUY
                Mr. Funny Shoes...

     EXT. OUTSIDE TYLER APARTMENT BUILDING - NIGHT

     The D.O.H. Van pulls up in front of a modest Pre-war
     building. Josh and Peter climb out.

     Peter is reviewing a roster.

                          PETER
                Josh, what was Immigration's
                countdown?

     Josh hands Peter a plastic bag with his sweat clothes
     and running shoes.

                          JOSH
                Thirty-three workers.

     Peter hands him the roster.

                          PETER
                There are thirty five listed in the
                reverend Wong's roster...

                          JOSH
                Shit.

     Peter walks up the front steps.

                          PETER
                Remember what that woman said, about
                people being taken? Check with the
                copsin the area.

     INT. TYLER APARTMENT - NIGHT

     Peter enters the apartment, which has long since been
     remodeled with a nicer couch and a bigger TV with slightly
     better reception.

                          PETER
                Sus?

     No answer.  He notices the dining room table is filled with
     yellowed FILES, all marked JUDAS TRADITOR.

                          PETER
                     (Looks around once again)
                Susan?

     INT. LAUNDRY ROOM

     Peter comes in to find Susan sitting in a chair before a
     dryer, quietly watching laundry whirl within.

                          PETER
                     (Regarding the laundry.)
                Thought it was my week for that.

                          SUSAN
                     (Shrugs.)
                I needed to think. It was either this
                or the weather channel.

     Peter walks over, kisses her.  He notices an open book of
     INSECT MORPHOLOGY on her lap. There's a FULL COLOR
     PHOTOGRAPH of an OOTHECA -- an insect eggcase.

     INT. LAUNDRY ROOM - LATER

     Peter folds laundry into his/her piles.  Susan paces.

                          SUSAN
                This thing was the size of my fist,
                Peter!! That's off the charts!

                          PETER
                Okay. So you lost a great specimen-

                          SUSAN
                Don't you get it? It's more than
                that.

     Peter takes a bedsheet. Susan helps him fold it.

                          SUSAN
                You know why insects don't grow larger?
                Because they don't have a complex
                respiratory system. What I saw did. It
                had lungs.

     Peter walks backward with his end of the sheet.  The two
     begin to fold it together.

                          SUSAN
                Evolution doesn't work that fast.
                Something pushed that thing to take the
                leap. We need to find another specimen.

                          PETER
                We?

     As they fold the sheet, they move closer together.

                          SUSAN
                I did a PH test on its tarsal pads.

     The folding of the sheet has brought them almost face to
     face. Susan finishes folding herself.

                          SUSAN
                There's only two species who match the
                enzymes I found.  One's a leaf-cutter ant
                in the Amazon...

     She has his full attention now.

                          SUSAN
                The other we released here two years ago.

     EXT. ALPHABET CITY - AVENUE B - DAY

     A TAXI CAB makes a U turn and cruises on.

     INT. CAB

     Susan ignores the yakking Armenian DRIVER as she scans
     the buildings and empty lots-

                          ARMENIAN DRIVER
                Avenue B... again! Maybe you got
                wrong letter, uh?

     The cabbie looks up at a Manhattan street map glued over
     his head on the roof of the cab.

                          SUSAN
                Keep going. We'll tell you when to
                stop...

                          PETER
                Maybe they lied to you.

                          SUSAN
                Even if they did... that's all we
                have, isn't it?

     The cab cruises past the tenement buildings, nondescript
     stores, junked cars and rubble-strewn lots. It stops
     before a traffic light.

     A LEERING HOMELESS GUY with a greasy rag and greasier
     cleaning solution approaches the windshield.

                          ARMENIAN
                No... Oh, shit. Get away, you Turk!

     The Homeless guy begins wiping/smudging the windshield
     with his dirty rag. The driver sends him away.

     The light turns green.  The Driver accelerates, turning
     on the windshield wipers to expunge the smears left by
     the guy.

     Susan sees something.

                          SUSAN
                Pull over!

                          ARMENIAN DRIVER
                What...?

     Susan motions excitedly.  The Driver pulls over. Susan
     gets out.

     EXT. OUTSIDE CAR

     Susan rushes over, removes something from the windshield
     wiper.

     A BUTTERFLY, its wing pinned under the rubber flapper.
     She holds it in her palm, then looks up at Peter.

                          SUSAN
                Metaxonycha Godmani.

                          PETER
                So?

     Susan looks around.  Just ahead is an empty LOT surrounded by
     a wooden fence plastered with flyers for rock bands and
     performance artists.

     An identical BUTTERFLY perches on the edge of a board.

     EXT. EMPTY LOT

     Susan and Peter walk through waist-high GRASS of a small
     urban wilderness.  Dozens of BUTTERFLIES flutter around them
     from the weeds.

                          RICKY (OS)
                If you want your money back, forget it!

     Peter and Susan look up.  The voice comes from a RAMSHACKLE
     CLUBHOUSE, built of wood scraps and cardboard.

                          DAVIS (OS)
                We already spent it!

     Susan walks forward.

                          SUSAN
                We're here to deal.

     Long beat.  The door to the clubhouse swings open.

                                                            CUT TO:

     INT. SUBWAY STATION - DAY

     A BLUR of subway cars goes by with an ear-pulverizing SOUND.

     At the end of the platform, Davis untwists a wire around the
     busted lock of a locker room door. Peter paces nervously
     nearby.

                          PETER
                Here, let me...

     He starts on it himself. Meanwhile, Ricky stares at a
     PHOTOGRAPH Susan has given to him:  a ribbed, tortoise-
     brown colored EGGCASE.

                          SUSAN
                You sure you didn't see one of these?

                          RICKY
                Gross. What is it?

                          SUSAN
                An "Ootheca". An eggcase. It probably had
                more, uh "weirdbugs" inside.

                          RICKY
                     (shakes his head)
                No way. I see one of those, I'd puke.

     Davis opens the door with a CLICK.

     INT. SUBWAY LOCKER ROOM

     A dark, abandoned LOCKER ROOM once used for transit workers.

     Susan and Peter walk in with the boys, nervous in the off-
     limits area.

                          DAVIS
                It was in that corner over there.

     Davis points to a bank of dented metal LOCKERS.

                          RICKY
                Sucker was fast, man.
                     (Picks up a pipe.)
                Had to take it out with one a these.

                          PETER
                Okay, guys.  We'll take it from here.

     Peter hands Ricky some money. The boy looksdown at it
     slyly.

                          RICKY
                Make it ten an' we won't tell the cops
                you're here.

     Peter regards the little scam artist dryly.

                          PETER
                Let's keep it at five and I won't
                condemn your clubhouse.

     Peter hands him a couple of dollars more. The two boys
     take off.

     Peter removes a PENLIGHT from his pocket.

     Dust covers everything. A forest of COPPER TUBING and PIPES
     where the sinks used to be.

     PETER

     inspects the floor. It's littered with cheap objects:
     chipped combs, used rubbers, soggy newspapers, smeared
     heroin syringes.

     Something shiny catches his eye. He picks it up.

                          PETER
                     (quietly)
                Look, a broken tooth...

     Something rustles nearby.

     He notices an old, rotting poster on the back wall.  It
     seems ODDLY TEXTURED somehow.  He walks toward it.

     SUSAN

     kneeling, pushes aside a dented trash bin. Behind it, there
     is a cabinet with rusty sliding doors.

     A SUBWAY TRAIN RUMBLES by outside, the sound echoes off
     the tile walls.

     Susan forces the door back. She peeks through the opening.

     Her face stares back at her from a dirty pocket mirror.
     She starts pulling something out.

     PETER

     at the oddly texture wall.  He shines the penlight at it...

     ...and is met with a FLUTTER OF WINGS.  MOTHS, perfectly
     camouflaged against the poster on the wall, whiz past him.

     Peter recoils.

                          SUSAN (OS)
                You okay?

     He nods.

     SUSAN

     turns back to her locker.  She withdraws a cheap PLASTIC
     NECKLACE from it.  As she removes it, it breaks.  A coulpe of
     beads fall away...

     ...rolls under the locker...

     ...and BOUNCE -- once, twice, thrice -- each time going
     deeper till they comes to a stop.

     Susan peers where the beads fell.

                          SUSAN
                There's something under here.

     Peter comes over, kneels by her. Susan takes a handful of
     beads and throws them at the base of the locker.

     CAMERA TRACKS to follow one of them. It rolls all the way
     under.

     A moment later, from some interior space, the sound of it
     BOUNCING on cement. He shines his light inside.

     INT. HOLE - PETER'S HAND

     Very dark. A highlight glints off a shell-like surface.

     The light barely touches it.

     THE WHOLE SURFACE BACKS AWAY.

     Peter drops the penlight.  It gets stuck in a jutting piece
     of concrete.

     PETER

                          PETER
                Shit.

     Peter tries to get his hand in

     DEEPER

     But he cannot reach the light. It is literally inches from
     his fingers...

     SUSAN

                          SUSAN
                Let me try.  My hands are smaller.

     She kneels and goes for it.

     INT. HOLE - SUSAN'S HAND

     Her hand reaches for the penlight.

     She barely touches it.  The penlight spins around.  Its light
     now illuminates...

     THE FACE OF A MAN.  Unseen by Susan.  Terrifying in its doll-
     like simplicity.  In the darkness, its features seem
     indiscernable, inert, almost frozen in a perfectly
     symmetrical pattern.

     It regards the spiderlike movement of Susan's fingers.

     SUSAN'S

     face squinches with the effort.

                          PETER
                Honey, just leave it.

                          SUSAN
                No, there's...

     INT. HOLE - SUSAN'S HAND

     As Susan's hand moves closer, the strange Face begins to
     TREMBLE.

     A CLICKING SOUND.

     Susan's hand is almost there.

     SUSAN

     reaches further.

     And suddenly A BEAM OF LIGHT cuts through the darkness.

     Their vision resolves. The figures of two MTA COPS stand
     before them:  ERNEST, 50, burly and bull-necked; and LEONARD
     -- African American, 45, more formidable than fat.

                          LEONARD
                     (Wearily)
                Now don't tell me.

     INT. HOLE

     Susan's hand withdraws.

                          LEONARD (OS)
                You lost a token, right?

                                                            CUT TO:

     INT. SUBWAY PLATFORM - LATER

     SHH-SHH-SHH.  A felt rag is expertly being pulled across a
     set of pristine black shoes.

     REVEAL Leonard sitting like a king in a chair, getting his
     shoes shined by Manny.  He leans back laconically while
     arguing with Peter. Ernest examines the ootheca picture.

                          PETER
                Look, I showed you my badge...

                          LEONARD
                Yeah, and you gonna have to show me a lot
                bigger one you wanna go down there.
                That's the old maintenance grid, Doc.
                Swiss cheese: tunnels, tracks...

                          PETER
                The Department of Public Health...

                          LEONARD
                ...should know better'n to go sneakin'
                around my turf...

                          PETER
                Fine.  You want me to call your
                supervisor?

                          LEONARD
                Please do.  He's a lonely guy.

     Uninterested, Leonard looks over to Susan and Chuy.

     ANGLE ON SUSAN

     She leans against the wall, inspects her dirty hand. Ernest
     gives her his handkerchief.

                          CHUY (OS)
                Gucci.  Flat pump.

     She looks down at Chuy, who sits nearby, holding a PAIR OF
     SPOONS.

                          ERNEST
                Your shoes.

     She stares down at her shoes.  Gucci flat pumps, all right.
     Susan smiles.

     Just then, a SUBWAY TRAIN pulls up.  The doors open,
     disgorging passengers. Chuy flips into action.  He starts
     playing his spoons, CLICKING them together, slapping them
     against his knee.

     Susan watches in wonder as the boy begins to use the spoons
     to IMITATE the different rhythmical step patterns of the
     VARIOUS COMMUTERS: The rolling, comical gait of A FAT MAN,
     the lithe haughty step of A PRIM LADY.

                          SUSAN
                     (Laughs.  To Chuy.)
                That's wonderful!  What grade are you in?

     Chuy doesn't answer.

                          ERNEST
                No school. Shoes're all Chuy knows about.

     Ernest discreetly points to his forehead.

                          MANNY
                     (immediately)
                He's special.

                          LEONARD
                He can imitate anything, you just watch
                him.

                          PETER
                     (Irritably, to Leonard)
                Excuse me, I'm talking to you.

                          LEONARD
                No, you talkin' at me.

     Leonard hands Manny a $5.00 bill for the shine, gets up and
     walks past Peter as if he were invisible.

                          ERNEST
                     (discreetly, to Susan)
                Is there some reward for this?

                          SUSAN
                I guess that could be arranged.

     Ernest smiles, pockets the ootheca picture.

                          PETER
                For Chrissakes.  You gonna lay a two-
                bit bureaucratic, territorial number
                on me?

                          LEONARD
                You wanna keep up the conversation, you
                best come back with the proper permits
                and the right attitude.

     Leonard saunters away with Ernest in tow.

     Peter shakes his head angrily.  He takes Susan by the arm,
     heads off in another direction.

     Chuy, without watching, clicks his spoons to the imitation of
     their steps.

     INT. SUBWAY STAIRS - DAY

     Susan and Peter walk up the stairs; Peter still fumes.

                          PETER
                You give someone a fucking uniform
                and... Did you hear how he talked to us?

                          SUSAN
                I heard how you talked to him.

                          PETER
                Oh, so I'm the bad guy now?

     Susan spares him an ironic look.

                          SUSAN
                He was just doing his job.

                          PETER
                Fine, then I'm the bad guy. Jesus!

     At the top of the stairs they're completely engulfed by
     sunlight.

                          PETER
                He wants a permit, I'll get him a
                permit.

                                                            CUT TO:

     INT. SUBWAY TRACKS - DUSK

     A train blurs by.

     A FLASHLIGHT BEAM over dirty gravel.  TILT with the beam to
     see Ernest walking his beat past TRACKS and GIRDERS.  Hulking
     out-of-service SUBWAY CARS surround him. He shines his light
     on the ootheca picture and then around him at the walls.

     A SOUND catches his attention.  A RUSTLING.

     He notices something off to a corner, walks over to it.

     A SHINY BROWN LUMP in the corner, covered in garbage.

     He touches the lump with his shoe.  It STIRS slightly.

     He touches it again...

     ...and a PAIR OF LEGS suddenly LASH OUT, kicking at him
     reflexively.

     Ernest jumps back.

     Another SET OF LEGS emerges...

     Oddly enough, Ernest relaxes.

                          ERNEST
                Chrissakes...

     He grabs the surface of the lump, and pulls it.  We see that
     it was just a SHINY BROWN TARP.

     Underneath, a group of THREE HOMELESS PEOPLE -- emaciated,
     toothless -- sleeping intertwined for warmth. In the dim
     light, they almost seem like a single organism.

                          ERNEST
                Guys, c'mon.

     The Homeless People stare back at him mutely.  Ernest starts
     getting annoyed.

                          ERNEST
                I told you to stick by the maintenance
                area.

                          BAG LADY
                Nah... It's private property now.

     Ernest looks at her, confused.

                          SKELETAL BUM
                He eats down there.

                          ERNEST
                Who?

                          HOMELESS MAN
                The Stickman.

                          BAG LADY
                Long John.

     The homeless man points.  Ernest turns his light.

     Another SILHOUETTE of the OVERCOAT MAN drawn on the wall. An
     arrow below it points east.

                          ERNEST
                Graffiti artist, uh?
                     (To Homeless People)
                Look guys, just get off my beat, you
                hear?  Get moving.

     Ernest hustles them out.  The homeless people glare at him,
     pick up their things and head into the gloom.

     Ernest watches them go.  He turns back to the graffiti
     painting of The Stickman.

                                                       DISSOLVE TO:

     INT. SUBWAY TUNNEL - LATER

     Ernest walks deeper into the tunnels. Dusklight slants in
     weakly from grates above.

     He stops as a RUMBLE is heard ahead of him  He ducks into a
     recess in the wall.  The RUMBLE grows LOUDER, LOUDER.

     A SUBWAY TRAIN curves around the bend up ahead, its
     HEADLIGHTS raking the opposite wall to reveal...

     A FIGURE crouched over something.

     We hear CHOMPING and SWALLOWING sounds.

     CU ERNEST

     Squinting to see over his flashlight beam.

                          ERNEST
                Hey, buddy!

     No answer.  Just the wet sounds of food getting chewed and
     ingested.  Ernest is revolted.

                          ERNEST
                Get off my track...

     The crouching figure lifts its head and looks around in a
     unusually quick BLUR OF MOTION.  It's the OVERCOAT MAN.

     Another distant RUMBLE. Ernest's clothes flutter in the puff
     of hot wind that signals an approaching train.

     Ernest pulls a CAN OF MACE from his belt, begins to advance.

     The Overcoat Man stands up.

     Ernest stops in his tracks.

     For he sees that the Overcoat Man is holding a large OBJECT
     in his arms. Something wet and shiny with blood.

     A dead dog.

     The Overcoat Man drops the animal.  It rolls slowly down his
     chest...

     ...and is briefly caught BY ANOTHER SET OF ARMS EXTENDING
     FROM HIS TORSO.

                          ERNEST
                Sweet Jesus...

     The Overcoat Man lets the animal fall to the ground.  He
     begins walking toward Ernest.

     Ernest backs away.

     The Overcoat Man LEAPS on him just as the SUBWAY TRAIN ROARS
     PAST!

     CRACK! Ernest's body is twisted and crunched by powerful
     arms.

     Through the strobing windows we see Ernest enveloped by the
     dark figure, then raised above, taken away.

     TRACK

     The can of mace rolls next to the track as the TRAIN CLEARS.

     The track is empty again.

                                                            CUT TO:

     INT. EXHIBITION HALL - BANNER

     We PAN across the banner:  'ARCHITECTS OF NATURE'.

     INT. EXHIBITION FLOOR

     EXHIBITS under glass set up throughout the room: Insect
     chambers and vaults of great complexity, etc.

     An opening night CROWD of affluent MUSEUM PATRONS.  All
     tuxedoes and painted smiles.  Some peremptorily peruse the
     displays; most just camp out at the buffet table.

     Peter enters, dressed in his worksuit.  He scans the
     room, sees Siri leaning against a wall by the buffet
     table, drinking an orange juice.  He goes over to her.

                          PETER
                Heya.
                     (Kisses her on the cheek.)
                Where's the boss?

     Siri gestures to the far end of the room.  Susan stands
     alone, sipping a chardonnay by an ANT MOUND exhibit.

                          SIRI
                Ant mound.

     Peter notices Siri seems unusually weary. She covers one
     of her eyes.

                          PETER
                You okay?

                          SIRI
                It's just a headache.  We were
                sandblasting Trump Tower here since
                four this morning.

                          PETER
                Maybe you should sit...

                          SIRI
                I'm fine. Go talk to Susan.  She could
                use a good word right now.

     She nods for him to go ahead.  Peter leaves.

     Siri closes her eyes.  She rubs the bandage around the
     insect bite on her hand.

     PETER

     approaches Susan.  She's staring through thr glass panes
     of the exhibit at the crowd of patrons.  In the
     refraction, their black tuxedoes and evening gowns seem
     to blend into one another.

                          PETER
                Great crowd.

                          SUSAN
                No such thing, baby.

     She looks over at the crowd congregated around the
     buffet table.

                          SUSAN
                I get the feeling they came more for
                the potroast than the apterids.

                          PETER
                Fuck 'em.  They don't know what
                they're missing.

                          SUSAN
                     (Distantly)
                Right.

     Peter looks at her.

                          PETER
                What's wrong?

     Susan sighs.

                          SUSAN
                Oh...nothing that a little
                menopausal's pee daikiri couldn't
                cure. Least that's what I thought.

     Peter looks at her, notices that one of her hands is on
     her stomach.

                          PETER
                     (genuinely moved)
                Oh, no, you were-

                          SUSAN
                I was just late.

     Susan nods.  Peter takes her hand. They sit by the ant
     mound.

                          SUSAN
                Ironic, don't you think?  These guys
                can hatch hundreds of offspring in a
                single clutch of eggs, right? And
                here we are...

                          PETER
                Susan, we're not b-

                          SIRI (OS)
                Susan?

     Susan looks up to see Siri standing on the other side of
     the glass case.

                          SIRI
                     (Weakly.)
                I'm sorry.  I think...I need...

     One of her eyes is completely bloodshot. Her mouth is
     bleeding. She puts her hand on the case to steady
     herself.

     Her fingers leave a STREAK OF BLOOD on the glass.

                          SUSAN
                Siri...

     Siri collapses.  The exhibit tips over.

     Peter pulls Susan out of the way just as the exhibit
     FALLS AND SMASHES TO THE GROUND!

                          SUSAN
                Siri!

     The room erupts into COMMOTION.

     Susan and Peter run to Siri, who lies unconscious on the
     floor.

     Peter gently turns her over.

     Siri's BLEEDING from the corner of her mouth.  Just like
     the Chinese workers in the sweatshop.

     Tuxedoed people encircle her next to the insect mounds.

                                                  SMASH CUT TO:

     EXT. NEW YORK STREET - NIGHT

     An ambulance races down the avenue toward a distant
     hospital.

     INT. HOSPITAL - HALLWAY

     Siri is rushed on a gurney toward the Emergency Room.

     Peter and Susan walk next to it talking to DR. CHRIS
     RAYMOND, a 35-year old ER physician.

                          PETER
                ...I think it's some kind of systemic
                infection, Chris.  I saw a few cases
                like it yesterday. A sweatshop in
                Canal.

                          RAYMOND
                     (to Peter.)
                Okay, look.  You better come in with
                me.  Help me through.

     INT. EMERGENCY ROOM

     Raymond, Peter, and several other ER STAFF work on Siri,
     now lying on an operating table.

                          RAYMOND
                     (To Peter)
                All hands on deck, Pete. Remember the
                dril?

                          PETER
                It'll come back to me.

     RAYMOND inspects Siri's wounded hand.  The bandage has
     been removed.  The bite-wound is infected and
     suppurating.  A large red circular RASH around it.

                          PETER
                Looks like a Lyme disease rash.

                          RAYMOND
                It's not consistent with the internal
                bleeding. Any idea what bit her?

     Peter shakes his head.

                          RAYMOND
                I think we're gonna need to have that
                specimen here.

     An ASSISTANT finishes inserting a catheter down her
     throat.

     Blood and fluid leak up through the clear tube.

     ABOVE THE OPERATING THEATER.

     Staring down through the circular glass deck, Susan
     silently observes the procedures.

     INT. MANNY'S APARTMENT - NIGHT

     Salmon-colored LIGHT slants in from sodium vapor streetlight.
     PAN through the shadowy room, past Manny's sleeping form to
     Chuy, asleep under a tent made of an old Star Wars blanket.

     A RHYTHMICAL CLICKING SOUND is heard from outside.

     Chuy pops his head out from under the blanket, listening.

     EXT. FIRE ESCAPE - NIGHT

     Wearing only his pajama bottoms, Chuy steps out on the fire
     escape with his spoons in hand.

     The CLICKING RESUMES from the building across the street.

     OVERHEAD VIEW

     The barefoot little boy crosses the street, steps through the
     center of the huge PAINT STAIN on the sidewalk.

     The CLICKING sound comes again.

     STREET LEVEL

     The CLICKING comes again from inside the flophouse.  It
     continues a little bit, then stops.

     Chuy CLICKS his spoons together, mimicking the sound.

     Beat.  A CLICKING from within again; almost an answer.

     Chuy ducks under the yellow DOH tape, walks toward the front
     of the building.

     He comes to the boarded entrance.  There is a hole, narrow,
     and low in the doorway.

     Chuy squats, begins to wriggle through it.

     INT. FLOPHOUSE - LOBBY

     Chuy steps into the lobby.

     The CLICKING comes again, from further inside.

     Chuy moves to find it.

     CHAPEL

     Bits of STREETLIGHT slant in.  Chuy walks slowly, listening.

     He steps into the SHADOW of a LOOMING FIGURE.  He turns...

     CHUY'S POV - CRUCIFIX

     We start on bleeding, nail-pierced feet, then TILT up the
     twisted body to the face of Jesus, looking down.

     CHUY

     stares without emotion at the plaster figure.

     MOVEMENT to his side.  He turns again.

     A dimly-lit FIGURE stands before him.

     Shapes fold and regroup in the darkness, resolving into the
     tall figure of the OVERCOAT MAN.

     The Man begins to emit the CLICKING NOISE from under his
     chin, his whole head VIBRATING.

     Chuy smiles.  He has a beautiful smile.

                          CHUY
                Mr. Funny Shoes.

     He plays his spoons, imitating the sound the figure made.

     He is answered...but this time, it's from the other side of
     the room. We PAN as he turns.

     ANOTHER OVERCOAT MAN appears in the shadows.

     Chuy GIGGLES, delighted.

                ...you don't even know what you're
                looking for.

                          PETER
                You said that thing was big as your
                hand.  I don't think I'm going to
                miss...

                          SUSAN
                Why take the chance?  Just let me go
                down there with you...

                          PETER
                No.

     Susan glares at him.  Peter sits down by her.

                          PETER
                Susan, listen to me:  you handled
                that insect almost as much as Siri...

                          SUSAN
                It didn't bite me.

                          PETER
                I know.  But if it was carrying
                something...there's a chance you
                could have been exposed.

     Susan is silent.

                          PETER
                Chris is going to run some blood
                tests on you.  I want you to stay here
                till he's absolutely sure you're
                clean.  Okay? Then you'll call me...
                You'll catch up with us...

     Susan looks up at him. Finally, she nods.

                          PETER
                We'll be all right, Sus.  I promise.

     He leans over, kisses her gently.  But Susan seems
     hardly reassured.

     INT. MANNY'S APARTMENT - PREDAWN

     The blue hours before dawn. Laconic movement outside.  New
     York dragging itself out of bed.

     We FIND Manny fixing some melted cheese sandwiches on a hot
     plate. He addresses Chuy's tented bed behind him.

                          MANNY
                My father saw me stay in bed, he'd go get
                a pitcher. Cold water, whoosh, I tell you
                that's some alarm clock, brrrrr!

     Manny cuts the bread in four equal sections and arranges them
     in a star-shaped pattern. A breakfast ritual of some kind.

                          MANNY
                Ah! There you go! The way you like 'em,
                Chu-chu...
                     (He pours a glass of milk.)
                We're low on milk, you remind Grampa to
                pick some up tonight, okay?

     He walks over to Chuy's tent bed. He pulls the sheets aside.

     His grandson is gone.

     EXT. SEWAGE FILTRATION PLANT - PREDAWN

     Sewage water BUBBLES in huge tanks.

     A WORKMAN walks down catwalks above the tank, disengaging the
     larger pieces of debris from the filter areas with grappling
     hooks.  Shoes, tires, rags...

     A GRINDING SOUND is heard.  The Workman YELLS out to a
     CONTROL BOOTH above.

                          WORKMAN
                Hold up!  We gotta block on filter D.

     SOUND of the pump coming to a halt.

     The Workman walks to the filter area.  He sinks his grappling
     hook into the polluted waters.

     UNDERWATER SHOT

     Spooky, silent. The grappling hook moves like a scythe to the
     filter...

     ...past long, soft filaments of RAGGED TISSUE...

     ...and connects with a LARGER FORM.

     ABOVE WATER

     The Workman feels the grappling hook connecting.  He gives a
     YANK, hooking whatever it is.

     He begins pulling it up.

     A PALE FORM bubbles to the surface.

     The Workman's face goes pale.

                          WORKMAN
                Oh, God...

     A grating VOICE from the control booth is heard over the P.A.

                          CONTROL BOOTH
                          VOICE
                What's the problem?

     It take the Workman a moment to speak.

                          WORKMAN
                I think it's a baby!

     The Workman pulls the form (as if that will do any good)
     toward the edge of the tank.

     He bends down, and now gets his first good look at it.

     The Workman SCREAMS.

     His grappling hook falls from his hand, into the sewage.

     INT. HOSPITAL - ICU WARD

     Susan watches Siri from behind a pane of glass.  Siri is
     connected to a respirator, her vital signs monitored by
     several machines.

     Raymond approaches Susan, two cups of coffee in his
     hands.

                          RAYMOND
                How you feeling?

                          SUSAN
                You tell me.

     He smiles, gives her one of the cups.

                          RAYMOND
                Your blood tests were all negative.
                You checked out.

     Susan visibly relaxes.  She looks back at the ICU ward.

                          SUSAN
                What about Siri?

                          RAYMOND
                She's stable.  I don't think there's
                any immediate danger, but we'll have
                to keep her under observation...

                          SUSAN
                You think it's some form of
                Strickler's, don't you?

     Beat.  Raymond shrugs.

                          RAYMOND
                Pathology's still working on the
                tissue samples.  If it is...it must
                be an errant strain.  Shorter
                incubation period.
                     (Beat.)
                I'm sorry, Sue.  We just don't know
                yet.

     INT. HOSPITAL - BATHROOM

     At the sink, Susan runs water over her hands, her face,
     trying to collect herself.  She looks up in the mirror.
     We see that her eyes are swollen, tear-stained.

     INT. HOSPITAL - HALLWAY

     She walks out of the ladies room, drying her face with a
     paper towel.

     SOUNDS of a nearby argument catch her attention.

                          JEREMY (OS)
                ...how many times I gotta tell you,
                man: we can't accept this!

                          EMT (OS)
                Well, what the hell else am I suppose
                to do with it?

     Susan heads in the direction of the voices.

     INT. HOSPITAL - HALLWAY NEAR MORGUE

     An ORDERLY (JEREMY) argues with an EMT.  Their point of
     contention:  a small FORM lying on a stretcher.

                          JEREMY
                Take it out back and throw it in the
                friggin' dumpster!

                          EMT
                Not unless somebody signs for it.

     Susan walks toward them, catches sight of the tiny form.

     Her eyes go wide.

                          SUSAN
                Oh, my God.

     Jeremy notices her.

                          JEREMY
                Hey, you can't...

                          SUSAN
                What's your name?

                NOW!!

     Jeremy hesitates.  But if her tone wasn't enough, the
     stare she gives him certainly is.

                          JEREMY
                Okay.

     Jeremy backs away, takes off down the hall.

     Susan approaches the stretcher.

                Washed up at the filtration plant on
                Bank street. Some asshole there
                thought it was a baby. They called
                us.

     Susan bends over it.  She covers her mouth and nose at
     the stench.

                          EMT
                It's a lobster, right?

     But it's not.  What lies on the stretcher before them
     looks more like a demon from a Brueghel painting.

     A THREE FOOT INSECT.  It's mephitic, pink-white body is
     rotten, falling apart.  The head's intact, with strange,
     large jaws thrown wide open. The chitin on one is half
     gone.

     Peter braces his legs and tries to push the whole bank of
     lockers clear--the locker section tips and falls with an
     ENORMOUS BANG, which echoes loudly off the tile walls. Dust
     flies everywhere.

     When the dust settles and flashlights are focussed on the

     out a few new ridges and valleys. Raymond snaps a couple of
     Polaroids.

                          SUSAN
                I'm on my way. I've got something for you
                to look at...

     Susan notices something weird and undefinable about the
     contours of the claws... But she can't put her finger on
     it.

     BACK AT THE TUNNEL

                          PETER
                We'll be back at the platform in...

                          LEONARD
                20 minutes. If you don't go sight-seeing
                anymore.

                          PETER
                     (To phone.)
                20 minutes.
                     (Beat.)
                Susan?

     The call is lost. Peter tries to change frequencies, but it's
     useless.

     Peter replaces the phone in his pocket.  He walks off.

                          LEONARD
                Funny.  Shoulda seen some track
                bunnies by now.

                          JOSH
                What?

                          LEONARD
                Track bunnies.  Rats.  They're
                usually around.

     No one notices the OVERCOAT MAN carving on the wall.

     INT. MANNY'S APARTMENT - NIGHT

     On Manny's dining room table, a heap of unpolished shoes has
     accumulated. The radio is playing a sad, elegiac Tango.

                          MANNY
                No, no, please understand... I can't
                wait that long.

     Looking disheveled and tired, Manny clutches the phone,
     listening intently.

                          MANNY
                Please. I write it down.
                     (he writes)
                2... 8... 7... 3. What does this mean
                "case number"? Okay. So, now what?  When
                can you...?

     He holds a color snapshot of Chuy sitting on a mailbox.

                          MANNY
                No, I can't wait...no, listen...

     Click. Manny slowly hangs up. He stares at his notepad, at
     the number 2873.

                          MANNY
                Hijos de puta.

     He crumples it up, throws it away, crosses to the window,
     picks up Chuy's last wire figure-

     FIGURE, CLOSER

     Another human-looking figure, long and thin, but with
     something slightly off about it.

     It has six limbs instead of four!

     MANNY

     frowns, looks down at the dark flophouse across the street.

                          MANNY
                Mr. Funny Shoes.

     Distant thunder is heard.

     BATHROOM CABINET

     Manny takes a STRAIGHT RAZOR from the bathroom cabinet, opens
     the blade.

     EXT. SUBWAY STATION - DAY

     Susan arrives at the stairs leading down to the subway
     station. A COUPLE passes her on their way up.

     A sign over the entrance says "STATION WILL CLOSE FOR REPAIRS
     AT 3 PM - TOKENS ONLY". Susan looks around- the area is semi-
     deserted, a bit creepy.

     She takes a deep breath, descends.

     INT. SUBWAY - DAY

     Susan pushes through the turnstile, enters the long corridors
     of gleaming tile, a somewhat de-humanizing atmosphere,
     straight out of a George Tooker painting.

     Very creepy.  Susan's footsteps ECHO in the empty tunnel.
     She sneaks a nervous glance over her shoulder- nobody is
     following her-

     PLATFORM "A" DELANCEY

     Susan observes the locker room door impatiently. A small crew
     of REPAIRMEN are dismantling a row of fluorescent lights.

     She sits and waits.

                                                            CUT TO:

     INT. DEEP IN TUNNEL

     Peter, Josh and Leonard walk through a darker area. The
     floor beneath them suddenly changes, becomes tile.

                          JOSH
                     (Sniffing)
                Smells like acid.

     Peter stops, looks around.

                          PETER
                Ammonia.

     Josh walks to the right, where the smell seems to emanate
     from.  At last they come to

     INT. VAULTED AREA - CONTINUOUS

     Josh LIGHTS a flare, sets it on the ground, walks ahead.  The
     ominous RUMBLE of a subway is heard in the distance.

     A cracked WATER MAIN above.  Water dribbles to the ground.

                          JOSH
                Peter...

                          PETER
                Yeah...?

                          JOSH
                There's some weird shit here.

                          PETER
                Weird shit...?

                          JOSH
                Take a look.

     Leonard shines his flashlight ahead.

     Revealed, quite literally, is a world of shit.

     LARGE FECES scattered everywhere:  on the floor, hanging
     sausage-like from the ceiling.  One can almost taste the
     stench of old ammonia.

     Peter puts on a rubber glove, inspects one of the fecal
     stalactites.

                          JOSH
                Fecal matter, unknown origin: weird
                shit.
                     (Beat)
                Whatever it is, it's not human.

     Josh breaks off a sample, drops it in a jar with a hard
     THUNK.  Leonard turns away in distaste.

                          LEONARD
                And it needs some metamucil.

     EXT. FLOPHOUSE - NIGHT

     It's raining like hell. Manny approaches the abandoned
     flophouse.

     He peeks through the boarded-up front entrance. Right there,
     on the dusty lobby floor, clearer than the larger
     shoeprints...

     ...he discovers a trail of tiny, barefoot prints.

                          MANNY
                Chuy...

     He kicks experimentally at the planks, but they're far too
     strong.

     ALLEY

     Manny explores the opposite face of the building, looking for
     a way in.

     A DOG is BARKING incessantly. Manny turns.

     Something moves in the shadows!  Something long and thin,
     haloed  by the rain.

     It moves again, the streetlight touching it for a fleeting
     moment as it totters around to the rear of the building.
     It's The Overcoat Man!

     The man hurries past. Manny sprints after him.

     ALLEYS

     Manny comes running around a pile of grocery crates.

     There is the OVERCOAT MAN.

     CARGO WORKERS mill around a group of vegetable trucks,
     unloading produce.

     The OVERCOAT MAN attracts no attention. Keeping his head
     down, staying near the shadowed buildings. Jumping and
     hopping, he skitters into an alley.

     FOLLOWING

     Manny has to trot to keep up with the mysterious figure. He
     pauses to take a pill and place it under his tongue.
     Once it takes effect he moves on.

     The OVERCOAT MAN has moved past a chainlink fence. How??
     It's too high!!!

     The old man squeezes through a jagged opening. The metal
     fabric cuts his shirt.

     On the other side: a dead end. Nowhere to go except
     for...

     A SEWAGE GRATE

     Manny lifts it.

     SEWAGE PIPE

     Manny lands on his feet with considerable difficulty. He
     flicks his lighter flame and opens the straight razor.

     This pipe is carpeted with trash and a thick crust of dirt.
     Something moves under a wet newspaper: a thick mass of long-
     legged spiders dissolve onto the walls and floor.

     Suddenly...the distant sound of spoons playing.

                          MANNY
                Chuy...

     Manny pulls a rosary from his pocket, wraps it around
     his wrist and crosses himself with the razor...

     ...then begins to move down the pipe.

     Susan examines the Polaroids.  She pulls out a payday bar.

     The crew of repairmen are leaving.

                          REPAIRMAN
                Hey, Lady, all power will be down in
                five minutes, okay?

                          SUSAN
                Okay....

     She munches on the bar. She stops: one snapshot has caught
     her attention.  The fridge light illuminated this photograph.

     Susan turns it around... and around... Trying to find
     something different in the lines.

     A train roars by.

     Then she notices it:

     THE POLAROID

     The closed jaws. They look like A HUMAN FACE.

     SUSAN

     Gets up nervously and heads for the dor to the locker room.

     A whole row of lamps goes off. The rest flickers in and
     out.

     Then we see, now standing on her platform: THE OVERCOAT MAN!!
     He looks at her between a row of columns under the dead neon
     lights.

     Susan tries the locker room door. It's unlocked.

     INT. LOCKER ROOM - SUSAN

     carefully crosses the floor to the bank of lockers.

     She kneels to examine the hole in the wall.  She nears a
     noise.

     THE OVERCOAT MAN is moving toward her.

                          SUSAN
                Peter?

     OVERCOAT MAN

     The man's face TIPS BACK...

     ...raising the complex, glittering INSECT HEAD FROM BEHIND
     ITS MASK-LIKE FRONT JAWS.

     Its multi-parted MOUTH clicks OPEN.

     Susan SCREAMS!

     The thing charges, its "coat" opening to reveal...SIX
     LEATHERY WINGS, fully extended! The wingspan blocks the
     whole tunnel, they vibrate rapidly.

     Susan tries to run, but the creature -- hereafter known
     simply as "The Mimic" -- LEAPS ONTO HER CHEST!

     She's dragged screaming into the hole.

     Their silhouettes recede rapidly amidst a confusion of legs,
     wings and pipes.

     INT. VAULTED AREA

     Peter and Josh put the fecal samples into the back-pack.

     Leonard stands at the other end of the area. He inspects some
     OLD SCAFFOLDING set up at an opening which leads to

     THE REMAINS OF AN OLD STATION

     fifteen feet below.

                          LEONARD
                I've never been this deep. This area
                here is the Old Armory station. They
                built it in the 40's. Ran out of money
                half-way through...

     It's like Grand Central's dead little brother. Tiled mosaic
     walls, columns, monumental arches. Spaces for shops. A group
     of abandoned turn-of-the-century subway cars on parallel
     tracks.

                          LEONARD
                Okay, the fat lady's singing. Time to go.

     Everything is gray with dust.

                          PETER (O.S.)
                     (To Josh)
                I want a team in here by six tonight,
                hands and knees with toothpicks...

     Leonard squints down at the planks of the scaffolding.

     A NYMPH -- big as the one seen earlier -- emerges from a pile
     of nearby feces as if it were part of the mound.

     Keeping his eyes fixed on the insect, Leonard coolly bends
     down, picks up a ROCK.

     PETER

     putting the last sample boxes into the back-pack, looks up
     and sees

     LEONARD

     step onto the scaffolding, raising the rock to crush the
     nymph.

                          PETER
                Don't!!

     SMASH! Leonard tosses the rock at the insect, crushing it.

     Peter rushes to the insect's corpse on the scaffolding.

                          LEONARD
                Did you see the size of that thing?!

                          PETER
                Look what you did! You stupid sonofa-

     A CREAK from the scaffolding at their combined weight.

     Leonard grabs Peter, tries to pull him from the scaffolding.

     CREEEEAAAAAK!

     THE ENTIRE SCAFFOLDING GIVES WAY!

     Buckling diagonally...

     ...taking Peter and Leonard with it...

     CRASH!  Both Peter and Leonard are thrown to the ground of
     the station below.  The scaffolding falls around them.

     JOSH

     rushes forward.

                          JOSH
                Peter!

     PETER AND LEONARD

     stir in the wreckage.  Peter rises shakily.  He puts his
     glasses on. One of the lenses is badly smashed.

                          PETER
                It's okay.  I'm all right.

     He tries to help Leonard up; Leonard knocks his hand away.

                          LEONARD
                Get the hell away from me!

     Peter looks up at Josh.

                          PETER
                     (Deadpan)
                He's all right, too.

     Leonard brushes himself off, checks out his walkie-talkie.
     It's been broken in the fall, a tangle of plastic and wires.
     He curses under his breath.

     Peter checks the wall for a handhold.  But there's only
     smooth tile and dust.

                          LEONARD
                Oh, that's gonna work.

                          PETER
                You got a better way up?

     Leonard removes his badge, tosses it up to Josh.

                          LEONARD
                     (To Josh.)
                Show that to the station manager.  Tell
                him Leonard's gonna have his bubble-butt
                he don't have someone down here in ten.

                          JOSH
                H-how do I get...?

                          LEONARD
                Way we came.  Take the first tunnel to
                your right...

     Leonard's voice echoes off the cavernous walls. Josh
     hurriedly writes it down in his notebook.

                          LEONARD (OS)
                Go left.  Go left again till you hit the
                fork... Then right again. You got that?

                          JOSH
                I think so. One right, two lefts...

                          LEONARD
                And a right.

                          JOSH
                Right.

                          PETER
                Go Josh. Now.

     Josh obeys.

     INT. NICHE

     We hear a persistent BEEPING...

     A concrete ROOM filled with glimmering debris. Cans,
     eyeglasses, fake teeth, chrome, foil, glass shards, broken
     watches.

     Susan lies unconscious, half-sunk in a mulch of decomposing
     food, old newspapers, plastic garbage bags.  An inch of brown
     WATER burbles past her bloody head.

     SOMETHING jostles her, rocking her back and forth.

     Her eyelids slowly open.

     A HUGE MIMIC IS PERCHED ON HER BODY!

     Its WINGCASE is drooped around her like a shroud. The
     creature furiously tears at her jacket, trying to get at
     Susan's beeper.

     The beeper spills from her pocket along with several Pay Day
     bars.  The Mimic CRUSHES the machine instantly, then chomps
     up all the candy bars with a single move of its mandibles.

     Susan watches in terror as the creature steps away.

     A SOUND from an adjacent tunnel.  Susan looks...

     ...and sees ANOTHER MIMIC pulling the REMAINS OF A MAN into
     the darkness.

     Susan gropes around her in the soggy debris, looking for some
     weapon.

     SUSAN'S HAND

     Her fingers close around a three-foot piece of RUSTY PIPE.

     Something dark drips on her hand.

     SUSAN

     looks up. Above her, a badly decomposing HUMAN FOOT, or what
     is left of it.  All part of the excarnated corpse of the
     Chinese Preacher.  His gold cross shines boldly in the dark.

     Susan GASPS.

     THE MIMIC

     hears the sound.  It immediately SKITTERS back to her.

     SUSAN

     jerks herself sideways...

     AND STABS THE PIPE into the Mimic's thorax with a wet CRRK!

     Susan heaves herself up, pushing the thing onto its back.

     The Mimic BUZZES furiously, milky WHITE FOAM pumping from the
     wound.  Its legs slash the air as it tries to right itself.

     Susan runs for the tunnels, debris falling from her clothing.

     INT. TUNNELS

     Susan staggers through a dark PASSAGEWAY.  Water drizzles
     into her grimy face.  She looks up.

     Rain leaks from an overhead grate three stories up.  She can
     see the SHOES of PEOPLE walking to and fro above.

                          SUSAN
                HELP!!!

     EXT. STREET ABOVE - NIGHT

     Life as usual on Delancey street.

     Pedestrians crisscross the metal grate, hunched under their
     umbrellas.  Traffic noise, T.V. displays on street front
     stores, boom boxes, car horns...

     They drown out the tiny sound of Susan's voice...

     SUSAN

     hears distant FEET SCURRYING toward her, punctuated by a
     metallic CLANG!  CLANG!  CLANG!

     SIDE TUNNEL

     CLANG!  The metal pipe, still imbedded in the Mimic, BANGS
     the wall as the insect moves down the dripping narrow tunnel.

     SUSAN

     looks around frantically.  She crosses to a METAL LID on the
     floor, lifts it.

     A HOLE is below, dropping off into darkness.

     The Mimic's CLANGING grows louder.

     Susan sits herself on the edge of the hole, grasping the
     metal lid by handles on its underside.

     The Mimic rushes into the chamber, speeding toward her...

     Susan JUMPS into the hole, hanging onto the lid...

     WHANG!  The lid SLAMS SHUT over the hole a fraction of a
     second before the creature reaches it.

     The Mimic touches the lid with its antennae, confused.

     INT. HOLE

     The TICK-TICKING of the Mimic's antennae scanning the lid.

     Susan hangs from the handles on the lid, her arms trembling.

     Susan's strength gives out.  She lets go, falls.

     PIPE GALLERY

     Susan CRASHES onto a juncture between two large PIPES.

     She MOANS in pain.

     CLOSER - SUSAN

     secures her position, looks down.  A seemingly bottomless pit
     below, crisscrossed with a FOREST OF PIPES AND DUCTS.

     The nearest pipe above her is well beyond reach.

     She is trapped.

     Then she hears the SOUND of the LID OPENING above.  She holds
     her breath.

     A faint YELLOW LIGHT of a lighter flickers down at her.

                                                            CUT TO:

     WET SECTION

     Josh cautiously enters a vaulted area.  Old pipes have been
     ripped from the walls.  WATER gushes over the steel-plated
     walls.  He looks around- this doesn't seem familiar.

     Josh freezes as he sees something behind a loose metal PLATE
     on the wall.

     He yanks at the plate- it gives a little bit. He yanks
     harder- the plate falls down on one side, hanging
     precariously from a loose bolt.

     It reveals A HOLE PACKED WITH DOZENS AND DOZENS OF OOTHECAS.

     He leans close to examine them- there is a NOISE in the
     tunnel behind him-

     JOSH'S POV - WATERFALL

     A curtain of WATER falls over the side of a pipe onto the
     floor.  Behind it, something ENORMOUS crawls into view.
     Multiple legs, antennae, an elongated body distorted by the
     water and the light of a flare.  It stops-

     JOSH

     Holding his breath and tiptoeing sideways, never taking his
     eyes off the thing, Josh begins to move away.  He sees a
     narrow OPENING in the wall- there seems to be dim LIGHT
     coming from something beyond it.  He tries to squeeze through
     the opening-

     MIMIC

     The creature is immobile behind the sheet of water, as if
     mesmerized by its flow-

     PIT - JOSH

     With tremendous effort, Josh passes through the opening.

     He finds himself inside a bowl-shaped mud hole.  Scattered
     around him he sees FUNNY BUNNY PATCHES that were sewn in the
     sweatshop.  He trips on a half-buried SEWING MACHINE.  He
     looks up-

     Above him is a grate.  He's come to the SHOWER ROOM of the
     sweatshop!

     INT. SWEATSHOP SHOWER ROOM

     Empty now, except for the rusting sewing machines in a
     corner.  We TILT to see Josh moving the grate away.  He
     jumps- no way he can grab onto the slippery tile-

     HIS HANDS SLIDE!!

     PIT

     Josh puts the old sewing machine upright.

     OUTSIDE

     Suddenly, the bolt hinging the plate gives way and... the
     steel plate hits the ground: KLANGG!!

     THE MIMIC

     leaps into action!

     PIT - JOSH

     hears the CLICKING, fairly close.  He shines his light back
     down the hole he entered through-

     JOSH'S POV - THE MIMIC

     moves past the waterfall and takes the wall at full speed.

     JOSH

                          JOSH
                Oh shit, oh shit, oh shit!

     He stands on top of the sewing machine, wobbling, reaches for
     the floor above-

     SWEATSHOP SHOWER ROOM

     Josh's head and one shoulder are in through the hole.  His
     arms tremble. He makes a desperate lunge and manages to grab
     the POWER CORD of one of the abandoned sewing machines.

     THE MIMIC

     rushes through the opening without even slowing down.

     JOSH

     pulls himself up, up-  WHAM!  The Mimic hits the lower part
     of his body, BLOOD spraying up through the hole.  He SCREAMS,
     grasps the cord with both hands!

     He is brutally YANKED down into the hole, the sewing machine
     tipping, then dragged across the tiled floor till it wedges
     violently in the hole!

     We track over to reveal, one of Chuy's perfectly
     executed WIRE SCULPTURES. Sitting atop another sewing
     machine.

                                                            CUT TO:

     INT. REMAINS OF THE SUBWAY STATION

     A ring of FLARES burns in the darkness like an island.  Peter
     lights another one, revealing a space buried in layers of
     dust and time.

     Cracked MANNEQUIN FACES stares out from an unopened TAILOR
     SHOP.  A FLOWER PARLOR decorated with cobwebs.  A yellowed
     NEWSPAPER on the floor, its headlines reading:  GERMAN TROOPS
     DRIVEN BACK ACROSS RHINE.

     Peter looks up to see Leonard approaching from the track.

                          PETER
                Any luck?

                          LEONARD
                Well...there's an old service elevator
                half a mile down the tracks.  Ain't gonna
                be much use, though.  Lines are dead.

     Peter shines his flare up at a thick cord of cables which HUM
     ominously with electricity.

                          PETER
                You said those cables're still live.
                Can't we rewire...?

                          LEONARD
                Oh, man, there you go again.

                          PETER
                What?

                          LEONARD
                Those things bring juice to the new
                stations.  You just can't rewire that
                shit...

     Peter approaches him.

                          PETER
                For Chrissakes, what's the problem?
                You need a memo every time you fart?

                          LEONARD
                All right, motherfucker, that's it.

     He pushes Peter violently. Their eyes lock and meet.
     Inches away from a fistfight.

                          PETER
                Shh! Shh!

     A SOUND rushing towards them, its echoes increasing by the
     second.

     Where is it coming from?

     Peter looks at Leonard.  Leonard unbuttons his holster clip,
     places his hand on his .22

     A SHADOW appears outside the archway.

     It steps onto the platform.

     Leonard frowns.

                          LEONARD
                     (tentative)
                Manny?!

     The old man stumbles out of the darkness, out of breath. A
     rusted crowbar in his hand.

     Leonard walks over to him solicitously.

                          LEONARD
                My God, what the hell are you...?

                          MANNY
                Hurry, the woman needs help!

     A shadow crosses Peter's face.

                          PETER
                Woman?

                                                            CUT TO:

     INT. PIPE GALLERY

     OUTSTRETCHED HANDS in the darkness.

     REVEAL Peter leaning across the void with one hand while
     Manny and Leonard grip his other.

     Susan below, balancing precariously on the crisscrossing
     pipes. A mess, but still alive.  She reaches up to Peter.

     It's too far.

                          SUSAN
                     (A whisper)
                Don't.

                          PETER
                Listen to me:  we're getting you out.

     Leonard and Manny pull Peter back into

     INT. TUNNELS

     Peter undoes his belt.

                          PETER
                     (To Manny and Leonard)
                Give me your belts.

     They obey. Peter buckles them together with his. He then
     loops one end around a bannister, the other around his wrist.

                          LEONARD
                     (to Manny, as he ties them
                     together)
                What are you doing down here?

                          MANNY
                Chuy. He was taken. He's down here
                somewhere...
                     (to Peter)
                Oh, please, hurry. I saw what was
                after her.

                          PETER
                What's...?

                          MANNY
                Just hurry.

     Peter takes his word for it.  He uses the belts to lower
     himself to the nearest pipe.

     Leonard LIGHTS a flare to illuminate the pipe gallery.

     Peter works his way down. The web of pipes seem to recede
     into Hades.

     The lifeline tightens.

     Peter gets to the last solid footing, lies down on his
     stomach and lets the belts down.

                          PETER
                I'm coming, Sus, I'm coming.

     But then, he sees something move below her. Then a hollow
     CLANG! CLANG! CLANG!

                          SUSAN
                No, Jesus, no.

                          PETER
                     (To Leonard)
                Toss the flare down!

                          LEONARD
                I only got...

                          PETER
                Just do it!

     Leonard lets the flare drop from his hand.

     It falls past them, ricocheting off the maze of pipes,
     spinning down to the pitch-black below.

     And for a split second the flame illuminates...

     THE MIMIC

     pipe in its thorax, nimbly CLIMBING THE PIPES TOWARD SUSAN
     CLANG! CLANG! CLANG!

     PETER'S

     eyes grow huge.

                          PETER
                Oh, Jesus...

     LEONARD

     just plain loses it.

                          LEONARD
                What the fuck is that?! What the fuck is
                that?!

     SUSAN

     knows all too well what's coming for her.

                          SUSAN
                     (A desperate appeal)
                Peter...

     Throwing caution to the wind, Peter reaches the belt down.

                          PETER
                Wrap it around your hand!

     Susan at last gets a grip.  Peter pulls with both arms.

     CLANG! CLANG! CLANG! Getting closer.

                          PETER
                Come on!

     Susan struggles for footholds on the slippery pipes,
     ascending foot by foot...

     Peter pulls her into his arms.

     CLANG! CLANG! CLANG!

     Peter bends down.

                          PETER
                Get on my shoulders!

     Susan steps onto his shoulders.  He pushes her up...

     And Leonard and Manny yank her out.

     CLANG! CLANG! CLANG!

     Peter scrambles up, SLAMS the lid back on the hole.

                          PETER
                Let's go!

     The four of them run.

     HOLD ON the lid.

     WHAM! It bursts from the floor, rolls away like a coin.

     INT. ABANDONED PLATFORM

     The four humans run down the empty platform.  Peter spares a
     look back.

                          PETER
                Oh, shit...

     Far down the tunnel,

     THE MIMIC HAS SPREAD ITS WINGS AND IS FLYING AFTER THEM!!

                          MANNY
                There!

     He points to the open DOOR of an ancient SUBWAY CAR.

     They sprint for the car, get to the door.  Manny, Peter,
     Leonard, then Susan...

     INT. SUBWAY REPAIR CAR

     ...tumble inside a repair car crammed with shelves and empty
     crates.

                          LEONARD
                Get the goddam door!

     Leonard and Peter both grab its handle, slide it shut...

     SPLACK!  The Mimic crashes into it!

     KLANGGG!  The door bulges out from the impact, almost
     tearing itself off the hinges.

     Susan jumps back.  Manny runs to cover her.

     The creature is caught, half in, half out, antennae and
     forelegs waving wildly!

     The abdomen CRASHES through a pane of glass.

                          PETER
                Push it! Push it! Don't let up!

     Leonard and Peter push harder, barely keeping it pinned.

     THE UPPER HALF OF THE MIMIC TEARS ITSELF LOOSE.

     WHITE BLOOD SPATTERS everywhere. The Mimic is NOW CUT IN
     HALF!

     The wings flap wildly, the abdomen shatters the safety
     window's outer panels.

     But the FRONT SECTION IS STILL ALIVE.  It scrabbles in,
     spraying white blood...

     ...drags itself up on the ceiling, then down onto the floor
     and under a row of shelves in a half-circle around the car
     till it finally comes to a halt.

     Silence.  The only sound is a SKITTERING outside.

     Susan looks outside the window.

     The Mimic's REAR HALF IS STILL TRYING TO PUSH THROUGH THE
     DOOR, its feet blindly dragging along.

     LEONARD

                          LEONARD
                What the fuck was that?

     Peter says nothing. Leonard grabs him by the shirt.

                          LEONARD
                You better tell me what the hell's
                going on here!

                          MANNY
                Hey, hey!! Take it easy!!

                          PETER
                     (to Leonard)
                We don't know!! We don't know what it
                is!

     Leonard releases Peter and, cocking his gun moves closer
     to the still thing.

                          PETER
                Wait a minute-

                          LEONARD
                Fuck you, wait a minute. I'm
                going to-

     SNAP!  The Mimic POUNCES on him, catching his leg in its
     front mandibles.

     A sickening CRUNCH as the Mimic's mouth begins to work the
     leg like a grinder-blender.

                          LEONARD
                GET IT!  GET IT OFF ME!

     Peter and Manny try to pull the thing off as Leonard falls
     and writhes on the floor.

     BAM! BAM! BAM! The men flinch away as Leonard empties his
     guns on it, until the thing's shell finally CRACKS!

     But the thing is still locked onto Leonard's leg.  Peter
     tries to work it free from the creature's jaws. No good.

                          PETER
                Its muscles are locked.

                          LEONARD
                     (Hoarse)
                Oh, Jesus!!

                          MANNY
                Wait...

     Manny removes a can of shoe polish from his coat, then starts
     smearing the stuff onto the Mimic's head and jaws.

                          LEONARD
                Oh, Jesus! It's hitting the bone man, get
                it off!!

     He lights a CIGARETTE LIGHTER, goes to touch the flame to the
     flammable stuff.

                          PETER
                     (Stopping him.)
                Hey hey hey...

                          MANNY
                Is how we make loose the ticks back home.

     Peter hesitates, but lets him go.  Manny lights the polish.

     WHOOSH...the Mimic's head is engulfed in a halo of flame. THE
     LEGS LOOSEN THEIR GRIP.

     Peter and Manny yank it free from Leonard, who's PASSED OUT
     from the pain.  His leg is torn and bloody.

                                                            CUT TO:

     INT. SUBWAY REPAIR CAR - LATER

     We now see the car is 50's vintage.  A POSTER of Mickey
     Mantle above an empty worktable.

     Peter sits before Susan.  She's trembling, understandably
     shaken from her previous experience.  BLOOD pours from a CUT
     on her forehead.

     Peter takes a bit of torn cloth, puts it to the wound, then
     tenderly raises her hand to keep the bandage in place.

                          PETER
                Just keep holding it.  Can you do that
                for me?
                     (No reponse.)
                Susan?

     Susan nods silently.  Her hand weakly presses the compress.

                          MANNY (OS)
                Doctor Tyler?

     He turns to Manny, who sits solicitously next to Leonard.
     His wound is wrapped with makeshift bandages. He begins to
     stir.

     Peter gets up, but Susan's hand is closed tightly around his,
     like the jaws of the Mimic.  He kisses her gently, then
     slowly manages to release his hand.

     He walks to Leonard, inspects his wound. Touches the sole of
     his foot.

                          PETER
                You feel anything?

                          LEONARD
                Yeah, I feel like ripping your
                fucking eyes out...

                          PETER
                Leonard, listen.  I need to see if
                there's any nerve damage before we
                carry you back.
                     (No response.)
                Look, I'm trying to help you here...

                          LEONARD
                Oh, you helped me here, all right, white
                boy.  You and your goddam memo. You
                needed to prove your point, uh?

                          PETER
                I'm sorry.  But I don't think letting you
                bleed to death is the best apology.

     Peter touches his foot again. Leonard finally nods.

     Manny gazes at the Mimic carcass at the end of the car.

                          MANNY
                Where the hell'd that thing come from?

     Peter looks at Susan.  She remains silent.

                          PETER
                     (Quietly)
                A mistake.

                          LEONARD
                "Mistake"?  What's that supposed to...?

                          PETER
                It doesn't matter, all right?  It's dead.

                          LEONARD
                How you know that?  Shit, it was runnin'
                around with its buttside gone and a
                fucking pipe through its heart...

                          SUSAN
                     (Quietly)
                It doesn't have a heart.

     Peter looks up at her.

                          SUSAN
                Just inner chambers...

                          MANNY
                But it look like a man. It... I saw it.

                          SUSAN
                No...

     She gets up, finally moving.

                          SUSAN
                That's what it wanted you to see.

                                                            CUT TO:

     OUTSIDE CAR

     The subway car sits at the end of the platform, windows dimly
     glowing in the dark. The door opens, and Manny and Peter
     snatch the lower half and wing pieces back into the car.

     INSIDE CAR - A LITTLE LATER

     The lower half of the insect has been moved into the car.
     Susan is reassembling it.

                          PETER
                So, you're saying this is like those bugs
                that -- that look like twigs or leaves
                or...

                          SUSAN
                     (shakes her head)
                That's camouflage...

     Susan displays the partly-charred head.

                          SUSAN
                This is mimicry. They evolve to mimic
                their predators. A butterfly can look
                like the eyes of an owl.  A catterpillar
                can copy a snake...

     Susan closes the multiple mouth parts into a self-contained
     bud shape, then pushes back the "face" mandibles.

                          SUSAN
                This has evolved to mimic the most
                dangerous predator it's ever had...

     She holds it in her hand, like Yorick's skull. The mimic's
     head obscenely mirrors her own. She inserts it into the
     shoulder cavity.

     She stands back.

                          SUSAN
                Us.

     CAMERA cranes up and reveals that the thing now looks like
     THE OVERCOAT MAN.

                          SUSAN
                Mantids can mimic. We gave the Judas
                that code...

                          MANNY
                     (quotes)
                "...and behold he will come that walks as
                a man, yet is not a man- ..."

                          SUSAN
                This, is our baby Peter. Yours and
                mine. Aren't you proud?

     OUTSIDE OF THE CAR - IN THE TUNNELS

     We see four shadows move fast, scuttling on the walls and
     ceiling...

     ...heading towards the car...

     INSIDE THE CAR

     A SUBWAY MAP on the wall.  Red, blue, and orange lines
     branching through the boroughs like veins.

                          SUSAN
                All these...they're like tunnels of an
                insect colony. Once these things hit a
                certain population density, they'll have
                to move out, form new colonies.

     The realization hits the others.

                          SUSAN
                We have to get help down here.  Burn
                the tunnels before...

     She's interrupted by a CLICKING from the tunnel ahead.

     It's answered by CLICKING from the tunnel behind.

                          LEONARD
                Get the doors!

     A brief glimpse down the car shows too many OTHER DOORS to
     close in time.

                          PETER
                Is there a switch?

                          LEONARD
                Third rail is dead.
                     (To Manny and Susan.)
                Get me up.  There must be a manual
                override in the booth.

     Manny and Susan help Leonard up.

                          SUSAN
                     (Whispering to Peter)
                The lights!

     Peter turns off the flashlights.

     Susan and Manny help Leonard to the car's CONTROL BOOTH.

     Peter looks

     OUTSIDE

     where the silhouette of a MIMIC moves to the rear of the car.

     CONTROL BOOTH

     Leonard opens a box on the side-wall marked MANUAL OVERRIDE.

     Inside, there is a large, HEXAGONAL SHAPED HOLE.

                          LEONARD
                     (Starts looking around)
                Where's the damn crank?!

     OUTSIDE

     The Mimic is only yards away.

     OTHER SHADOWS emerge from the distant dark.

     INSIDE

     Manny leaves Leonard and Susan to look for the lever crank.

     He runs to help Peter try and shut the doors manually.

     But it's useless.  Many of the doors won't budge.

                          PETER
                     (hissing a whisper)
                They're coming!

     OUTSIDE

     The shadows get nearer, their CLICKING louder...

     CONTROL BOOTH

     Susan looks under the dashboard, finds a HEXAGONAL SHAPED
     ROD.  The lever crank.

                          SUSAN
                I got it!

     Susan gives it to Leonard. He JAMS the rod into the hexagonal
     shaped hole.  Perfect fit.

     Leonard begins CRANKING the thing.  But it's rusty and
     slow...

                          SUSAN
                Hurry! Please!

     THROUGHOUT SUBWAY CAR

     The doors begin to swing shut very slowly.

     OUTSIDE - A MIMIC'S POV

     sees the moving doors, starts heading for them.

     CONTROL BOOTH

     Leonard can't crank fast enough.  Susan joins in, putting her
     hands over Leonard's.  Both spin the thing as fast as
     possible.

     SUBWAY CAR

     Peter and Manny each pulling on a door, trying to speed up
     the closing process.

     SHADOWS are seen approaching, now very close.

     CONTROL BOOTH

     Leonard and Susan put all their effort into turning the crank
     one more time...

                          LEONARD
                Come on, you son-of-a...

     SUBWAY CAR

     A SOFT CLICK as the doors SHUT IN UNISON.

     Silence.

     All four are stock still, like a submarine crew awaiting the
     blast of depth charges.  Their eyes dart to the

     WINDOWS

     caked with soot, irradiated by the distant glow of one of the
     red flares.

     THUCK! Something BUMPS against the door.

     A machine-gun patter of FOOTSTEPS on the roof.

     The car SHAKES.

     OUTSIDE

     The dark platform is alive with phantom shapes.

     INSIDE

     SCREEECH!! Something sharp is drawn along the car roof like a
     nail over a chalkboard.

     THUMP! THUMP!  Impacts on the sides...

     An obscene symphony of sounds as Mimics lay siege to the car.

     PETER

     A BUZZ OF WINGS catches his attention.  He turns.  His face
     is reflected in a security window.

     CRACK!  The window SPLINTERS, destroying Peter's reflection.

     ABOVE MANNY

     Claws SCRATCH the ceiling. It begins to dent.

     BELOW SUSAN AND LEONARD

     Large forms CLICKING underneath, looking for a way in.

     Susan stares at the floor, her eyes following the course of
     the clicking...

     ...which leads to Leonard's wounded, bloodstained leg.

                          SUSAN
                Oh, God.
                     (Looks at Leonard.)
                The blood...

     KLANGGG!  A Mimic leg PIERCES the ceiling above them!

     Susan pulls Leonard out of the way just in time as

     IN THE SUBWAY CAR

     KLANG!  KLANG! More legs break through the ceiling!

     SUSAN AND LEONARD

     emerge from the control booth, Leonard's arm over Susan's
     shoulder.

                          SUSAN
                His blood! It's driving them crazy! We
                have to mask the odor!

                          PETER
                How?!

     But there's not time enough to discuss possible solutions.

     Leonard pulls off his jacket. Susan begins wrapping it around
     his wound to mask it. Manny helps.

     Peter has upended one shelf, jamming it against a broken
     window as a barricade.

     Despite their efforts, the Mimics are not thrown off the
     scent.

                          PETER
                It's no use! They know we're in here!

                          SUSAN
                They don't know anything Peter, they
                just sense. They're hardwired!

                          PETER
                Right. Hardwired to eat anything that's
                not like them!

     The whole car is now shaking and buckling.

                          SUSAN
                Exac...

     She looks over at the severed Mimic corpse nearby.  A
     realization...

                          SUSAN
                     (To Manny)
                Give me your razor.

     Manny looks at her blankly. Susan just takes the blade.

     The whole car is now shaking and buckling.

     She runs to the Mimic's carcass.  For a moment, she
     hesitates.  But the pandemonium leaves her little choice.

     She SLICES into the Mimic's corpse with the razor...

                          PETER
                What are you doing?

     ...sticks her arm in all the way to the elbow...

     ...and pulls out two fat AMBER SACS the size of
     softballs.  She SLICES them open.

     Orange GOO leaks out, its stench overpowering.

                          LEONARD
                     (covers his nose)
                Shit!

     Peter looks up as Susan slides one of the sacs over to
     him.

                          SUSAN
                Rub it on the windows!

                          PETER
                What-

                          SUSAN
                Just do it!!

     Holding his breath, against the stench, he smears the
     crap on the windows, the doorframe...

     MANNY

     looks to the roof, listening.

     And remarkably, the SOUNDS of the Mimics START
     SUBSIDING.

     Susan comes over to Leonard, begins dabbing the goop on
     Leonard's wound.  Leonard makes a face at the stink.

                          LEONARD
                What are you putting that crap on me
                for?

                          SUSAN
                Scent glands.  Insects use 'em to
                identify themselves to each other.

     She smears the floor area behind Leonard. The activity winds
     down gradually, and finally comes almost to a halt.

                                                            CUT TO:

     SUBWAY CAR - LATER

     Leaning against the dirtied window, Manny creates a streak
     for every Mimic he sees.

     Peter, Leonard and Susan are hard at work. Leonard has
     created a small "model" of the station using pocket debris
     and the wall map.

                          LEONARD (O.S.)
                Okay. That's us.

     Manny's lighter represents the subway car.

                          LEONARD
                This track we're on? Goes down into
                the repair area.
                     (Makes an "X" further down)
                The elevator's over here. Leads up to
                the active tunnels.

     THUMP! An oily, soft abdomen brushes lazily up against
     the glass. Manny moves away.

                          PETER
                Can we get this car there?

                          LEONARD
                Someone'd have to go to the
                switchroom, pull the coupling lever,
                that'll send us left and to the
                elevator.

                          SUSAN
                But the power...

                          LEONARD
                Hell, I might be able to juice the whole
                area, if I can get to the power box. It's
                just a couple of cables...

                          MANNY
                Oh, how you gonna get there, Leonard?
                Hop?

                          PETER
                     (To Leonard)
                Just talk me through it. I can go with
                Manny.

                          LEONARD
                It would take a minute or so.
                     (beat)
                You won't last that long out there.

                          SUSAN
                Peter, you couldn't even fix our TV!

     Tense silence. He points at the glands on the floor.

                          PETER
                We'll cover ourselves with this. They
                can mimic us-  we Goddam mimic them!

                          SUSAN
                Peter-

                          PETER
                It worked before...

                          SUSAN
                     (an edge in her voice)
                The scent won't last...

                          PETER
                That's why we should do it now.

     Susan knows they have no other choice.

     LATER

     Susan is stuffing Leonard's old bloody bandages into the
     thorax of the dead Mimic.  She ties a flare to its center.

                          LEONARD
                It's just a regular old pump switch,
                okay? Right by the track signal
                board.

     Manny is spreading the mucus-like liquid of the gland-sac on
     himself and Peter as Leonard instructs them-

                          LEONARD
                The lights come up, you pull the
                switch.

                          MANNY
                I pull.

                          LEONARD
                You don't do that, we're on the wrong
                track.
                     (turns to Peter)
                You...

     The two men look into each other's eyes.

                          LEONARD
                You gonna finally get to fuck around
                with the wires.  Think you can
                handle it?

                          PETER
                Depends.  You got a memo?

     Leonard's hard feelings give way to an almost
     imperceptible smile.

     Using a ballpoint pen, he draws a schematic on the back
     of Peter's hand.

                          LEONARD
                All right then.  You gonna find two
                wires.  One's green.  The other's
                blue...

     SUSAN

     approaches Manny, who looks distractedly out the window.

                          MANNY
                He's out there. I heard him. How can
                he be? This things...

                          SUSAN
                Manny...

                          MANNY
                I didn't protect him, lady. He
                trusted me. And I didn't protect
                him... His father...I lost his father
                to the streets and now, Chuy...

                          SUSAN
                We'll find him. We'll be back and
                find him.

     Manny doesn't respond.

     READY TO GO

     Susan dabs at Peter's face with the last touches of the
     scent gland substance.  She doesn't meet his eyes as she
     speaks.

                          SUSAN
                You're going to have to keep it
                really slow.  Their eyes react to
                sudden movements.

     Peter barely nods, his nerves clearly on edge.  He
     instinctively goes to wipe his forehead.  Susan stops
     him.

                          SUSAN
                Don't touch it.  And for Godsakes,
                try not to sweat.  They can sense
                chemical changes...

                          PETER
                Try not to sweat?

     Leonard turns to Susan and Peter.

                          LEONARD
                Okay, people...

     Leonard's voice comes through like a clarion.

                          LEONARD (OS)
                ...are we ready for this?

     Susan has her hand on Peter's chest; Peter is taking deep
     breaths, trying to cool down his body to prevent sweat.  It's
     an odd parody of Lamaze exercise.

                          LEONARD
                Whatever you do, don't step on the
                third rail coming back. Six hundred
                volts'll blow your leg right off.

     A final breath.  He's about as calm as he's going to get.

     He looks at Susan a long moment. He takes her hand.

                          PETER
                I was just thinking how I could use a
                pair of pliers... and I remembered where
                they are...

                          SUSAN
                     (overlapping)
                That's it. That's it. Breathe easy.

     A sad, nervous smile appears on Peter's face.

                          PETER
                In the tool box under the kitchen
                counter...

     Susan kisses him softly on the lips.

     Manny approaches.  Show time.

     Susan steps away from Peter. She looks toward the control
     booth.

                          SUSAN
                Open it.

     LEONARD

     begins turning the lever crank slowly.

     SUBWAY DOORS

     gradually begin to open, and stop half way.

     The darkness outside is alive with CLICKING.

     PETER AND MANNY

     slowly move between the opening of the door and make their
     way to

     INT. PLATFORM

     They step onto the dusty concrete.  Come to a stop.

     SUSAN

     watches nervously for the reaction of the Mimics

     OUTSIDE

     LARGE SHADOWS pass far and near of Peter and Manny; but none
     of the Mimics seem to care about them one way or the other.

     Peter and Manny exchange looks: a moment of relief.  It's
     working.

     Peter slowly moves right along the track to the nearby POWER
     BOX.

     Manny goes left, starts to make a longer journey across the
     platform to the SWITCH ROOM.

     SUBWAY CAR

     Susan moves away from the door, goes over the Mimic carcass,
     filled with the bloody bandages.

     PLATFORM - BY THE TRACKS

     Peter makes his way to the edge of the platform, whispering
     to himself.

     He lowers himself slowly to the track.

     PLATFORM - NEAR THE SWITCHROOM

     Manny moves toward the door.  A large WINDOW OF DUSTY GLASS
     reflects his image...and the distant ones of the Mimics.

     BY THE TRACKS

     Peter gets to the track.  He turns

     And is met FACE TO FACE WITH A MIMIC!

     Its antennae move toward his head, curious.

     Its human-mask face plate clicks apart and together.

     Peter remains stock still.  He starts breathing deeply...

     SUBWAY CAR

     Leonard has now fully opened the doors.

     SUSAN

     pulls the tipcase of the FLARE tied to the dead Mimic's
     midsection.  FSST!  The flare SPARKS alive.

     The sudden light draws the attention of several Mimics
     outside.

     Susan pushes the carcass toward an open door at the front of
     the car...

     ...and with a HEAVE, throws it onto the front track.

     OUTSIDE

     The other Mimics take instant notice.

     BY PETER

     The Mimic before him suddenly turns.  In a flash of speed,
     it's gone, heading toward

     THE DEAD MIMIC

     stuffed with the bloody rage, the thing sends its fellow
     into a feeding frenzy.

     The other Mimics begin TEARING into it, ripping their brother
     to shreds in cannibalistic orgy.

     SUBWAY CAR

     Susan watches in disgust.

                          SUSAN
                Choke on it, motherfuckers.

     Leonard turns the lever crank again.  The doors begin to
     shut.

     PETER

     breathes a sigh of relief.

     He goes to the powerbox, opens it up.

     He shines his flashlight down on the back of his hand.
     The simple chart tells him what to wire:  BLUE WIRES TO
     THE GREEN WIRES.

                          PETER
                     (to himself)
                Green...Blue...

     He looks back up at the powerbox.  His face falls.

     All the wires are a GROSS BROWN, their colored plastic
     casings having long ago faded into goo.

     INT. SWITCHROOM

     Manny enters. The space is even more dusty than the rest of
     the station. Spiderwebs strung over old machinery.  White
     Doric PILLARS support the ceiling like skeletal bones.  1940s
     style LAMPS are built into their side.

     Manny looks around.  Off to the right, right next to the
     rusted track switch board, he heads for the COUPLING SWITCH.

     Once there, he rests and, through the murky windows, he
     waves back to LEONARD.

     He pulls out his pills box and takes a pill. But his hands
     are shaking, under enormous tension. Some of the pills
     scatter on the floor. He puts the box away and leans
     against the wall.

     A CLICKING nearby catches his attention, echoing from the
     entrance of ANOTHER ROOM.

     It is not the sound of the Mimics; but rather, of METAL.

     Spoons.

                          MANNY
                Chuy...?

     Manny follows the sound.

     BY THE TRACK

     Peter desperately tries to connect the wires the right way.
     He wipes off the brown gunk, tries to discern any semblance
     of color.

     He feels himself start to sweat.  He tries to relax.
     Breathes...

     INT. ROOM BEHIND SWITCHROOM

     The space is larger than the switchroom.  The walls and
     ceiling have an odd, shiny consistency.

     Manny heads in further, locates the levers and waits.

     Something pale and small emerges from the dark, a few feet
     away, a face that seems to float in the eerie half-light.

     A RUSTLING behind him.  Manny turns around.

                          MANNY
                     (Whispering)
                Nino...

     He swings the light onto Chuy, sitting on the floor before
     the remains of a RUSTY COLUMN.  That beautiful, emotionless
     smile on his pale face.

                          MANNY
                Chuy...

     BY THE POWERBOX

     Peter has made all the necessary connections.  He turns now
     to the fuse-section.

     A red throw-switch is there, and two big slots for fuses.

     One is still occupied.

     The other one empty.

                          PETER
                Dammit!

     CU - PETER'S FOREHEAD

     BEADS OF SWEAT begin to form.

     SUBWAY CAR

     Susan watches the Mimics at their feast.

     All of a sudden, they begin to stop, as if losing interest.

                          SUSAN
                     (horrified)
                The scent's fading...

     Susan steps back, looks around desperately for a flashlight.

                          LEONARD
                     (tense as hell)
                What's Manny doing? I can't see him
                anymore.

     ROOM BEHIND SWITCHROOM

                          MANNY
                Nino, please...

     Manny slaps his knees with both hands in a parental gesture
     of "come to me".

     In the darkness, something that looks like a PALM FROND
     floats gracefully down from the ceiling, making see-saw
     gestures as it falls through the air.

     Manny shines his flashlight on the floor.  It's not a palm
     frond.

     It's a wing.

     Manny turns his flashlight to the ceiling and walls.

     The place IS COVERED WITH MIMICS.  They are in the middle of
     a vicious mating ritual.  The males tear savagely at the
     females wings as they proceed to mount them.  A chaotic
     clusterfuck.

     Manny is sickened.

     CHUY GIGGLES. Manny shines his light ahead. Manny's face
     falls.

                          MANNY
                Dios mio...

     The WHITE PILLAR BEHIND CHUY IS MOVING...

     ...unfolding...

     ...at last revealing...

     AN ALBINO MIMIC!  Another leap for evolution...

     Its form is different from the other Mimics.  Sleeker, more
     supple, almost beautiful.  And while its movements are still
     not completely human, there is a kind of unearthly grace to
     them that at the very least entrance us.

     The thing raises itself to full height, dwarfing the tiny
     boy.  It stands over him like a king over his court fool.

     Chuy giggles happily.  It's all a game to him.

     The Albino CLICKS in response -- a long, leisurely sound, as
     if trying to communicate with the boy.

     Chuy pulls his spoons out and begins to play them, making a
     perfect imitation of the sound.

     Manny starts to tremble as the creature gazes upon him with
     huge, expressionless 'eyes'.  He turns to Chuy-

                          MANNY
                     (barely audible)
                Chuy...

                          CHUY
                     (whispers)
                Friends.

                          MANNY
                NO, NO, CHUY, NO...

                          CHUY
                Friends.

     The Albino CLICKS his jaws, moving in toward Manny.

     CHUY

     plays his SPOONS in perfect imitation.

     MANNY

     stands under an archway in a swirl of dust. He raises his
     arms, like a prophet. He lets go of hsi razor and kneels.

                          MANNY
                God has closed his eyes. This, he cannot
                see...

     His vacant eyes, fill with tears, he prays quietly, a strange
     serenity invades him.

     The Albino's jaws open and charge.

     PLATFORM

     Some Mimics advance toward Peter's direction.

     SUBWAY CAR

     Susan desperately waves a flashlight and bangs the window,
     trying to attract their attention.

                          SUSAN
                Over here! Over here! Goddam you!!

     BY THE TRACKS

     Peter BREAKS the arm off one of his glasses.  He jams it at
     the empty fuse.  It SPARKS.

     PLATFORM

     THUMP!  The electricity COMES ON...

     The lamps on the columns BURST INTO FLAMES from the power
     surge.  Fire illuminates the station like a Greek temple.

     BY THE TRACKS

     Peter climbs up onto the tracks...

     ...sweat staining his forehead...

     Peter wipes it and removes the scent coating.

     THE MIMICS

     clearly react, sensing the chemical change, like bees
     reacting to honey.

     SUBWAY CAR

                          SUSAN
                     (to Leonard)
                THE DOOR! OPEN THE FUCKING DOOR!

     LEONARD

     looks at the now lit control panels, tries to decide which
     button to press. He begins to press each one in turn.

     PETER

     hears the sound of spoons playing.

     He turns to see Chuy, standing by the outside of the switch
     room.  The boy smiles. A flashlight shines behind him.

                          PETER
                Manny...

     But the thing holding the flashlight is anything but human:
     The ALBINO steps into view, moving eerily like an unstrung
     puppet. His claws and jaws are coated in blood. Chuy joyfully
     announces the arrival like a little drummer boy.

     THE MIMICS

     climb over the roof, moving toward the rear of the-

     SUBWAY CAR - CONTROL BOOTH

     Susan runs in.  SLAMS her hand down on a button.

     FSST!

     THE SUBWAY CAR

     The doors open.

                          SUSAN
                Peter!!

     Peter hesitates, takes a step toward Chuy.

                          PETER
                Come on, kid...

     Chuy seeks shelter behind the Albino's legs.

                          PETER
                     (horrified)
                Jesus!

     The albino charges toward him.

                          SUSAN
                Run!! Peter!!

     Peter bolts for the car.

     THE MIMICS

     jump and land

     SUBWAY CAR

     just as Peter squeezes through one of the doors.

     BAM! THUD! The doors dent. Glass cracks.

                          SUSAN
                     (Yelling to Leonard)
                GO!!

     Susan presses the button. The doors close again.

                          LEONARD
                The kid...

                          PETER
                The kid's with them!!

                          LEONARD
                What do you-?

                          PETER
                Go!! Just go!!

     CONTROL BOOTH

     Leonard throws the dead man's switch by the control board.

     SUBWAY CAR

     JOLTS into action.

     OUTSIDE

     The train LURCHES forward.

     Wheels spark and kick into gear. The mimics scramble and re-
     assemble quickly, ready to attack.

     THE ALBINO

     changes position and charges towards the car.

     THE MOVING CAR

     reaches a "Y" section.  The car moves to the track to the
     right.

     INSIDE SUBWAY CAR

     Leonard's eyes go wide as he sees

                          LEONARD
                He didn't do it!

                          SUSAN
                What?

                          LEONARD
                Manny never threw the coupling switch!!
                We're goin' the wrong way!!!

     OUTSIDE CAR

     It keeps bearing right. Further away from their destination.

     ...towards an old STORAGE YARD in their path.  Idle cars and
     repair equipment on the tracks.

     A crash seems inevitable.

     INSIDE THE CAR

     Leonard pulls

     THE BRAKES

     but they don't work at all.

     From below the car we see the wheels spinning freely,
     heading for collision.

     INSIDE THE CAR

     Susan grabs Leonard from the control booth. To Peter

                          SUSAN
                MOVE BACK!!!

     They rush back against the opposite door.

     STORAGE YARD - SUBWAY CAR

     CRAAASHH!!  The car BASHES into a parked section of train in
     a GRIN of tearing metal...

     ...flips off the track...

     ...and onto its side...

     The car skids to a stop.  SPARKS fill the air.

     INSIDE SUBWAY CAR

     All three are hurt.  Leonard's leg wound has reopened. Peter
     has badly damaged his right arm.

                          SUSAN
                You all right?

     Peter nods painfully.  Susan to Leonard.

                          LEONARD
                     (Simply, re: his leg)
                Can't feel it.

     Peter and Susan sling Leonard's arms over their shoulders.
     They raise him up.

     OUTSIDE SUBWAY CAR

     They move unsteadily outside.

                          SUSAN
                Which way?

                          LEONARD
                Across both tracks!!

                          PETER
                Shit.

     They head off over a concrete island in the direction of the
     correct track.

     FURTHER BACK

     The Mimics and the Albino moving closer.

     PETER AND SUSAN

     try to hurry, but it's no use given Leonard's condition.

                          LEONARD
                     (Quietly)
                Lemme go.

     Peter and Susan both disregard the order.

                          SUSAN
                We're no leaving you!

                          LEONARD
                No way we can outrun 'em together.
                Move it!

     Leonard suddenly grabs his POLICE BATON from his belt
     clip.  He pushes the two away.

                          LEONARD
                NOW!! GO!! Get the hell off my beat!

     Leonard turns away from them.

     Peter goes to get Leonard, but Susan stops him.  This MTA
     officer is staying put.

                          LEONARD
                Come on.  Come to poppa.

     Reluctantly, the two begin down the tunnel.

     LEONARD

     takes a stand by the third rail, baton in hand.

     INT. SUBWAY TUNNEL - FURTHER DOWN

     Peter and Susan run.

                          SUSAN
                There.

     An open CAGE ELEVATOR on a platform nearby.  A sign overhead:
     AUTHORIZED PERSONNEL ONLY.

     They rush toward it.

     INT. SUBWAY TUNNELS - "Y" SECTION

     Leonard stands like a guardian to the tunnel mouth.

     SOUNDS of the Mimics approaching. He glances at the third
     rail beside him, then down the track.

                          LEONARD
                Come here, you mealy-mouthed...

     The sound gets louder.

                          LEONARD
                Multi-legged...

     Leonard raises his baton in top MTA form.

                          LEONARD
                Maggot-munchin' motherfu...

     THUD!  Several Mimcs slam onto Leonard!

     Leonard goes down, HITTING them futilely with his baton.

     They begin to tear at his limbs.

     Leonard rolls...

     ...kicks his good leg out...

     ...and CONNECTS WITH THE THIRD RAIL.

     AN ARC of ELECTRICITY lights up the darkness, consuming
     Leonard and the Mimics.

     INT. BY THE CAGE ELEVATOR

     The crackling sound echoes through to Peter and Susan.

     Susan hits the elevator button again.

                          SUSAN
                I can't tell if it's working!

     Peter has unbarred the gate.

     SUSAN

     looks up, into the shaft.

     THE ELEVATOR

     coming down, but it's taking its own sweet time.

                          SUSAN
                Oh, come on, come on!

                          PETER
                Jump in.

     Peter pulls her into the shaft, closes the security gate
     behind them.

     INT. SHAFT

     A skeletal framework on each side.  Just enough for a
     handhold.

     Peter steadies Susan as she climbs in beside him.  She
     balances on the narrow ledge.

     Peter SLAMS the cage door shut, latching it.

                          PETER
                You go first. I'll be right below you.

                          SUSAN
                Your arm, you can't...

                          PETER
                I can.  We can do this...

     He shows her the first hand and foothold.  Susan grabs on.

     INT. SUBWAY TUNNEL

     The Albino amkes its way forward, flanked by two Mimics.

     It stops.

     Turns toward the elevator.

     INT. SHAFT

     Susan hauls herself up the framework, handhold by
     handhold. Peter is right below her.

     She can see his arms are starting to tremble dangerously
     with the effort.

                          SUSAN
                We're gonna make it!

     Peter grinds his teeth, trying to make the next
     handhold.

     WHAM!  Something hits the gate below them!

     INT. BY THE ELEVATOR GATE

     The Mimics are tearing at the metal gate.

     The Albino remains still, watching them work.

     PETER AND SUSAN

     Susan's arm and legs are shaking now.  Her breath starts
     catching in her throat with the effort.

                          PETER
                Don't hold your breath!  Keep it going,
                even flow!

     Susan tried, but can't.  She tries to pull herself up to the
     next level.

                          PETER
                C'mon...

                          SUSAN
                Ah...

                          PETER
                Talk to me.

                          SUSAN
                Peter...

     Susan pulls herself up.

                          SUSUAN
                I'm really glad I'm not pregnant.

     REVERSE

     We look down past them as they climb.  Two of the Mimics and
     the Albino have gotten into the shaft!

     The Albino is so long it climbs by bracing its legs against
     opposite walls.

     SUSAN AND PETER

     Susan is crying, barely any strength left.

     Peter does his best to stay in control, but in truth is
     barely hanging on himself.

     LIGHT hits them from the shaft above now, SOUNDS of PEOPLE
     TALKING and a muffled P.A. ANNOUNCEMENT filter down.

     MIMICS

     rushing upward on the shaft wall, higher, higher.

     INT. ELEVATOR SHAFT

     Peter's hands grab onto the grating of the gate on the next
     floor.

     KCHUNK! is heard above them.  Peter looks up.

     Now the elevator is coming down.

                          PETER
                Hang onto me.

     Peter pulls Susan up till she can grab it too, both of them
     able to get a foothold on the ledge-

                          PETER
                Hang on tight!

     He begins to KICK on the gate, trying to tear it free.  Susan
     looks back down.

     SUSAN'S POV - SHAFT

     The Mimics rush up, closer, closer.  The Albino opens its
     mandibles.

     SUSAN AND PETER

     both KICK at the gate, it gives, Peter pulls Susan through
     to the

     INT. SUBWAY TRACK

                          PETER
                Come on!

     Peter and Susan stumble away.

     INT. ELEVATOR SHAFT

     The Albino sees the elevator approaching from above.

     It gives a few CLICKS to its minions.

     The two other Mimics race up the shaft...

     ...toward the elevator...

     ...and WEDGE THEMSELVES IN ON EITHER SIDE!

     They are CRUSHED instantly.  But the elevator is stopped just
     above the open gate.

     With just enough room for the Albino to get through to

     INT. SUBWAY TRACKS

     Susan and Peter run.  There is LIGHT just up the tunnel.  We
     hear VOICES.

                          SUSAN
                Don't look back!

     They go for it.  At last, they make it to

     INT. A PLATFORM

     Susan and Peter stumble forward.  Light streams down from
     overheads. Susan turns.

     SUSAN'S POV

     The Albino spills out onto the track behind them.

     Sleek, streamlined, light glancing beautifully off it.

     SUSAN AND PETER

     turn back...

     HEADLIGHTS hit them as we hear the ROAR of a SUBWAY TRAIN
     heading at them from the other side of the platform!

                          SUSAN
                No...

                          PETER
                We can do it!

     They run.

     ALBINO

     runs, faster than any other Mimic.

     TRAIN

     The express train BLOWS its HORN, RUSHING FORWARD.

     PLATFORM - COMMUTERS

     Weary late-night COMMUTERS stand half-asleep on the tracks.
     A sleepy-eyed little girl points, tugging on her mother's
     hand.

                          LITTLE GIRL
                Mommy, there's people...

     PETER AND SUSAN

                          PETER
                     (Adrenaline pumping)
                We-can-do-this!!!

     MOTORMAN

     The driver sees the battered couple...

     He reaches for the brake...

     SUSAN AND PETER

     They reach the edge of the platform, the HORN deafening as
     the train speeds toward them.  Peter pushes Susan up, leaps-

     INT. TRAIN - CONDUCTOR

     We RUSH toward his horrified face.

     THE ALBINO

     directly ahead.

     The train, still flying, PLOWS INTO IT...

     ...flattening, grinding, pulverizing...

     ...until the windshield of the subway car is covered in white
     blood.

     The motoran leans on the brake, his eyes screwed shut in
     primal horror. The train SQUEALS to a stop...

     ON THE PLATFORM

     Susan and Peter collapse on the cement floor in each others
     arms.  Heaving and weeping.

     INT. GRAND CENTRAL STATION - NIGHT

     COMMUTERS turn to stare as Peter and Susan move across
     the floor.  Both bruised and bloodied, leaning against
     each other, heading for the exit.

     Some DERELICTS observe them with curiosity.

     A trio of MTA cops start towards them.

                          PETER
                It'll be fine... it... They're still
                down there. We'll seal the whole
                system, go in with whatever it
                takes...

     But Peter's voice evidences a lack of conviction now,
     he's trying to convince both Susan and himself of
     something he doesn't fully believe.

                          PETER
                It'll be fine... We nailed them
                before, we'll do it again...

     He hurries to meet the MTA cops. Susan looks up.

     SUSAN'S POV

     Commuters move to and fro, moving up and down and in and
     out of the illuminated areas of the station.

     In the crush of onlookers is one deadpan face-  a MIMIC,
     hugging the shadows, waiting for its moment!

     We PAN 180 degrees to the other side of the platform-
     there, briefly glimpsed is ANOTHER, and ANOTHER.

     We TILT down to the throng below.

                          SUSAN
                     (barely audible)
                They've come up...

     The electrified VOICE of the train ANNOUNCER suddenly
     FADES UP, telling of departures and delays-

     We raise above Susan's head-

                          TRAIN ANNOUNCER
                The 11:16 local to Poughkeepsie,
                boarding now, Track 32- the 7:20
                Connecticut local, making
                connections to South Norwalk-

     DOWN ANGLE

     -culminating in an OVERHEAD VIEW of the main terminal.

     The movement continues. But from here, the people are
     dots, their importanec no greater than that of a colony
     of ants.

                                                          FADE OUT:

     NOTE: THE HARD COPY OF THIS SCRIPT CONTAINED SCENE NUMBERS.
     THEY HAVE BEEN REMOVED FOR THIS SOFT COPY.




                                                           FADE IN:

     THE SCREEN

     Stygean darkness.

     Wet CLICKING SOUNDS. A BEAM of purplish ULTRA-VIOLET LIGHT
     reveals a mosaic of moving forms... COCKROACHES. They skitter
     restlessly under the beam's intensity. SERIES OF SHOTS -- the
     UV Beam passing over various parts of the space. Pipe webs,
     walls, girders -- all covered with the insects. Thousands of
     them.

     PULL BACK TO REVEAL

     INT. SEWER SYSTEM

     Innards of steel. A vast maze of tunnels.

     A GROUP OF FIGURES advances through the tunnels with handheld
     UV lamps.

     The figures are dressed in gray air-tight NEOPRENE SUITS,
     their faces hidden by skin tight MASKS and bug-like NIGHT
     VISION GOGGLES. In the dense silence, respirator valves HISS-
     CLICK at the corner of their lips in mechanical rhythm.

     The scene has a dream-like, choreographed quality.

     NIGHT-VISION POV

     Eerie, aquatic green.  The horde of insects appear to be some
     kind of sea-life, crawling over the floor of a dead ocean.

     THE TEAM OF FIGURES

     From their midst appears another FIGURE, its neoprene suit a
     flat WHITE.  Female, clearly the TEAM LEADER.

     She carries a stainless steel CONTAINER filled with twenty
     small compartments, each bearing a large, heavy-shelled roach
     with a different BARCODE on their back.

     JUDAS ROACHES.

     She kneels and opens the

     CASE

     TCHK!! A dozen of the Judas roaches are released.  They slide
     through into the area.

     THE NEARBY ROACHES

     react instantaneously.  In a rustle of tiny legs, they begin
     to stream toward the Judases.

     Jostle and fight each other for position to mate with them.

     They even crawl over the Team Leader in an effort to reach
     the Judases.  The Team Leader makes no effort to brush them
     off.  Patient, almost godlike, she watches the MATING.

     LATER

     A MANHOLE has been opened above. CHAINS are dropped down and
     attached by a Team Member to A 100-GALLON DISPOSAL DRUM.

     REVEAL the floor of the tunnel, carpeted with the still forms
     of the roaches, now all DEAD.

     The Team Members quietly shovel the tiny corpses into other
     disposal drums.

     At their feet skitter the only survivors of the massacre:
     the bar-coded Judas Roaches.

     In a crunch of machinery, the first disposal drum is lifted
     by the chains through the manhole to

     EXT. A CITY STREET - DAY

     MIDTOWN MANHATTAN.  A cacophony of SOUND and LIGHT.

     Dirty snow drifts over Bryant Park. Emergency lights blink
     everywhere. A wall of cars sits on Sixth Avenue, stopped
     dead. Exhaust fumes hang in the air. Jaded TRAFFIC COPS send
     the cars on crosstown detours.

     Mounted policemen patrol a line of yellow sawhorses near
     dozens of Department of Public Health vehicles, angle-parked
     in a military phalanx.

     A monumental ribcage-like scaffolding has been erected in the
     middle of the street, "sealing" the area with amber plastic.

     Inside, UNIFORMED WORKERS take the disposal drum of roaches
     and toss it into one of a number of huge DUMPSTERS.

     The Team Leader watches from nearby, exhauster.  Her mask is
     off. We see her face: Enthomologist SUSAN WYETH, 28.

     An ARM gently drapes over her shoulder.

                          PETER (OS)
                How we doing?

     She looks over at DR. PETER TYLER, 34, bespectacled.  A
     HEADSET around his neck, a coat emblazoned with the
     DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH logo.  He has the look of a man who's
     just fought a long battle and come out victorious.

                          SUSAN
                We'll see...

     He offers her a bite of a PAY DAY CANDYBAR.  Susan smiles,
     shakes her head.  She wearily leans against him.

     Peter looks out as the dumpster filled with roaches is raised
     by MECHANICAL ARMS into the waiting maw of the dump truck.

     THE SCREEN. DARKNESS.

     A voice, a somber bas-relief in the darkness.

                          ANCHORMAN (VO)
                Strickler's Disease crept into Manhattan
                like a thief in the night, claiming its
                first hundred victims before it was even
                classified.

     INT. HOSPITAL - NIGHT - FLOATING SHOT

     We FLOAT through a long hospital ward.

     Past ROWS of illuminated oxygen tents, pulsating softly in
     the dark like cocoons of light.

                          ANCHORMAN (VO)
                Most were children under ten.

     TRACK past tents.  BODIES OF SMALL CHILDREN inside, wrapped
     in white sheets, hooked up to IVs or breathing apparatus.
     Skeletal hands, parched lips, glazed eyes.

     BELLOWS of respirators push in and out, labored, failing.

     IMAGE RESOLVES TO A VIDEO ON A SCREEN.

     PULL BACK to reveal a number of SCREENS, each with a
     different set of images.  We are in a NEWS VAN.   A
     TECHNICIAN and DIRECTOR sit watching.

     The voice belongs to an ANCHORMAN who's now overimposed.

                          ANCHORMAN
                Only after the numbers had reached into
                the thousands were officials able to
                identify the carrier of the deadly
                infection...

                          DIRECTOR
                Cut to three.

     The Technician manipulates the controls.  On another screen
     we see them cut to STOCK NEWS FOOTAGE: regular cockroaches,
     crawling on garbage.

                          ANCHORMAN
                Blattida Germanica.  The common
                cockroach.

                          DIRECTOR
                     (To a RUNNER)
                Tell them we're ready for a live feed.

     EXT. OUTSIDE VAN - CITY HALL - DUSK

     The runner exits the News Van.  Other such vehicles parked
     nearby.  A CROWD of ONLOOKERS, REPORTERS and a gaggle of
     PROTESTERS with handpainted signs.

     Gliding past them, we pick up sound bites...

                          REPORTER 1
                ...an insect that has proven virtually
                immune to chemical control...

                          REPORTER 2
                ...the announcement by the Health
                Department that an end to the nightmare
                has finally...

     REPORTER 3 is interviewing a Greenpeace PROTESTER who is
     holding up a photograph of Susan.

                          REPORTER 3
                ...an ex-colleague of Doctor Susan
                Wyeth...

                          PROTESTER
                ...Susan has always been opposed to
                biological tampering. A real advocate
                for ecological causes, it's not...

     MOVE past them to further inside of the perimeter...

     INT. AUDITORIUM - CITY HALL

     A NEWS CONFERENCE in progress.  A packed house.  T.V.
     monitors spaced ever 10 seats or so. In the audience, the
     MAYOR OF NEW YORK and various CITY OFFICIALS, listening to

     Peter, speaking at the podium with the ease and enthusiasm of
     a public servant still untainted by bureaucracy.

     ON A TV MONITOR

     While Peter talks, a news title appears at the bottom of the
     screen: PETER TYLER. DEPUTY DIRECTOR, DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH.

                          PETER
                     (wrapping up)
                ...in Nature, evolution is a long,
                leisurely conversation between an
                organism and its environment. We,
                however, did not have the luxury of
                time...

     Susan is waiting in the wings. She observes the audience.

     She notices that the entire front row is composed of CHILDREN
     who have survived Strickler's.  Leg and arm braces, facial
     scarring...

     He nods at Susan, who takes the podium, adjusting her jacket,
     slightly ill at ease in her business suit.  She clears her
     throat, speaks softly.

                          SUSAN
                With the aid of genetic labs throughout
                the country, we recombined cockroach DNA
                with genetic information from termites
                and mantids. We were able to create a
                biological counter-agent.  A new ally, if
                you will...

     She places a clear container on the podium for all to see.

                          SUSAN
                Blattida Traditor.

     CU CONTAINER

     One of the Judas roaches skitters about in the container.

                          SUSAN (OS)
                The "Judas Roach".

     Cameras FLASH.  MURMURS from the audience.

                          SUSAN
                The Judas is a non-carrier of Stricklers,
                with a short life-span and heightened
                pheromone emission.

     On the back row she can see some ecological hand-painted
     signs being raised in silent protest. She stumbles for a
     second, then resumes her speech.

                          SUSAN
                The female is basically a sexual magnet;
                common males travelled miles and fought
                for the right to mate with them.

     The audience is rapt.

                          SUSAN
                When they did, they took away something
                else we added -- a hormone, passed
                through sexual congress that causes their
                metabolism to go into overdrive.  No
                matter what their food intake, they
                starved to death in a matter of hours.

     Now Peter takes the mic.

                          PETER
                We've achieved almost total eradication
                of the roach population.  As of today,
                the disease has been officially
                contained.

     A STANDING OVATION starts and is carried on as we...

                                                            CUT TO:

     INT. TYLER APARTMENT - BATHROOM - SUSAN

     in a tub in a dark bathroom. Her business suit crumpled
     on the bathroom floor.  SOUND of a TV outside.

                          PETER (OS)
                Sus, come on.  You're missing it.

     INT. LIVING ROOM

     Nothing grand.  Peter in his shorts at a TV with shitty
     reception.  He adjusts the disgruntled cable box.

     He is seen over the TV, giving his address.

                          PETER
                Fucking thing! I hope someone's taping
                this.
                     (Out.)
                Susan, come on.  It's really good this
                time. I got most of the lines out.
                     (No response.)
                Sus?

     Peter sighs. He picks up an open bottle of champagne and
     two mis-matched ceramic cups, then heads for the bathroom.

     INT. BATHROOM

                          PETER
                Life's a bitch. Our 15 minutes came
                and went and all we got was bad
                cable...

     Susan doesn't answer, clearly not in the same high spirits.

                          PETER
                Hiding from the hard glare of publicity?

     He notices her crumpled garment on the floor.  He picks it
     up, puts it up on the hanger.

                          PETER
                A shame.  You looked great tonight.

                          SUSAN
                Please.

                          PETER
                You did!

     He sits by the tub.

                          SUSAN
                Do you think we did the right thing?

                          PETER
                Taking a cab instead of hiring a limo?

                          SUSAN
                You know what I mean...

     Peter pours some champagne into the cups.

                          SUSAN
                We did no impact evaluation.  The
                consequences of...

                          PETER
                     (sighs)
                Is this a Catholic guilt thing...?

     We hear a NEWSREADER on the TV.

                          NEWSREADER (TV)
                ...a flawless strategy which has stopped
                a potential epidemic in its tracks...

                          PETER
                You hear that?  Flawless.

                          SUSAN
                We just don't know.

     He offers one cup to Susan.  She doesn't take it.

                          PETER
                We know we saved lives.

     He sits closer to her.

                          PETER
                There're gonna be a lot of kids running
                around next year because of you.

     Beat.  Susan starts to relax. He kisses her.

                          PETER
                Who know?  We get lucky, maybe a couple
                of 'em'll be ours.

                          SUSAN
                     (smiling now)
                We're down to a "couple" now, huh?

     She pats the water, beckoning.

                          PETER
                Oh, I don't know. People are beginning
                to talk about us...

     Still partially clothed, he steps into the bathtub. Susan
     shakes her head, laughs ruefully.

                          SUSAN
                Don't worry, I'll save your honor.
                Maybe I'll even marry you.

     She reaches over, kisses him.

                                                          FADE OUT:

                                                        FADE IN TO:

     EXT. ALPHABET CITY - NIGHT

     The WILLIAMSBURG BRIDGE dimly visible through the rain.

     ALPHABET CITY STREETS

     Empty warehouses. Closed businesses. Traffic lights blinking
     on empty streets. Everything seems doomed under the heavy
     layer of rain.

     SUPERIMPOSE:  TWO YEARS LATER

     A DILAPIDATED BUILDING before us. A blazing NEON CROSS made
     of the words 'JESUS SAVES' hangs askew from its facade.

     CRANE to see the ROOFTOP.

     WHAM! The door to the interior stairs FLIES OPEN and a tall,
     thin CHINESE PREACHER in his sixties lurches out, eyes wild
     with terror.

     He looks back down the steps.

     Something's climbing up fast, casting ominous, complex
     shadows on the wall.

     Too many FOOTSTEPS for it to be just one person.

     The man hurriedly shuts the door and slides a bolt home.

     Trembling, he backs away as a booming THUD makes the door
     shudder. Raw, frenzied pounding and scratching follows...
     something inhuman, determined to break through.

     The metal surface suddenly buckles and bulges.

     On the man's white undershirt, a blotch of blood starts to
     grow.  Needles of rain stab his flesh.

     He searches wildly for a possible escape.

     He reaches the edge of the roof: it's five floors down to the
     sidewalk.

     Two of the hinges on the door come loose, pulverizing the
     surrounding concrete.

     WHAM!  The door to the stairs bulges outward as something
     SMASHES against it again and again.  Frenzied SCRATCHING.

     The man sprints to the other end of the roof. There, on the
     adjoining building...

     THE CHINESE PREACHER'S POV

     Just one floor below on the building across the alley is a
     suspended PAINTERS' PLATFORM, crowded with paint cans under a
     tarp.  A two-story old EYEWEAR ADVERTISEMENT from the 40's is
     being painted over.

     THE CHINESE PREACHER

     Looks back to the door.  BAM! a tremendous SHATTERING sound.
     LIGHT spills from inside. Two bolts fly in the air, a hinge
     gives.

     He CRIES OUT in terror.

     The man gauges the distance between buildings; can he make
     it?

     He takes a few steps back, a few more...

     Panting hard, he closes his eyes, his chest soaked in blood
     and rain.

     THE DOOR EXPLODES OUTWARD AND SKIDS ACROSS THE SLIPPERY ROOF.

     Light from inside projects the shadow of wild, busy things
     onto the curtain of rain.

     Weeping with fear, the man desperately tries to hurl himself
     to the catwalk.

     It's too far.

     He FALLS...CRASH!  he hits the platform, knocking boards
     loose and sending paint cans onto their sides, rolling.  He
     bounces, slides off the edge, barely able to grab onto a
     loose board to save himself from falling.

     The RAIN blasts down.  The scaffold CREAKS.  He hits the
     edge, upsetting the cans of paint there.

     He holds onto the planks with all his might, trying to push
     with his feet, but they slide on the wet wall.

     BELOW

     Cans bounce off the pavement. White pain blasts all over.

     CU HANDS

     The man's hands slip on the planks, tiring.

     FEET

     The Chinese Preacher's FEET bicycle in the air, unable to
     find a purchase on the wet brick wall-

     THE CHINESE PREACHER

     is hanging just in front of the painted EYE of the forties'
     model.  He looks up above him, sees something-

                          CHINESE PREACHER
                No.  Please, God, no!

     A SHADOW crosses his face as something looms above him.
     Suddenly there is a CRACK and the platform tilts completely
     on one end.

     HANDS

     The Chinese Preacher's fingernails dig in, then slip on the
     wet wood.

     His hands paw the air.

     WIDER

     For a moment his body, silhouetted in the rain, seems
     suspended in a void. Then he falls backwards.

     THE GROUND

     Impact. His body cracks the pavement.

     Small pools of rain form on his dead, open eyes.

     We CRANE to reveal

     A WINDOW ON A BUILDING ACROSS THE STREET

     CHUY, a young Latino boy. He stares out the window at the
     Chinese Preacher's body with no discernable emotion.

     He works a small WIRE SCULPTURE in his hands.

     APARTMENT

     It's a small one-bedroom apartment.

     An old man sleeps peacefully on a cot: Chuy's grandfather.
     MANNY GAVIOLA, mid 60's, white hair haloes his handsome,
     benign face.

     All around him: SHOES, shoes everywhere you look, on the
     table, on the chairs, on the kitchen counter, on the floor.

     A small altar is illuminated by votive candles. Next to it,
     standing by the window is

     CHUY

     HIS P.O.V.

     We see a blurry vision of The Chinese Preacher's splayed
     figure in a swirl of color.

     Chuy's attention focuses on the Preacher's shoes.

     CHUY

                          CHUY
                     (a whisper)
                Oxfords, 8 1/2. Black...

     He looks away from the body and goes back to twisting the
     wire into shape.

     THE PUDDLE OF PAINT

     around the preacher, reflects large shadows moving above,
     and across the neon sign...

     CHUY

     hears a strange sound, a rhythmic clicking.

     His head lifts and what he sees causes his expression to
     change--there is an uncharacteristic flicker of excitement in
     his eyes.

     ACROSS THE ROOFTOP

     We are behind whatever it is that has captured Chuy's
     attention.

     TICKETY-TACKETY-TOCK...

     The strange clicking sound grows louder.  The figure begins
     moving in some weird, preparatory fashion. Then it steps
     forward and drops out of frame.

     CHUY

     His eyes follow the figure down to the pavement in a slow
     arc.

     Chuy puts down the wire miniature and opens the window to get
     a better view.

     GROUND LEVEL

     The Chinese Preacher's body is now being dragged toward the
     rear of the alley, leaving colored paint smears in its wake.

     CHUY

     We isolate the boy's face and, on the soundtrack, every other
     noise FADES AWAY.

     Chuy reaches for a pair of SPOONS nearby.

     He begins to click them together.

     Imitating the strange clicking sound heard a moment ago.

     THE CHINESE PREACHER

     is being pulled into a small, ground-level vent. The only
     problem is that no human is small enough to squeeze through
     this hole.

     CHUY

     watches, still clicking with his spoons.

     THE CHINESE PREACHER'S BODY

     is stuck. One of his legs is through the hole up to the
     thigh, but the other is folded up unnaturally and pressing
     against the wall next to the vent. Impossible.

     There is a silent beat, and then a series of INCREDIBLY
     VIOLENT TUGS, BAM! BAM! BAM! shaking the Paint-soaked body
     like a rag doll.

     CHUY

     His spoons stop. His jaw tightens a little as we hear
     terrible cracking and scraping sounds.

     THE WINDOW

     The Chinese Preacher's head and hands disappear into the
     hole. Bits of clothing, paint and blood stick to the edges of
     the opening.

     CHUY

     watches, still fascinated.

                          CHUY
                     (very low)
                Funny, funny shoes...

     He starts a new wire sculpture.

                                                            CUT TO:

     EXT. JOGGING PATH - CENTRAL PARK - DAWN

     Peter is covered in sweat, running at a good clip around the
     Central Park reservoir. A beautiful day dawns behind him; the
     windows of the Beresford sparkle in the morning sun.

     Peter outperforms most of the other RUNNERS in the track, his
     steady rhythm evidence of years of practice. Keeping his
     stride, he runs off the track and past a flock of OLD NUNS.

                          PETER
                Excuse me, ladies...

     Without slowing down, Peter retakes the path and moves past
     them.

     EXT. JOGGER'S PATH - NEAR FIFTH AVENUE - LATER

     Peter finally slows down. He checks his pulse and stops at a
     water fountain.

     As he drinks, he sees a DERELICT drawing a figure on the
     sidewalk.

     The derelict spots Peter.  He picks up his chalk, drifts off.

     Intrigued, Peter goes closer to the drawing. An arrow points
     to a manhole cover set among the bushes.

     Peter circles around, trying to make sense out of the lines.

     Then the painted motif finally reveals itself.

     GRAFFITI

     A talismanic figure of raw, archetypal power. A few jagged
     lines form the shape of a MAN IN AN OVERCOAT. His face is
     little more than a malignant blotch.

                                                            CUT TO:

     INT. MUSEUM - EXHIBIT ROOM - DAY

     A room of half-finished exhibits. A group of SCULPTORS --
     most of them undergraduates -- work on a gigantic piece
     representing a termite mound.  They're supervised by SIRI, a
     punkish young Indian research assistant.

     Susan talks to some of the sculptors about a 100-1 scale
     clay model of an insect's head.  She gestures to the
     model's mandible set.

                          SUSAN
                ...no, guys, these have to fit
                perfectly.  No spaces in between. Let
                me tell you why. Insects have no
                hands. All they have is this set of
                mandibles.

     She grabs the outer mandible set.

                          SUSAN
                See?  This little piggy will grab the
                prey.

     Then unfolds a second set...

                          SUSAN
                Then this little piggy will tear it
                in half...

     And a third!!!

                          SUSAN
                ...and this little one will grind it
                to a pulp and push it in... all the
                way into the mouth.  These are
                precision tools here. Can you
                remember that?

     The guys nod.

                          SUSAN
                Good.  Then get it right.

     A piece of the termite mound is raised above their heads,
     revealing...

     ...Peter, at the entrance, still dressed in his jogging
     sweats. He smiles at Susan.

                                                            CUT TO:

     EXHIBITS

     Peter and Susan walk through.  Peter pulls something from a
     KNAPSACK.  A bottle of medicine marked: METALLININ.

                          PETER
                     (teasing)
                "Baby in a bottle..."

     He gives it to Susan.

                          SUSAN
                Don't tease.

     Around them, WORKMEN begin unloading crates of display stuff,
     as a MAN on a ladder tacks up an "ARCHITECTS OF NATURE"
     banner. Susan proceeds behind an exhibit representing a
     honeycomb.  Peter follows as she begins to arrange some tools.

                          PETER
                You know where they get this
                fertility stuff?  They extract it
                from the urine of menopausal Italian
                nuns.

                          SUSAN
                     (laughs)
                Monks bottle their own wine. Don't
                they?

     She gently touches her belly.

                          SUSAN
                Trust me. I've never been this late.
                Never.

     She shakes the bottle.

                          SUSAN
                If nun's pee is what it takes...

     Peter's cellular RINGS from his knapsack. Susan grabs a
     larvae model from a pile on the floor.

                          SUSAN
                You were the one who ran around with
                ice in his underwear, don't forget
                that.

                          PETER
                Don't get kinky here...

     Peter takes the call. Susan cuts away the excess plastic on
     the lid around the honeycomb moldings. The larvae fits
     perfectly inside.

                          PETER
                Okay, meet me out front.
                     (to Susan)
                I gotta go. Josh's picking me up in five.
                see you tonight.

                          SUSAN
                I'll be late.

     He kisses her and leaves. Susan turns to Siri and the group
     working on that sculpture.

                          SUSAN
                Siri, sandblast that thing. It looks
                like Trump Tower.  Those mounds are
                supposed to be made of dirt and
                excretions...

                          SIRI
                     (a wicked smile)
                Just like Trump Tower, then.

                                                            CUT TO:

     EXT. STREET

     A Department of Health VAN honks its way through a traffic
     jam.

     INT. VAN

     Peter's right hand man, JOSH MASLOW -- a young, good-natured,
     can-do guy -- drives.

                          JOSH
                ...So I say "buddy, you have every
                violation in the book.  Gimme one
                good reason not to close you down."
                You know what the Kraut says to me?

     In the back, Peter finishes changing out of his jogging
     sweats and into his worksuit.

                          JOSH
                The blintzes!  "Try the blintzes..."

                          PETER
                     (distractedly)
                Selling your sould for a fistful of
                carbohydrates...

                          JOSH
                Not just any carbohydrates, mind you.
                It was like being on the receiving
                end of some kind of transcendent oral
                sex.
                     (honks furiously)
                We should get a strobe on this thing.
                Maybe even a siren.

                          PETER
                Yeah, and a loudspeaker so you can
                yell "Epidemic! Epidemic! You're all
                going to die!"

     EXT. FLOPHOUSE - DAY

     The Department of Health van pulls up outside the flophouse
     where the Chinese Preacher died. Peter and Josh get out.

     COPS push back a few ONLOOKERS. Josh proudly flashes his DOH
     badge.

                          JOSH
                Health Department...

     The cops let them pass.

                          PETER
                You really love flashing that thing,
                don't you?

                          JOSH
                Hey. I'm a short guy. Waddaya want?

     Two cops -- WOYCHEK and RICE -- approach, in no real hurry.

                          PETER
                Peter Tyler, DOH. You gentlemen were
                the first on the scene?

                          WOYCHEK
                     (gestures to Rice)
                We were both on patrol, saw this paint
                mess. Then I looked through that cellar
                window. We both did...

                          PETER
                You gone in?

                          WOYCHEK
                No. We waited.

                          PETER
                Good.

     Peter peeks through a narrow cellar window on the floor.

     Through the oily, smeared window, a ghostly array of PALE
     FACE AND HANDS appears, startling him.

                          PETER
                     (to Josh)
                Get the EMT's in there, now.

                                                            CUT TO:

     LATER

     PARAMEDIC AMBULANCES rush in. Sirens at full blast.

     Stepping out of the building across, Manny walks next to
     Chuy, who holds his hand. The old man carries a box full of
     shoes.

     Chuy looks back at the cop circus, amused.

                          MANNY
                C'mon Chuy, we're gonna be late.
                     (discreetly crossing himself)
                Cops are bad news. Don't look at them.

     He gently pulls his grandson's hand and moves briskly away.

     JOSH

     uses an iron bar, and breaks a padlocked cellar door. A heavy
     stench emanates from inside. The cops cover their noses.

     INT. CELLAR

     Peter and Josh enter a dingy, dungeon-like cellar,
     illuminated only by bug zappers and emergency lights. Every
     door and window has been nailed shut or sports a heavy-duty
     padlock. Peter and Josh walk through the dismal scene.

     In sharp contrast with the dirt-smeared walls, we see shiny
     metallic SEWING MACHINES and swatches of cloth appliqued with
     a FUNNY BUNNY cartoon character.

     Josh examines the label stitched into the collar. It reads:
     PROUDLY MADE IN USA.

                          PETER
                Jesus.

     His light hits a group of quivering, skeletal CHINESE
     IMMIGRANTS, standing in a tight group against a wall.

                          WOYCHEK
                     (from the outside)
                They look real sick, don't they?

     INT. STAIRWELL, MUSEUM - DUSK

     Carrying boxes full of terrarium material, Susan and Siri
     ride an antiquated cage-steel elevator.  No floor buttons,
     just an old-fashioned hand-activated lever.

                          SUSAN
                ...as long as they're ready for the
                opening I don't care, just tell them
                that.

                          SIRI
                I'm on it.  Don't worry.
                     (Beat)
                Look, Susan...I don't mean to pry,
                but... I kinda overheard you and
                Peter.

                          SUSAN
                     (Smiles ironically)
                Watch your step, Siri.  Your grant
                could be on the line here.

                          SIRI
                I just...well, I had this cousin in
                Delhi.  She was having problems, too.
                She, ah...

                          SUSAN
                What?

                          SIRI
                She used a baster.

     Susan looks at her.

                          SIRI
                Not a big one.  I mean, it was like a
                turkey baster.

                          SUSAN
                Oh, Jesus.

     She tries to stop the elevator at the fourth floor, but
     it rises just a little too far.

                          SUSAN
                Come on, darlin'...

     Susan has to jimmy the lever till the elevator falls
     level to the floor.

                          SIRI
                     (continues)
                She kept it under her bed. Thing is,
                it kinda worked.  I mean, she had to
                hide it from her husband, but...

     A pair of young boys, RICKY and DAVIS, sit on the floor
     outside Susan's lab door.  A crumpled paper bag and a shoe
     box sit beside them.

                          SUSAN
                What's this?

                          SIRI
                Oh, right... They been here since noon.
                I told them you're real busy.

     Susan smiles at the boys, who stand when they see her.

                          SUSAN
                Hello.

                          RICKY
                You the bug lady, right?

     Siri chuckles.

                          SUSAN
                     (smiles)
                I suppose so.

     Ricky raises and shakes the paper bag.

                          RICKY
                We're here to deal.

     INT. MOUNTING ROOM - DUSK

     SUNLIGHT slants in to illuminate an incredible array of live
     and mounted dead INSECTS, trapped in turn-of-the-century
     glass fronted cabinets. Davis puts his nose up against one,
     fascinated.

                          SUSAN
                Metaxonycha Godmani, Trigonopelastes
                Delta.  Field Butterflies.  Have you been
                upstate?

     She examines the boys' findings, mostly rag-tag specimens
     of battered butterflies.

                          DAVIS
                Avenue B.

                          SUSAN
                     (sadly)
                I guess they got lost in this city.

                          RICKY
                So, you wanna buy em?

                          DAVIS
                There's extra wings in the bag.

     Siri lingers in the background.

                          SUSAN
                You guys have done a nice job.  How bout
                five dollars?

                          RICKY
                     (dismayed)
                That's it?

                          DAVIS
                     (to Ricky)
                Show her the weirdbug.

     He indicates the shoebox-

                          RICKY
                Cost a dollar just to look.

                          DAVIS
                It's a great bug.  We kinda broke it a
                little...

     Siri impatiently points at the wall clock-

                          SUSAN
                Fellas, I'll tell you what...ten dollars
                for everything.  Plus a killing jar, some
                tweezers and mounts so the next bunch you
                catch will be in better shape.

                          DAVIS
                Deal!

                          RICKY
                You crazy! That's the best!!

                          DAVIS
                Bug's almost dead anyway.

     Susan holds out two five dollar bills.  The boys can't
     resist.  Davis grabs the money-

                          DAVIS
                Thanks, lady.

     Ricky gives a last possessive look to the shoe box, then
     follows Davis out.

     Siri crosses to the window and wrestles to close it.

                          SIRI
                Ten dollars?

     Susan places all the kid's items -including the shoebox- in
     a wastebasket.

                          SUSAN
                Alphabet City kids- there's much worse
                things they could be selling.

     Siri hits the window frame with a paperweight, gets it half
     way down.

                          SIRI
                I hate this fucking window...

     EXT. ACROSS STREET FROM MUSEUM - NIGHTFALL

     CRANE TO a nearby alley.

     A GAUNT MAN IN AN OVERCOAT stands in the shadows, looking up
     at Siri working on the window.

     As a streetlamp lights up, he backs up into the shadows.

                                                            CUT TO:

     INT. FLOPHOUSE. LOBBY - NIGHTFALL

     Religious slogans and posters are hung everywhere in what
     used to be the lobby of a men's hotel.  A hand-lettered sign:
     "NO LIQUOR, NO DRUGS, NO PROFANITY"

     PARAMEDICS are leading a number of ill CHINESE IMMIGRANTS up
     from the cellar door seen earlier.  Many are brought out on
     STRETCHERS. DOH staff put tags on their wrists.

     Peter examines a PALE OLD MAN on a stretcher while
     simultaneously talking to Josh.

                          PETER
                     (to Josh)
                There's plenty of systemic infection
                already, so as soon as we get a
                preliminary reading, start them on
                anti-biotics. You saw this?

     Peter flicks on his penlight, examines the Old Man's eyes.
     One of them is completely bloodshot. Then he shows Josh
     the gums. They're bleeding.

                          PETER
                Internal hemorrage. 2 our of 5 have
                it.  No definite signs of TB, but we'll
                quarantine them a week just to make sure.

                          JOSH
                Immigration's gonna love you for that.

                          PETER
                Tell them to send flowers to the
                usual address.

     INT. SWEAT SHOP. BASEMENT

     Peter pushes back a sheet hung across a doorway.

     BASEMENT SHOWERS

     A tiled nightmare. Concentration camp-cozy. A pile of old,
     rusting sewing machines clutter the floor, spilling
     oxide to a central grate.

                          JOSH
                Two shifts, people rotating from bed to
                work.  One toilet. We're in Wal-Mart
                hell, here.

     Josh swats a fly.

                          PETER
                Did they get the sleazebag who owns this
                place?

                          JOSH
                Triad, Chinese Mafia. They bring people
                from Yunan. Slave labor...
                     (eyes his notebook)
                Reverend Harry Wong, a preacher had the
                flophouse fronting for them. No sign of
                him.

     An overhead door is opened. Daylight streams in. Peter spots
     YANG, an Asian cop, talking to a CHINESE WOMAN lying on a
     stretcher which hasn't been moved yet.  She is hollow-eyed,
     near death.  Her hand weakly hangs on to the cop as if for
     dear life.

                          PETER
                Tell her she's going to be alright.
                We'll take care of her.

     Peter kneels next to her, looking at her and nodding while
     Yang translates. The woman mutters again, tears of fear in
     her eyes.  Yang shakes his head.

                          YANG
                She's delirious.  Keeps saying the "Dark
                Angels" are coming for her. She says
                they took some of her people away.

                          PETER
                Dark Angels?

                          YANG
                     (Shrugs.)
                Probably a gang.  Chinese people, man.
                They come up with some wacky stuff.

     They pull the stretcher out through the open overhead door
     and into an

     ALLEY

     The stretcher is rolled into a waiting vehicle, its lights
     flashing. Unseen by them, on a brick wall, nearly buried by
     graffiti, is a crude DRAWING.

     It is of the same, odd figure Peter saw drawn earlier.  The
     OVERCOAT MAN.

     INT. LAB - NIGHT - MONTAGE

     Susan and Siri, both wearing Walkman headsets, deftly mount
     BUTTERFLIES and other INSECTS onto display boards for the
     exhibit. Rain is blowing in through the half-open window.

     Their movements are precise and lyrical, the colors and
     designs of the insects are beautiful.

     We understand how you can get lost in this world.  Susan
     works steadily, a partially-eaten PAY-DAY BAR and the
     wrappers of several others are evidence of her dinner.

     A PAGER goes off in Susan's lab coat.

     She takes off her headset; CLASSICAL MUSIC leaks from her
     headphones.

     On the PAGER's LCD screen the message reads: LATE
     TONIGHT. PETE.

     Susan puts the pager down. Goes to close the window.

     There is a loud, angry BUZZING sound.

                          SUSAN
                Siri?
                     (louder)
                Siri?!

     Siri pulls her headset off; HEAVY METAL MUSIC leaks from her
     headphones.

     The BUZZING sound again. We PAN across the various bugs and
     mounting implements till we come to rest...

     ...on the SHOEBOX the boys gave Susan. Something rattles
     wildly inside.

                          SIRI
                ...the fuck?

     Susan crosses to the trash bin, picks the box out. It
     vibrates on her hand, then becomes quiet, something moves
     inside.

     She slowly opens the lid.

     The bottom of the box is littered with two inches of shredded
     newspaper. Crumbs of bread and some rice-krispies can be
     spotted here and there: a kid's idea of a comfy critter's
     nest. She moves her free hand closer.

                          SUSAN
                     (To Siri)
                Can you...?

     Suddenly and INSECT big as her hand springs out of the
     shredded paper nest and tries to grab on to her! Minute
     pieces of paper fly through the air!!

     Susan slaps the lid back down.

                          SUSAN
                     (a scared whisper)
                Could you...help me...?

                                                            CUT TO:

     LATER

     Siri comes over as Susan grabs steel tongs and a cork
     dissecting board.

                          SUSAN
                I'm gonna pull it out and I want you to
                pin it down, okay?

                          SIRI
                What is it?

                          SUSAN
                I have no idea.  Are you ready?

     Siri nods, pins in hand.  Susan opens the lid and grabs the
     nymph with the tongs.  The creature goes berserk, flailing
     its spindly limbs, BUZZING and CROAKING, a milky substance
     FOAMING out of its body.

                          SIRI
                Oh my God...

     Susan deposits the insect onto the corkboard.

     Siri tries to get a hold of it; but it twists out of the
     tongs and wraps its coarse legs around her hand!! A spider
     trapping a sparrow.

                          SIRI
                Shit!! Get it!  Get it!

     SNAP!  It bites her hand between index and forefinger.

     Susan pins the insect into the corkboard. It spins furiously,
     like a crazy LP record.

     Susan gets a grip on it again with the tongs.  Siri uses more
     pins to secure it down.

                          SUSAN
                     (Noticing Siri's hand)
                It bit you.

                          SIRI
                No shit.

     SUSAN

     leans to get a closer look at the NYMPH: Deep dark brown,
     flat as a pancake, one rear leg broken, lower tail smashed.

     It squirms helplessly now, looking pitiful under the harsh
     overhead light.

                          SUSAN
                This wing configuration. I've
                never...

                          SIRI
                     (looking at her injury)
                Fuck! It broke the skin...

                          SUSAN
                And they're not fully developed.  This
                thing's not even an adult.

     The nymph continues to HISS and FOAM, struggling against the
     steel pins. Susan looks closely at the insect's belly.

                          SUSAN
                My God.

                          SIRI
                What?

     Susan gestures to look.  Siri stares down at

     THE NYMPH'S TORSO

     where a SET OF VALVES on its underside click in and out.

                          SUSAN (OS)
                It's breathing.

     SIRI

     shakes her head.

                          SIRI
                That's impossible.  Insects don't...

                          SUSAN
                I know.
                     (Picks up a SCALPEL)
                Help me get a sample.

     Susan touches her scalpel to the nymph's leg.

     The nymph CLICKS nervously.

                          SUSAN
                Hold on, big guy, hold on...

     She traps the nymph down and CUTS THE LEG OFF.

     A painful, agonized BUZZ echoes around the room.

                                                            CUT TO:

     MONITOR

     Susan attaches the insect's leg to a samll holder. It is
     frozen in a swirl of dry ice.

     The brittle leg is then mounted in a LASER MICROTOME. Bit by
     bit, the machine executes MICROSCOPIC WAFER CUTS. Siri is
     making slides out of each section.

     A series of MICROPHOTOGRAPHIC IMAGES flash onto the screen.
     In the background we hear the high-pitched BUZZ-

     We see the lights from the mounting room through a glass
     brick wall.

     INT. MOUNTING ROOM - NIGHT

     We see the nymph slowly squirming in the FG, then RACK FOCUS
     to the rain-spattered WINDOW.

     Suddenly the OVERCOAT MAN is standing on the windowsill!

     The window is lifted effortlesly from the outside.

     SUSAN

     prepares a blue solution and places two drops on each smear
     slide.

     Reflected in the glass brick behind her we see the man moving
     across the room.

     THE OVERCOAT MAN

     seen only through rippled glass and reflections, moves
     through the lab.

     His body STEAMS lightly from the rain. His movements are
     quirky, spastic.

     The man observes the imprisoned insects with curiosity.

     He comes to the nymph, pinned and mutilated on the worktable.
     The nymph CLICKS and CHITTERS excitedly, as if communicating
     with the man.

     He looks up at the worklight.  It seems to bother him.

     WHUMP!!! In a blur of motion, he SMASHES the light bulb.

     SUSAN

     watches the smear slide.  The blue droplets begin to CHANGE
     COLOR once in contact with the leg section...

                          SUSAN
                Hold on a second...

     ...slowly turning a deep green.

                          SIRI
                What?

     Then, THREE LARGE BEETLES fly into the room.

     Siri looks at Susan. Susan gets up, hesitant, signals for
     Siri to stay.

     We FOLLOW Susan into the mounting room.

     SUSAN'S POV

     She walks in, barely able to see her hand in front of her
     face.

     The window facing the street is wide open, rain blowing in.

     Something CRUNCHES under her feet.  She bends down, looks.

     She's stepped on the broken glass of the lightbulb.

     The floor is alive with various INSECTS -- crawling, hopping,
     flying away from their displays, which have been opened.

     The nymph is gone from the board!

     She looks under the work table the nymph was on.

     We LOWER as we TRACK BACK with her.  Something is folded up
     in the corner of the ceiling behind her, camouflaged in the
     shadows, clinging impossibly to the wall.

     THE OVERCOAT MAN.

     He lowers himself with silent grace.

     Susan whirls.

     WHOOSH! A GUST OF WIND! A FLUTTERING SHADOW OFF THE WINDOW!

     Silence.

                          SIRI (O.S.)
                Susan?

     Susan GASPS, startled.  We SHIFT to see Siri at the door.

                          SUSAN
                Call security.

                                                            CUT TO:

     EXT. FLOPHOUSE - NIGHT

     The last DOH van takes off under the heavy rain.

     Across the street, Chuy looks down from his apartment window.

     INT. MANNY'S APARTMENT - SAME

     Chuy sits at the window, twisting wire into a human-like
     figure.  MOVING past him, we see a group of other WIRE
     FIGURES on the table, backs of chairs, lamps, everywhere.

     Manny sits at the kitchen table. He IGNITES a can of shoe
     polish with a match, then lights a cigarette off the flame.

     He puts the cigarette in his mouth and proceeds to polish a
     pair of shoes. A SILLY SHOW plays over the TV.

                          MANNY
                Not too little, not too much. You rub it
                in, around and around like this. Let the
                leather take it.

     Manny leans tiredly against the table. He looks fatigued
     and in pain. He takes a small pill and places it under
     his tongue.

                          MANNY
                You watching? You should learn to
                work the shoes. You're good with your
                hands...

     Manny shoots a glance over to his grandson.

                          MANNY
                Chuy...you gonna get all wet.

     Chuy doesn't pay attention, just stares out at the street.

                          MANNY
                Did you look at the story book I got you?

     Manny lifts a brightly colored CHILDREN'S BOOK.

                          MANNY
                Our Animal Friends.  Can you say that,
                Chico?  "Friends"?

     Nothing from Chuy.

     CHUY'S POV - STREET

     The building across the street. Yellow DOH tape at the
     entrance.

                          MANNY (OS)
                A friend is the one you can trust.  When
                you are with a friend, no matter where in
                the world, you are at home.

     A FIGURE moves out of the shadows and totters in the rain
     toward the entrance.  It is the OVERCOAT MAN, barely visible
     in the rain.

                          MANNY
                In this city. A friend is a hard thing to
                find...

     CHUY

     His face shows a bit of animation.

                          CHUY
                Funny Shoes...

     Manny looks up from the book.

                          CHUY
                Alli.  Mr. Funny Shoes.

     Manny comes over, looks out.

     THEIR POV

     The figure has disappeared into the dark front of the
     boarded-up building.

     MANNY AND CHUY

                          MANNY
                No one is there. Is empty.

     Chuy doesn't respond.  Manny turns the boy's face to his.

                          MANNY
                Chuy, listen to me.  They have Jesus on
                the cross, but that is not a holy place.
                You understand?

     Chuy looks at him blankly.  Manny sighs; he knows he doesn't.

                          MANNY
                Ah, Nino.  God only knows what goes on in
                your head, eh?

     He pats the boy on the head, then goes back to work. Chuy
     turns back to stare at the street.

                          CHUY
                Mr. Funny Shoes...

     EXT. OUTSIDE TYLER APARTMENT BUILDING - NIGHT

     The D.O.H. Van pulls up in front of a modest Pre-war
     building. Josh and Peter climb out.

     Peter is reviewing a roster.

                          PETER
                Josh, what was Immigration's
                countdown?

     Josh hands Peter a plastic bag with his sweat clothes
     and running shoes.

                          JOSH
                Thirty-three workers.

     Peter hands him the roster.

                          PETER
                There are thirty five listed in the
                reverend Wong's roster...

                          JOSH
                Shit.

     Peter walks up the front steps.

                          PETER
                Remember what that woman said, about
                people being taken? Check with the
                copsin the area.

     INT. TYLER APARTMENT - NIGHT

     Peter enters the apartment, which has long since been
     remodeled with a nicer couch and a bigger TV with slightly
     better reception.

                          PETER
                Sus?

     No answer.  He notices the dining room table is filled with
     yellowed FILES, all marked JUDAS TRADITOR.

                          PETER
                     (Looks around once again)
                Susan?

     INT. LAUNDRY ROOM

     Peter comes in to find Susan sitting in a chair before a
     dryer, quietly watching laundry whirl within.

                          PETER
                     (Regarding the laundry.)
                Thought it was my week for that.

                          SUSAN
                     (Shrugs.)
                I needed to think. It was either this
                or the weather channel.

     Peter walks over, kisses her.  He notices an open book of
     INSECT MORPHOLOGY on her lap. There's a FULL COLOR
     PHOTOGRAPH of an OOTHECA -- an insect eggcase.

     INT. LAUNDRY ROOM - LATER

     Peter folds laundry into his/her piles.  Susan paces.

                          SUSAN
                This thing was the size of my fist,
                Peter!! That's off the charts!

                          PETER
                Okay. So you lost a great specimen-

                          SUSAN
                Don't you get it? It's more than
                that.

     Peter takes a bedsheet. Susan helps him fold it.

                          SUSAN
                You know why insects don't grow larger?
                Because they don't have a complex
                respiratory system. What I saw did. It
                had lungs.

     Peter walks backward with his end of the sheet.  The two
     begin to fold it together.

                          SUSAN
                Evolution doesn't work that fast.
                Something pushed that thing to take the
                leap. We need to find another specimen.

                          PETER
                We?

     As they fold the sheet, they move closer together.

                          SUSAN
                I did a PH test on its tarsal pads.

     The folding of the sheet has brought them almost face to
     face. Susan finishes folding herself.

                          SUSAN
                There's only two species who match the
                enzymes I found.  One's a leaf-cutter ant
                in the Amazon...

     She has his full attention now.

                          SUSAN
                The other we released here two years ago.

     EXT. ALPHABET CITY - AVENUE B - DAY

     A TAXI CAB makes a U turn and cruises on.

     INT. CAB

     Susan ignores the yakking Armenian DRIVER as she scans
     the buildings and empty lots-

                          ARMENIAN DRIVER
                Avenue B... again! Maybe you got
                wrong letter, uh?

     The cabbie looks up at a Manhattan street map glued over
     his head on the roof of the cab.

                          SUSAN
                Keep going. We'll tell you when to
                stop...

                          PETER
                Maybe they lied to you.

                          SUSAN
                Even if they did... that's all we
                have, isn't it?

     The cab cruises past the tenement buildings, nondescript
     stores, junked cars and rubble-strewn lots. It stops
     before a traffic light.

     A LEERING HOMELESS GUY with a greasy rag and greasier
     cleaning solution approaches the windshield.

                          ARMENIAN
                No... Oh, shit. Get away, you Turk!

     The Homeless guy begins wiping/smudging the windshield
     with his dirty rag. The driver sends him away.

     The light turns green.  The Driver accelerates, turning
     on the windshield wipers to expunge the smears left by
     the guy.

     Susan sees something.

                          SUSAN
                Pull over!

                          ARMENIAN DRIVER
                What...?

     Susan motions excitedly.  The Driver pulls over. Susan
     gets out.

     EXT. OUTSIDE CAR

     Susan rushes over, removes something from the windshield
     wiper.

     A BUTTERFLY, its wing pinned under the rubber flapper.
     She holds it in her palm, then looks up at Peter.

                          SUSAN
                Metaxonycha Godmani.

                          PETER
                So?

     Susan looks around.  Just ahead is an empty LOT surrounded by
     a wooden fence plastered with flyers for rock bands and
     performance artists.

     An identical BUTTERFLY perches on the edge of a board.

     EXT. EMPTY LOT

     Susan and Peter walk through waist-high GRASS of a small
     urban wilderness.  Dozens of BUTTERFLIES flutter around them
     from the weeds.

                          RICKY (OS)
                If you want your money back, forget it!

     Peter and Susan look up.  The voice comes from a RAMSHACKLE
     CLUBHOUSE, built of wood scraps and cardboard.

                          DAVIS (OS)
                We already spent it!

     Susan walks forward.

                          SUSAN
                We're here to deal.

     Long beat.  The door to the clubhouse swings open.

                                                            CUT TO:

     INT. SUBWAY STATION - DAY

     A BLUR of subway cars goes by with an ear-pulverizing SOUND.

     At the end of the platform, Davis untwists a wire around the
     busted lock of a locker room door. Peter paces nervously
     nearby.

                          PETER
                Here, let me...

     He starts on it himself. Meanwhile, Ricky stares at a
     PHOTOGRAPH Susan has given to him:  a ribbed, tortoise-
     brown colored EGGCASE.

                          SUSAN
                You sure you didn't see one of these?

                          RICKY
                Gross. What is it?

                          SUSAN
                An "Ootheca". An eggcase. It probably had
                more, uh "weirdbugs" inside.

                          RICKY
                     (shakes his head)
                No way. I see one of those, I'd puke.

     Davis opens the door with a CLICK.

     INT. SUBWAY LOCKER ROOM

     A dark, abandoned LOCKER ROOM once used for transit workers.

     Susan and Peter walk in with the boys, nervous in the off-
     limits area.

                          DAVIS
                It was in that corner over there.

     Davis points to a bank of dented metal LOCKERS.

                          RICKY
                Sucker was fast, man.
                     (Picks up a pipe.)
                Had to take it out with one a these.

                          PETER
                Okay, guys.  We'll take it from here.

     Peter hands Ricky some money. The boy looksdown at it
     slyly.

                          RICKY
                Make it ten an' we won't tell the cops
                you're here.

     Peter regards the little scam artist dryly.

                          PETER
                Let's keep it at five and I won't
                condemn your clubhouse.

     Peter hands him a couple of dollars more. The two boys
     take off.

     Peter removes a PENLIGHT from his pocket.

     Dust covers everything. A forest of COPPER TUBING and PIPES
     where the sinks used to be.

     PETER

     inspects the floor. It's littered with cheap objects:
     chipped combs, used rubbers, soggy newspapers, smeared
     heroin syringes.

     Something shiny catches his eye. He picks it up.

                          PETER
                     (quietly)
                Look, a broken tooth...

     Something rustles nearby.

     He notices an old, rotting poster on the back wall.  It
     seems ODDLY TEXTURED somehow.  He walks toward it.

     SUSAN

     kneeling, pushes aside a dented trash bin. Behind it, there
     is a cabinet with rusty sliding doors.

     A SUBWAY TRAIN RUMBLES by outside, the sound echoes off
     the tile walls.

     Susan forces the door back. She peeks through the opening.

     Her face stares back at her from a dirty pocket mirror.
     She starts pulling something out.

     PETER

     at the oddly texture wall.  He shines the penlight at it...

     ...and is met with a FLUTTER OF WINGS.  MOTHS, perfectly
     camouflaged against the poster on the wall, whiz past him.

     Peter recoils.

                          SUSAN (OS)
                You okay?

     He nods.

     SUSAN

     turns back to her locker.  She withdraws a cheap PLASTIC
     NECKLACE from it.  As she removes it, it breaks.  A coulpe of
     beads fall away...

     ...rolls under the locker...

     ...and BOUNCE -- once, twice, thrice -- each time going
     deeper till they comes to a stop.

     Susan peers where the beads fell.

                          SUSAN
                There's something under here.

     Peter comes over, kneels by her. Susan takes a handful of
     beads and throws them at the base of the locker.

     CAMERA TRACKS to follow one of them. It rolls all the way
     under.

     A moment later, from some interior space, the sound of it
     BOUNCING on cement. He shines his light inside.

     INT. HOLE - PETER'S HAND

     Very dark. A highlight glints off a shell-like surface.

     The light barely touches it.

     THE WHOLE SURFACE BACKS AWAY.

     Peter drops the penlight.  It gets stuck in a jutting piece
     of concrete.

     PETER

                          PETER
                Shit.

     Peter tries to get his hand in

     DEEPER

     But he cannot reach the light. It is literally inches from
     his fingers...

     SUSAN

                          SUSAN
                Let me try.  My hands are smaller.

     She kneels and goes for it.

     INT. HOLE - SUSAN'S HAND

     Her hand reaches for the penlight.

     She barely touches it.  The penlight spins around.  Its light
     now illuminates...

     THE FACE OF A MAN.  Unseen by Susan.  Terrifying in its doll-
     like simplicity.  In the darkness, its features seem
     indiscernable, inert, almost frozen in a perfectly
     symmetrical pattern.

     It regards the spiderlike movement of Susan's fingers.

     SUSAN'S

     face squinches with the effort.

                          PETER
                Honey, just leave it.

                          SUSAN
                No, there's...

     INT. HOLE - SUSAN'S HAND

     As Susan's hand moves closer, the strange Face begins to
     TREMBLE.

     A CLICKING SOUND.

     Susan's hand is almost there.

     SUSAN

     reaches further.

     And suddenly A BEAM OF LIGHT cuts through the darkness.

     Their vision resolves. The figures of two MTA COPS stand
     before them:  ERNEST, 50, burly and bull-necked; and LEONARD
     -- African American, 45, more formidable than fat.

                          LEONARD
                     (Wearily)
                Now don't tell me.

     INT. HOLE

     Susan's hand withdraws.

                          LEONARD (OS)
                You lost a token, right?

                                                            CUT TO:

     SHH-SHH-SHH.  A felt rag is expertly being pulled across a
     set of pristine black shoes.

     REVEAL Leonard sitting like a king in a chair, getting his
     shoes shined by Manny.  He leans back laconically while
     arguing with Peter. Ernest examines the ootheca picture.

                          PETER
                Look, I showed you my badge...

                          LEONARD
                Yeah, and you gonna have to show me a lot
                bigger one you wanna go down there.
                That's the old maintenance grid, Doc.
                Swiss cheese: tunnels, tracks...

                          PETER
                The Department of Public Health...

                          LEONARD
                ...should know better'n to go sneakin'
                around my turf...

                          PETER
                Fine.  You want me to call your
                supervisor?

                          LEONARD
                Please do.  He's a lonely guy.

     Uninterested, Leonard looks over to Susan and Chuy.

     ANGLE ON SUSAN

     She leans against the wall, inspects her dirty hand. Ernest
     gives her his handkerchief.

                          CHUY (OS)
                Gucci.  Flat pump.

     She looks down at Chuy, who sits nearby, holding a PAIR OF
     SPOONS.

                          ERNEST
                Your shoes.

     She stares down at her shoes.  Gucci flat pumps, all right.
     Susan smiles.

     Just then, a SUBWAY TRAIN pulls up.  The doors open,
     disgorging passengers. Chuy flips into action.  He starts
     playing his spoons, CLICKING them together, slapping them
     against his knee.

     Susan watches in wonder as the boy begins to use the spoons
     to IMITATE the different rhythmical step patterns of the
     VARIOUS COMMUTERS: The rolling, comical gait of A FAT MAN,
     the lithe haughty step of A PRIM LADY.

                          SUSAN
                     (Laughs.  To Chuy.)
                That's wonderful!  What grade are you in?

     Chuy doesn't answer.

                          ERNEST
                No school. Shoes're all Chuy knows about.

     Ernest discreetly points to his forehead.

                          MANNY
                     (immediately)
                He's special.

                          LEONARD
                He can imitate anything, you just watch
                him.

                          PETER
                     (Irritably, to Leonard)
                Excuse me, I'm talking to you.

                          LEONARD
                No, you talkin' at me.

     Leonard hands Manny a $5.00 bill for the shine, gets up and
     walks past Peter as if he were invisible.

                          ERNEST
                     (discreetly, to Susan)
                Is there some reward for this?

                          SUSAN
                I guess that could be arranged.

     Ernest smiles, pockets the ootheca picture.

                          PETER
                For Chrissakes.  You gonna lay a two-
                bit bureaucratic, territorial number
                on me?

                          LEONARD
                You wanna keep up the conversation, you
                best come back with the proper permits
                and the right attitude.

     Leonard saunters away with Ernest in tow.

     Peter shakes his head angrily.  He takes Susan by the arm,
     heads off in another direction.

     Chuy, without watching, clicks his spoons to the imitation of
     their steps.

     INT. SUBWAY STAIRS - DAY

     Susan and Peter walk up the stairs; Peter still fumes.

                          PETER
                You give someone a fucking uniform
                and... Did you hear how he talked to us?

                          SUSAN
                I heard how you talked to him.

                          PETER
                Oh, so I'm the bad guy now?

     Susan spares him an ironic look.

                          SUSAN
                He was just doing his job.

                          PETER
                Fine, then I'm the bad guy. Jesus!

     At the top of the stairs they're completely engulfed by
     sunlight.

                          PETER
                He wants a permit, I'll get him a
                permit.

                                                            CUT TO:

     INT. SUBWAY TRACKS - DUSK

     A train blurs by.

     A FLASHLIGHT BEAM over dirty gravel.  TILT with the beam to
     see Ernest walking his beat past TRACKS and GIRDERS.  Hulking
     out-of-service SUBWAY CARS surround him. He shines his light
     on the ootheca picture and then around him at the walls.

     A SOUND catches his attention.  A RUSTLING.

     He notices something off to a corner, walks over to it.

     A SHINY BROWN LUMP in the corner, covered in garbage.

     He touches the lump with his shoe.  It STIRS slightly.

     He touches it again...

     ...and a PAIR OF LEGS suddenly LASH OUT, kicking at him
     reflexively.

     Ernest jumps back.

     Another SET OF LEGS emerges...

     Oddly enough, Ernest relaxes.

                          ERNEST
                Chrissakes...

     He grabs the surface of the lump, and pulls it.  We see that
     it was just a SHINY BROWN TARP.

     Underneath, a group of THREE HOMELESS PEOPLE -- emaciated,
     toothless -- sleeping intertwined for warmth. In the dim
     light, they almost seem like a single organism.

                          ERNEST
                Guys, c'mon.

     The Homeless People stare back at him mutely.  Ernest starts
     getting annoyed.

                          ERNEST
                I told you to stick by the maintenance
                area.

                          BAG LADY
                Nah... It's private property now.

     Ernest looks at her, confused.

                          SKELETAL BUM
                He eats down there.

                          ERNEST
                Who?

                          HOMELESS MAN
                The Stickman.

                          BAG LADY
                Long John.

     The homeless man points.  Ernest turns his light.

     Another SILHOUETTE of the OVERCOAT MAN drawn on the wall. An
     arrow below it points east.

                          ERNEST
                Graffiti artist, uh?
                     (To Homeless People)
                Look guys, just get off my beat, you
                hear?  Get moving.

     Ernest hustles them out.  The homeless people glare at him,
     pick up their things and head into the gloom.

     Ernest watches them go.  He turns back to the graffiti
     painting of The Stickman.

                                                       DISSOLVE TO:

     INT. SUBWAY TUNNEL - LATER

     Ernest walks deeper into the tunnels. Dusklight slants in
     weakly from grates above.

     He stops as a RUMBLE is heard ahead of him  He ducks into a
     recess in the wall.  The RUMBLE grows LOUDER, LOUDER.

     A SUBWAY TRAIN curves around the bend up ahead, its
     HEADLIGHTS raking the opposite wall to reveal...

     A FIGURE crouched over something.

     We hear CHOMPING and SWALLOWING sounds.

     CU ERNEST

     Squinting to see over his flashlight beam.

                          ERNEST
                Hey, buddy!

     No answer.  Just the wet sounds of food getting chewed and
     ingested.  Ernest is revolted.

                          ERNEST
                Get off my track...

     The crouching figure lifts its head and looks around in a
     unusually quick BLUR OF MOTION.  It's the OVERCOAT MAN.

     Another distant RUMBLE. Ernest's clothes flutter in the puff
     of hot wind that signals an approaching train.

     Ernest pulls a CAN OF MACE from his belt, begins to advance.

     The Overcoat Man stands up.

     Ernest stops in his tracks.

     For he sees that the Overcoat Man is holding a large OBJECT
     in his arms. Something wet and shiny with blood.

     A dead dog.

     The Overcoat Man drops the animal.  It rolls slowly down his
     chest...

     ...and is briefly caught BY ANOTHER SET OF ARMS EXTENDING
     FROM HIS TORSO.

                          ERNEST
                Sweet Jesus...

     The Overcoat Man lets the animal fall to the ground.  He
     begins walking toward Ernest.

     Ernest backs away.

     The Overcoat Man LEAPS on him just as the SUBWAY TRAIN ROARS
     PAST!

     CRACK! Ernest's body is twisted and crunched by powerful
     arms.

     Through the strobing windows we see Ernest enveloped by the
     dark figure, then raised above, taken away.

     TRACK

     The can of mace rolls next to the track as the TRAIN CLEARS.

     The track is empty again.

                                                            CUT TO:

     INT. EXHIBITION HALL - BANNER

     We PAN across the banner:  'ARCHITECTS OF NATURE'.

     INT. EXHIBITION FLOOR

     EXHIBITS under glass set up throughout the room: Insect
     chambers and vaults of great complexity, etc.

     An opening night CROWD of affluent MUSEUM PATRONS.  All
     tuxedoes and painted smiles.  Some peremptorily peruse the
     displays; most just camp out at the buffet table.

     Peter enters, dressed in his worksuit.  He scans the
     room, sees Siri leaning against a wall by the buffet
     table, drinking an orange juice.  He goes over to her.

                          PETER
                Heya.
                     (Kisses her on the cheek.)
                Where's the boss?

     Siri gestures to the far end of the room.  Susan stands
     alone, sipping a chardonnay by an ANT MOUND exhibit.

                          SIRI
                Ant mound.

     Peter notices Siri seems unusually weary. She covers one
     of her eyes.

                          PETER
                You okay?

                          SIRI
                It's just a headache.  We were
                sandblasting Trump Tower here since
                four this morning.

                          PETER
                Maybe you should sit...

                          SIRI
                I'm fine. Go talk to Susan.  She could
                use a good word right now.

     She nods for him to go ahead.  Peter leaves.

     Siri closes her eyes.  She rubs the bandage around the
     insect bite on her hand.

     PETER

     approaches Susan.  She's staring through thr glass panes
     of the exhibit at the crowd of patrons.  In the
     refraction, their black tuxedoes and evening gowns seem
     to blend into one another.

                          PETER
                Great crowd.

                          SUSAN
                No such thing, baby.

     She looks over at the crowd congregated around the
     buffet table.

                          SUSAN
                I get the feeling they came more for
                the potroast than the apterids.

                          PETER
                Fuck 'em.  They don't know what
                they're missing.

                          SUSAN
                     (Distantly)
                Right.

     Peter looks at her.

                          PETER
                What's wrong?

     Susan sighs.

                          SUSAN
                Oh...nothing that a little
                menopausal's pee daikiri couldn't
                cure. Least that's what I thought.

     Peter looks at her, notices that one of her hands is on
     her stomach.

                          PETER
                     (genuinely moved)
                Oh, no, you were-

                          SUSAN
                I was just late.

     Susan nods.  Peter takes her hand. They sit by the ant
     mound.

                          SUSAN
                Ironic, don't you think?  These guys
                can hatch hundreds of offspring in a
                single clutch of eggs, right? And
                here we are...

                          PETER
                Susan, we're not b-

                          SIRI (OS)
                Susan?

     Susan looks up to see Siri standing on the other side of
     the glass case.

                          SIRI
                     (Weakly.)
                I'm sorry.  I think...I need...

     One of her eyes is completely bloodshot. Her mouth is
     bleeding. She puts her hand on the case to steady
     herself.

     Her fingers leave a STREAK OF BLOOD on the glass.

                          SUSAN
                Siri...

     Siri collapses.  The exhibit tips over.

     Peter pulls Susan out of the way just as the exhibit
     FALLS AND SMASHES TO THE GROUND!

                          SUSAN
                Siri!

     The room erupts into COMMOTION.

     Susan and Peter run to Siri, who lies unconscious on the
     floor.

     Peter gently turns her over.

     Siri's BLEEDING from the corner of her mouth.  Just like
     the Chinese workers in the sweatshop.

     Tuxedoed people encircle her next to the insect mounds.

                                                  SMASH CUT TO:

     EXT. NEW YORK STREET - NIGHT

     An ambulance races down the avenue toward a distant
     hospital.

     INT. HOSPITAL - HALLWAY

     Siri is rushed on a gurney toward the Emergency Room.

     Peter and Susan walk next to it talking to DR. CHRIS
     RAYMOND, a 35-year old ER physician.

                          PETER
                ...I think it's some kind of systemic
                infection, Chris.  I saw a few cases
                like it yesterday. A sweatshop in
                Canal.

                          RAYMOND
                     (to Peter.)
                Okay, look.  You better come in with
                me.  Help me through.

     INT. EMERGENCY ROOM

     Raymond, Peter, and several other ER STAFF work on Siri,
     now lying on an operating table.

                          RAYMOND
                     (To Peter)
                All hands on deck, Pete. Remember the
                dril?

                          PETER
                It'll come back to me.

     RAYMOND inspects Siri's wounded hand.  The bandage has
     been removed.  The bite-wound is infected and
     suppurating.  A large red circular RASH around it.

                          PETER
                Looks like a Lyme disease rash.

                          RAYMOND
                It's not consistent with the internal
                bleeding. Any idea what bit her?

     Peter shakes his head.

                          RAYMOND
                I think we're gonna need to have that
                specimen here.

     An ASSISTANT finishes inserting a catheter down her
     throat.

     Blood and fluid leak up through the clear tube.

     ABOVE THE OPERATING THEATER.

     Staring down through the circular glass deck, Susan
     silently observes the procedures.

                                                            CUT TO:

     INT. MANNY'S APARTMENT - NIGHT

     Salmon-colored LIGHT slants in from sodium vapor streetlight.
     PAN through the shadowy room, past Manny's sleeping form to
     Chuy, asleep under a tent made of an old Star Wars blanket.

     A RHYTHMICAL CLICKING SOUND is heard from outside.

     Chuy pops his head out from under the blanket, listening.

     EXT. FIRE ESCAPE - NIGHT

     Wearing only his pajama bottoms, Chuy steps out on the fire
     escape with his spoons in hand.

     The CLICKING RESUMES from the building across the street.

     OVERHEAD VIEW

     The barefoot little boy crosses the street, steps through the
     center of the huge PAINT STAIN on the sidewalk.

     The CLICKING sound comes again.

     STREET LEVEL

     The CLICKING comes again from inside the flophouse.  It
     continues a little bit, then stops.

     Chuy CLICKS his spoons together, mimicking the sound.

     Beat.  A CLICKING from within again; almost an answer.

     Chuy ducks under the yellow DOH tape, walks toward the front
     of the building.

     He comes to the boarded entrance.  There is a hole, narrow,
     and low in the doorway.

     Chuy squats, begins to wriggle through it.

     INT. FLOPHOUSE - LOBBY

     Chuy steps into the lobby.

     The CLICKING comes again, from further inside.

     Chuy moves to find it.

     CHAPEL

     Bits of STREETLIGHT slant in.  Chuy walks slowly, listening.

     He steps into the SHADOW of a LOOMING FIGURE.  He turns...

     CHUY'S POV - CRUCIFIX

     We start on bleeding, nail-pierced feet, then TILT up the
     twisted body to the face of Jesus, looking down.

     CHUY

     stares without emotion at the plaster figure.

     MOVEMENT to his side.  He turns again.

     A dimly-lit FIGURE stands before him.

     Shapes fold and regroup in the darkness, resolving into the
     tall figure of the OVERCOAT MAN.

     The Man begins to emit the CLICKING NOISE from under his
     chin, his whole head VIBRATING.

     Chuy smiles.  He has a beautiful smile.

                          CHUY
                Mr. Funny Shoes.

     He plays his spoons, imitating the sound the figure made.

     He is answered...but this time, it's from the other side of
     the room. We PAN as he turns.

     ANOTHER OVERCOAT MAN appears in the shadows.

     Chuy GIGGLES, delighted.

                ...you don't even know what you're
                looking for.

                          PETER
                You said that thing was big as your
                hand.  I don't think I'm going to
                miss...

                          SUSAN
                Why take the chance?  Just let me go
                down there with you...

                          PETER
                No.

     Susan glares at him.  Peter sits down by her.

                          PETER
                Susan, listen to me:  you handled
                that insect almost as much as Siri...

                          SUSAN
                It didn't bite me.

                          PETER
                I know.  But if it was carrying
                something...there's a chance you
                could have been exposed.

     Susan is silent.

                          PETER
                Chris is going to run some blood
                tests on you.  I want you to stay here
                till he's absolutely sure you're
                clean.  Okay? Then you'll call me...
                You'll catch up with us...

     Susan looks up at him. Finally, she nods.

                          PETER
                We'll be all right, Sus.  I promise.

     He leans over, kisses her gently.  But Susan seems
     hardly reassured.

     INT. MANNY'S APARTMENT - PREDAWN

     The blue hours before dawn. Laconic movement outside.  New
     York dragging itself out of bed.

     We FIND Manny fixing some melted cheese sandwiches on a hot
     plate. He addresses Chuy's tented bed behind him.

                          MANNY
                My father saw me stay in bed, he'd go get
                a pitcher. Cold water, whoosh, I tell you
                that's some alarm clock, brrrrr!

     Manny cuts the bread in four equal sections and arranges them
     in a star-shaped pattern. A breakfast ritual of some kind.

                          MANNY
                Ah! There you go! The way you like 'em,
                Chu-chu...
                     (He pours a glass of milk.)
                We're low on milk, you remind Grampa to
                pick some up tonight, okay?

     He walks over to Chuy's tent bed. He pulls the sheets aside.

     His grandson is gone.

     EXT. SEWAGE FILTRATION PLANT - PREDAWN

     Sewage water BUBBLES in huge tanks.

     A WORKMAN walks down catwalks above the tank, disengaging the
     larger pieces of debris from the filter areas with grappling
     hooks.  Shoes, tires, rags...

     A GRINDING SOUND is heard.  The Workman YELLS out to a
     CONTROL BOOTH above.

                          WORKMAN
                Hold up!  We gotta block on filter D.

     SOUND of the pump coming to a halt.

     The Workman walks to the filter area.  He sinks his grappling
     hook into the polluted waters.

     UNDERWATER SHOT

     Spooky, silent. The grappling hook moves like a scythe to the
     filter...

     ...past long, soft filaments of RAGGED TISSUE...

     ...and connects with a LARGER FORM.

     ABOVE WATER

     The Workman feels the grappling hook connecting.  He gives a
     YANK, hooking whatever it is.

     He begins pulling it up.

     A PALE FORM bubbles to the surface.

     The Workman's face goes pale.

                          WORKMAN
                Oh, God...

     A grating VOICE from the control booth is heard over the P.A.

                          CONTROL BOOTH
                          VOICE
                What's the problem?

     It take the Workman a moment to speak.

                          WORKMAN
                I think it's a baby!

     The Workman pulls the form (as if that will do any good)
     toward the edge of the tank.

     He bends down, and now gets his first good look at it.

     The Workman SCREAMS.

     His grappling hook falls from his hand, into the sewage.

     Susan watches Siri from behind a pane of glass.  Siri is
     connected to a respirator, her vital signs monitored by
     several machines.

     Raymond approaches Susan, two cups of coffee in his
     hands.

                          RAYMOND
                How you feeling?

                          SUSAN
                You tell me.

     He smiles, gives her one of the cups.

                          RAYMOND
                Your blood tests were all negative.
                You checked out.

     Susan visibly relaxes.  She looks back at the ICU ward.

                          SUSAN
                What about Siri?

                          RAYMOND
                She's stable.  I don't think there's
                any immediate danger, but we'll have
                to keep her under observation...

                          SUSAN
                You think it's some form of
                Strickler's, don't you?

     Beat.  Raymond shrugs.

                          RAYMOND
                Pathology's still working on the
                tissue samples.  If it is...it must

                I'm sorry, Sue.  We just don't know
                yet.

     INT. HOSPITAL - BATHROOM

     At the sink, Susan runs water over her hands, her face,
     trying to collect herself.  She looks up in the mirror.
     We see that her eyes are swollen, tear-stained.

     INT. HOSPITAL - HALLWAY

     She walks out of the ladies room, drying her face with a
     paper towel.

     SOUNDS of a nearby argument catch her attention.

                          JEREMY (OS)
                ...how many times I gotta tell you,
                man: we can't accept this!

                          EMT (OS)
                Well, what the hell else am I suppose
                to do with it?

     Susan heads in the direction of the voices.

     INT. HOSPITAL - HALLWAY NEAR MORGUE

     An ORDERLY (JEREMY) argues with an EMT.  Their point of
     contention:  a small FORM lying on a stretcher.

                          JEREMY
                Take it out back and throw it in the
                friggin' dumpster!

                          EMT
                Not unless somebody signs for it.

     Susan walks toward them, catches sight of the tiny form.

     Her eyes go wide.

                          SUSAN
                Oh, my God.

     Jeremy notices her.

                          JEREMY
                Hey, you can't...

                          SUSAN
                What's your name?

                Did you hear me?  Get Dr. Raymond!
                NOW!!

     Jeremy hesitates.  But if her tone wasn't enough, the
     stare she gives him certainly is.

                          JEREMY
                Okay.

     Jeremy backs away, takes off down the hall.

     Susan approaches the stretcher.

                     (To EMT)

                Washed up at the filtration plant on
                Bank street. Some asshole there
                thought it was a baby. They called
                us.

     Susan bends over it.  She covers her mouth and nose at
     the stench.

                          EMT
                It's a lobster, right?

     But it's not.  What lies on the stretcher before them
     looks more like a demon from a Brueghel painting.

     A THREE FOOT INSECT.  It's mephitic, pink-white body is
     rotten, falling apart.  The head's intact, with strange,
     large jaws thrown wide open. The chitin on one is half
     gone.

                Better hurry it up, Doc. My shift's

     Peter braces his legs and tries to push the whole bank of
     lockers clear--the locker section tips and falls with an
     ENORMOUS BANG, which echoes loudly off the tile walls. Dust
     flies everywhere.

     When the dust settles and flashlights are focussed on the
     area of the wall where the lockers stood, we see a LARGE

     wiring, elaborate debris kitchens. The walls are completely
     taken by layer after layer of hand carved initials and

     elaborate quotations from the bible.

     picks up Chuy's last wire figure-

     Another human-looking figure, long and thin, but with
     something slightly off about it.

     It has six limbs instead of four!

     Susan arrives at the stairs leading down to the subway
     station. A COUPLE passes her on their way up.

     A sign over the entrance says "STATION WILL CLOSE FOR REPAIRS
     AT 3 PM - TOKENS ONLY". Susan looks around- the area is semi-
     deserted, a bit creepy.

     She takes a deep breath, descends.

     INT. SUBWAY - DAY

     Susan pushes through the turnstile, enters the long corridors
     of gleaming tile, a somewhat de-humanizing atmosphere,
     straight out of a George Tooker painting.

     Very creepy.  Susan's footsteps ECHO in the empty tunnel.
     She sneaks a nervous glance over her shoulder- nobody is
     following her-

     PLATFORM "A" DELANCEY

     Susan observes the locker room door impatiently. A small crew
     of REPAIRMEN are dismantling a row of fluorescent lights.

     She sits and waits.

     INT. DEEP IN TUNNEL

     Peter, Josh and Leonard walk through a darker area. The
     floor beneath them suddenly changes, becomes tile.

                     (Sniffing)
                Smells like acid.

     Peter stops, looks around.

                          PETER
                Ammonia.

     Josh walks to the right, where the smell seems to emanate
     from.  At last they come to

     INT. VAULTED AREA - CONTINUOUS

     Josh LIGHTS a flare, sets it on the ground, walks ahead.  The
     ominous RUMBLE of a subway is heard in the distance.

     A cracked WATER MAIN above.  Water dribbles to the ground.

                          JOSH
                Peter...

                          PETER
                Yeah...?

                          JOSH
                There's some weird shit here.

                          PETER
                Weird shit...?

                          JOSH
                Take a look.

     Leonard shines his flashlight ahead.

     Revealed, quite literally, is a world of shit.

     LARGE FECES scattered everywhere:  on the floor, hanging
     sausage-like from the ceiling.  One can almost taste the
     stench of old ammonia.

     Peter puts on a rubber glove, inspects one of the fecal
     stalactites.

                          JOSH
                Fecal matter, unknown origin: weird
                shit.
                     (Beat)
                Whatever it is, it's not human.

     Josh breaks off a sample, drops it in a jar with a hard
     THUNK.  Leonard turns away in distaste.

                          LEONARD
                And it needs some metamucil.

     EXT. FLOPHOUSE - NIGHT

     It's raining like hell. Manny approaches the abandoned
     flophouse.

     He peeks through the boarded-up front entrance. Right there,
     on the dusty lobby floor, clearer than the larger
     shoeprints...

     ...he discovers a trail of tiny, barefoot prints.

                          MANNY
                Chuy...

     He kicks experimentally at the planks, but they're far too
     strong.

     ALLEY

     Manny explores the opposite face of the building, looking for
     a way in.

     A DOG is BARKING incessantly. Manny turns.

     Something moves in the shadows!  Something long and thin,
     haloed  by the rain.

     It moves again, the streetlight touching it for a fleeting
     moment as it totters around to the rear of the building.
     It's The Overcoat Man!

     The man hurries past. Manny sprints after him.

     ALLEYS

     Manny comes running around a pile of grocery crates.

     There is the OVERCOAT MAN.

     CARGO WORKERS mill around a group of vegetable trucks,
     unloading produce.

     The OVERCOAT MAN attracts no attention. Keeping his head
     down, staying near the shadowed buildings. Jumping and
     hopping, he skitters into an alley.

     FOLLOWING

     Manny has to trot to keep up with the mysterious figure. He
     pauses to take a pill and place it under his tongue.
     Once it takes effect he moves on.

     The OVERCOAT MAN has moved past a chainlink fence. How??
     It's too high!!!

     The old man squeezes through a jagged opening. The metal
     fabric cuts his shirt.

     On the other side: a dead end. Nowhere to go except
     for...

     A SEWAGE GRATE

     Manny lifts it.

     SEWAGE PIPE

     Manny lands on his feet with considerable difficulty. He
     flicks his lighter flame and opens the straight razor.

     This pipe is carpeted with trash and a thick crust of dirt.
     Something moves under a wet newspaper: a thick mass of long-
     legged spiders dissolve onto the walls and floor.

     Suddenly...the distant sound of spoons playing.

                          MANNY
                Chuy...

     Manny pulls a rosary from his pocket, wraps it around
     his wrist and crosses himself with the razor...

     ...then begins to move down the pipe.

     Susan examines the Polaroids.  She pulls out a payday bar.

     The crew of repairmen are leaving.

                          REPAIRMAN
                Hey, Lady, all power will be down in
                five minutes, okay?

                          SUSAN
                Okay....

     She munches on the bar. She stops: one snapshot has caught
     her attention.  The fridge light illuminated this photograph.

     Susan turns it around... and around... Trying to find
     something different in the lines.

     A train roars by.

     Then she notices it:

     THE POLAROID

     The closed jaws. They look like A HUMAN FACE.

     SUSAN

     Gets up nervously and heads for the dor to the locker room.

     A whole row of lamps goes off. The rest flickers in and
     out.

     Then we see, now standing on her platform: THE OVERCOAT MAN!!
     He looks at her between a row of columns under the dead neon
     lights.

     Susan tries the locker room door. It's unlocked.

     INT. LOCKER ROOM - SUSAN

     carefully crosses the floor to the bank of lockers.

     She kneels to examine the hole in the wall.  She nears a
     noise.

     THE OVERCOAT MAN is moving toward her.

                          SUSAN
                Peter?

     OVERCOAT MAN

     The man's face TIPS BACK...

     ...raising the complex, glittering INSECT HEAD FROM BEHIND
     ITS MASK-LIKE FRONT JAWS.

     Its multi-parted MOUTH clicks OPEN.

     Susan SCREAMS!

     The thing charges, its "coat" opening to reveal...SIX
     LEATHERY WINGS, fully extended! The wingspan blocks the
     whole tunnel, they vibrate rapidly.

     Susan tries to run, but the creature -- hereafter known
     simply as "The Mimic" -- LEAPS ONTO HER CHEST!

     She's dragged screaming into the hole.

     Their silhouettes recede rapidly amidst a confusion of legs,
     wings and pipes.

     INT. VAULTED AREA

     Peter and Josh put the fecal samples into the back-pack.

     Leonard stands at the other end of the area. He inspects some
     OLD SCAFFOLDING set up at an opening which leads to

     THE REMAINS OF AN OLD STATION

     fifteen feet below.

                          LEONARD
                I've never been this deep. This area
                here is the Old Armory station. They
                built it in the 40's. Ran out of money
                half-way through...

     It's like Grand Central's dead little brother. Tiled mosaic
     walls, columns, monumental arches. Spaces for shops. A group
     of abandoned turn-of-the-century subway cars on parallel
     tracks.

                          LEONARD
                Okay, the fat lady's singing. Time to go.

     Everything is gray with dust.

                          PETER (O.S.)
                     (To Josh)
                I want a team in here by six tonight,
                hands and knees with toothpicks...

     Leonard squints down at the planks of the scaffolding.

     A NYMPH -- big as the one seen earlier -- emerges from a pile
     of nearby feces as if it were part of the mound.

     Keeping his eyes fixed on the insect, Leonard coolly bends
     down, picks up a ROCK.

     PETER

     putting the last sample boxes into the back-pack, looks up
     and sees

     LEONARD

     step onto the scaffolding, raising the rock to crush the
     nymph.

                          PETER
                Don't!!

     SMASH! Leonard tosses the rock at the insect, crushing it.

     Peter rushes to the insect's corpse on the scaffolding.

                          LEONARD
                Did you see the size of that thing?!

                          PETER
                Look what you did! You stupid sonofa-

     A CREAK from the scaffolding at their combined weight.

     Leonard grabs Peter, tries to pull him from the scaffolding.

     CREEEEAAAAAK!

     THE ENTIRE SCAFFOLDING GIVES WAY!

     Buckling diagonally...

     ...taking Peter and Leonard with it...

     CRASH!  Both Peter and Leonard are thrown to the ground of
     the station below.  The scaffolding falls around them.

     JOSH

     rushes forward.

                          JOSH
                Peter!

     PETER AND LEONARD

     stir in the wreckage.  Peter rises shakily.  He puts his
     glasses on. One of the lenses is badly smashed.

                          PETER
                It's okay.  I'm all right.

     He tries to help Leonard up; Leonard knocks his hand away.

                          LEONARD
                Get the hell away from me!

     Peter looks up at Josh.

                          PETER
                     (Deadpan)
                He's all right, too.

     Leonard brushes himself off, checks out his walkie-talkie.
     It's been broken in the fall, a tangle of plastic and wires.
     He curses under his breath.

     Peter checks the wall for a handhold.  But there's only
     smooth tile and dust.

                          LEONARD
                Oh, that's gonna work.

                          PETER
                You got a better way up?

     Leonard removes his badge, tosses it up to Josh.

                          LEONARD
                     (To Josh.)
                Show that to the station manager.  Tell
                him Leonard's gonna have his bubble-butt
                he don't have someone down here in ten.

                          JOSH
                H-how do I get...?

                          LEONARD
                Way we came.  Take the first tunnel to
                your right...

     Leonard's voice echoes off the cavernous walls. Josh
     hurriedly writes it down in his notebook.

                          LEONARD (OS)
                Go left.  Go left again till you hit the
                fork... Then right again. You got that?

                          JOSH
                I think so. One right, two lefts...

                          LEONARD
                And a right.

                          JOSH
                Right.

                          PETER
                Go Josh. Now.

     Josh obeys.

     INT. NICHE

     We hear a persistent BEEPING...

     A concrete ROOM filled with glimmering debris. Cans,
     eyeglasses, fake teeth, chrome, foil, glass shards, broken
     watches.

     Susan lies unconscious, half-sunk in a mulch of decomposing
     food, old newspapers, plastic garbage bags.  An inch of brown
     WATER burbles past her bloody head.

     SOMETHING jostles her, rocking her back and forth.

     Her eyelids slowly open.

     A HUGE MIMIC IS PERCHED ON HER BODY!

     Its WINGCASE is drooped around her like a shroud. The
     creature furiously tears at her jacket, trying to get at
     Susan's beeper.

     The beeper spills from her pocket along with several Pay Day
     bars.  The Mimic CRUSHES the machine instantly, then chomps
     up all the candy bars with a single move of its mandibles.

     Susan watches in terror as the creature steps away.

     A SOUND from an adjacent tunnel.  Susan looks...

     ...and sees ANOTHER MIMIC pulling the REMAINS OF A MAN into
     the darkness.

     Susan gropes around her in the soggy debris, looking for some
     weapon.

     SUSAN'S HAND

     Her fingers close around a three-foot piece of RUSTY PIPE.

     Something dark drips on her hand.

     SUSAN

     looks up. Above her, a badly decomposing HUMAN FOOT, or what
     is left of it.  All part of the excarnated corpse of the
     Chinese Preacher.  His gold cross shines boldly in the dark.

     Susan GASPS.

     THE MIMIC

     hears the sound.  It immediately SKITTERS back to her.

     SUSAN

     jerks herself sideways...

     AND STABS THE PIPE into the Mimic's thorax with a wet CRRK!

     Susan heaves herself up, pushing the thing onto its back.

     The Mimic BUZZES furiously, milky WHITE FOAM pumping from the
     wound.  Its legs slash the air as it tries to right itself.

     Susan runs for the tunnels, debris falling from her clothing.

     Susan staggers through a dark PASSAGEWAY.  Water drizzles

     Rain leaks from an overhead grate three stories up.  She can
     see the SHOES of PEOPLE walking to and fro above.

                HELP!!!

     EXT. STREET ABOVE - NIGHT

     Life as usual on Delancey street.

     Pedestrians crisscross the metal grate, hunched under their
     umbrellas.  Traffic noise, T.V. displays on street front
     stores, boom boxes, car horns...

     They drown out the tiny sound of Susan's voice...

     SUSAN

     hears distant FEET SCURRYING toward her, punctuated by a
     metallic CLANG!  CLANG!  CLANG!

     SIDE TUNNEL

     CLANG!  The metal pipe, still imbedded in the Mimic, BANGS
     the wall as the insect moves down the dripping narrow tunnel.

     SUSAN

     looks around frantically.  She crosses to a METAL LID on the
     floor, lifts it.

     A HOLE is below, dropping off into darkness.

     The Mimic's CLANGING grows louder.

     Susan sits herself on the edge of the hole, grasping the
     metal lid by handles on its underside.

     The Mimic rushes into the chamber, speeding toward her...

     Susan JUMPS into the hole, hanging onto the lid...

     WHANG!  The lid SLAMS SHUT over the hole a fraction of a
     second before the creature reaches it.

     The Mimic touches the lid with its antennae, confused.

     below, crisscrossed with a FOREST OF PIPES AND DUCTS.

     The nearest pipe above her is well beyond reach.

     She is trapped.

     Then she hears the SOUND of the LID OPENING above.  She holds
     her breath.

     A faint YELLOW LIGHT of a lighter flickers down at her.

     WET SECTION

     Josh cautiously enters a vaulted area.  Old pipes have been
     ripped from the walls.  WATER gushes over the steel-plated
     walls.  He looks around- this doesn't seem familiar.

     Josh freezes as he sees something behind a loose metal PLATE
     on the wall.

     He yanks at the plate- it gives a little bit. He yanks
     harder- the plate falls down on one side, hanging
     precariously from a loose bolt.

     It reveals A HOLE PACKED WITH DOZENS AND DOZENS OF OOTHECAS.

     He leans close to examine them- there is a NOISE in the
     tunnel behind him-

     JOSH'S POV - WATERFALL

     A curtain of WATER falls over the side of a pipe onto the
     floor.  Behind it, something ENORMOUS crawls into view.
     Multiple legs, antennae, an elongated body distorted by the
     water and the light of a flare.  It stops-

     JOSH

     Holding his breath and tiptoeing sideways, never taking his
     eyes off the thing, Josh begins to move away.  He sees a
     narrow OPENING in the wall- there seems to be dim LIGHT
     coming from something beyond it.  He tries to squeeze through
     the opening-

     MIMIC

     The creature is immobile behind the sheet of water, as if
     mesmerized by its flow-

     PIT - JOSH

     With tremendous effort, Josh passes through the opening.

     He finds himself inside a bowl-shaped mud hole.  Scattered
     around him he sees FUNNY BUNNY PATCHES that were sewn in the
     sweatshop.  He trips on a half-buried SEWING MACHINE.  He
     looks up-

     Above him is a grate.  He's come to the SHOWER ROOM of the
     sweatshop!

     INT. SWEATSHOP SHOWER ROOM

     Empty now, except for the rusting sewing machines in a
     corner.  We TILT to see Josh moving the grate away.  He
     jumps- no way he can grab onto the slippery tile-

     HIS HANDS SLIDE!!

     PIT

     Josh puts the old sewing machine upright.

     OUTSIDE

     Suddenly, the bolt hinging the plate gives way and... the
     steel plate hits the ground: KLANGG!!

     THE MIMIC

     leaps into action!

     PIT - JOSH

     hears the CLICKING, fairly close.  He shines his light back
     down the hole he entered through-

     JOSH'S POV - THE MIMIC

     moves past the waterfall and takes the wall at full speed.

     JOSH

                          JOSH
                Oh shit, oh shit, oh shit!

     He stands on top of the sewing machine, wobbling, reaches for
     the floor above-

     SWEATSHOP SHOWER ROOM

     Josh's head and one shoulder are in through the hole.  His
     arms tremble. He makes a desperate lunge and manages to grab
     the POWER CORD of one of the abandoned sewing machines.

     THE MIMIC

     rushes through the opening without even slowing down.

     JOSH

     pulls himself up, up-  WHAM!  The Mimic hits the lower part
     of his body, BLOOD spraying up through the hole.  He SCREAMS,
     grasps the cord with both hands!

     He is brutally YANKED down into the hole, the sewing machine
     tipping, then dragged across the tiled floor till it wedges
     violently in the hole!

     We track over to reveal, one of Chuy's perfectly
     executed WIRE SCULPTURES. Sitting atop another sewing
     machine.

     Cracked MANNEQUIN FACES stares out from an unopened TAILOR
     SHOP.  A FLOWER PARLOR decorated with cobwebs.  A yellowed

                Well...there's an old service elevator
                half a mile down the tracks.  Ain't gonna
                be much use, though.  Lines are dead.

     Peter shines his flare up at a thick cord of cables which HUM
     ominously with electricity.

                          PETER
                You said those cables're still live.
                Can't we rewire...?

                          LEONARD
                Oh, man, there you go again.

                          PETER
                What?

                          LEONARD
                Those things bring juice to the new
                stations.  You just can't rewire that
                shit...

     Peter approaches him.

                          PETER
                For Chrissakes, what's the problem?
                You need a memo every time you fart?

                          LEONARD
                All right, motherfucker, that's it.

     He pushes Peter violently. Their eyes lock and meet.
     Inches away from a fistfight.

                          PETER
                Shh! Shh!

     A SOUND rushing towards them, its echoes increasing by the
     second.

     Where is it coming from?

     Peter looks at Leonard.  Leonard unbuttons his holster clip,
     places his hand on his .22

     A SHADOW appears outside the archway.

     It steps onto the platform.

     Leonard frowns.

                          LEONARD
                     (tentative)
                Manny?!

     The old man stumbles out of the darkness, out of breath. A
     rusted crowbar in his hand.

     Leonard walks over to him solicitously.

                          LEONARD
                My God, what the hell are you...?

                          MANNY
                Hurry, the woman needs help!

     A shadow crosses Peter's face.

                          PETER
                Woman?

                                                            CUT TO:

     INT. PIPE GALLERY

     OUTSTRETCHED HANDS in the darkness.

     REVEAL Peter leaning across the void with one hand while
     Manny and Leonard grip his other.

     Susan below, balancing precariously on the crisscrossing
     pipes. A mess, but still alive.  She reaches up to Peter.

     It's too far.

                          SUSAN
                     (A whisper)
                Don't.

                          PETER
                Listen to me:  we're getting you out.

     Leonard and Manny pull Peter back into

     INT. TUNNELS

     Peter undoes his belt.

                          PETER
                     (To Manny and Leonard)
                Give me your belts.

     They obey. Peter buckles them together with his. He then
     loops one end around a bannister, the other around his wrist.

                          LEONARD
                     (to Manny, as he ties them
                     together)
                What are you doing down here?

                          MANNY
                Chuy. He was taken. He's down here
                somewhere...
                     (to Peter)
                Oh, please, hurry. I saw what was
                after her.

                          PETER
                What's...?

                          MANNY
                Just hurry.

     Peter takes his word for it.  He uses the belts to lower
     himself to the nearest pipe.

     Leonard LIGHTS a flare to illuminate the pipe gallery.

     Peter works his way down. The web of pipes seem to recede
     into Hades.

     The lifeline tightens.

     Peter gets to the last solid footing, lies down on his
     stomach and lets the belts down.

                          PETER
                I'm coming, Sus, I'm coming.

     But then, he sees something move below her. Then a hollow
     CLANG! CLANG! CLANG!

                          SUSAN
                No, Jesus, no.

                          PETER
                     (To Leonard)
                Toss the flare down!

                          LEONARD
                I only got...

                          PETER
                Just do it!

     Leonard lets the flare drop from his hand.

     It falls past them, ricocheting off the maze of pipes,
     spinning down to the pitch-black below.

     And for a split second the flame illuminates...

     THE MIMIC

     pipe in its thorax, nimbly CLIMBING THE PIPES TOWARD SUSAN
     CLANG! CLANG! CLANG!

     PETER'S

     eyes grow huge.

                          PETER
                Oh, Jesus...

     LEONARD

     just plain loses it.

                          LEONARD
                What the fuck is that?! What the fuck is
                that?!

     SUSAN

     knows all too well what's coming for her.

                          SUSAN
                     (A desperate appeal)
                Peter...

     Throwing caution to the wind, Peter reaches the belt down.

                          PETER
                Wrap it around your hand!

     Susan at last gets a grip.  Peter pulls with both arms.

     CLANG! CLANG! CLANG! Getting closer.

                          PETER
                Come on!

     Susan struggles for footholds on the slippery pipes,
     ascending foot by foot...

     Peter pulls her into his arms.

     CLANG! CLANG! CLANG!

     Peter bends down.

                          PETER
                Get on my shoulders!

     Susan steps onto his shoulders.  He pushes her up...

     And Leonard and Manny yank her out.

     CLANG! CLANG! CLANG!

     Peter scrambles up, SLAMS the lid back on the hole.

                          PETER
                Let's go!

     The four of them run.

     HOLD ON the lid.

     WHAM! It bursts from the floor, rolls away like a coin.

     INT. ABANDONED PLATFORM

     The four humans run down the empty platform.  Peter spares a
     look back.

                          PETER
                Oh, shit...

     Far down the tunnel,

     THE MIMIC HAS SPREAD ITS WINGS AND IS FLYING AFTER THEM!!

                          MANNY
                There!

     He points to the open DOOR of an ancient SUBWAY CAR.

     They sprint for the car, get to the door.  Manny, Peter,
     Leonard, then Susan...

     INT. SUBWAY REPAIR CAR

     ...tumble inside a repair car crammed with shelves and empty
     crates.

                          LEONARD
                Get the goddam door!

     Leonard and Peter both grab its handle, slide it shut...

     SPLACK!  The Mimic crashes into it!

     KLANGGG!  The door bulges out from the impact, almost
     tearing itself off the hinges.

     Susan jumps back.  Manny runs to cover her.

     The creature is caught, half in, half out, antennae and
     forelegs waving wildly!

     The abdomen CRASHES through a pane of glass.

                          PETER
                Push it! Push it! Don't let up!

     Leonard and Peter push harder, barely keeping it pinned.

     THE UPPER HALF OF THE MIMIC TEARS ITSELF LOOSE.

     WHITE BLOOD SPATTERS everywhere. The Mimic is NOW CUT IN
     HALF!

     The wings flap wildly, the abdomen shatters the safety
     window's outer panels.

     But the FRONT SECTION IS STILL ALIVE.  It scrabbles in,
     spraying white blood...

     ...drags itself up on the ceiling, then down onto the floor
     and under a row of shelves in a half-circle around the car
     till it finally comes to a halt.

     Silence.  The only sound is a SKITTERING outside.

     Susan looks outside the window.

     The Mimic's REAR HALF IS STILL TRYING TO PUSH THROUGH THE
     DOOR, its feet blindly dragging along.

     LEONARD

                          LEONARD
                What the fuck was that?

     Peter says nothing. Leonard grabs him by the shirt.

                          LEONARD
                You better tell me what the hell's
                going on here!

                          MANNY
                Hey, hey!! Take it easy!!

                          PETER
                     (to Leonard)
                We don't know!! We don't know what it
                is!

     Leonard releases Peter and, cocking his gun moves closer
     to the still thing.

                          PETER
                Wait a minute-

                          LEONARD
                Fuck you, wait a minute. I'm
                going to-

     SNAP!  The Mimic POUNCES on him, catching his leg in its
     front mandibles.

     A sickening CRUNCH as the Mimic's mouth begins to work the
     leg like a grinder-blender.

                          LEONARD
                GET IT!  GET IT OFF ME!

     Peter and Manny try to pull the thing off as Leonard falls
     and writhes on the floor.

     BAM! BAM! BAM! The men flinch away as Leonard empties his
     guns on it, until the thing's shell finally CRACKS!

     But the thing is still locked onto Leonard's leg.  Peter
     tries to work it free from the creature's jaws. No good.

                          PETER
                Its muscles are locked.

                          LEONARD
                     (Hoarse)
                Oh, Jesus!!

                          MANNY
                Wait...

     Manny removes a can of shoe polish from his coat, then starts
     smearing the stuff onto the Mimic's head and jaws.

                          LEONARD
                Oh, Jesus! It's hitting the bone man, get
                it off!!

     He lights a CIGARETTE LIGHTER, goes to touch the flame to the
     flammable stuff.

                          PETER
                     (Stopping him.)
                Hey hey hey...

                          MANNY
                Is how we make loose the ticks back home.

     Peter hesitates, but lets him go.  Manny lights the polish.

     WHOOSH...the Mimic's head is engulfed in a halo of flame. THE
     LEGS LOOSEN THEIR GRIP.

     Peter and Manny yank it free from Leonard, who's PASSED OUT
     from the pain.  His leg is torn and bloody.

                                                            CUT TO:

     INT. SUBWAY REPAIR CAR - LATER

     We now see the car is 50's vintage.  A POSTER of Mickey
     Mantle above an empty worktable.

     Peter sits before Susan.  She's trembling, understandably
     shaken from her previous experience.  BLOOD pours from a CUT
     on her forehead.

     Peter takes a bit of torn cloth, puts it to the wound, then
     tenderly raises her hand to keep the bandage in place.

                          PETER
                Just keep holding it.  Can you do that
                for me?
                     (No reponse.)
                Susan?

     Susan nods silently.  Her hand weakly presses the compress.

                          MANNY (OS)
                Doctor Tyler?

     He turns to Manny, who sits solicitously next to Leonard.
     His wound is wrapped with makeshift bandages. He begins to
     stir.

     Peter gets up, but Susan's hand is closed tightly around his,
     like the jaws of the Mimic.  He kisses her gently, then
     slowly manages to release his hand.

     He walks to Leonard, inspects his wound. Touches the sole of
     his foot.

                          PETER
                You feel anything?

                          LEONARD
                Yeah, I feel like ripping your
                fucking eyes out...

                          PETER
                Leonard, listen.  I need to see if
                there's any nerve damage before we
                carry you back.
                     (No response.)
                Look, I'm trying to help you here...

                          LEONARD
                Oh, you helped me here, all right, white
                boy.  You and your goddam memo. You
                needed to prove your point, uh?

                          PETER
                I'm sorry.  But I don't think letting you
                bleed to death is the best apology.

     Peter touches his foot again. Leonard finally nods.

     Manny gazes at the Mimic carcass at the end of the car.

                          MANNY
                Where the hell'd that thing come from?

     Peter looks at Susan.  She remains silent.

                          PETER
                     (Quietly)
                A mistake.

                          LEONARD
                "Mistake"?  What's that supposed to...?

                          PETER
                It doesn't matter, all right?  It's dead.

                          LEONARD
                How you know that?  Shit, it was runnin'
                around with its buttside gone and a
                fucking pipe through its heart...

                          SUSAN
                     (Quietly)
                It doesn't have a heart.

     Peter looks up at her.

                          SUSAN
                Just inner chambers...

                          MANNY
                But it look like a man. It... I saw it.

                          SUSAN
                No...

     She gets up, finally moving.

                          SUSAN
                That's what it wanted you to see.

                                                            CUT TO:

     OUTSIDE CAR

     The subway car sits at the end of the platform, windows dimly
     glowing in the dark. The door opens, and Manny and Peter
     snatch the lower half and wing pieces back into the car.

     INSIDE CAR - A LITTLE LATER

     The lower half of the insect has been moved into the car.
     Susan is reassembling it.

                          PETER
                So, you're saying this is like those bugs
                that -- that look like twigs or leaves
                or...

                          SUSAN
                     (shakes her head)
                That's camouflage...

     Susan displays the partly-charred head.

                          SUSAN
                This is mimicry. They evolve to mimic
                their predators. A butterfly can look
                like the eyes of an owl.  A catterpillar
                can copy a snake...

     Susan closes the multiple mouth parts into a self-contained
     bud shape, then pushes back the "face" mandibles.

                          SUSAN
                This has evolved to mimic the most
                dangerous predator it's ever had...

     She holds it in her hand, like Yorick's skull. The mimic's
     head obscenely mirrors her own. She inserts it into the
     shoulder cavity.

     She stands back.

                          SUSAN
                Us.

     CAMERA cranes up and reveals that the thing now looks like
     THE OVERCOAT MAN.

                          SUSAN
                Mantids can mimic. We gave the Judas
                that code...

                          MANNY
                     (quotes)
                "...and behold he will come that walks as
                a man, yet is not a man- ..."

                          SUSAN
                This, is our baby Peter. Yours and
                mine. Aren't you proud?

     OUTSIDE OF THE CAR - IN THE TUNNELS

     We see four shadows move fast, scuttling on the walls and
     ceiling...

     ...heading towards the car...

     INSIDE THE CAR

     A SUBWAY MAP on the wall.  Red, blue, and orange lines
     branching through the boroughs like veins.

                          SUSAN
                All these...they're like tunnels of an
                insect colony. Once these things hit a
                certain population density, they'll have
                to move out, form new colonies.

     The realization hits the others.

                          SUSAN
                We have to get help down here.  Burn
                the tunnels before...

     She's interrupted by a CLICKING from the tunnel ahead.

     It's answered by CLICKING from the tunnel behind.

                          LEONARD
                Get the doors!

     A brief glimpse down the car shows too many OTHER DOORS to
     close in time.

                          PETER
                Is there a switch?

                          LEONARD
                Third rail is dead.
                     (To Manny and Susan.)
                Get me up.  There must be a manual
                override in the booth.

     Manny and Susan help Leonard up.

                          SUSAN
                     (Whispering to Peter)
                The lights!

     Peter turns off the flashlights.

     Susan and Manny help Leonard to the car's CONTROL BOOTH.

     Peter looks

     OUTSIDE

     where the silhouette of a MIMIC moves to the rear of the car.

     CONTROL BOOTH

     Leonard opens a box on the side-wall marked MANUAL OVERRIDE.

     Inside, there is a large, HEXAGONAL SHAPED HOLE.

                          LEONARD
                     (Starts looking around)
                Where's the damn crank?!

     OUTSIDE

     The Mimic is only yards away.

     OTHER SHADOWS emerge from the distant dark.

     INSIDE

     Manny leaves Leonard and Susan to look for the lever crank.

     He runs to help Peter try and shut the doors manually.

     But it's useless.  Many of the doors won't budge.

                          PETER
                     (hissing a whisper)
                They're coming!

     OUTSIDE

     The shadows get nearer, their CLICKING louder...

     CONTROL BOOTH

     Susan looks under the dashboard, finds a HEXAGONAL SHAPED
     ROD.  The lever crank.

                          SUSAN
                I got it!

     Susan gives it to Leonard. He JAMS the rod into the hexagonal
     shaped hole.  Perfect fit.

     Leonard begins CRANKING the thing.  But it's rusty and
     slow...

                          SUSAN
                Hurry! Please!

     THROUGHOUT SUBWAY CAR

     The doors begin to swing shut very slowly.

     OUTSIDE - A MIMIC'S POV

     sees the moving doors, starts heading for them.

     CONTROL BOOTH

     Leonard can't crank fast enough.  Susan joins in, putting her
     hands over Leonard's.  Both spin the thing as fast as
     possible.

     SUBWAY CAR

     Peter and Manny each pulling on a door, trying to speed up
     the closing process.

     SHADOWS are seen approaching, now very close.

     CONTROL BOOTH

     Leonard and Susan put all their effort into turning the crank
     one more time...

                          LEONARD
                Come on, you son-of-a...

     SUBWAY CAR

     A SOFT CLICK as the doors SHUT IN UNISON.

     Silence.

     All four are stock still, like a submarine crew awaiting the
     blast of depth charges.  Their eyes dart to the

     WINDOWS

     caked with soot, irradiated by the distant glow of one of the
     red flares.

     THUCK! Something BUMPS against the door.

     A machine-gun patter of FOOTSTEPS on the roof.

     The car SHAKES.

     OUTSIDE

     The dark platform is alive with phantom shapes.

     INSIDE

     SCREEECH!! Something sharp is drawn along the car roof like a
     nail over a chalkboard.

     THUMP! THUMP!  Impacts on the sides...

     An obscene symphony of sounds as Mimics lay siege to the car.

     PETER

     A BUZZ OF WINGS catches his attention.  He turns.  His face
     is reflected in a security window.

     CRACK!  The window SPLINTERS, destroying Peter's reflection.

     ABOVE MANNY

     Claws SCRATCH the ceiling. It begins to dent.

     BELOW SUSAN AND LEONARD

     Large forms CLICKING underneath, looking for a way in.

     Susan stares at the floor, her eyes following the course of
     the clicking...

     ...which leads to Leonard's wounded, bloodstained leg.

                          SUSAN
                Oh, God.
                     (Looks at Leonard.)
                The blood...

     KLANGGG!  A Mimic leg PIERCES the ceiling above them!

     Susan pulls Leonard out of the way just in time as

     IN THE SUBWAY CAR

     KLANG!  KLANG! More legs break through the ceiling!

     SUSAN AND LEONARD

     emerge from the control booth, Leonard's arm over Susan's
     shoulder.

                          SUSAN
                His blood! It's driving them crazy! We
                have to mask the odor!

                          PETER
                How?!

     But there's not time enough to discuss possible solutions.

     Leonard pulls off his jacket. Susan begins wrapping it around
     his wound to mask it. Manny helps.

     Peter has upended one shelf, jamming it against a broken
     window as a barricade.

     Despite their efforts, the Mimics are not thrown off the
     scent.

                          PETER
                It's no use! They know we're in here!

                          SUSAN
                They don't know anything Peter, they
                just sense. They're hardwired!

                          PETER
                Right. Hardwired to eat anything that's
                not like them!

     The whole car is now shaking and buckling.

                          SUSAN
                Exac...

     She looks over at the severed Mimic corpse nearby.  A
     realization...

                          SUSAN
                     (To Manny)
                Give me your razor.

     Manny looks at her blankly. Susan just takes the blade.

     The whole car is now shaking and buckling.

     She runs to the Mimic's carcass.  For a moment, she
     hesitates.  But the pandemonium leaves her little choice.

     She SLICES into the Mimic's corpse with the razor...

                          PETER
                What are you doing?

     ...sticks her arm in all the way to the elbow...

     ...and pulls out two fat AMBER SACS the size of
     softballs.  She SLICES them open.

     Orange GOO leaks out, its stench overpowering.

                          LEONARD
                     (covers his nose)
                Shit!

     Peter looks up as Susan slides one of the sacs over to
     him.

                          SUSAN
                Rub it on the windows!

                          PETER
                What-

                          SUSAN
                Just do it!!

     Holding his breath, against the stench, he smears the
     crap on the windows, the doorframe...

     MANNY

     looks to the roof, listening.

     And remarkably, the SOUNDS of the Mimics START
     SUBSIDING.

     Susan comes over to Leonard, begins dabbing the goop on
     Leonard's wound.  Leonard makes a face at the stink.

                          LEONARD
                What are you putting that crap on me
                for?

                          SUSAN
                Scent glands.  Insects use 'em to
                identify themselves to each other.

     She smears the floor area behind Leonard. The activity winds
     down gradually, and finally comes almost to a halt.

                                                            CUT TO:

     SUBWAY CAR - LATER

     Leaning against the dirtied window, Manny creates a streak
     for every Mimic he sees.

     Peter, Leonard and Susan are hard at work. Leonard has
     created a small "model" of the station using pocket debris
     and the wall map.

                          LEONARD (O.S.)
                Okay. That's us.

     Manny's lighter represents the subway car.

                          LEONARD
                This track we're on? Goes down into
                the repair area.
                     (Makes an "X" further down)
                The elevator's over here. Leads up to
                the active tunnels.

     THUMP! An oily, soft abdomen brushes lazily up against
     the glass. Manny moves away.

                          PETER
                Can we get this car there?

                          LEONARD
                Someone'd have to go to the
                switchroom, pull the coupling lever,
                that'll send us left and to the
                elevator.

                          SUSAN
                But the power...

                          LEONARD
                Hell, I might be able to juice the whole
                area, if I can get to the power box. It's
                just a couple of cables...

                          MANNY
                Oh, how you gonna get there, Leonard?
                Hop?

                          PETER
                     (To Leonard)
                Just talk me through it. I can go with
                Manny.

                          LEONARD
                It would take a minute or so.
                     (beat)
                You won't last that long out there.

                          SUSAN
                Peter, you couldn't even fix our TV!

     Tense silence. He points at the glands on the floor.

                          PETER
                We'll cover ourselves with this. They
                can mimic us-  we Goddam mimic them!

                          SUSAN
                Peter-

                          PETER
                It worked before...

                          SUSAN
                     (an edge in her voice)
                The scent won't last...

                          PETER
                That's why we should do it now.

     Susan knows they have no other choice.

     LATER

     Susan is stuffing Leonard's old bloody bandages into the
     thorax of the dead Mimic.  She ties a flare to its center.

                          LEONARD
                It's just a regular old pump switch,
                okay? Right by the track signal
                board.

     Manny is spreading the mucus-like liquid of the gland-sac on
     himself and Peter as Leonard instructs them-

                          LEONARD
                The lights come up, you pull the
                switch.

                          MANNY
                I pull.

                          LEONARD
                You don't do that, we're on the wrong
                track.
                     (turns to Peter)
                You...

     The two men look into each other's eyes.

                          LEONARD
                You gonna finally get to fuck around
                with the wires.  Think you can
                handle it?

                          PETER
                Depends.  You got a memo?

     Leonard's hard feelings give way to an almost
     imperceptible smile.

     Using a ballpoint pen, he draws a schematic on the back
     of Peter's hand.

                          LEONARD
                All right then.  You gonna find two
                wires.  One's green.  The other's
                blue...

     SUSAN

     approaches Manny, who looks distractedly out the window.

                          MANNY
                He's out there. I heard him. How can
                he be? This things...

                          SUSAN
                Manny...

                          MANNY
                I didn't protect him, lady. He
                trusted me. And I didn't protect
                him... His father...I lost his father
                to the streets and now, Chuy...

                          SUSAN
                We'll find him. We'll be back and
                find him.

     Manny doesn't respond.

     READY TO GO

     Susan dabs at Peter's face with the last touches of the
     scent gland substance.  She doesn't meet his eyes as she
     speaks.

                          SUSAN
                You're going to have to keep it
                really slow.  Their eyes react to
                sudden movements.

     Peter barely nods, his nerves clearly on edge.  He
     instinctively goes to wipe his forehead.  Susan stops
     him.

                          SUSAN
                Don't touch it.  And for Godsakes,
                try not to sweat.  They can sense
                chemical changes...

                          PETER
                Try not to sweat?

     Leonard turns to Susan and Peter.

                          LEONARD
                Okay, people...

     Leonard's voice comes through like a clarion.

                          LEONARD (OS)
                ...are we ready for this?

     Susan has her hand on Peter's chest; Peter is taking deep
     breaths, trying to cool down his body to prevent sweat.  It's
     an odd parody of Lamaze exercise.

                          LEONARD
                Whatever you do, don't step on the
                third rail coming back. Six hundred
                volts'll blow your leg right off.

     A final breath.  He's about as calm as he's going to get.

     He looks at Susan a long moment. He takes her hand.

                          PETER
                I was just thinking how I could use a
                pair of pliers... and I remembered where
                they are...

                          SUSAN
                     (overlapping)
                That's it. That's it. Breathe easy.

     A sad, nervous smile appears on Peter's face.

                          PETER
                In the tool box under the kitchen
                counter...

     Susan kisses him softly on the lips.

     Manny approaches.  Show time.

     Susan steps away from Peter. She looks toward the control
     booth.

                          SUSAN
                Open it.

     LEONARD

     begins turning the lever crank slowly.

     SUBWAY DOORS

     gradually begin to open, and stop half way.

     The darkness outside is alive with CLICKING.

     PETER AND MANNY

     slowly move between the opening of the door and make their
     way to

     INT. PLATFORM

     They step onto the dusty concrete.  Come to a stop.

     SUSAN

     watches nervously for the reaction of the Mimics

     OUTSIDE

     LARGE SHADOWS pass far and near of Peter and Manny; but none
     of the Mimics seem to care about them one way or the other.

     Peter and Manny exchange looks: a moment of relief.  It's
     working.

     Peter slowly moves right along the track to the nearby POWER
     BOX.

     Manny goes left, starts to make a longer journey across the
     platform to the SWITCH ROOM.

     SUBWAY CAR

     Susan moves away from the door, goes over the Mimic carcass,
     filled with the bloody bandages.

     PLATFORM - BY THE TRACKS

     Peter makes his way to the edge of the platform, whispering
     to himself.

     He lowers himself slowly to the track.

     PLATFORM - NEAR THE SWITCHROOM

     Manny moves toward the door.  A large WINDOW OF DUSTY GLASS
     reflects his image...and the distant ones of the Mimics.

     BY THE TRACKS

     Peter gets to the track.  He turns

     And is met FACE TO FACE WITH A MIMIC!

     Its antennae move toward his head, curious.

     Its human-mask face plate clicks apart and together.

     Peter remains stock still.  He starts breathing deeply...

     SUBWAY CAR

     Leonard has now fully opened the doors.

     SUSAN

     pulls the tipcase of the FLARE tied to the dead Mimic's
     midsection.  FSST!  The flare SPARKS alive.

     The sudden light draws the attention of several Mimics
     outside.

     Susan pushes the carcass toward an open door at the front of
     the car...

     ...and with a HEAVE, throws it onto the front track.

     OUTSIDE

     The other Mimics take instant notice.

     BY PETER

     The Mimic before him suddenly turns.  In a flash of speed,
     it's gone, heading toward

     THE DEAD MIMIC

     stuffed with the bloody rage, the thing sends its fellow
     into a feeding frenzy.

     The other Mimics begin TEARING into it, ripping their brother
     to shreds in cannibalistic orgy.

     SUBWAY CAR

     Susan watches in disgust.

                          SUSAN
                Choke on it, motherfuckers.

     Leonard turns the lever crank again.  The doors begin to
     shut.

     PETER

     breathes a sigh of relief.

     He goes to the powerbox, opens it up.

     He shines his flashlight down on the back of his hand.
     The simple chart tells him what to wire:  BLUE WIRES TO
     THE GREEN WIRES.

                          PETER
                     (to himself)
                Green...Blue...

     He looks back up at the powerbox.  His face falls.

     All the wires are a GROSS BROWN, their colored plastic
     casings having long ago faded into goo.

     INT. SWITCHROOM

     Manny enters. The space is even more dusty than the rest of
     the station. Spiderwebs strung over old machinery.  White
     Doric PILLARS support the ceiling like skeletal bones.  1940s
     style LAMPS are built into their side.

     Manny looks around.  Off to the right, right next to the
     rusted track switch board, he heads for the COUPLING SWITCH.

     Once there, he rests and, through the murky windows, he
     waves back to LEONARD.

     He pulls out his pills box and takes a pill. But his hands
     are shaking, under enormous tension. Some of the pills
     scatter on the floor. He puts the box away and leans
     against the wall.

     A CLICKING nearby catches his attention, echoing from the
     entrance of ANOTHER ROOM.

     It is not the sound of the Mimics; but rather, of METAL.

     Spoons.

                          MANNY
                Chuy...?

     Manny follows the sound.

     BY THE TRACK

     Peter desperately tries to connect the wires the right way.
     He wipes off the brown gunk, tries to discern any semblance
     of color.

     He feels himself start to sweat.  He tries to relax.
     Breathes...

     INT. ROOM BEHIND SWITCHROOM

     The space is larger than the switchroom.  The walls and
     ceiling have an odd, shiny consistency.

     Manny heads in further, locates the levers and waits.

     Something pale and small emerges from the dark, a few feet
     away, a face that seems to float in the eerie half-light.

     A RUSTLING behind him.  Manny turns around.

                          MANNY
                     (Whispering)
                Nino...

     He swings the light onto Chuy, sitting on the floor before
     the remains of a RUSTY COLUMN.  That beautiful, emotionless
     smile on his pale face.

                          MANNY
                Chuy...

     BY THE POWERBOX

     Peter has made all the necessary connections.  He turns now
     to the fuse-section.

     A red throw-switch is there, and two big slots for fuses.

     One is still occupied.

     The other one empty.

                          PETER
                Dammit!

     CU - PETER'S FOREHEAD

     BEADS OF SWEAT begin to form.

     SUBWAY CAR

     Susan watches the Mimics at their feast.

     All of a sudden, they begin to stop, as if losing interest.

                          SUSAN
                     (horrified)
                The scent's fading...

     Susan steps back, looks around desperately for a flashlight.

                          LEONARD
                     (tense as hell)
                What's Manny doing? I can't see him
                anymore.

     ROOM BEHIND SWITCHROOM

                          MANNY
                Nino, please...

     Manny slaps his knees with both hands in a parental gesture
     of "come to me".

     In the darkness, something that looks like a PALM FROND
     floats gracefully down from the ceiling, making see-saw
     gestures as it falls through the air.

     Manny shines his flashlight on the floor.  It's not a palm
     frond.

     It's a wing.

     Manny turns his flashlight to the ceiling and walls.

     The place IS COVERED WITH MIMICS.  They are in the middle of
     a vicious mating ritual.  The males tear savagely at the
     females wings as they proceed to mount them.  A chaotic
     clusterfuck.

     Manny is sickened.

     CHUY GIGGLES. Manny shines his light ahead. Manny's face
     falls.

                          MANNY
                Dios mio...

     The WHITE PILLAR BEHIND CHUY IS MOVING...

     ...unfolding...

     ...at last revealing...

     AN ALBINO MIMIC!  Another leap for evolution...

     Its form is different from the other Mimics.  Sleeker, more
     supple, almost beautiful.  And while its movements are still
     not completely human, there is a kind of unearthly grace to
     them that at the very least entrance us.

     The thing raises itself to full height, dwarfing the tiny
     boy.  It stands over him like a king over his court fool.

     Chuy giggles happily.  It's all a game to him.

     The Albino CLICKS in response -- a long, leisurely sound, as
     if trying to communicate with the boy.

     Chuy pulls his spoons out and begins to play them, making a
     perfect imitation of the sound.

     Manny starts to tremble as the creature gazes upon him with
     huge, expressionless 'eyes'.  He turns to Chuy-

                          MANNY
                     (barely audible)
                Chuy...

                          CHUY
                     (whispers)
                Friends.

                          MANNY
                NO, NO, CHUY, NO...

                          CHUY
                Friends.

     The Albino CLICKS his jaws, moving in toward Manny.

     CHUY

     plays his SPOONS in perfect imitation.

     MANNY

     stands under an archway in a swirl of dust. He raises his
     arms, like a prophet. He lets go of hsi razor and kneels.

                          MANNY
                God has closed his eyes. This, he cannot
                see...

     His vacant eyes, fill with tears, he prays quietly, a strange
     serenity invades him.

     The Albino's jaws open and charge.

     PLATFORM

     Some Mimics advance toward Peter's direction.

     SUBWAY CAR

     Susan desperately waves a flashlight and bangs the window,
     trying to attract their attention.

                          SUSAN
                Over here! Over here! Goddam you!!

     BY THE TRACKS

     Peter BREAKS the arm off one of his glasses.  He jams it at
     the empty fuse.  It SPARKS.

     PLATFORM

     THUMP!  The electricity COMES ON...

     The lamps on the columns BURST INTO FLAMES from the power
     surge.  Fire illuminates the station like a Greek temple.

     BY THE TRACKS

     Peter climbs up onto the tracks...

     ...sweat staining his forehead...

     Peter wipes it and removes the scent coating.

     THE MIMICS

     clearly react, sensing the chemical change, like bees
     reacting to honey.

     SUBWAY CAR

                          SUSAN
                     (to Leonard)
                THE DOOR! OPEN THE FUCKING DOOR!

     LEONARD

     looks at the now lit control panels, tries to decide which
     button to press. He begins to press each one in turn.

     PETER

     hears the sound of spoons playing.

     He turns to see Chuy, standing by the outside of the switch
     room.  The boy smiles. A flashlight shines behind him.

                          PETER
                Manny...

     But the thing holding the flashlight is anything but human:
     The ALBINO steps into view, moving eerily like an unstrung
     puppet. His claws and jaws are coated in blood. Chuy joyfully
     announces the arrival like a little drummer boy.

     THE MIMICS

     climb over the roof, moving toward the rear of the-

     SUBWAY CAR - CONTROL BOOTH

     Susan runs in.  SLAMS her hand down on a button.

     FSST!

     THE SUBWAY CAR

     The doors open.

                          SUSAN
                Peter!!

     Peter hesitates, takes a step toward Chuy.

                          PETER
                Come on, kid...

     Chuy seeks shelter behind the Albino's legs.

                          PETER
                     (horrified)
                Jesus!

     The albino charges toward him.

                          SUSAN
                Run!! Peter!!

     Peter bolts for the car.

     THE MIMICS

     jump and land

     SUBWAY CAR

     just as Peter squeezes through one of the doors.

     BAM! THUD! The doors dent. Glass cracks.

                          SUSAN
                     (Yelling to Leonard)
                GO!!

     Susan presses the button. The doors close again.

                          LEONARD
                The kid...

                          PETER
                The kid's with them!!

                          LEONARD
                What do you-?

                          PETER
                Go!! Just go!!

     CONTROL BOOTH

     Leonard throws the dead man's switch by the control board.

     SUBWAY CAR

     JOLTS into action.

     OUTSIDE

     The train LURCHES forward.

     Wheels spark and kick into gear. The mimics scramble and re-
     assemble quickly, ready to attack.

     THE ALBINO

     changes position and charges towards the car.

     THE MOVING CAR

     reaches a "Y" section.  The car moves to the track to the
     right.

     INSIDE SUBWAY CAR

     Leonard's eyes go wide as he sees

                          LEONARD
                He didn't do it!

                          SUSAN
                What?

                          LEONARD
                Manny never threw the coupling switch!!
                We're goin' the wrong way!!!

     OUTSIDE CAR

     It keeps bearing right. Further away from their destination.

     ...towards an old STORAGE YARD in their path.  Idle cars and
     repair equipment on the tracks.

     A crash seems inevitable.

     INSIDE THE CAR

     Leonard pulls

     THE BRAKES

     but they don't work at all.

     From below the car we see the wheels spinning freely,
     heading for collision.

     INSIDE THE CAR

     Susan grabs Leonard from the control booth. To Peter

                          SUSAN
                MOVE BACK!!!

     They rush back against the opposite door.

     STORAGE YARD - SUBWAY CAR

     CRAAASHH!!  The car BASHES into a parked section of train in
     a GRIN of tearing metal...

     ...flips off the track...

     ...and onto its side...

     The car skids to a stop.  SPARKS fill the air.

     INSIDE SUBWAY CAR

     All three are hurt.  Leonard's leg wound has reopened. Peter
     has badly damaged his right arm.

                          SUSAN
                You all right?

     Peter nods painfully.  Susan to Leonard.

                          LEONARD
                     (Simply, re: his leg)
                Can't feel it.

     Peter and Susan sling Leonard's arms over their shoulders.
     They raise him up.

     OUTSIDE SUBWAY CAR

     They move unsteadily outside.

                          SUSAN
                Which way?

                          LEONARD
                Across both tracks!!

                          PETER
                Shit.

     They head off over a concrete island in the direction of the
     correct track.

     FURTHER BACK

     The Mimics and the Albino moving closer.

     PETER AND SUSAN

     try to hurry, but it's no use given Leonard's condition.

                          LEONARD
                     (Quietly)
                Lemme go.

     Peter and Susan both disregard the order.

                          SUSAN
                We're no leaving you!

                          LEONARD
                No way we can outrun 'em together.
                Move it!

     Leonard suddenly grabs his POLICE BATON from his belt
     clip.  He pushes the two away.

                          LEONARD
                NOW!! GO!! Get the hell off my beat!

     Leonard turns away from them.

     Peter goes to get Leonard, but Susan stops him.  This MTA
     officer is staying put.

                          LEONARD
                Come on.  Come to poppa.

     Reluctantly, the two begin down the tunnel.

     LEONARD

     takes a stand by the third rail, baton in hand.

     INT. SUBWAY TUNNEL - FURTHER DOWN

     Peter and Susan run.

                          SUSAN
                There.

     An open CAGE ELEVATOR on a platform nearby.  A sign overhead:
     AUTHORIZED PERSONNEL ONLY.

     They rush toward it.

     INT. SUBWAY TUNNELS - "Y" SECTION

     Leonard stands like a guardian to the tunnel mouth.

     SOUNDS of the Mimics approaching. He glances at the third
     rail beside him, then down the track.

                          LEONARD
                Come here, you mealy-mouthed...

     The sound gets louder.

                          LEONARD
                Multi-legged...

     Leonard raises his baton in top MTA form.

                          LEONARD
                Maggot-munchin' motherfu...

     THUD!  Several Mimcs slam onto Leonard!

     Leonard goes down, HITTING them futilely with his baton.

     They begin to tear at his limbs.

     Leonard rolls...

     ...kicks his good leg out...

     ...and CONNECTS WITH THE THIRD RAIL.

     AN ARC of ELECTRICITY lights up the darkness, consuming
     Leonard and the Mimics.

     INT. BY THE CAGE ELEVATOR

     The crackling sound echoes through to Peter and Susan.

     Susan hits the elevator button again.

                          SUSAN
                I can't tell if it's working!

     Peter has unbarred the gate.

     SUSAN

     looks up, into the shaft.

     THE ELEVATOR

     coming down, but it's taking its own sweet time.

                          SUSAN
                Oh, come on, come on!

                          PETER
                Jump in.

     Peter pulls her into the shaft, closes the security gate
     behind them.

     INT. SHAFT

     A skeletal framework on each side.  Just enough for a
     handhold.

     Peter steadies Susan as she climbs in beside him.  She
     balances on the narrow ledge.

     Peter SLAMS the cage door shut, latching it.

                          PETER
                You go first. I'll be right below you.

                          SUSAN
                Your arm, you can't...

                          PETER
                I can.  We can do this...

     He shows her the first hand and foothold.  Susan grabs on.

     INT. SUBWAY TUNNEL

     The Albino amkes its way forward, flanked by two Mimics.

     It stops.

     Turns toward the elevator.

     INT. SHAFT

     Susan hauls herself up the framework, handhold by
     handhold. Peter is right below her.

     She can see his arms are starting to tremble dangerously
     with the effort.

                          SUSAN
                We're gonna make it!

     Peter grinds his teeth, trying to make the next
     handhold.

     WHAM!  Something hits the gate below them!

     INT. BY THE ELEVATOR GATE

     The Mimics are tearing at the metal gate.

     The Albino remains still, watching them work.

     PETER AND SUSAN

     Susan's arm and legs are shaking now.  Her breath starts
     catching in her throat with the effort.

                          PETER
                Don't hold your breath!  Keep it going,
                even flow!

     Susan tried, but can't.  She tries to pull herself up to the
     next level.

                          PETER
                C'mon...

                          SUSAN
                Ah...

                          PETER
                Talk to me.

                          SUSAN
                Peter...

     Susan pulls herself up.

                          SUSUAN
                I'm really glad I'm not pregnant.

     REVERSE

     We look down past them as they climb.  Two of the Mimics and
     the Albino have gotten into the shaft!

     The Albino is so long it climbs by bracing its legs against
     opposite walls.

     SUSAN AND PETER

     Susan is crying, barely any strength left.

     Peter does his best to stay in control, but in truth is
     barely hanging on himself.

     LIGHT hits them from the shaft above now, SOUNDS of PEOPLE
     TALKING and a muffled P.A. ANNOUNCEMENT filter down.

     MIMICS

     rushing upward on the shaft wall, higher, higher.

     INT. ELEVATOR SHAFT

     Peter's hands grab onto the grating of the gate on the next
     floor.

     KCHUNK! is heard above them.  Peter looks up.

     Now the elevator is coming down.

                          PETER
                Hang onto me.

     Peter pulls Susan up till she can grab it too, both of them
     able to get a foothold on the ledge-

                          PETER
                Hang on tight!

     He begins to KICK on the gate, trying to tear it free.  Susan
     looks back down.

     SUSAN'S POV - SHAFT

     The Mimics rush up, closer, closer.  The Albino opens its
     mandibles.

     SUSAN AND PETER

     both KICK at the gate, it gives, Peter pulls Susan through
     to the

     INT. SUBWAY TRACK

                          PETER
                Come on!

     Peter and Susan stumble away.

     INT. ELEVATOR SHAFT

     The Albino sees the elevator approaching from above.

     It gives a few CLICKS to its minions.

     The two other Mimics race up the shaft...

     ...toward the elevator...

     ...and WEDGE THEMSELVES IN ON EITHER SIDE!

     They are CRUSHED instantly.  But the elevator is stopped just
     above the open gate.

     With just enough room for the Albino to get through to

     INT. SUBWAY TRACKS

     Susan and Peter run.  There is LIGHT just up the tunnel.  We
     hear VOICES.

                          SUSAN
                Don't look back!

     They go for it.  At last, they make it to

     INT. A PLATFORM

     Susan and Peter stumble forward.  Light streams down from
     overheads. Susan turns.

     SUSAN'S POV

     The Albino spills out onto the track behind them.

     Sleek, streamlined, light glancing beautifully off it.

     SUSAN AND PETER

     turn back...

     HEADLIGHTS hit them as we hear the ROAR of a SUBWAY TRAIN
     heading at them from the other side of the platform!

                          SUSAN
                No...

                          PETER
                We can do it!

     They run.

     ALBINO

     runs, faster than any other Mimic.

     TRAIN

     The express train BLOWS its HORN, RUSHING FORWARD.

     PLATFORM - COMMUTERS

     Weary late-night COMMUTERS stand half-asleep on the tracks.
     A sleepy-eyed little girl points, tugging on her mother's
     hand.

                          LITTLE GIRL
                Mommy, there's people...

     PETER AND SUSAN

                          PETER
                     (Adrenaline pumping)
                We-can-do-this!!!

     MOTORMAN

     The driver sees the battered couple...

     He reaches for the brake...

     SUSAN AND PETER

     They reach the edge of the platform, the HORN deafening as
     the train speeds toward them.  Peter pushes Susan up, leaps-

     INT. TRAIN - CONDUCTOR

     We RUSH toward his horrified face.

     THE ALBINO

     directly ahead.

     The train, still flying, PLOWS INTO IT...

     ...flattening, grinding, pulverizing...

     ...until the windshield of the subway car is covered in white
     blood.

     The motoran leans on the brake, his eyes screwed shut in
     primal horror. The train SQUEALS to a stop...

     ON THE PLATFORM

     Susan and Peter collapse on the cement floor in each others
     arms.  Heaving and weeping.

     INT. GRAND CENTRAL STATION - NIGHT

     COMMUTERS turn to stare as Peter and Susan move across
     the floor.  Both bruised and bloodied, leaning against
     each other, heading for the exit.

     Some DERELICTS observe them with curiosity.

     A trio of MTA cops start towards them.

                          PETER
                It'll be fine... it... They're still
                down there. We'll seal the whole
                system, go in with whatever it
                takes...

     But Peter's voice evidences a lack of conviction now,
     he's trying to convince both Susan and himself of
     something he doesn't fully believe.

                          PETER
                It'll be fine... We nailed them
                before, we'll do it again...

     He hurries to meet the MTA cops. Susan looks up.

     SUSAN'S POV

     Commuters move to and fro, moving up and down and in and
     out of the illuminated areas of the station.

     In the crush of onlookers is one deadpan face-  a MIMIC,
     hugging the shadows, waiting for its moment!

     We PAN 180 degrees to the other side of the platform-
     there, briefly glimpsed is ANOTHER, and ANOTHER.

     We TILT down to the throng below.

                          SUSAN
                     (barely audible)
                They've come up...

     The electrified VOICE of the train ANNOUNCER suddenly
     FADES UP, telling of departures and delays-

     We raise above Susan's head-

                          TRAIN ANNOUNCER
                The 11:16 local to Poughkeepsie,
                boarding now, Track 32- the 7:20
                Connecticut local, making
                connections to South Norwalk-

     DOWN ANGLE

     -culminating in an OVERHEAD VIEW of the main terminal.

     The movement continues. But from here, the people are
     dots, their importanec no greater than that of a colony
     of ants.

                                                          FADE OUT:

 "MINORITY REPORT" 
               -- Aug 15th 1997 rewrite by Jon Cohen


 DARKNESS 
               And then, slowly emerging from the mists of darkness, a pale,
               beautifully proportioned FACE.

               The oval face is female, a woman of indeterminate age, her
               features as fragile as porcelain.  Her eyes are closed in
               sleep, or in death ... or in something in between.

               Now TWO MORE FACES emerge out of the darkness.  They are
               male, and they float into position on either side of the
               female.  They are just as ethereally beautiful, just as pale,
               and like the female their eyes are closed.

               The ghostly lips of the female begin to twitch.  Her features,
               which have been expressionless, suddenly contort, mask-like,
               into the face of a woman in fear.  Her eyes open.

               The male face on her right contorts too.  His features warp
               into an angry snarl -- the mask of a man enraged.  His eyes
               open.

               The male face on her left takes on the expression of a young
               boy, a boy who is terribly frightened.  His eyes open wide.

               As if they are lost in the same terrible waking dream, a
               sudden and unnerving exchange begins ...

 FEMALE                               (frightened woman)
 JOHNNY, PLEASE MALE RIGHT                               (mocking man)
                         "Johnny, please.  Johnny please."

 FEMALE                          You're scaring me.

 MALE LEFT                               (child's voice)
 DADDY, DON'T. DADDY 
 MALE RIGHT                               (considering)
                         I don't like you any more, Carol.

 FEMALE                               (imploring)
                         Put the scissors down.  You're scaring
                         me.  Please.

 MALE RIGHT                          Oh, Carol.

 FEMALE                          Johnny!  Stop!

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 2. 

 MALE RIGHT                          Don't grab at me!  Let

 MALE LEFT                          Daddy!  No!

               All we see are three faces on the screen mouthing words but
               we can imagine a terrible struggle taking place before us: a
               man with scissors lunging at his wife, her anguished scream,
               the whimpering cries of their son.

               And then there is silence, and it is over, and the three
               faces instantly return to their impassive porcelain state.
               Their eyes slowly close.  They do not move.

               So that when they do move again, it is startling.  In abrupt
               unison, the EYES flash open.  Three pairs of eyes stare
               straight at us, accusing.

               Three mouths open, but speak, in rasping tones, as one.

 ALL THREE                          Murderer!

               The faces linger a moment, the weary eyes slowly close, and
               the dark reaches forth, and takes them.

 DISSOLVE TO: 
 EXT. SUBURBIA DAY 
               Morning in America.  Just look at it.  America in the
               midfifties, the suburban landscape stretching endlessly into
               the sun drenched distance.  White house upon white house.
               Emerald lawns, glistening with dew.

               In each driveway, a big Chevy, or a Ford, muscled with chrome,
               long tailfins that taper like the fins on rocket ships.

               Kids burst out of the houses, and zoom down sidewalks on
               trikes.  Mothers in bright dresses stand in doorways,
               watching.  The smiling mothers wave to one another, then go
               back into their houses.

               Dogs bark, birds sing in trees of just the right height,
               boys and girls laugh and ring the bells on their trikes.  It
               is a delicious world, where dogs and birds and children are
               safe.

 INT. A HOUSE 
               A family room with all the trappings of the era: a flagstone
               fireplace, a console TV, a man's leatherette Barca-Lounger,
               a pipe stand holding two pipes on a nearby table, boxes of
               children's games neatly stacked on a wall shelf.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 3. 

               A young mother, CAROL, her hair -in a pony-tail, stands at a
               picture window in a corner of the family room, staring mildly
               at the scene outside.

 CAROL'S POV - A LITTLE GIRL 
               A little girl bounces a red ball on the sidewalk.  The ball
               gets away from her, and rolls into the street.

               At the same moment, a two-toned CHEVY, lush and huge, rounds
               the corner.

               The girl sees the car coming, but still goes after the ball.

 THE FAMILY ROOM 
               Carol sees what is about to happen -- but she doesn't cry
               out, or bang on the window, or run for the front door.  She
               watches.  And smiles a little.

 OUTSIDE 
               The girl careens gleefully into the middle of the street.

 INSIDE THE CHEVY 
               The driver -- a man in a loose fitting dark green suit, white
               shirt, thin brown tie -- sits behind the steering wheel of
               the car.

               Disturbingly, the man's hands are not on the steering wheel.
               Not only that, he is holding the morning newspaper up in
               front of him, reading, oblivious to the scene before him.

               Through the windshield, we see the little girl in the road
               in front of him, going for her ball.

               CAROL Watches, her smile in place.

 OUTSIDE 
	       The little girl picks up her red ball, as the Chevy bears 
	       down on her.

 INSIDE THE CHEVY 
               An alarm suddenly CHIRPS.  The car automatically brakes to a
               halt.  The man looks around the edge of his paper to see
               what is happening.

 THE STREET 
               The car has stopped, inches from the girl.

               The girl giggles as, the man in the car gives her a big wink.
               She waves, then runs back to the sidewalk with her red ball.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 4. 

               The man goes back to his newspaper, and the car, entirely on
               its own, starts up again.  The car rounds a corner, and
               disappears.

 INSIDE THE HOUSE 
               Carol turns away from the window.  She startles when she
               sees her husband, JOHNNY, is there behind her.  He is in his
               pajamas.  How long has he been there, watching her?

 JOHNNY                               (gruff)
                         Why'd you let me sleep so long?

 CAROL                          It's Saturday, Johnny, you always --
                              (beat)
                         Why are you staring at me like that?

               He takes a step toward her.  He stands there, his thick black
               hair tousled with sleep, scratching his stubbled jaw,
               considering her.

 JOHNNY                          I'm unhappy that you let me sleep so
                         long.

               He takes another step toward her.  She doesn't move a muscle.
               A little BOY suddenly enters the room.  Johnny turns, looks
               at his son, looks back over his shoulder at his wife.  Then,
               without a word, he begins to walk out of the room.  On his
               way out, Johnny's eyes flick to Carol's sewing basket, which
               sits beside a sewing machine.  It is not the sewing that has
               caught his attention, but a large pair of garment SCISSORS
               which lie across a fold of colored cloth.

 EXT. THE HOUSE -- MOMENTS LATER 
               Johnny stands on the front porch, scratching.  He walks down
               his front walk, and bends over to pick up the newspaper.
               Carol stands in the doorway, watching him.

               A SHADOW slides over Johnny, cast from above.  The air fills
               with the piercing WHINE of an engine.  Johnny looks up,
               alarmed.

               In the sky above him, just beyond the tips of the suburban
               trees, is a black PRECRIME POLICE HOVERCRAFT.

               The children, the mothers, Carol in the doorway -- everyone
               freezes in place, as Johnny is cast into an inexplicable
               drama.

               Racing SOUNDLESSLY down the street toward him, are SLEEK
               TECHNOLOGICAL MARVELS, lethal and efficient looking -- they
               seem to be cars -- but they are so different from the fat
               Fords and Chevies in the driveways that it is hard for us to
               process them.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 5. 

               Helmeted police with mirrored visors erupt out of the cars.
               More police drop from the hovercraft in harnesses.  Their
               uniforms are black, seem actually to absorb light.  Their
               left hands are bare, their right hands are encased in some
               sort of complicated glove.

 CLOSE 
 ON - A GLOVE 
               The glove is a weapon of some kind, the elongated index finger
               ending in an open barrel.

               Clearly, this is not, as it first seemed, the past -- not
               America in the 1950's.  It is the neo-past, the retro world
               of America 2040, where the familiar of yesterday is
               intermeshed with hypertechnology.

               And all of that hypertechnology is focused on JOHNNY, as he
               makes a run for the house, sheets of newspaper scattering
               behind him.  He bursts up the front porch, shoving Carol out
               of the way.

               Eight Precrime police officers assemble in the yard. From a
               backpack, one of them quickly removes an instrument with a
               handle grip and an ovoid screen.  It is a holographic scanner.

               He activates it, scans the OFFICER in front of him, and an
               IDENTICAL POLICE OFFICER takes three-dimensional form.

               The two real officers circle the house, repeating the maneuver
               a dozen times.

               In less than a minute, a decoy force of men -- three
               dimensional, standing in place, but shifting and turning
               like living beings -- has been created.  An overwhelming
               police deterrent presence has been established.

 INSIDE THE HOUSE 
               The Precrime police overwhelm the interior of the house,
               too.  It is impossible to tell which officers are real, and
               which are scanned holographs.  The juxtaposition of the
               futuristic cops in a 1950's style house is disorienting.

 INSIDE A BEDROOM CLOSET 
               Johnny, in his pajamas, crouches beneath a rack full of his
               wife's dresses.

 UPSTAIRS HALLWAY 
               Two OFFICERS, standing back-to-back, hold their gloved hands
               out in front of them, palm out.  When the first officer points
               his palm toward a door at the end of the hallway, his glove
               BEEPS softly.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 6. 

               The officer looks at his PALM.  A red thermal IMAGE appears
               on a small flexible screen -- the heat outline of a crouching
               man.  The first officer flicks his helmeted head to the second
               officer.

 THE BEDROOM 
               The room is packed with police -- how many are real?

 THE CLOSET 
               Johnny squirms, his pajamas saturated with sweat.  He calls
               out through the door.

 JOHNNY                          I didn't do anything!

 OUTSIDE THE CLOSET 
               Every OFFICER in the room lifts his gloved hand and points
               his index barrel at the closet door.  The effect is deeply
               accusatory.

               An OFFICER speaks, his VOICE electronically manipulated to
               be as menacing as possible.

 OFFICER 1                          Come out of the closet on your hands
                         and knees.

               Nothing happens.  Two officers aim their barrels at the
               perimeter of the door.  In repeated, small SONIC BLASTS, the
               closet door is blown off of its frame, revealing Johnny among
               the dresses.

               Johnny starts to rise, and BAM, a section of floorboards is
               blasted away beneath his feet.

 OFFICER 1                          Hands and knees!

               Johnny trips among the splintered floorboards, and drops.
               He stays on his hands and knees, and approaches.  He lifts
               his head and looks up at the officer.

 JOHNNY                          I didn't... 

		Another OFFICER 2 bends down with a DEVICE -- the words
		"IdentiScan" on its side -- and blips a red laser light 
		into each of Johnny's, eyes, reading his irises.  The 
                officer nods affirmatively to the other officer.

 OFFICER 2 POSITIVE FOR JOHN PALMER. 
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 7. 

 OFFICER 1                               (to Johnny)
                         John Palmer, if you were being
                         arrested for any other crime, I would
                         now read you your rights.
                              (beat)
                         But you are under arrest for the
                         future murderer of your wife, Carol
                         Palmer.  You have no rights.

               Johnny, on his hands and knees, goes limp.

 EXT. THE HOUSE -- LATER 
               In the background, Johnny is guided into a Precrime police
               vehicle as the neighbors look on.  Carol and her son stand
               in the doorway, stunned.

               TWO OFFICERS remove their helmets.  The first man is tall,
               sandy-haired, good eyes, deeply blue; This is PAUL ANDERSON,
               late thirties, Director of the Precrime Division, Washington
 D.C. 
               The second man is ED WITWER, Anderson's second in command,
               late thirties, big like Anderson, good face, strong in the
               shoulders, short brown hair.

               The two men are deeply comfortable together.  They can speak,
               or not.  It doesn't matter -- they still communicate.  Two
               good cops, good together.

               They walk side-by-side around the house, dematerializing the
               holographic decoy cops.

 WITWER                          Thought we might a had a runner.

               Anderson seems tired, takes a moment to answer.

 ANDERSON                          Yeah, a runner.

 WITWER                          A little chase -- that'd been good.

 ANDERSON                          Fifty cops on the scene takes the
                         chase out of them.

 WITWER                               (smiles)
                         But only eight of us were real.

               Witwer dematerializes the last decoy.

 ANDERSON                          We ever get a runner, I'd be too old
                         to give chase.

 WITWER                          You'd chase.  You'd love it,.  Man.

               They get to the front of the house and watch the Precrime
               vehicle holding Johnny zoom SOUNDLESSLY away.

 ANDERSON                          I love it more Johnny boy doesn't
                         get to murder his wife.

 WITWER                               (beat)
                         It's a beautiful world.

 EXT. SAME SCENE -- LATER 
               The children play on their trikes.  The wives talk among
               themselves.  The birds sing, the dogs bark.

               The little girl bounces her red ball again.  She stops a.
               minute, when two pieces of newspaper blow past her,
               unexpectantly littering the orderly suburban landscape.

 INT. A BEDROOM - SUBURBAN VIRGINIA (OUTSIDE WASHINGTON) DAY 
               Decorated in a 1950's style.  Anderson lies in bed beside
               his wife, LISA, a pretty, green-eyed brunette.  It is early
               morning, they are both awake.  Her hand caresses his chest.
               Maybe they will make love.

               Lisa's hand stops suddenly on the center of Anderson's chest.

 LISA                          Jesus, Paul.  Your heart's hammering.
                              (playfully)
                         I excite you that much?

               He turns to her, and the grim set of his jaw makes her smile
               vanish.

 ANDERSON                          I used to love being a cop.  

 LISA                          You're still a cop.  I'm a factory
                         worker.  We don't catch murderers.
                         We process them.

               Lisa takes a long breath.  She's been down this road before.
               She speaks reassuringly.

 LISA                          You're the best homicide cop in the
                         country.

	       ANDERSON snorts disdainfully.

 ANDERSON                          Great -- except there's no such thing
                         as homicide.  What I do best doesn't
                         exist anymore.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 9. 

 LISA PAUL.                               (beat)
                         You're the Director of a perfect
                         system.  A Cop with a perfect record

 ANDERSON                          The Precogs have a perfect record.
                         They identify the accused -- I just
                         put on my monkey suit and go round
                         them up.

               Lisa hugs him, kisses the back of his neck.

 LISA                          And then I prosecute them.  And they
                         go to jail.  And lives are saved.
                         Thousands of lives.
                              (beat)
                         And that's a cop's dream.

               Anderson is silent for a time.  He sighs, then smiles, and
               turns to his wife, takes her in his arms.

 ANDERSON                          No.  You're a cop's dream.

 INT. THE BATHROOM -- LATER 
               Anderson steps out of the shower, and begins to towel himself
               dry- He glances out a casement window.  He tilts his head,
               curious, then wipes at the steam on the window.

 ANDERSON'S POV LISA 
               Lisa stands in the backyard in her nightgown, talking on a
               cell phone.  She hangs up, moves quickly back into the house.

 ANDERSON 
               Cocks his head, then goes back to toweling off.

 INT. KITCHEN -- LATER 
               Checkered linoleum floor.  Appliances out of the 1950's.

               Except there are little differences.  When Lisa puts a skillet
               of eggs on the stove, the heating element is not an electric
               coil, or gas but a shimmering field of light.

               Lisa is dressed in a blue jersey skirt and a brief jacket.
               Anderson wears a gray suit, thin blue tie, white shirt,
               wingtipped shoes.  He doesn't look up from the newspaper as
               he speaks.

 ANDERSON                          Who called?

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 10. 

               Lisa keeps her back to him as she flips the eggs.  She touches
               her long brown hair.

 LISA                          No one.  I called about my hair.
                         Getting it done this afternoon.

               Anderson looks like he's about to say something else, when
               suddenly someone RAPS on the back screen door.  Anderson and
               Lisa both turn and smile.

 ANDERSON                          Come on in, neighbor.  Want some
                         coffee?

 OUTSIDE THE DOOR 
               FRANK D'IGNAZIO, 65, white-haired, robust, hesitates before
               coming in.  A thin METALLIC ARM with a red laser light arches
               quickly down from above the doorway, shines into each of his
               EYES, scanning the irises.  The arm lifts out of view, the
               screen door UNLATCHES.

               Frank enters the kitchen, carrying a basket of tomatoes.

 FRANK D'IGNAZIO                          Brought these for your supper.

 LISA                          Oh, Frank.  That's so sweet.  Thank
                         you.

 FRANK D'IGNAZIO                          Sweet, nothing.  I gotta get rid of
                         these things.  One plant, and I'm
                         invaded by tomatoes.  When I was a
                         kid ...

               Anderson laughs, claps his friend and neighbor on the back,
               teases him.

 ANDERSON                          Before all this genetically engineered
                         crap ...

               Frank gives him an ornery look, then a smile.

 FRANK D'IGNAZIO                          Yeah well, it's true.  It used to be
                         a challenge to grow things.  An art.
                         Now you put one plant in the ground
                         -- then jump the hell out of the
                         way.

               Anderson gestures for Frank to sit down.

 ANDERSON                          Coffee?

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 11. 

 FRANK D'IGNAZIO                          Nah, thanks.  Can't stay.  You guys
                         are rushing off to work anyway.

               Lisa sets the eggs down in front of Anderson.

 LISA                          You and Ellie come for supper then.

 ANDERSON                          We'll barbecue.

               Frank nods and pushes on the screen door.

 FRANK D'IGNAZIO                          You betcha.  We'll bring some more
                         tomatoes -- a new batch will have
                         grown by then.

               They all laugh, Frank exits, Anderson goes back to his paper.

 EXT. DRIVEWAY -- LATER 
               Anderson waves to Lisa.  Her big Studebaker drives off down
               the tree-lined street and away.

               Anderson approaches his Chevy.  He doesn't take out a key to
               unlock it.  There is no lock.  He slides in behind the wheel.
               Doesn't take out a key for the ignition -- there is no
               ignition.

               A thin METALLIC ARM arches down from the sun visor, scans
               Anderson's EYES, identifying him.  A seat harness wraps around
               him, and the car STARTS.

               Anderson picks up a folder marked "Precrime" and begins to
               read through the papers.  The Chevy backs out of the driveway
               and takes him to work.

 EXT. INTERSTATE 95 - ALEXANDRIA, VA -- LATER 
               A vast spread of corporate and government buildings -- the
               spillover from Washington D.C. across the Potomac River into
               Virginia.

               Beyond the white of Washington is "The Sprawl" -- the massive
               unzoned city that has spread uncontrolled on the outskirts
               of the Capitol.  It is impenetrable and uninviting, especially
               to those comfortable in the utopian suburbs.

               Anderson's Chevy moves in a sea of fifties-type cars.
               Occasionally, an ultramodern vehicle zips past them.  In the
               sky above is another sea -- of advertising dirigibles,
               holographic billboards, hovercrafts, skim-jet transports.
               On one of the holographic billboards giant words begin to
               flash: "I LIKE MIKE!"

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 12. 

               Then a picture of the smiling President appears.  Then the
               words: "RE-ELECT PRESIDENT MIKE BILLINGS FOR ANOTHER FOUR
 YEARS! KEEP THE PAST IN OUR FUTURE!" 
 INSIDE ANDERSON'S CHEVY 
               Through his windshield, Anderson glances at a holographic
               road sign.

               THE ROAD SIGN reads: "FBI Headquarters 1 mile.  CIA
               Headquarters 1.5 miles.  PRECRIME Headquarters 2 miles."

               Anderson goes back to his papers.

 INT. PRECRIME HEADQUARTERS 
               Anderson sits in a too large office in a too large chair.
               He abruptly rises and begins to pace.  The room is large,
               but he paces like a lion confined in a cage.

               He punches an intercom.  A female VOICE responds.

 INTERCOM VOICE                          Yes, Director Anderson?

 ANDERSON                          Where's Ennis Page?  Why hasn't he
                         delivered this morning's Precog discs?

               Ed Witwer opens the door to the office., and casually walks
               in.

 INTERCOM VOICE                          I'll find him, sir.

               Ed shakes his head, smiles.

 WITWER                          Bullying the staff again, Director
                         Anderson?

 ANDERSON                          Screw you.

               Anderson turns away and stares out a large window.  Witwer
               joins him.

 ANDERSON (CONT'D)                          Was that fun for you, yesterday?

 WITWER                          The Johnny Palmer bust?

 ANDERSON                          Yeah.

 WITWER                          It was okay.  We got our man.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 13. 

               Anderson takes a long breath.

 ANDERSON                          When do we not get our man?

               They turn as Ennis PAGE, 44, a thin, tight little man with
               burr cut hair, knocks and enters the room.  He carries a
               black BRIEFCASE marked:

               "Zone 218 - Washington/Alexandria, VA." The case is cuffed
               to his wrist.

 PAGE                          Sorry I'm late, sir.  Precogs put
                         out a heavy national volume this
                         morning -- four for our zone.

 ANDERSON (DISTRACTED)                          Put the case on my desk, Ennis.

               Page hesitates, doesn't do it.  Anderson moves quickly to
               Page.

 ANDERSON (CONT'D)                          What was I thinking.

               Anderson leans over the BRIEFCASE.  A small panel recedes, a
               red laser scanner clicks on, scans Anderson's eyes, BEEPS
               affirmatively, then clicks off.  The cuff on Page's wrist
               falls open.

               Now Page puts the case on Anderson's desk.  Page hesitates.
               Anderson and Witwer know just what he's going to do.  Page
               reaches down, unable to resist straightening a pile of papers
               strewn on Anderson's desk.

               Anderson and Witwer exchange knowing smiles.  When Page looks
               up they try to cover, but are not quick enough.  He frowns
               tightly, and heads for the door.

               Anderson calls after him.

 ANDERSON                          Thanks, Ennis.  

               Witwer turns to leave, too.

 WITWER                          Now that's a guy who really cares.

               Witwer grins to himself as he walks out of the office.

               Anderson takes a deep breath and goes to his desk, and opens
               the briefcase.  Four small bright DISCS sit in rows.  He
               removes one, places it in a VIDEO MONITOR that lifts into
               view from the center of his desk.  He sits back, weary, and
               watches.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 14. 

 VIDEO SCREEN 
               A young black woman stands in a hallway.  She stares at a
               door, gun in hand.  She opens the door, enters a bedroom.

               She glides toward a bed, where a man lies sleeping.  She
               lifts the gun and fires it into his sleeping form.

               ANDERSON pops the disc, jots down some notes, pops in a new
               disc.

 VIDEO SCREEN 
               A white woman stands at a stove, cooking.  A man comes up
               behind her slowly, silently, a necktie taut between his hands.
               He raises the necktie toward her neck

 ANDERSON 
               He's not watching the screen.  He is out of his chair now, 
               looking out the window.

 INT. PRECRIME MAIN LOBBY 
               A tour of Precrime is in progress, like the public relations
               tours run by present-day FBI.  The TOUR GUIDE, a pretty,
               smartly uniformed woman in her twenties, leads a group of
               adults and children, all with glowing nametags, through the
               building.

 TOUR GUIDE                          Welcome to the main headquarters of
                         Precrime.  Smaller Precrime branches
                         are scattered throughout the United
                         States.

               The group follows the guide slowly through the lobby.

 TOUR GUIDE (CONT'D)                          Precrime was established in 2030,
                         with the harnessing of the remarkable
                         talents of the Precognitive mutants.

               She points cheerfully to a stubby little man, MR. HARRIS.

 TOUR GUIDE (CONT'D)                          Mr. Harris, can you tell me how many
                         Precogs there are?

 MR. HARRIS                          Three.  Uh, right?

 TOUR GUIDE                          That's exactly right!  A lot of people
                         assume there are Precogs in every
                         branch office.
 (MORE) 
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 15. 

 TOUR GUIDE (CONT'D)                          But there are only three Precogs,
                         right here in this building.  And
                         the information they give us, we
                         send out to all the other branches.
                              (beat)
                         And what is that information -what
                         do the Precogs do?

               An eager boy, TIMMY has the answer to that one.

 TIMMY                          They protect us.

               The guide tousles his hair.

 TOUR GUIDE                               (chipper voice)
                         That's right, Timmy.  Because of the
                         Precogs, you're going to grow up
                         murderfree.  Isn't that something?

 MR. HARRIS                          They ever wrong?  The Precogs ever
                         screw up when they predict a murder?

               The guide laughs tolerantly.

 TOUR GUIDE                          Never, sir.  It's an infallible
                         system.  The Precogs predict a
                         homicide, and our Precrime police
                         then apprehend that future murderer
                         before the event occurs.  And right
                         next door is the Judicial Center,
                         where we prosecute the
                         future murderers.

 TIMMY                          Can we see the Precogs?

 TOUR GUIDE                          No, I'm sorry.  That part of the
                         building is not open to the public.
                              (beat)
                         Now, if you'll just step this way
 ... 
               She waves the group on toward an elevator.

 INT. THE PRECOG CHAMBER 
               The chamber is an elaborate, hypertech hospital, constructed
               for the maintenance of three beings -- the Precogs.  They
               are triplets -- two of the Precogs are male, one is female.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 16. 

               Technicians swarm all over them like worker bees.  The bodies
               of the Precogs are being tended to: exercised, cleansed,
               groomed.

               The head of each Precog is encased in a complex, ornate HELMET
               that seems to be an amalgam of organic tissues and bright
               metallics.  The helmets pulse slightly, and the surfaces
               seem to flow and shift, like oil on water.

               A network of micro-thin cables that are actually strands of
               light, rise Medusa-like from each helmet, then centralize
               into a single strand, and connect to a massive mainframe
               computer.

               The Precogs appear to be in suspended animation, or in comas.
               They are absolutely still and limp -- except for their faces.
               Their faces are in constant motion, the lips mouthing scenes
               from murders only they can see.  Life for a Precog is an
               endless cycle of death.

 CLOSE ON - THE FEMALE PRECOG 
               we recognize her fragile and perfect FACE from the opening
               scene of the movie.  She floats in a glowing nutritive bath.
               Like her brothers, she seems to be eternally young, or
               eternally old.

               The technicians lift her from her bath.  She is dried, dressed
               in a robe, then guided into an over-sized, throne like chair.
               Her brothers are guided into their thrones, on either side
               of her.

               Not once are their helmets removed.  What they feed into the
               mainframe is too valuable.  It must be gathered twenty-four
               unrelenting hours a day.

 INT. A ROOM 
               Ennis Page sits in a room just off the Precog Chamber.  He
               can see them through a large window.  He works a large
               computer console, the gathering point for the information
               the Precogs constantly feed the computer.

               Perhaps every ten seconds, a small DISC is released by the
               computer, and mechanically gathered, sorted, and placed -under
               Page's watchful eye -- into a black case.

               ANDERSON is in the room standing quietly behind Page.  As
               Director, Anderson is authorized to come and go, but from
               his fussy movements, it's obvious Page sees anyone else in
               the room as an intruder in his special domain.

               Anderson turns and looks through the window at the Precogs.

 ANDERSON                          What would they think about if we
                         unhooked them?

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 17. 

               Page looks up from his work.

 PAGE                          They don't think, sir.  They just
                         see.

               Anderson is silent.

 PAGE (CONT'D)                          They're not even alive, really.

               Anderson contemplates the scene, nods to Page's words, then
               turns and walks out of the room, as Page looks on.

 INT. THE PRECOG CHAMBER 


               The female Precog sits in her chair.  Her eyes are open.
               She faces the window that looks into Page's main frame room.
               In the window we see Anderson leaving the room.

               The female Precog's eyes drift closed.

 DISSOLVE TO: 
 INT.COURTROOM - JUDICIAL CENTER -- DAY 
               A trial is in progress.  The defendant is Johnny Palmer.  He
               sits, ashen, at a table, his DEFENSE ATTORNEY beside him.

               There are no jurors in the Juror BOX.  There is a JUDGE, 55,
               and stern.  There are a few people in the public seats.

               The Precrime prosecuting attorney is Lisa Anderson.  She
               wears a black robe, and addresses the Director of Precrime,
               Anderson, who sits in the witness stand.

 LISA                          Director Anderson, do you swear that
                         the disc you now present to the court
                         is the only and authentic disc of
                         the future murder of Carol Palmer by
                         her husband, John Palmer?

               It is a ritual that they both have acted out hundreds of
               times.  Anderson gives the rote answer as he holds up the
 DISC. 
 ANDERSON                          Yes.  This is the only and authentic
                         disc of the event seen by the
                         Precognitive mutants and recorded by
                         the Precrime Division.  This is the
                         immutable evidence of the infallible
                         system.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 18. 

 LISA                          The murder of Carol Palmer will occur
 ... ? 
 ANDERSON                          In one week -- June 16th, 2040 at
                         10:33 in the morning.

               Lisa steps back.  The judge reaches out and Anderson hands
               him the disc.  The judge inserts it into a special video
               machine on his desk.  Anderson steps down, his ritual part
               in this trial completed.

               A huge MONITOR comes to life behind the judge.  He does not
               turn around to watch -- he has his own monitor.

               Johnny Palmer watches, eyes wide.  We now see, in detail,
               what we previously heard the Precogs act out in the beginning
               of the movie.

 THE MONITOR 
               The Palmer's family room.  Johnny reaches into Carol's sewing
               basket for the scissors.  Carol stands defenseless in front
               of him.  Their son cowers in a corner of the room.

 CAROL                          Johnny, please --

 JOHNNY                          "Johnny, please.  Johnny please."

 CAROL                          You're scaring me.

 JOHNNY'S SON DADDY, DON'T. DADDY 
               Johnny approaches his wife with deadly menace.

 JOHNNY                               (considering)
                         I don't like you any more, Carol.

 CAROL                               (imploring)
                         Put the scissors down.  You're scaring
                         me. Please.  

               We cut away from the monitor and stay on JOHNNY PALMER'S FACE 
               as he sits at the defense table.  He winces at each terrible exchange.

 JOHNNY (O.S.)                          Oh, Carol.

 CAROL (O.S.)                          Johnny!  Stop!

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 19. 

 JOHNNY (O.S.)                          Don't grab at me!  Let go...

 JOHNNY'S SON (O.S.)                          Daddy!  No!

               Johnny Palmer cries out as the MONITOR goes blank.

 JOHNNY                          I didn't do it.  I'm innocent!  It
                         didn't happen!

               The JUDGE hits his gavel.

 JUDGE                          How does the defense plead?

               The defense attorney glances at his watch, then quickly
               rattles off the words to his part of this judicial ritual.

 DEFENSE ATTORNEY                          The defense acknowledges the
                         infallibility of the system.  We are
                         Guilty.  We throw ourselves at the
                         mercy of the court.

 JOHNNY                          No! No! The Precogs are wrong!  No!

               The court guards are on him in an instant.  They lead him
               out of the courtroom.

 INT.A BOARDING HOUSE - THE SPRAWL -- DAY 
               Anderson pushes down a tight hallway thick with police and
               enters a disheveled room.  The fifties interior is drab: a
               Formica table, bad curtains, a frayed Lazy Boy positioned in
               front of a TV.

               Ed Witwer is already on the scene.  He stands a few feet
               from the BODY of a man, gunshot wound to the head, a handgun
               on the floor nearby.

 WITWER                               (to Anderson)
                         Looks like the old days.

               Anderson nods to his former partner.  Anderson leans over
               the body.

 ANDERSON                          That would be bad news for an
                         infallible system.

               Witwer is suddenly bored.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 20. 

 WITWER                          We know it can't be a murder -- the
                         Precogs would've seen it.  Why do
                         you insist on coming to these things?

 ANDERSON                          Keeps the system honest.  And besides,
                         I like to pretend I'm a cop.

               Anderson turns to an officer.

 ANDERSON (CONT'D)                          Who's got the Coroner?

               Another OFFICER steps forward with a large blue case.

 OFFICER                          Right here, sir.

               The officer places the case beside the corpse, and opens the
               latches.  Inside the case is a large metallic APPARATUS: the
               "Coroner."

               It comes to auto-life, and begins to unfold itself - It rises
               crab-like, and steps out of its case.

               Except for his mouth, the doctor doesn't move.  His projected
               image stands beside the body, his arms folded behind his
               back.  He is the interface, the way the humans communicate
               with the crab apparatus.

 ANDERSON                          Hi DOC.

 HOLOGRAPHIC DOCTOR                          Hello, Director Anderson.

               The coroner crab begins to walk the body, which is face down
               on the floor.  It moves slowly, hesitating as it crawls the
               body's back to insert various razor thin probes and core
               samplers through the shirt and into the spinal cord.

 WITWER                          This a homicide, Doc?

 HOLOGRAPHIC DOCTOR                          I'm presently analyzing neurohormones,
                         Assistant Director Witwer.  I have
                         not concluded my examination.

               The crab engulfs the back of the head, probes the wound.

 HOLOGRAPHIC DOCTOR (CONT'D)                          I'm detecting carbonization of skull
                         fragments around the entry wound.

               Witwer whispers to Anderson.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 21. 

 WITWER                          Bingo.  The guy put the gun to his
                         own head.

 HOLOGRAPHIC DOCTOR                          I have not determined that yet,
                         Assistant Director.

               Witwer grins.

 WITWER                          You have good ears for a ghost, Doc.

               The coroner crab steps away from the body.

 HOLOGRAPHIC DOCTOR                          Please rotate the corpse to the
                         lateral supine position.

               Two officers turn the body face-up.  The crab inches close
               to probe the face.  Disconcertingly, it lifts the eyelids,
               and examines the interior of the mouth, so that for a moment
               the manipulation makes the corpse seem alive.

               Then the crab moves down the trunk and the legs At last, it
               comes to a standstill.  The holographic Doctor closes his
               eyes as if in thought.

 WITWER                          Can you imagine if this was a
                         homicide?  Who even knows how to
                         hunt down a killer any more?

               Anderson gives him a hard look.

 ANDERSON                          I know how, dammit.  You know how.

 WITWER                          Easy, partner.
                              (beat)
                         But you know what I'm saying.  The
                         state legislatures are pushing to
                         stop funding for training homicide
                         detectives ...

 ANDERSON                          God bless the Precogs.

               The Doctor opens his eyes.

 HOLOGRAPHIC DOCTOR                          This event is a negative homicide.
                         A mortal wound was generated by a
                         .22 calibre bullet self-delivered to
                         the parietal 'portion of the skull
                         on June 10th, 2040, at 11:57 pm,
 (MORE) 
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 22. 

 HOLOGRAPHIC DOCTOR (CONT'D)                          Eastern Standard Time.  This event
                         is a positive suicide.

               The holographic doctor begins to shimmer, then disappears
               back into the coroner crab.  The crab crawls back into its
               case, folds its probes and legs tight to its metal body, and
               shuts down.

               Witwer turns to Anderson.

 WITWER                          It's time to stop coming to these,
                         partner.

               Anderson watches as the med techs lift the body onto a
               stretcher.

 ANDERSON                          Yeah.  You're right.

 INT. A BANQUET - WASHINGTON, D.C. -- NIGHT 
               Anderson, in black-tie, with Lisa in a shimmering blue gown
               at his side, moves through a huge room filled high level
               government officials and politicians.

 ANDERSON                          A little bit of me dies every time I
                         come to one of these things.

 LISA                          It's only a party, Paul.

 ANDERSON                          I'd never have let them appoint me
                         to Precrime if I'd have known this
                         was going to be part of it.

 LISA                          You're exactly what Precrime needed.
                         An amazing homicide cop and a real
                         person in an unreal job.

 ANDERSON                          Exactly.  

 LISA 			 The public loves the
                         Precogs.  But they give people the
                         creeps, too.  You're something they
                         understandp a regular cop running
                         things.

               Anderson sighs as he looks around the elegantly appointed
               banquet hall.

 ANDERSON                          Let's invite all these irregular
                         assholes over for a barbecue.  Burgers
                         and beer - think they'd come?

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 23. 

               A barrel-chested man with a great shock of pepper gray hair,
               SENATOR MALCOLM, 58, takes hold of Anderson's elbow from
               behind.

 SENATOR MALCOLM                          I'd come, Mr. Director.  And I'd
                         make all the other assholes come
                         with me.

               Lisa reddens, Anderson gives an embarrassed cough.  The
               Senator laughs and claps him on the back.

 SENATOR MALCOLM (CONT'D)                          Nice job this morning.  Another
                         negative homicide.  The Precogs never
                         let us down.

               Mrs. Malcolm smoothly occupies Lisa, while the Senator eases
               Anderson in the opposite direction 

 SENATOR MALCOLM                         I have a dream, Paul.

 ANDERSON                          I know you do, Senator.

 SENATOR MALCOLM                          Hundreds of Precogs.  Not just
                         predicting murders, but predicting
                         all crimes.  Burglary, arson, assaults
 ... 
 ANDERSON                          How about jaywalking?  Littering?
                         Now there's a crime.

               The Senator smiles through his teeth.

 SENATOR MALCOLM                          I don't want a police state, you
                         know that.  But we have an opportunity
                         here, and

 ANDERSON                          No sir, we don't have that
                         opportunity.  There are only three
                         Precogs.  They're a lucky accident
                         of nature.  There are no more.

 SENATOR MALCOLM                               (beat)
                         We can make more.  Just give me your
                         support.  Help me increase funding
                         for the Precog Engineering Project.

 ANDERSON                          Precogs aren't sheep or pigs.  Seeing
                         into the future is a gift, a
                         nonreproducible event.

 ANDERSON (CONT'D)                          There was only one Mozart, and there
                         are only three Precogs.

 SENATOR MALCOLM                          Fuck Mozart.  The people want to be
                         safe.  They want that more than they
                         want food or love.

               He gestures at the room full of glittering partygoers.

 SENATOR MALCOLM (CONT'D)                          Look at us -it's 2040 and we've
                         wrapped ourselves up in the 1950's
                         like a big security blanket.  Why?
                         Because we want to feel like they
                         felt.  Safe.

 ANDERSON                          Senator, a world filled with hundreds
                         of Precogs is not my idea of a safe
                         place.

               The Senator gives it one last shot.

 SENATOR MALCOLM                          Sure could use your help, Paul.

 ANDERSON                          I decline, Senator.  I'm sorry.

 SENATOR MALCOLM                               (icily)
                         Don't think I'll come to your barbecue
                         after all.

               The senator moves off.  Anderson stands stiffly among the
               sea of black-ties and exquisite fifties dresses.

 INT. PRECOG ENGINEERING LAB - CHEVY CHASE, MD DAY 
               Anderson walks through the lab with a tall, pale man, DR,
               RESFIELD, 60, the head scientist.  It is not a place that
               warms Anderson's heart.

               Biotechnicians work at long stainless steel tables dissecting
               and examining protoplasmic tissue masses.  Other technicians
               peer through massive microscopes.  Still others use robotic
               arms to manipulate radioactive organics behind leaded-glass
               barriers.

 DR. RESFIELD                          You don't get out here much.

 ANDERSON                          Not my sort of place.

               Dr. Resfield emits a dry little laugh.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 25. 

 DR. RESFIELD                          The head of Precrime squeamish?

 ANDERSON                          When it comes to needles and scalpels,
                         yeah.

 DR. RESFIELD                          I promise we won't use any on you.

 ANDERSON                          What do you use them on?

 DR. RESFIELD                               (beat)
                         On bits of this and that.

               Anderson looks at him.  The doctor pauses outside a thick
               door.  An IdentiScan device quickly reads their eyes, and
               the door opens with an electronic hiss.

               Anderson looks around the lab.  Technicians lower mesh
               cylinders into some sort of chemical VAT.  Another technician
               turns a dial, and an electric charge courses through the
               roiling liquid.

 ANDERSON                          What's happening here?

 DR. RESFIELD                          We're in an interesting phase.

 ANDERSON                          What's in the cylinders?

 DR. RESFIELD                          Neurotissue.

 ANDERSON                          From ...?

 DR. RESFIELD                          A fusion of sources.  From the
                         Precogs' deceased mother.  From the
                         Precogs themselves.

 ANDERSON                          A fusion of ... ?

 DR. RESFIELD                          In lay terms, we mated sperm from
                         the brothers with ova from the mother
                         and sister to create new growth.

               The CYLINDERS shudder as the voltage is increased.

 DR. RESFIELD (CONT'D)                          And then we add mutating variables.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 26. 

               Anderson stares into the roiling vat.  Dr. Resfield waits
               for more questions.  But it is clear from Anderson's
               expression he has already learned enough.

 INT. ANDERSON'S OFFICE -- DAY 
               Anderson sits in his office reviewing Precog discs for
               premurders in the local Washington area. We stay on him as he
               watches the monitor.  He pops the disc, jots down some notes,
               slides in the next disc.

               Anderson's mouth slowly opens.  He leans close to the monitor,
               his face ashen.

 EXT. FRANK D'IGNAZIO'S BACKYARD -- LATER 
               Frank is on his hands and knees, working his vegetable garden.
               He whistles softly under his breath as he trowels the rich
               soil.

               He sits up as he hears someone open the garden gate.  He
               lifts his straw hat in greeting, gives a smile.  It's
 ANDERSON. 
 FRANK D'IGNAZIO                          What are you doing, playing hooky?

               Anderson tries to smile.  But it won't come.  He looks around
               the abundant garden.

 ANDERSON                          It's great out here, Frank.. You got
                         the touch.

               Frank straightens with a grimace.

 FRANK D'IGNAZIO                          I got the arthritis, is what I got.

               Anderson reflexively looks up at a high WHINING sound from
               over head.  Frank follows his gaze.  A Precrime HOVERCRAFT
               glides into position overhead.

               Frank stares, then lowers his eyes to the ground.  He takes
               a long sad breath.

 FRANK D'IGNAZIO (CONT'D)                          Ah shit, neighbor.
                              (beat)
                         Goddamn Precogs don't miss a beat,
                         do they?
                              (beat)
                         Can we do this inside?  Ellie's not
                         home.

               Anderson's voice is full of pain.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 27. 

 ANDERSON                          Sure, Frank.  Yeah.

 INT. FRANK'S KITCHEN -- MOMENTS LATER 


               Frank wanders the kitchen, trying to focus on his situation.
               Anderson has trouble meeting his friend's eyes.

               Through a window we can see black suited police officers
               with mirrored helmets swarming outside Frank's house.

 FRANK D'IGNAZIO                               (distracted)
                         I thought I'd buried it all.
                         Thirty-five years -- all those minutes
                         and days to bury it.
                              (beat)
                         But suddenly you see the man who
                         murdered your daughter walking the
                         streets -- my God it throws you.

               Frank stops pacing.  He stares at a kitchen drawer.

 ANDERSON                          He'd served his time, Frank.  I know
                         it's not fair.  It's way beyond not
                         fair ...

               Frank looks.  At Anderson bitterly.

 FRANK D'IGNAZIO                               (yells)
                         God damn the Precogs.  You know?
                         Why couldn't they have been around
                         to save my girl?
                              (softly)
                         Now they're catching me.

               Frank reaches into the drawer and pulls out a small handgun.

 FRANK D'IGNAZIO (CONT'D)                          I really shoot the bastard, huh?
                         When?

 ANDERSON                          Next Wednesday, at noon.

 FRANK D'IGNAZIO                          Good.

               Anderson's cop eyes are all over the gun.

 ANDERSON                          It's not in you, Frank, to kill
                         anybody.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 28. 

 FRANK D'IGRAZIO                          Tell it to the Precogs.  It's set in
                         stone now, right?

               Frank puts the gun on the kitchen counter.  Anderson relaxes.

 FRANK D'IGNAZIO                               (almost inaudible)
                         I don't want to be a part of this
                         world anymore.

 ANDERSON                          I know, Frank.

               Frank gives Anderson a look -- no, friend, you don't know.
               Then Frank looks hard at the gun on the counter.

 FRANK D'IGNAZIO                               (beat)
                         So.  Tell me, Paul.  Do the Precogs
                         see everything?

 ANDERSON                          No.

 FRANK D'IGRAZIO                          Then they won't have seen this.

               Frank suddenly snatches up the gun and presses it to his own
               head.  On Anderson's anguished FACE, at the SOUND of the gun
               going off.

 EXT. FRONT YARD -- LATER 
               Anderson stands with his old partner, Witwer, on Frank's
               front porch.  Behind them, through an open door, we see Lisa
               comforting Ellie D'Ignazio in the living room.

               Anderson is deeply shaken.  Witwer tries to talk him through
               it.

 WITWER (GENTLY)                          We had to bring him in.

               Anderson doesn't respond.

 WITWER (CONT'D)                          He was a future murderer.

 ANDERSON                               (angrily)
                         You blame him?  The guy killed his
                         daughter!

               Witwer lets the implication of his words sink in.

 ANDERSON (CONT'D)                          Yeah.  I know.  I know.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 29. 

               Anderson turns and watches as they wheel Frank's draped body
               into the back of an ambulance.  Anderson's bitterness erupts.

 ANDERSON (CONT'D)                          I hate the Precogs, Ed. I believe in
                         them absolutely and I hate them
                         absolutely.  Jesus.

               Witwer listens to him.

 ANDERSON (CONT'D)                          And that goddamn lab trying to grow
                         more of them.  Put a Precog in every
                         home, you know?  So we can have more
                         Franks - people shooting themselves --
                         over who knows what?

               Witwer kneads Anderson's shoulder, talks to him in soothing
               tones like you'd calm an agitated horse.

 WITWER                          Precrime did the job it was supposed
                         to do.

               The two men can hear Ellie sobbing inside the house.

 WITWER (CONT'D)                          You know it.  And you believe in it.

 ANDERSON (BEAT)                          Yeah.

 WITWER                          It's not easy.  It beats us down.
                         Ellie in there -- no doubt she hates
                         you right now.

               Anderson turns to Witwer.

 ANDERSON                          That's why I got into this business
                         -- to be hated.

               Anderson almost manages a small smile.  Witwer puts his arm
               around him.  Walks him away from the scene.

 WITWER                          They hated us when we were regular
                         cops.  Now we're Precrime, and they
                         still hate US.  It's one of the little
                         perks of law enforcement nobody knows
                         about.

               Their quiet laughter is tinged with sadness.  Anderson looks
               into his partner's good, open face.  Then they both look
               away, their understanding of each other complete.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 30. 

 INT. ANDERSON'S BEDROOM -- LATE NIGHT 
               Anderson stares out the window at Frank's house, illuminated
               by the moon.  It's a mournful sight.

               Lisa rises on an elbow and watches him from the bed.

 DISSOLVE TO: 
 INT. PRECRIME HEADQUARTERS-ALEXANDRIA-DAY - ONE WEEK LATER 
               Ennis Page, in the mainframe room just off the Precog Chamber,
               picks up a black BRIEFCASE marked: "Zone 218 Washington /
               Alexandria, VA." He approaches the door, and his eyes are
               scanned.  The door opens with a HISS.

               We follow Page as he walks through doors and corridors until
               he reaches a long hallway leading to the Director's office.
               Anderson's secretary, Angela, looks up on Page's approach.
               She nods.  He nods.

               He walks around her desk.  His eyes are scanned, and the
               door to Anderson's office opens.

               ANDERSON looks up, wearily.

 INT. ANDERSON'S OFFICE -- LATER 
               Anderson inserts a disc into the video monitor, almost
               absently.  As we have seen him do before, he swivels his
               chair away from the monitor, and stares at Washington D.C.
               across the Potomac.  Hovercrafts and transports skim through
               the sky above the Washington Monument.

               The camera stays on Anderson's back as the sound from the
               Precog disc begins.  He hears his own voice speaking in
               strained, agitated tones.

 ANDERSON (O.S.)                          Let's not do this, Ed.

               Anderson slowly swivels around and stares with disbelief and
               horror at the monitor.

 THE MONITOR 
               shows Anderson and Witwer in a room, a few feet apart pointing
               guns directly at each other.  Their eyes intense and panicked.
               Who murders whom?

               Ed's eyes cut to a huge digital clock on the wall as the red
               seconds tumble away.

 ANDERSON                          Oh, Ed ...

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 31. 

               Witwer lowers his gun.  He stands unresisting before

               Anderson.

               Witwer sees his own death in Anderson's wild eyes, has always
               seen it.

               Anderson FIRES his weapon, puts a bullet straight into
               Witwer's heart, throwing him back against a wall.  Witwer
               slumps, dying, beneath the huge digital clock, which reads:

 5:20 AM. 
 BACK TO SCENE 
               Anderson stares as the monitor fades to a blank.  His hand
               goes to his mouth.  His body begins to shake.  He hugs
               himself, but he can't stop the shaking.

               The DISC pops out of the side of the monitor.  It is a small
               SOUND, but it has Anderson up and out of his chair as if it
               were a gunshot, He reaches for the disc but cannot touch it.
               His legs suddenly weaken, and he drops to one knee beside
               his desk, like a man in need of prayer.

               There is a single thought that screams through his brain.
               It is an almost visible thing, filling the room, blackly.
               Anderson whispers the sickening words that shape his fate.

 ANDERSON (CONT'D)                          I kill you.
                              (beat)
                         Oh god, I kill you.

               As Anderson pulls himself up, and tries to reach again for
               the disc ...

 CUT TO: 
 INT. THE PRECOG CHAMBER 
               In an image just like the scene in the beginning of the movie,
               the three FACES of the Precogs hover in the misty darkness.
               Their closed eyes open in SUDDEN UNISON.  They speak as one.

 ALL THREE                          Murderer!

               After a long moment, the eyes close again, and the Precogs
               fade into the mists ...

 CUT TO: 
 INT. ANDERSON'S OFFICE 
               Anderson looks up sharply at the SOUND of a knock on his
               door.  Every normal sound seems grotesquely AMPLIFIED, the
               traffic outside, his own breathing.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 32. 

               His senses are on overload.

               The door begins to open.  A stockinged leg is the first thing
               Anderson sees.  His secretary, ANGELA.

 ANGELA                          Sir?

               She hesitates before fully entering the room, Anderson grabs
               at the incriminating disc.  He sees his EYES reflected in
               its alloy surface.  He pushes the disc deep into his pants
               pocket.

               Somehow he finds his voice.

 ANDERSON                          Come in.  Angela.

               She looks at him, uncertain.  Then she places a small stack
               of papers on his desk.

 ANGELA                          Need you to sign these.  And your
                         eleven o'clock starts in five minutes.

 ANDERSON                          My ... eleven.

 ANGELA                               (beat)
                         Budget coordination with the FBI.
                              (beat)
                         You okay, sir?

               Anderson runs his hand through his hair, can't think fast
               enough.  He sees her glance at the black Precog disc case.
               He shuts it, awkwardly, and it auto-locks.

 ANDERSON                          Have Page take this.

               Angela steps back, disturbed.

 ANGELA                          But sir, the procedure

 ANDERSON (SNAPS)                          I make procedure.  Call him.
                              (long beat)
                         I'm not okay, Angela ... you're right.

               My head and stomach.  I'm going down to the clinic.  Or maybe
               just home.

               Angela looks relieved at the explanation.

 ANGELA                          Yes sir.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 33. 

               He moves past her.  His FINGERS fidget against the hidden
               disc in his pocket.

 ANDERSON                          I'll speak to Witwer, put him in
                         charge for the rest of the day.

               He hesitates at the door, turns to look at his office, and
               at his view of Washington.  Then he is gone.

 INT. OUTSIDE WITWER'S OFFICE -- MOMENTS LATER 
               Anderson looks in the door Of Witwer's empty office.  He
               takes a step inside.

               Witwer's booming voice sounds from behind him, startling
               him.

 WITWER                          Breaking and entering.  That'll get
                         you five to ten, hard.

               Witwer immediately scans his old partner's ashen face.

 WITWER (CONT'D)                          What's wrong?

               Anderson can hardly bear to meet his friend's eyes.  He
               REACHES into his pocket, as if to lift the disc into the
               light.  If he could just do that, show it to Witwer.

 WITWER                          Paul?

               Anderson's hand comes out of his pocket, EMPTY.

 ANDERSON                          Take over for me today?

 WITWER                          You sick?

 ANDERSON                          Yeah.

               Witwer makes a show of backing away.

 WITWER                          Don't give it to me.  You probably
                         have that Trans-10 virus going around.
                         A stomach thing.  I hate stomach
                         things.

               Anderson Almost smiles.

 ANDERSON                          Ed.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 34. 

 WITWER                          Yeah?

               Witwer looks at him.  Anderson almost reaches out for him.

 ANDERSON                          Run the place, okay?

 WITWER                               (smiles)
                         Sure.  Right into the ground.
                              (beat)
                         Go on home before I call Infectious
                         Control and have them spray you down
                         with something.

               Anderson moves unsteadily down the hallway.  Witwer calls
               out.

 WITWER (CONT'D)                          You want me to do the discs, or hold
                         them for you to review when you get
                         back?

 ANDERSON                          Can't let them back up.  Do 'em.

 WITWER                          Call you later.  Take it easy, all
                         right?

               Witwer lifts his hand in farewell, Anderson fixes on that
               last image -- Witwer waving goodbye.

 INT. PRECRIME UNDERGROUND GARAGE -- LATER 
               Anderson, sweating now, leans against a thick cement pillar
               and pulls out a cell phone.  He hits a button.

 INTERCUT BETWEEN ANDERSON / LISA AT THE JUDICIAL CENTER 
               Lisa sits in a meeting.  Her phone CHIRPS softly.  She glances
               at the display, then rises to take it.  She goes to a corner
               of the room.

 LISA                          Paul?

 ANDERSON                          Listen to me.

               Lisa presses her phone close to her ear.

 LISA                          I can hardly hear you.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 35. 

 ANDERSON                          I'm underground.  Weakens the signal
                         so it can't be picked up.

               Alarm moves across her face.

 LISA                          But we're on Secure

 ANDERSON                          Listen, dammit!  I'm going to murder
                         Ed.

               The Precogs picked it up.

               On Lisa -- can she have heard right?

 LISA                          Paul.  Paul His crackling voice
                         faintly comes through the phone.

 ANDERSON'S VOICE                          ... home.

               Lisa's phone goes dead.

 BACK TO ANDERSON 
               Anderson looks down a long row of parked Precrime ground
               transports.  They are sleek and menacing, the black shells
               lumpy with dangerous gadgetry.  In the distance, a POLICE
               OFFICER, holding an armful of equipment, opens the back of
               one of them.

               He looks up at Anderson's approach.  He puts his equipment
               down, and salutes.

 POLICE OFFICER                          Hello, sir.

               Anderson nods, moves close.

 ANDERSON                          What's your name, officer?

 POLICE OFFICER                          Bob, uh, Robert Smythe.

 ANDERSON                          These the new Python transports?

               The young officer turns and looks at the transport with pride,
               is about to speak, when Anderson touches a palm-sized Nova
               stun gun to the base of his neck.

 ANDERSON (CONT'D)                               (sincerely)
                         Sorry, Officer Smythe.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 36. 

               The officer buckles.  Anderson catches him, rolls him gently
               into the back of the transport.

               Then Anderson quickly reaches into the transport, and begins
               stuffing equipment into a duffel bag: a helmet and black
               uniform, the weapon-glove, a folded rifle, a holographic
               scanner, and other equipment whose function we can only guess
               at.

               Anderson looks up at a sound, echoey FOOTSTEPS.  They
               approach, then fade away.

               Anderson places the officer's hands and legs together, then
               aims a nozzled cylinder at them.  He shoots a spray of blue
               BindFoam chemical restraint, sticking the man to the floor
               of the transport in an adhesive glob.

               Then he leaves the scene, running.

 INT. ANDERSON'S CHEVY 
               Anderson grips the wheel of his Chevy, driving down 1-95.
               The fact that he can't control his car -- that the steering
               wheel has no function, his speed is predetermined, and his
               direction is guided by satellite -- is maddening now.

               From inside the cars that glide along beside him people turn
               and look curiously at the man who is actually gripping his
               steering wheel.

               Anderson slams it with his fist.  Through his windshield
               Anderson sees a four year old boy in the driver's seat of a
               passing red and black Ford.  His mother sits in the
               passenger's seat, blithely reading.  The boy mimics Anderson,
               gleefully slams his steering wheel too, then laughs.

               Anderson turns and looks the other way, into the distance,
               at the "Sprawl,' the vast unzoned city attached to Washington
               D.C. You can see it in his face: a man could lose himself in
               there.

 EXT. POTOMAC PARK 
               Anderson stands on an embankment.  He holds the Precog disc
               in his hand, ready to throw it into the river.

               He stands like that ... and then slowly lets his hand drop.
               He doesn't do it.

 INT. ANDERSON'S HOME - SUBURBS -- LATER 
               Lisa enters the house, in a rush.  Every shade is drawn.
               Paul Anderson sits in an overstuffed chair, absolutely
               motionless, like a man who has died suddenly.

 ANDERSON                          Don't move.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 37. 

               Lisa doesn't get it.  She continues toward him.

 ANDERSON (CONT'D)                          Stop!  Moving heats you up, makes it
                         easier for them to pick you up on
                         their thermals.

               She looks at him, scared, stops in her tracks.  She is
               suddenly suffocating.

 LISA                          It's a hundred degrees in here.

 ANDERSON                          I turned the furnace all the way up.
                         Your hair dryer.  The oven.  If they
                         come, it'll buy me twenty seconds.
                         Maybe thirty.

 LISA                          Nobody's coming for you.

               Anderson stares at her.

 LISA (CONT'D)                          On the phone -- what you said.  It's
                         impossible.

               She shakes her head in disbelief.  Anderson speaks, choking
               on the words.

 ANDERSON                          I'm going to kill Ed Witwer.

 LISA                          It's not true.

               Anderson's right hand hangs over the side of his armchair.
               We see the bright DISC cupped in the palm.  He seems about
               to reveal it to her, but doesn't, yet.  He keeps staring at
               her intently.  Something is holding him back.

 LISA (CONT'D)                          You're upset.  You've been unhappy.
                         There's a lot of pressure on you.
                         And then Frank ...

 ANDERSON                          One week from today.  Tuesday, June
                         25, at five-twenty in the morning.
                         I shoot him, Lisa.

 LISA                               (beat)
                         You need to take time off.

               Anderson laughs harshly.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 38. 

 ANDERSON                          You don't have to worry about that.

               She steps toward him.

 LISA                               (gently)
                         I want to hold you.

 ANDERSON                          If you love me, stand there.  And
                         don't move.

               Tears well in her eyes.

 ANDERSON (CONT'D)                          I saw the disc, Lisa.  I shoot him.
                         In the chest.  And he dies.  I've
                         watched a thousand murders.  This
                         time I star in one.

 LISA                          Something's wrong.  You wouldn't do
                         it.

 ANDERSON                          The Precogs are never wrong.  They
                         emit a single disc.  "The immutable
                         evidence of the infallible system."

               The room is terribly hot, his words -- she begins to sway
               unsteadily.

               Anderson focuses on her.  Her face.  Her hair ...

 LISA                          We'll figure this out.  We'll review
                         the system.

 ANDERSON                          There is no review.  There's only
                         the disc.  It Shows My guilt.  There's
                         no defense.

               Her long hair.  He stares.

 LISA                          You can't run.  Please, let's --

               A SOUND outside.  They both turn.  A deep silence.  The
               furnace churns out heat.  And Anderson looks at Lisa's hair
               ... and finally understands.

               Slowly, and very carefully, Anderson slides the DISC back
               into his pocket.  He rises from his chair.  For the first
               time he goes to her, reaches out, and touches her hair.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 39. 

 ANDERSON                          Last week.  It was strange.  I watched
                         from the bathroom window.  You went
                         out in the backyard to make a call.

               She looks at him.

 ANDERSON (CONT'D)                          An appointment, you said.  For a
                         haircut that afternoon.

               Lisa's hand jumps to her hair.

 ANDERSON (CONT'D)                          You didn't get your hair cut.  You
                         went to the trouble of calling first
                         thing in the morning.  It was that
                         important ...

               She reaches for him.  He pulls away.

 LISA                          Stop it!  Paul, please.  You're
                         panicking.  Everything's going to
                         look wrong.  You're going to distrust
                         everybody and everything now.

               Lisa implores him.

 LISA (CONT'D)                          You can't distrust me.
                              (beat)
                         It was Ed I called.

               Anderson cocks his head.

 ANDERSON                          Ed.  why outside?  Why lie about it?

 LISA                          Stop being a cop and listen to me!

               A booming, electronically altered VOICE suddenly penetrates
               the walls of the house from outside.

 VOICE (O.S.)                          Director Anderson!  There is no
                         escape!

               Anderson, betrayed, glares at his wife.  She's frantic.

 LISA                          Your birthday's tomorrow!  We wanted
                         to...

               But be's already on the move, running for the upstairs.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 40. 

 VOICE (O.S.)                          Drop to your hands and knees and
                         stay there.  Precrime is entering
                         your house!

               Lisa screams, as her front door is sonically BLASTED off its
               hinges, and a swarm of Precrime officers in mirrored helmets
               hurtle in.

 LISA                          Paul!

	       They move past her and spread through the rooms and up the 
               stairs like a disease in fast motion.

 UPSTAIRS 
               Helmeted officers hold their gloved right bands palm out,
               scanning rooms for thermal presence.

               An OFFICER 1 steps out of a small room.  He speaks, his voice
               electronically altered.

 OFFICER 1                          He's got a hair dryer going.  Screwed
                         up my reading.

               The others nod.

 OFFICER 2                          We're not picking up shit.

               They rush into rooms, with increased urgency.  We follow
               OFFICER 1 as he moves counter to the group and down the
               stairs.

               He hesitates as he moves through the living room, which is
               awash in personnel.  Lisa stands against the wall, pale and
               shaken.  He looks at her for a long beat, then steps over
               the shattered door and out into the sunlight.

 OUTSIDE 
               Everywhere else in the neighborhood it is green and calm.
               But Anderson's house looks like a wasps's nest someone has
               kicked.  Four Precrime hovercrafts are suspended above it,
               engines WHINING.  Black Python transports are all over the
               street out in front, and more keep coming.

               And everywhere on foot, there are Precrime police.  OFFICER
               I approaches a Python ground transport.  Another officer
               guards it, weapon out, his head turning right to left.  He
               settles on OFFICER 1's approach and raises his weapon.

               OFFICER 1 doesn't even break stride.  He walks right up to
               the guard -- and then right through him.  A holograph decoy.
               OFFICER 1 enters the Python.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 41. 

 INSIDE THE PYTHON 
               OFFICER 1 removes his helmet -- it's Anderson.  And then
               comes the moment of truth -- have they cancelled his
               IdentiScan access to Precrime vehicles yet?

               A little scanner arm arches down from the visor, and flashes
               a red beam into his eyes.  Anderson presses his lips together.
               The Python turns on, and a generated voice greets him.

 VOICE                          Paul Anderson 0256 clear.

               Anderson grips the steering wheel.  But his time, since it
               is a law enforcement.  Vehicle, the steering actually works.
               Anderson pulls out.

               FROM ABOVE, as the Python transport slips away from the chaos.

               THEN HIGHER, and we see that the direction the Python is
               headed will take it from the green of the suburbs, through
               the white of Washington, and into the dark of The Sprawl.

 INT. PRECRIME HEADQUARTERS -- DAY 


               Ed Witwer sits alone in an antechamber.  He stares at an
               oversized oak door, then looks down at the floor.

               He runs both hands through his hair.  He is tired, his eyes
               weary, lost.

               A voice comes over the intercom.

 VOICE                          Enter now please, Assistant Director
                         Witwer.

               Witwer pulls himself together, and opens the door.

 INT. A CONFERENCE ROOM 
               Witwer takes a seat at the end of a long table.

               Powerful men sit at the other end of the table.  SWANSON,
               sharp-boned, the FBI Director.  CRONIN, awl-like eyes, the
               CIA Director.  Senator Malcolm.  Chief Justice POLLARD, whose
               face reveals nothing.  Vice-President ALMER, whose tongue
               darts across his dry lips unsettlingly.  Unpleasant looking
               men in an unpleasant mood.

               Cronin looks up from a printout he's been reading and stares
               at Witwer.

 CIA CRONIN                          The central question is: Why does
                         Anderson want to kill Witwer?

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 42. 

               Cronin holds up the printout.

 CIA CRONIN (CONT'D)                          We checked your finances.  His
                         finances.  Nothing irregular, you
                         don't steal from him, he doesn't
                         steal from you.  You haven't done
                         anything that he might have
                         discovered, and vice versa.

               Swanson holds up another sheath of papers.

 FBI SWANSON                          Personnel checks reveal no ambitious
                         coups planned by you to topple him.
                              (beat)
                         He's done nothing to you, or you to
                         him.

               Witwer presses his lips together.

 VICE-PRESIDENT ALMER                          You fucking his wife?

 WITWER                          No.

 FBI SWANSON HIS MOTHER? HIS BROTHER? 
               Witwer gives him a bad look.

 FBI SWANSON (CONT'D)                          Okay.  There we are.

 JUSTICE POLLARD                          So, you are friends, partners, and
                         soul mates.  Anderson has no motive.

 WITWER                          I can't think of one.
                              (beat)
                         Maybe JUSTICE POLLARD The Precogs
                         are mistaken?

               Witwer looks away.  Jesus, he wants out of this room.

 JUSTICE POLLARD                          You don't believe that, do you?

 WITWER                               (barely audible)
                         No.  The Precogs are infallible.

               Senator Malcolm is impatient with all this.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 43. 

 SENATOR MALCOLM                          You're goddam right.  So, gentlemen
                         -screw the motive.  We got a
                         pre-murderer on the run, and a nasty
                         little PR problem.

               The very powerful men level their unpleasant gazes on Witwer.

 VICE-PRESIDENT ALMER                          And here is our solution.  You are
                         now Director Witwer.

               Witwer shakes his head, starts to protest.  Almer silences
               him with a raised finger.

 VICE-PRESIDENT ALMER (CONT'D)                          Precrime must demonstrate its
                         willingness to go after one of its
                         own.  Total impartiality.

 WITWER                          Now look--

               Cronin talks right over him.

 CIA CRONIN                          The public must believe that every
                         future murderer is pursued with equal
                         vigor.

 FBI SWANSON                          Therefore, Precrime will put in charge
                         the man best suited to the job.  And
                         who would pursue a murderer harder
                         ... than his intended victim?

 JUSTICE POLLARD                          You went after Anderson yesterday
                         -because it was right, and because
                         you believe.

               Almer speaks with a tight irony.

 VICE-PRESIDENT ALMER                          And your belief will certainly grow
                         stronger with each tick of the clock.

               Witwer looks at the men with thinly-veiled hatred.  But he
               does not deny their words.

 JUSTICE POLLARD                          Haw long will it take, Director?

               Wiltwer takes a long breath, concentrates his mind on the
               task he can't avoid.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 44. 

 WITWER                          He knows Precrime, of course.  And
                         the streets -- he's rusty, but he'll
                         remember how to work them.  It'll
                         come back to him fast.  He's ... the
                         best.

               Witwer almost smiles.  Justice Pollard's not smiling.

 JUSTICE POLLARD                          We're not here to praise Caesar --
                         we're here to bury him.

               Witwer looks at Pollard, then lifts a finger and touches his
               right eye.

 WITWER                          He can't avoid iris identification.
                         Every door he opens, every ATM he
                         uses, or taxi or transport he boards
                         -- he'll get scanned.
                              (quietly)
                         It won't take long to find him.  

	       The eyes that look back at Witwer are unblinking.

 EXT. THE SPRAWL NIGHT 
               The unzoned city is full of 1950's iconography, but it all
               feels different than it did in the suburbs.  Where the burbs
               were Ike, the city is Joseph McCarthy.

               The fat Ramblers and Studebakers have a little grime on them.
               The women's dresses are tighter and more urgent, the men's
               suits have some shine at the elbows.  You look over your
               shoulder here, move faster, and smile a lot less.

               And some streets you don't go on at all.  Anderson's Python
               moves down one of them.  He stops under a blackened suspension
               bridge, gets out.  He's still in uniform.  He holds a duffel
               bag.

               He starts to walk away from the Python, then hesitates.
               He's left the door open.  He shakes his head at his
               sloppiness.  Goes back and shuts the door.  Walks away again.

 INSIDE THE CAR 
               He's left a small DEVICE on the passenger's seat.  Digital
               numbers shoot by in reverse.  Something CLICKS.

 OUTSIDE THE CAR 
               Anderson continues walking away.  He doesn't look back as
               the Python is engulfed in a miniature sun of heat and flame.
               It's not a gasoline powered vehicle -- so it doesn't explode.
               It just ceases to exist.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 45. 

 EXT. ORANGE DRY CLEANERS - -- NIGHT LATER 
               Through a smeared window Anderson sees racks of suits and
               dresses hanging in clear plastic bags.  He gets to work on
               the door.

 INT. ANDERSON'S HOUSE -- NIGHT 
               Lisa lies in her bed, alone in the dark.  She listens to an
               almost inaudible sound, a high WHINE.

 EXT. ANDERSON'S HOUSE 
               A Precrime HOVERCRAFT floats high above her house, a dark
               moon in the low clouds.

 EXT. ORANGE DRY CLEANERS -- EARLY MORNING 
               A worker stands in the back of the store puzzling over the
               clean clothes piled on the floor.  It almost looks like a
               nest, like someone slept there

 EXT. SUBWAY LATER 
               Anderson, in a blue suit and fedora, carrying his duffel
               bag, stands on a subway platform.  He takes out a cell phone,
               dials a number.  He looks up at the SOUND of a train.

               The approaching MagLev train has a lit sign on its front
               car: "33rd Street Express."

 CUT TO: 
 INT. PRECRIME HEADQUARTERS 
               Search and Command room.  Witwer moves up and down the aisles,
               past technicians who man computers and holographic tracking
               displays.

               A Precrime TECHNICIAN 1 suddenly sits upright.  Witwer picks
               him out of the crowd and zeroes in.

 TECHNICIAN                          It's Anderson.

               Witwer grabs a phone, punches a button

 WITWER                          Paul! 
                The technicians scramble to pinpoint Anderson on a
               Glowing holographic MAP.

               Another TECHNICIAN 2 calls out to Witwer.  Witwer covers his

 ANDERSON                          Why am I going to kill you,Ed?

 INTERCUT:ANDERSON ON THE SUBWAY /WITWER AT PRECRIME 
 WITWER                          There's no motive

 ANDERSON                          My wife calling you before breakfast?

 WITWER                          We were planning a surprise party.
                         It was going to be today.
                              (beat, ironic)
                         Happy birthday, partner.

 ANDERSON                          This party's no fun, Ed. It's a hell
                         of a surprise, though.
                              (beat)
                         I'm having trouble trusting people,
                         Ed, I gotta tell you.

               At Precrime, they upload a MAP DISPLAY of the Express train's
               route.  We see a blue light moving -- the train.  And two
               separate red dots along its route.

               An OFFICER points at the dots, and speaks to Witwer in a low
               voice.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 47. 

 OFFICER                          The train makes two stops, here and

 WITWER                          I'm here.  You gotta come in, Paul .

 ANDERSON                          I'm a Cop, Ed. I need a motive.

 WITWER                          Come in.  We'll figure this thing

 ANDERSON                          I saw a news flash.  You're the new
                         Director.  Is that the point of this?

 WITWER                          Fuck you.

               Anderson smiles.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 48. 

 ANDERSON                          Didn't think so.  But it has to be
                         something, Ed.

               Witwer looks at the DISPLAY MAP.  We see the blue train
               nearing its first stop, 20th street.  We see two waves of
               lighted green dots -- Precrime units heading for 20th and
               33rd.

 WITWER                          Paul.  Come in.

               Anderson sees an overhead light come on in the train: "Next
               Stop 20th Street.

 ANDERSON                          If I come in, it puts me close to
                         you.  If I get close ... I may kill
                         you.  I can't risk that.
                              (beat)
                         Anyway, they'd force you to lock me
                         up.  And that'd be it -- I'd never
                         get my chance to solve this thing.

               Witwer needs to keep him talking

 WITWER                          You're kinds liking this, in a way,
                         aren't you?  The action ...

 ANDERSON                          And you get to be a real cop again.
                         We get to flex our muscles.

 CUT TO: 
 EXT. 20TH STREET SUBWAY STATION 
               Precrime vehicles pull up.  Hovercrafts appear in the sky
               above.

 CUT TO: 
 INT. 20TH STREET SUBWAY STATION 
               Anderson's train is just finishing off-loading passengers.
               The doors close and the train begins to pull out as the first
               helmeted Precrime officers flood the platform.

               One of them points.

 CLOSE ON: A TRAIN WINDOW 
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 49. 

               Anderson is visible through the window, talking on his cell
               phone.

 CUT TO: 
 INT.PRECRIME HEADQUARTERS 
               Witwer stares at the map.  The train has stopped at 20th
               street.  But Anderson's still talking.  He isn't getting off
               -- he's going on to 33rd Street, the last stop.

               Technician 2 presses his earphone close, listens, then calls
               over to Witwer.  Witwer covers his mouthpiece.

 TECHNICIAN 2                          We have visual verification -- he's
                         still on the train.

               Witwer gives him a thumb's up.  We STAY ON Witwer as he
               listens to Anderson, and watches his train move toward 33rd
               on the MAP.

 ANDERSON'S VOICE                          I want to tell you something, partner.
                         You listening?

               Witwer nods.  Now the MAP shows all the Precrime units
               swarming toward the 33rd Street subway station.

 WITWER                          Yeah.

 ANDERSON'S VOICE                          I gotta do this.  I have to figure
                         this thing out.
                              (beat)
                         But listen to me now.  If it was you
                         running, I'd come after you, Ed.

               Witwer stares at the MAP, at all the units he's sent after
               his friend.

 ANDERSON'S VOICE (CONT'D)                          You're a cop.  And I'm a future
                         murderer.
                              (beat)
                         Do your job, Ed. Come after me hard.
                         Because, Jesus Christ, I wouldn't
                         sleep or eat until I had tracked you
                         down and put a gun to your head.

 EXT. 33RD STREET SUBWAY 
               Precrime officers pour down the stairs toward the train
               platform.

 CUT TO: 
 INT. PRECRIME HEADQUARTERS 
               Witwer watches on the MAP at all the little symbols merging
               together, like a gameboard -- but this game ends in a reallife
               confrontation between one man and an army of them.

 WITWER                          You wouldn't shoot a cop would you,
                         Paul?
                              (beat)
                         Paul?  Paul? 

	       He looks urgently to the phone technician

 TECHNICIAN 1                          He's still on the line.

               Witwer presses his ear to the phone.  He can hear the subway
               make its STOP.  Then he hears a chorus of mechanized VOICES
               -the voices of the Precrime police, the SCREAMS of panicked
               passengers

 VOICES ON ANDERSON'S PHONE                          Police.  Everyone down on your hands
                         and knees!
                              (then)
                         Oh, shit.

 CUT TO: 
 INT.SUBWAY TRAIN 
               The Precrime officers aim the index barrels of their
               gloveweapons at ANDERSON, who sits blithely on a seat, holding
               his cell phone to his ear.

               Anderson begins to shimmer, then dematerialize ghost-like,
               into nothingness.  He was a holographic decoy.

               What is actually there on the train seat is Anderson's cell
               phone.  Rigged to its mouthpiece is a tiny digital voice
               recorder.

 CUT TO: 
 INT. 20TH STREET SUBWAY 
               Anderson trots up the stairs and safely out onto the streets
               of The Sprawl.

 DISSOLVE TO: 
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 51. 

 EXT. STREET - THE SPRAWL -- NIGHT 


               Every city has its underbelly.  If you lifted the fat dark
               underbelly of The Sprawl this is where you'd end up.

               The streets here feel like alleys, clotted and tight.  There
               are streetlights, bright ones -- but the light dies at its
               source, never makes it through the sour air down to the
               ground.

               The retro fifties look comes apart here.  The people that
               you see -- and you only catch quick glimpses of them, they
               move like rats -- wear black mostly, tight fitting
               tech-fibers.

               ANDERSON'S caught one of the rats, a thin bald guy in black.
               Anderson has him pinned up against a wall.  They're having
               some kind of exchange -- which consists of the guy answering
               none of Anderson's questions, and Anderson pressing him harder
               against the wall.

               Finally, the guy does something odd.  He lifts a finger and
               pulls down Anderson's right lower eyelid.  Anderson lets
               him.  Then the guy does the same on the left.  Has a long
               look.  And then nods.  Anderson releases him, and they go
               off together.

 EXT. AN APARTMENT BUILDING -- LATER 
               An oppressive brick thing on a side street.  The facade is
               crumbling.  Nothing good happens in a building like this..

               The guy leads Anderson to the building, then scurries off
               into the night.

 INT. ROOM -- LATER 
               A stained overstuffed chair in the corner, a dreary little
               kitchen with crusted dishes in the sink.

               But jarringly, in the center of all this, is a make-shift
               hypertech medical setup: a gleaming operating table, an array
               of lasers, scalpels and surgical equipment, an anesthesia
               console.

               Anderson sits in a chair facing DOC.  DOC is a big man with
               delicate fingers.  He sneezes, then blows his nose hard into
               a handkerchief.

 DOC                          Got a cold.

               Anderson looks at him uneasily.  It's not just DOC -- it's
               the whole setup, the needles and scalpels, the medical thing,
               which Anderson truly does not care for.  Doc sneezes again,
               then looks up at his patient.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 52. 

 DOC (CONT'D)                          Don't worry.  I could cut open your
                         chest, sew a dead cat in there, and
                         you'd never get an infection.  Not
                         with the spectrum antibios I'll be
                         shooting into you.

 ANDERSON                          I'm not here for cat surgery, Doc.

               Doc chuckles.  Then he waits, expectantly.

               Anderson hands him a tiny opalescent card.  A preset cash
               card.  DOC slides it into small console, watches the numbers
               flash up.  He frowns, sighs.

 ANDERSON (CONT'D)                          It's all I could safely move

               He waits.  Doc's not thrilled, but finally, he nods.

 DOC                          Yeah.  All right.

               Time to got down to business.  Doc walks over to a large
               medical cabinet and opens the door.  It's full of EYES, and
               parts of eyes -- 611 !  A cryo-jars.

               Anderson tightens.

 DOC (CONT'D)                          You understand what I told you then.
                         I can't just give you new irises.
                         The Scanners will read the scar
                         tissue.  Alarms will go off.

 ANDERSOIN                          I'm a cop, I know

 DOC                          I gotta take your eyes out.

               Anderson knows this, too, wishes Doc would shut up ANDERSON
               Yeah.

 DOC (CONT'D)                          And put in new ones.

 ANDERSON                          Yeah.  I get it, DOC.

               Anderson rises up out of his chair and goes over to the
               operating table.  He lies down.

 ANDERSON (CONT'D)                          Do me quick before I run out of here.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 53. 

               Anderson lies there, blinking up at the ceiling.  He listens
               to Doc preparing instrument trays.  It's a bad sound.

 EXT. THE SPRAWL -- DAY 
               The suspension bridge where we saw Anderson vaporize the
               Python transport.  Witwer stands watching as a Precrime
               techno-unit sifts through the white ashes.

               Witwer lifts his face to the acrid breeze coursing off the
               Potomac.  It's a pose a track dog might hold, nose up, testing
               the air for a scent.

 INT. BOARDING HOUSE ROOM - THE SPRAWL -- DAY 
               We can't see anything at first, because Anderson can't see
               anything either.  He's in a deep post-surgical haze.  DOC'S
               voice comes to him.  It's warped and ugly.

 DOC'S VOICE                          Don't take the bandages off for twenty
                         four hours.  You'll go blind if you
                         do.

               Anderson makes an affirmative grunt. Now we see his
               surroundings, even though Anderson still can't.  He lies in
               a grungy bed, his head and eyes swathed in white dressings.
               Doc stands over him.

 DOC                          You're in a room.  I had you moved
                         here, a couple miles from my place.
                         If they find you, they don't find
                         me.

               Anderson grunts weakly.

 DOC (CONT'D)                          A guy will come in, feed you once.
                              (beat)
                         I juiced up the nano-reconstruction
                         around your new eyes, 'cause I know
                         you're in a hurry.

 ANDERSON                               (Fuzzily))
                         Nano-re ...construction.

 DOC                          Organic microrobots that reconstruct
                         nerves and blood vessels.  It'll
                         feel like fleas chewing on your
                         eyeballs.  Don't scratch.

               Anderson is already reaching his hands for his bandages.
               Doc forces them away.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 54. 

 DOC (CONT'D)                          I'm giving you a bonus, might come
                         in handy.  Feel this.

               Doc takes an air-syringe out of his pocket and touches it to
               Anderson's hand.

 DOC (CONT'D)                          It's a temporary paralytic enzyme.
                         Someone spots you, you duck into an
                         alley, shoot this under your chin.

               Doc presses the tip into the soft underpart of Anderson's
               chin.  Anderson jumps.

 DOC (CONT'D)                          The enzyme turns your facial muscles
                         to mush.  You won't look like the
                         same man.

 ANDERSON                          Jesus.

 DOC                          You tighten up again in about thirty
                         minutes.  Hurts like nothing you
                         ever felt.  It's vicious, but
                         effective.  I'll put it in your bag.

               Finally, Doc takes a small clock out of his pocket and places
               it on a dresser beside Anderson's bed.

 DOC (CONT'D)                          I'm setting up a timer.  When it
                         buzzes tomorrow, take off your
                         bandages, and get the hell out of
                         here.

               Anderson, groggy, starts to say something else, but then he
               hears a door open and close, and Doc is gone.

 EXT. THE SPRAWL -- NIGHT 
               The Precrime presence mounts on the streets.  A couple of
               units move past the boarding house, but they don't stop.

 INT. BOARDING HOUSE ROOM -- DAY 
               Anderson sits in a chair, his dressings like a blindfold.
               He looks like a hostage.  He is sweating.  Keeps reaching
               for his dressings to scratch, then forces himself not to.

               He speaks to someone we don't yet see.  The guy DOC said
               would come.

 ANDERSON                          I'm hungry, but sick to my stomach.
 (MORE) 
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 55. 

 ANDERSON (CONT'D)                          Guess I should eat.  
				(Beat) 
			 You gonna help feed me?

               Now the camera moves and we see who it is that has been sent
               to help Anderson.  It's the rat guy, the thin bald man
               Anderson had roughed up the day before.  The guy has a bowl
               of hot soup in his hands.  He stares contemptuously at
               Anderson.

 ANDERSON (CONT'D)                          So how do we do this, pal?

               The rat guy doesn't say a word.  He simply tips the hot soup
               and it splatters down into Anderson's lap.  Anderson cries
               out in pain and surprise.  The guy walks out of the room.

 CLOSE ON- THE TIMER 
               Twenty hours gone by.  Four more to go.

 EXT. THE SPRAWL 
               Precrime cops are shaking down any of the rats they can catch,
               looking for leads, looking for anything.

 INT. THE BOARDING ROOM 
               The TIMER shows one hour to go.  Anderson sits in a chair,
               squirming miserably.  His dressings are wet with sweat, and
               frayed and dirty at the edges where he has tugged and plucked
               at them.

 ANDERSON                               (to himself)
                         Fuck.

               He is this close to ripping the dressings off

 EXT. THE BOARDING HOUSE -- DAY 
               A Precrime transport stops.  Two officers get out.  One of
               them sets up a large thermal scanner on the sidewalk, and
               does a read on the boarding house.  The other does a read on
               a pawn shop and bar next door..

               The OFFICER 1 doing Anderson's boarding house, calls to the
               other officer.

 OFFICER 1                          Got 27 warm bodies in this place.
                         What should it take, three or four
                         Spiders?

 OFFICER 2                          Do four.  Speed things up, so we can
                         go eat.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 56. 

               The Officer 1 opens the back of the transport, and takes out
               a box.  He removes four round BALLS.  They are silver, as
               big as billiard balls.

               He goes up to the boarding house, gets IdentiScanned, and
               the front door opens.  He rolls the balls down a dark hallway.

               Then he goes back out to the transport, and leans against
               it, bored.  He holds up an electronic clipboard and waits
               for the data to come in.

 INT. THE BUILDING 
               The BALLS roll about eight feet, then suddenly come to
               autolife as they spin.  They open like flowers -- flowers
               with legs.

 CLOSE ON : A BALL 
               A fist-sized Spider takes shape.  On its head is an IdentiScan
               lens mounted on a thin metallic antenna.

 INT. A ROOM 
               An OLD WOMAN sits at a card table eating a bowl of something
               unidentifiable.  She looks up with annoyance as she sees a
               spider scuttling across the floor toward her.  It makes a
               CLICKING sound on the floor as it comes.  She's poor, living
               in The Sprawl -- she knows the drill.  She continues to eat
               as the SPIDER crawls up the leg of the card table.  She barely
               watches as it moves past her bowl and toward her hand.

 OLD WOMAN                          It's nice to have a little company

               She smiles toothlessly at her joke The Spider hops onto her
               am and inches up, then moves across her shoulder.  It grips
               her cheek lightly, as the IdentiScan antenna reads her eyes.

               Then it leaps off her and onto the floor and CLICKS away
               across the linoleum.

 EXT. THE BOARDING HOUSE 
               The Precrime officer lifts his clipboard and checks a column
               with his laser pen, and waits for the next one.

 INT. ANDERSON'S ROOM 
               Anderson sits in his chair.  He cocks his head, listening.
               His body tenses.  Something feels wrong.

               The TIMER shows ten minutes to go.  Blindfolded for a day
               and a night, Anderson has no idea how much time he has left.
               Three seconds, four hours?

               A flattened SPIDER squeezes under his door.  Anderson tenses
               as it CLICKS across the floor toward him.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 57. 

               He knows that sound.

               Anderson stumbles up and out of his chair.  He starts to
               grab at his dressings, remembers Doc's warning, and stops
               himself.  The SPIDER waits for him to settle, then CLICKS
               toward him again.

               Anderson moves around the room, avoiding the Spider.  He is
               dripping with sweat, starting to breathe hard.  The Spider
               comes faster.  Anderson crashes into a table, brings it down.
               Falls across the bed.

 EXT. THE BOARDING HOUSE 
               The Officer 1 squints at his clipboard.  One of the Spiders
               is taking too long.  He adjusts his thermal scanner, and
               sees the heat outline of a man bouncing around a room.

               The other Officer 2 finishes reading the pawn shop and the
               barroom, then wanders over to Officer 1. They both watch the
               screen.

 OFFICER 1                          Stinking drunk.

 OFFICER 2                               (beat)
                         Or a guy who doesn't want to get
                         read.

 INT. ANDERSON'S ROOM 
               Anderson forces himself to sit still, because he knows the
               consequences.  The Spider advances, starts up his leg.

               The TIMER has not buzzed.  Anderson can't touch his dressings.
               The Spider moves across his shoulder and onto his face.  It
               WHIRS and HUMS trying to adjust its antenna against the
               dressings.

 EXT. THE BOARDING HOUSE 
               The officers eye the thermal scanner, as they reach for their
               mirrored helmets, getting ready to go in.

 INT. ANDERSON'S ROOM 
               The Spider crawls all over Anderson's head, trying to get
               past the dressings for a read.

               Anderson has no choice.  None.  He starts to lift at his
               dressing.  The Spider senses his cooperation, freezes in
               place.

               Anderson wants to scream.  He unwraps his head, tugs the eye
               pads away from his eyes.  He rips them off.  The Spider sits
               on his shoulder, waiting.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 58. 

               Anderson's eyes are tightly closed.  He opens them

 ANDERSON'S POV - BLINDING LIGHT 
               Light brighter than a magnesium burn, brighter than a nuclear
               flashpoint.  Light to buckle the knees and push the brain
               beyond endurance.

               And though all this the faraway sound of a BUZZER going off.
               The TIMER has finally sounded.  Anderson's open eyes are
               streaming with tears, but he has survived the moment.

 ANDERSON'S POV - THE ROOM 
               It comes into slow focus The Spider, all business, reads his
               eyes.  Then, as if nothing unusual has occurred, it jumps
               off his shoulder, and crosses the floor.  It flattens, scoots
               under the door, and is gone.

 EXT. THE BOARDING HOUSE 
               The officers see that the Spider has gotten its read.  They
               pull off their helmets.

 OFFICER 1                          Let's eat.

               They start putting their equipment back into the transport.

 INT. ANDERSON'S ROOM 
               Anderson stares at himself in a dusty mirror.  His new eyes
               are tender and bloodshot.  And they are not blue, like the
               ones he was born with, but a deep brown.  Anderson is exactly
               the same, and utterly different.

               He grabs his duffel bag, and gets the hell out of there.

 INT. PRECRIME HEADQUARTER'S -- DAY 
               Lisa, looking drawn and scared, sits in Witwer's office.
               Witwer isn't looking too well, either.

 WITWER                          They told me to move into Paul's
                         office.  I said fuck you very much.

               Lisa nods.

 WITWER (CONT'D)                               (softly)
                         I don't want to do any of this, Lisa.

 LISA                          I know.  I know that.
 (MORE) 
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 59. 

 LISA (CONT'D)                               (beat)
                         Everybody's got their reasons for
                         wanting you in charge.  So do I --
                         you won't bring him in dead.

 WITWER                          Yeah.  But if he shoots a cop ...
                              (beat)
                         Which is what he does four days from
                         now, isn't it?

               Witwer's eyes imp involuntarily to a CLOCK on his desk.

 LISA                          He'd never hurt you.

 WITWER                          I know that.  But the other thing I
                         know is -- the Precogs are never
                         wrong.

               The words are leading them no place good.  They stop talking,
               and just sit there.

 INT. THE SPRAWL 
               Anderson stands on a street corner waiting in line with
               several people waiting for the N0.6 Turbo Tram.

               The double decker Tram comes.  People get off, then the line
               starts to move forward as people get on.

               Anderson fidgets.  He's last in line.  Each person gets
               IdentiScanned as he boards.  Anderson's putting his new eyes
               to the test.  If the scan goes wrong, he's positioned himself
               to run.

               The woman ahead of him, gets scanned, pays her fare.
               Anderson's turn.  Anderson goes up the steps, and a red beam
               reads his eyes.

               The Tram DRIVER glances at a monitor beside his steering
               wheel, then nods at him.

 DRIVER                          Welcome aboard, Mr. Symington.  Plenty
                         of seats in the back.

               Anderson nods, moves casually to the back.  But his jaw
               muscles are flexing hard, working off the tension.

 INT. A WEALTHY HOME - SUBBURIAN WASHINGTON -- NIGHT 
               Senator Malcolm releases a self satisfied little belch as he
               finishes off a late night whiskey in his panelled den.  He
               wanders about admiring himself in the many political photos
               adorning the cherry wood walls.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 60. 

               He's feeling cozy and safe, the way rich people can afford
               to.  No IdentiScan Spiders would ever be sent under his doors.
               No intrusions of any sort, nothing that a coiffed secretary
               or a loyal wife wouldn't announce before hand.

               Which is why he doesn't immediately understand the small
               SOUND at ear level, coming from just behind him.  It's a
               metallic CLICK-CLICK.  He turns amiably.  His eyes instantly
               widen, and his knees buckle when he sees he's looking into
               the barrel of ANDERSON'S cocked gun.

 ANDERSON                          Time to upgrade your alarm system,
                         Senator.

               Senator Malcolm tries to regain his composure.  His fear
               embarrasses him.

 ANDERSON (CONT'D)                          Your work-up of Witwer.  The Security
                         Panel would've done one.
                              (beat)
                         Why do I kill Witwer?

               The Senator finds his voice.

 SENATOR MALCOLM                          There's no motive.

 ANDERSON                          There's, always a motive.

               Anderson presses the gun to the Senator's forehead.  He slides
               the barrel tip back and forth across the Senator's sweaty
               skin.  It makes a greasy red mark.

 ANDERSON (CONT'D)                          I could've come to anyone on the
                         panel.  But I picked you.
                              (beat)
                         Of all the shits on that panel, I
                         like you least of all.  So if this
                         gun goes off, I'll feel bad, but
                         not, you know, devastated.

               You can almost see a thought dawning on Senator Malcolm.

               And then, shockingly he spits in Anderson's face, and turns
               and walks to the other side of the den.  His tone is mocking.

 SENATOR MALCOLM                          What the fuck was I worried about?
                         You can't kill me.  The Precogs
                         would've seen it.

               Anderson realizes this, too, lowers his gun.  The Senator is
               even laughing now.  For a moment Anderson does nothing, then
               he moves toward the Senator again.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 61. 

               The Senator stands his ground smugly.

 SENATOR MALCOLM (CONT'D)                          Witwer's clean.  You're clean.
                         There's nothing.  No motive.  Kind
                         of like something Kafka would've
                         cooked up.
                              (beat)
                         You like that, cockroach?  You're
                         fucked and you'll never know why.

               The Senator is laughing hard now.  Anderson lets him.

 ANDERSON                          Tell you something about the Precogs,
                         Senator.  They're great on murder.
                         But it's the little things they fail
                         to see.

               Anderson hits the Senator so hard it bounces him across the
               floor and into the cherry wood panelling.  Several of his
               beloved photos crash down onto him.

 ANDERSON (CONT'D)                          Little things like that, for instance.

               Anderson steps over him, and walks out of the room

 INT. PRECRIME HEADQUARTERS -- DAY 
               Search and Command room.  Witwer stands there amidst all of
               the technology speaking to a group of Precrime officers.

 WITWER                          He hasn't shown up on one goddamn
                         IdentiScan in three days.

               No one says anything, and then LIEUTENANT GLASER, 30, speaks
               up.

 LIEUTENANT GLASER                          He's found a room -- he's going to
                         sit it out.

 WITWER                          Yeah, except for holding a gun to
                         senator Malcolm's goddman head in
                         his own goddman house last night,
                         Anderson's sitting it out!
                              (beat)
                         Why hasn't he been scanned?

               The officers look at their shoes.

 WITWER (CONT'D)                          Why is he invisible?  He's moving
                         around but he isn't being seen.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 62. 

               Lieutenant Glaser tries again.

 LIEUTENANT GLASER                          Hes beating the scanners

 WITWER                          No one beats the scanners.

               Witwer reaches up, wearily, rubbing his face and eyes with
               his hands.  The fingers dragging across his eyes stop.  Then
               his hands drop away, and he looks at his men.

 WITWER (CONT'D)                          He's done his eyes

 LIEUTENANT GLASER                          But the scarring always

 WITWER                          He went the whole way.  The crazy
                         bastard had his eyes removed.  New
                         ones sewn in.

 LIEUTENANT GLASER                          That takes weeks to heal.

 WITWER                          If you're prepared to go blind, a
                         street surgeon'll juice up the repair
                         cycle.  They don't give a fuck about
                         risk.

               Witwer's eyes flick to a digital CLOCK on the wall.  It's
               something he can't help doing now.

 WITWER (CONT'D)                          He's going to do what it takes to
                         stay free -- if it blinds him, maims
                         him, or kills him.

               Witwers admiring smile makes his men very uncomfortable .

 INT. KITCHEN - THE SUBURBS -- DAY 
               A mother places a carton of milk on a table in front of her
               teenage son.  He pours it into his cereal bowl, then puts
               the carton down in front of him.

               There's a flexible Vid-Screen on the side of the carton,
               about the size of a playing card.  AS the sleepy kid watches,
               the disposable Vid-Screen sparkles to life.

               Nothing unusual, they always do that.  For advertisements,
               lost kids, or in this case crime bulletins.

               A good one.  The kid straightens up.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 63. 

 THE VID-SCREEN 
               A fully rotating mug shot of PAUL ANDERSON fills the screen,
               followed by vital statistics and details of the precrime
               he's been charged with.

               The kid watches for a while, then gets bored, and pulls the
               Dexi-Pops cereal box over and starts reading the back of
               that.

 INT. A LIVING ROOM - THE SPRAWL -- DAY 
               A big man in a tee shirt lies on a couch, a bowl of popcorn
               perched on his belly.  He stares at a TV monitor that's the
               size of a twin bed.

 TV 
               Anderson's face fills the monitor.  The TV image is so big
               that Anderson overwhelms the room with his video presence.
               It's like God coming to pay a visit -- even if you want to
               avoid Him you can't.

               The big man with the popcorn tries to do just that.  He surfs
               through a zillion channels, but Anderson's visage is
               omnipresent.

 EXT. THE SKY - THE SPRAWL -- DAY 
               Anderson's face fills the skies, too.  Witwer and Precrime
               have pulled out all the stops.

               Advertising dirigibles float by with Anderson's image on it.
               Holographic billboards with Anderson hover in the air.  There
               are so many Andersons in the sky he seems to be part of the
               weather, a special type of cloud.

               People on the streets look up, briefly interested, then go
               about their business.

 EXT. A STREET - THE SPRAWL 
               One person who is paying deep attention to all this is
               Anderson himself.  He stands on a street corner, wearing
               dark glasses and a fedora, staring at a public video kiosk.

 VIDEO KIOSK 
               The mug shot of Anderson disappears and is replaced by a
               Precrime SPOKESWOMAN.

 SPOKESWOMAN                          The United States Supreme Court has
                         issued a special injunction allowing
                         the unprecedented public viewing of
                         former Precrime Director Paul
                         Anderson's future murder of Edward
                         Witwer, the current Director.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 64. 

 ANDERSON                          His mouth slowly opens.  He steps
                         back against a wall and slides his
                         hand into his pants pocket.  He looks
                         at the Precog DISC in his cupped
                         hand, then quickly puts it away.

               He stares at the kiosk as people on the street begin to gather
               around excitedly.

               CROWDS OF PEOPLE look into the sky, in store windows, at
               other video kiosks.  They have the enthralled anticipation
               of a mob at a public guillotining.

 SPOKESWOMAN                          She continues her declamation

 SPOKESWOMAN (CONT'D)                          The video you are about to see,
                         generated by the Precognitive mutants,
                         is the immutable evidence of the
                         infallible system.
                              (reassuring smile)
                         Citizens are urged to call
                         1-800-PRECRIME with any information
                         that may lead us to the whereabouts
                         of Paul Anderson, future murderer.

 ANDERSON                          Shakes his head in confusion and
                         disbelief.  But he has the Precog
                         disc ...

               The OLD GUY him nudges him

 OLD GUY                          This oughtta be good, huh?

 VIDEO KIOSK 
               And there it is, Anderson and Witwer standing there pointing
               guns at each other.  The whole thing just as we saw it before.
               All the way through to the fatal moment.

 ANDERSON                          Oh, Ed ...

               Anderson shoots him.  Witwer slumps, dying.  The video stops.
               And then begins to play all over again, right from the start,
               the 1-800-PRECRIME number scrolling along the bottom of it.
               "Call now!  Call now!  Call now!

 ANDERSON (CONT'D)                          Moves quickly through the crowds.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 65. 

 INT. BAR - THE SPRAWL -- NIGHT 
               Ennis Page sits on a bar stool at the far end of a bar so
               full of cigarette smoke it doesn't seem capable of supporting
               life.  But it supports the kind of life Page is interested
               in.

               An emaciated woman with a feral smile slides onto a stool
               beside Page.  He gives one shake of his head, and she slides
               away again.  His eyes cut to a group of females.  He waits
               for the next approach.

 CLOSE ON: PAGE 
               as a HAND reaches over his shoulder and places a Precog disc
               on the bar in front of him.  Page makes a sound and tries to
               jump away, as if the disc is something lethal.  Which it is,
               in a way.

               Anderson presses him back down on his stool.  Sits next to
               him.  Page stares at him, scared.  Anderson looks straight
               ahead as he speaks.

 ANDERSON                          "Ennis Page engages the services of
                         prostitutes because his relationships
                         with them compound his feelings of
                         selfloathing."
                              (beat)
                         Direct quote from your psychological
                         profile -- the kind of shit I had to
                         know as your former boss.

 ANDERSON (CONT'D)                          "Page is an obsessive-compulsive
                         Type Nine." Another quote.  Niners
                         are great for the kind of work you
                         do -- keeping all those Precog discs
                         in order.

               You can almost see Page's heart slamming in his chest.  He
               tries to hide it with tough talk.

 PAGE                          I fuck whores and I'm orderly, so
                         what?

 ANDERSON                          Something's out of order, Ennis.
                         Deeply out of order.

               Page looks unhappily at the disc on the bar PAGE You got a
               disc Anderson picks it up, holds it tight in his fist

 ANDERSON (CONT'D)                          Not A disc.  The disc.  When I went
                         home sick, I stole it.
 (MORE) 
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 66. 

 ANDERSON (CONT'D)                          I took it with me, Ennis.  I wasn't
                         sick, I was running with the evidence.
                              (lets that sink in)
                         So how is it that Precrime has one,
                         too?

 PAGE                               (utterly baffled)
                         You can't make copies 

	       Anderson waits.  Lets Page work through it.

 PAGE (CONT'D)                          It's the basis of the system.  The
                         immutable evidence.  Copies are
                         impossible.
                              (beat)
                         You went home.  A little later, I
                         came in with a disc for Mr. Witwer
                         to review.  I wasn't halfway out the
                         door when he cried out.

               Anderson is barely breathing, he's listening so hard.

 PAGE (CONT'D)                          He was in shock.  He showed me.  It
                         was you shooting him.  Then all hell
                         broke loose.  He had to send the
                         Precrime units to your house.

 ANDERSON                          Ennis -- you gave out the same disc
                         twice.  Less than an hour apart.
                         The one I stole.  And then another
                         one.  Of the same event.

 PAGE                          It's impossible.  The Precogs can
                         only move forward to new events.
                         Into the future.  They never repeat.

               Anderson looks around.  Patrons are beginning to look over
               in his direction, eyes lingering.  He rises.

               Page seems in a daze.  As an obsessive-compulsive niner, the
               concept of an untidy system is disorienting.

               Anderson starts to say something to the man, then doesn't.

               On the way out Anderson gets IdentiScanned.  An automatic
               DIGITAL VOICE calls out after him.

 DIGITAL VOICE                          Have a nice night, Mr. Symington

	       Anderson leaves the dark of the bar for the deeper dark of The Sprawl.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 67. 

 INT. A STREET - THE SPRAWL -- DAY 
               A YOUNG GUY with a sparse moustache walks up to a payphone.
               He picks up, the receiver and immediately gets IdentiScanned.
               A light goes on, he's about to dial.

               Anderson appears out of nowhere, shoulders him out of the
               way.  The young guy drops the receiver and stumbles back
               onto the sidewalk.  Anderson grabs the hanging receiver.

 YOUNG GUY                          Hey!  Hey, you can't... 

	       He reaches for Anderson, then thinks better of it.  Anderson 
	       is twice his size and very menacing in dark glasses.

 YOUNG GUY (CONT'D)                          I'm gettin' a cop.

               The guy scurries off.  Anderson dials quickly.

 INTERCUT ANDERSON/LISAS OFFICE 
               Lisa, walking down a hallway in the Judicial Center, stops
               to answer her BEEPING cell phone.  She leans against a wall,
               as lawyers and judges pass by.

 ANDERSON                          It's me.

 LISA                          Paul.

               Lisa grips the phone and turns to the wall

 ANDERSON                          Your phone will be bugged.  So we
                         can't meet, we can't do anything.
                         Just listen.  Nowing you're listening
                         is enough.

               Lisa nods, as if he's right there.  He is right there, for
               her.  This is all she's got.

 ANDERSON (CONT'D)                          When Precrime stormed the house, I
                         thought you'd called them.  Betrayed
                         me.

 LISA                          No.

 ANDERSON                          I know.  Witwer sent them.  He saw
                         the disc and had to do his job.
                              (beat)
                         Tell me you forgive me.  Please.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 68. 

 LISA                          Of course, I forgive you.

               There's no time left.  He has to get off the line and start
               moving again.  A vast weariness enters his voice.

 ANDERSON                          All these people I need to forgive
                         me.
                              (beat)
                         Do you think Frank forgave me?  All
                         I could do for him was send him
                         gardenias.
                              (long beat)
                         I love you.

               Lisa almost cries out when he hangs up.  She flattens herself
               against a wall.  She stays like that for a long moment,
               pulling the sound of her husband's voice, his words, deep
               inside of herself.

               And then she gets a look, as one of those words registers
               profoundly.

 LISA                               (whispers to herself)
                         Frank hated gardenias.

 EXT. EAST END CEMETERY - ARLINGTON -- LATER 
               A public cemetery along the Potomac.  There's not much land
               left for new graves.  A funeral is taking place.  A lot of
               mourners in dark 1950's suits and dresses.  The service is
               nearing its end.

               Frank D'Ignazio's newly dug grave is nearby.  Lisa stands
               there, looking at the temporary marker, and the flowers and
               wreaths piled up against it.

               Two rows over, they are lowering the casket into the ground.

               High in the sky, a PRECRIME HOVERCRAFT, everpresent in Lisa's
               life, floats in the low clouds with a barely audible WHINE.

               Lisa rests a floral arrangement against the pile of flowers.
               Her hand drifts near a white GARDENIA WREATH.  There is a
               small envelope tucked beneath a blossom.  She takes it.

               Then she rises and begins to walk back to her car.

               The funeral is over, and the mass of mourners, many wearing
               dark glasses, fan out toward a long line of cars.

               One of the MOURNERS brushes past Lisa.  She looks up and he
               tips his dark glasses down onto his nose and stares over
               them at her.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 69. 

               It's Anderson.  Isn't it?  She looks into his eyes.  And
               it's jarring, the blue eyes gone, that they're brown now.
               But it's him, he's there, and she wants to reach out for
               him.  Knows she can't.

               He's already moving on.  He's risked everything for a look.
               He slips into the black sea of mourners, she goes to her car
               -neither of them ever breaking stride.

               The Precrime craft hovers, unaware

 INT. LISA'S CAR 
               Lisa opens the envelope as her car drives her down the
               Alexandria-Washington ConnectWay.

               A Precog DISC falls into her hand.  Her mouth opens -- she's
               never held one before.

               And there is a NOTE with it It READS:

               "The Precogs generated duplicate discs.  This is the first.
               Precrime has the second.  Duplicates.  Why?"

 EXT. A CONVENIENCE STORE - THE SPRAWL -- DAY 
               Anderson has to eat bad food quickly, and on the run.  He
               gathers up a wrapped sandwich, a bag of donuts, something to
               drink.

               He waits in line.  He doesn't like to be in a line, waiting.
               The woman ahead of him argues about change.  He presses his
               lips together.

               And then he glances at the mirrored surface of a hidden camera
               DOME attached to the ceiling.  It gives him a fish eye
               reflected VIEW of what's happening behind him.

               Precrime police are happening behind him.  He doesn't stop
               to ponder, as two Python transports zoom up outside the store.

               Anderson vaults the counter, knocking the customer and the
               clerk to the floor.

 INT. BACK ROOM 
               Anderson plows over a guy filling a trash can.  He hears the
               mechanically altered COMMANDS of a Precrime officer calling
               from the store.

 VOICE                          Paul Anderson.  Drop to your hands
                         and knees!

               Anderson crashes out into an alley, and clambers up a fence.
               SONIC BLASTS shatter the air around him.  Chunks of brick
               fly off the walls on both sides.  But he is full of
               adrenaline, and there is no stopping him.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 70. 

 INT. A TURBOTRAM - THE SPRAWL -- LATER 
               A different part of the city.  Anderson hunkers low in the
               back seat of a tram.

               He looks up, as the DRIVER swears

 DRIVER                          What the hell --

               Anderson stands up, looks down the aisle, through the
               windshield.  Precrime transports are heading straight at the
               tram, going the wrong way on a one way avenue.

               They've even taken radio control of the P.A. system on the
               tram.

 VOICE                          Paul Anderson.  Drop to your hands
                         and knees!

               Anderson can't believe it -- how are they suddenly pinpointing
               him?  The passengers turn in unison like cattle, and stare
               at him, terrified.

               Anderson grabs his duffel bag and kicks at the back exit
               doors, smashing them open, and tumbles out onto the street.

               He rolls, and is up on his feet in a second, reaching into
               his bag for a glove.  He pulls the weapon onto his right
               hand, as he whirls around sizing up his predicament.

               Precrime transports have begun to seal off both ends of the
               street.  He looks up.  He is surrounded by skyscrapers and
               buildings -- he is walled in, at the bottom of an urban
               canyon.

               People freeze against the sides of buildings, run into
               doorways where they can.  Passengers in trans and taxis or
               cars stay there, pressed against their windows watching.

               Nothing moves, except the Python transports, closing in.
               The lead officer speaks, with that menacing electronically
               altered VOICE.

 VOICE (CONT'D)                          Lower your weapon, or we will
                         neutralize your threat potential.

               The Precrime police are out of the transports now, advancing
               at either end of the city street in phalanxes of men.

               Anderson eyes the side of the black granite office building
               closest to him.

 ANDERSON'S POV - A HIGH PRESSURE HYDRANT 
               The large red hydrant sits a few inches out from the building.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 71. 

               Anderson almost smiles as he begins to walk slowly toward
               it, his weapon pointing harmlessly at the pavement.

 VOICE (CONT'D)                          Do not move!

               Anderson is up on the sidewalk now, two feet out from the
               building, right beside the high pressure hydrant.

               He stops, looks up, looks down, looks at the police advancing.
               It is a moment for prayer.  Anderson doesn't have a moment.

               He spreads his feet and fires a massive SONIC BLAST down at
               the sidewalk.  The effect on the underground water main is
               immediate.

               A GEYSER of water two feet in diameter erupts straight up
               from the sidewalk, lifting the tumbling Anderson fifteen
               feet into the air right alongside the building.

               The stunned police officers try to take aim, but Anderson's
               bouncing at the top of the geyser.  And they can't fire,
               anyway, because officers workers stare at the excitement
               from every window in the building.

               All this in a time span of seconds.  The world spins crazily
               for ANDERSON, but he manages to grip hold of a metal support
               beam holding the building's sign, one story up.

               The police try to see what he's doing, but the torrent of
               water from the water main break obscures his moves.

               He pulls himself onto a ledge, steadies himself, slides along
               it toward a second story window.  The office building gawkers
               lurch backward from the window as Anderson blasts it to
               sparkling dust and leaps inside.

 INT. OFFICE BUILDING 
               The building covers almost an entire city block.  Anderson,
               dripping wet, runs from one end of it to another, blasting
               through doors, shoving terrified workers out of the way.

               He is like a wide receiver running the length of the field,
               jumping obstacles, slamming through, over, and around whatever
               he must to get to his goal.

               And then he reaches his goal -- the windows overlooking the
               avenue next block over and parallel to the one where Precrime
               ambushed him.

               He spots a double-decker TurboTram moving slowly in the stream
               of traffic.  It pulls to the curb below to pick up passengers.

               Anderson blasts out the window and leaps onto the roof of
               the bus.  It is a bone-jarring landing.  He loses
               consciousness for a second, rolls the length of the roof,
               and slides off it onto the pavement.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 72. 

               He lies there, trying to rouse himself.  Traffic brakes to a
               stop automatically as car and truck sensors read his form in
               the road.  No one wants to touch him.  A single car horn
               SOUNDS, and then a chorus of them.

               Anderson rouses, struggles to his feet, and takes off in a
               limping run.

 INT. SUBWAY STATION LATER 
               Anderson, out of breath and in pain, leans against a post at
               the far end of the passenger platform.  There are tracks on
               either side of him, one marked "Uptown" and the other
               "Downtown. "

               He feels a blast of air and looks to his right and sees that
               the Downtown train is coming in.  And on his left, too, the
               Uptown train rounds the bend and comes into view.

               Which MagLev train will lead him to safety?  Which one won't
               they pinpoint?  He runs up to a teenage KID who has his arm
               around his girlfriend.  They step back, startled.  He's got
               a flat top hair cut, she wears a pleated skirt and saddle
               shoes.

               The trains pull in.

 ANDERSON                          Pick one for me!

 KID                          What?

 THEY TRY TO WALK AWAY 
 ANDERSON                          Point to the train I should take.
                         Please.

 KID                          I don't know.

               The girl lifts a nervous finger and points.  The Uptown.  He
               runs to board it, as they run in the opposite direction to
               the Downtown.

 INT. SUBWAY CAR 
               He sits at the back of the half empty train watching the
               dark rush by.  A train chosen arbitrarily -- it's impossible
               they could find him.

               A station Stop.  He starts to get off, is actually on the
               platform, then steps back onto the train.

               The rushing dark again.  When the MagLev eases to a halt at
               the next station he gets off this time.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 73. 

 INT. STATION 
               He walks toward the exit stairs with a handful of people.
               He eases back and lets them go up first.

 THE STAIRS 
               Precrime officers crouch around the bend, silently snatching
               people out of the way as they come into view.  They wait
               -but Anderson does not come.  And he does not come.

               On signal, the Precrime officers rush down the stairs.

 DOORWAY ABOVE THE STAIRS 
               ANDERSON hangs high above the doorway near the ceiling,
               adhered by one arm there by a blue glob of adhesive BindFoam.

 ANDERSON'S POV - THE OFFICERS 
               as they run below him down the stairs.  They go out of sight,
               he can hear them rushing along the platform searching for
               him.

               The strain of hanging by one arm is killing him.  He reaches
               up.  With a laser knife, and cuts away at his coat sleeve,
               releasing himself from the glob.  He drops to the stairs,
               and instantly slips up them.

               He surprises a helmeted OFFICER, just around the bend.  He
               slams HIM against the wall, yanks off his helmet, and holds
               the laser knife against his throat.

               The OFFICER 1s clearly terrified.  He speaks hoarsely through
               Anderson's choking grip.

 OFFICER                          Don't kill me!  Jesus.  Please.

               Anderson looks at the panicked officer.  Anderson closes his
               eyes trying to put it together.  He opens them.

 ANDERSON                          But the Precogs would've predicted
                         me killing you.  You'd know whether
                         I do or not.

               The officer looks at him with eyes begging for mercy.
               Anderson suddenly gets it.  He tightens his grip on the man.

 ANDERSON (CONT'D)                          They shut down the system.  Haven't
                         they?  They've shut down the Precogs.

               The officer nods.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 74. 

 OFFICER                          They're off homicides.  They're
                         redirecting them to help us locate
                         you.

               Which is how they knew where he'd be every time.

               Anderson chops quickly at the base of the man's skull,
               knocking him out.  And then he runs, because what else can
               he do?

 INT. JUDICIAL CENTER -- DAY 
               Lisa stands in a long hallway outside a door, labeled:
               COURTROOM 17.  She holds a briefcase in one hand.  Down the
               hall, other courtrooms are in use, but not this one.  She
               enters the dark and vacant Courtroom 17.

 INT. COURTROOM 17 
               Lisa sits at the judge's bench in the empty courtroom.  The
               lights are dim.

               She takes a small, battery-powered tv out of her briefcase.
               She turns it on.

 TV 
               The murder of Witwer by Anderson is being shown over and
               over in a continuous loop.  Flashing at the bottom is the
               hotline number: "1-800-PRECRIME." Then- "Call Now!  Call
               Now!

 BACK TO SCENE 
               Now Lisa takes out the Precog disc Anderson gave to her -the
               first disc.

               She places it in the specialized monitor on the judge's bench.

               The tv and the judge's monitor sit side by side.  The tv
               plays the version of the murder from the second disc; the
               judge's monitor plays the version from the first disc.

               She stares intently, her eyes flicking back and forth from
               one version to the other.  They seem absolutely identical.
               When the judge's monitor goes blank, she starts it over again.

               Lisa stares, watching her husband murder his best friend,
               endlessly.

 EXT. A GAS STATION - ALEXANDRIA -- DAY 
               A gas station right out of the fifties.  An attendant in a
               uniform and cap whistles while he wipes down the windshield
               of a sky blue Rambler.

               In the background, Anderson walks toward a men's room.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 75. 

 INT. THE MEN'S ROOM 
               Anderson looks at himself in the mirror.  He reaches out and
               touches one reflected eye, which is a deep brown.  It is
               still startling to him, the color of his eyes.

               Then he reaches into his duffel bag and takes out the air
               syringe Doc gave to him.  He looks at it nervously.  It is
               filled with 5 cc's of an opaque green liquid.

               He touches the tip of it to the soft center under his chin.
               He closes his eyes.  Then he screws up his courage, and hits
               the plunger.  The liquid is pneumatically delivered with a
               searing HISS.

               Anderson screams out in agony, slams back against the wall
               of the bathroom.  His hands reach up for his face -- which
               looks like it's boiling from within.

 ANDERSON'S FACE 
               The skin on both cheeks begins to pucker.  The muscle tone
               around his chin goes soft, and begins to sag like an old
               man's.  That is the effect -- like he is aging fifty years.
               His forehead wrinkles, the skin under his eyes droop.  Healthy
               pink is replaced by bloodless gray.

 AND MOTHER OF GOD DOES IT HURT 
 EXT. THE MEN'S ROOM 
               The ATTENDANT knocks nervously on the door

 ATTENDANT                          You all right in there?

               When the door opens, an unhealthy looking old guy with a
               fedora hat pulled low comes slowly out of the bathroom.
               Anderson nods, and walks past the attendant, who watches
               after him uncertainly as he wanders off.

 INT. PRECRIME HEADQUARTERS - ALEXANDRIA -- LATER 
               The perky tour guide we met earlier takes another group around
               the headquarters.  There may be a massive campaign to find
               Anderson, but the Precrime public relations machine continues
               to run without interruption.

               There are ten people in the group, and the physically
               transformed Anderson is among them.  They all wear glowing
               nametags.  Anderson's reads, "Mr. Symington." He keeps his
               hands in his pockets, and his head low.

               We have heard the tour guide's spiel before

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 76. 

 TOUR GUIDE                          Welcome to the main headquarters of
                         Precrime.  Smaller Precrime branches
                         are scattered throughout the United
                         States.

               She is about to go on when she looks over at Anderson.  He
               is fidgeting uncomfortably.

 TOUR GUIDE (CONT'D)                          Are you ... all right, Mr. Symington?

               Anderson moves up close to her, a little too close.  He
               whispers to her, embarrassed.  She gives him a professional
               smile, and points in the distance past the elevators.

               Anderson nods, and heads off.  She calls after him.

 TOUR GUIDE (CONT'D)                          We'll wait right here for you, sir!

 INT. A STAIRWELL 
	       Anderson runs down a back stairwell to a lower floor.

 INT. A BASEMENT CORRIDOR 
               Anderson stands outside a door marked: "Housekeeping." Above
               the doorway is an IdentiScan device.

               Anderson reaches into his coat and carefully removes a small
               cryo-jar.

 CLOSE ON: THE CRYO-JAR 
               Imbedded in the clear gelatinous coolant are two eyeballs
               -the irises a luminous blue.

 INT. SEARCH AND COMMAND -- MOMENTS LATER 
               The operations room in Precrime.  The technicians sit at
               their computers and holographic tracking displays.

               Witwer paces among them.  His eyes keep flicking to the
               digital clock on the wall.  Then they cut back to the men
               and machines that are telling him nothing.  Witwer does not
               look well at all, When a TECHNICIAN leans close to his
               computer monitor,Witwer almost leaps across the room to get
               to him.  He looks over the man's shoulder.

 WITWER                          What is it?

 TECHNICIAN                          Must be a glitch ...

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 77. 

 WITWER                          What?

 TECHNICIAN                          Anderson just got IdentiScanned.

               Witwer grips the back of the technician's chair.  The
               technician types the data through again.

 TECHNICIAN (CONT'D)                          It's him -- he's been scanned.

 WITWER                          Where is he?

               The technician looks up at Witwer.

 TECHNICIAN                          But he's had his eyes done.  Right?
                         Sir?  Tries to think it through.

 WITWER                               (barely audible)
                         He had to have.

               The technician's computer flashes the next piece of
               information.  When he speaks, it's the last thing Witwer
               wants to hear.

 TECHNICIAN                          Jesus Christ, sir.  He's in the
                         basement of this building.

               All eyes turn to Witwer.  The unspoken question hangs in the
               air.  Anderson's come to murder Witwer?

 INT. PRECRIME HEADQUARTERS 
               Throughout the building, every available Precrime Officer
               begins to receive orders to mobilize toward the basement.

 INT. THE PRECOG CHAMBER 
               Four officers stand guard in the chamber.  They listen to
               the orders coming in on their earpieces.  Three of the guards
               rush out of the room, one stays behind.

               The three Precogs sit in their oversized chairs, the female
               in the middle, the males on either side of her.  Their eyes
               are open ... and they are deeply alert.

               Two technicians tend to the Precogs.  At the back of the
               chamber, through a large window, we see Ennis Page sitting
               at the huge mainframe.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 78. 

 INT. SEARCH AND COMMAND 
               A ring of Precrime officers three men deep stand guard around
               Witwer.  Witwer looks like he wants to kill them all.

 WITWER                          This is ridiculous.

               Lieutenant Glaser replies forcefully

 LIEUTENANT GLASER                          Standing orders from the Security
                         Panel, sir.

 WITWER                          If he wants to get to me, he'll get
                         to me.

 LIEUTENANT GLASER                          No, he won't, sir.

               Witwer looks at the confident young officer almost pityingly.
               Then his eyes flick to the wall clock.

 INT. THE BASEMENT 
               Armed Precrime officers clog the corridors, conducting
               defensive searches of one room after another.  All they are
               coming up with so far are some very startled housekeepers.

 INT. THE PRECOG CHAMBER 
               In the chamber are one guard, two technicians, and three
               Precogs.  And all of them are left in sudden darkness, as
               the power is cut.

 INT. SEARCH AND COMMAND 
               The officers around Witwer reach for their maglite
               flashlights.  The Search and Command room suddenly looks
               exceedingly vulnerable.

               A technician calls out from the darkness

 TECHNICIAN                          Don't worry, air -emergency generators
                         will kick on in five seconds.

               The green glow from a roomful of wristwatches makes the room
               seem alive with fireflies.  Five seconds go by.  Then ten
               more.

 WITWER                          Explanation, please!

 TECHNICIAN                          Uh, sir.  It seems ... he got the
                         generators, too.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 79. 

               There is a long moment of silence.  And then Witwer begins
               to laugh.

 INT. THE PRECOG CHAMBER 
               The room is utterly dark and silent.  The silence is broken
               by the SOUND of something rolling across the floor.  Somebody
               speaks, probably the guard.

 VOICE                          Shit.

               An explosion of light fills the room in STROBE-LIKE blasts.
               And leaping through the light is ANDERSON.  The temporarily
               blinded guard and technicians have dropped to their knees.
               Anderson stun guns them quickly.

               The strobes fade, and Anderson sets a zirc-flare on the floor.
               We see that the enzyme is wearing off -- his facial features
               are returning to normal.

               He is oblivious to the Precogs in their chairs.  It is the
               equipment he is after.

               Through the observation window we see ENNIS PAGE watching in
               horror as Anderson severs the light cables connecting the
               Precog helmets to the mainframe.

               Anderson aims a sonic blast at the observation window, blowing
               it out and knocking Page unconscious.  Then he reaches into
               the room and destroys the mainframe itself with a series of
               blasts.

               Anderson is so intent on destruction he does not sense a
               PRESENCE behind him.  Perhaps it is because the movement is
               so completely devoid of malice it is beyond detection.

               A HAND, the fingers pale and slender, reaches out and takes
               hold of his hand.

               Anderson whirls around, weapon out.  And there before him,
               is the FEMALE Precog.  He looks at her, then beyond her to
               the other Precogs who are lolling in semiconsciousness in
               their chairs.

               Her helmet is off.  She is young, but her close-cropped hair
               is silver white.  And when she speaks, her voice is like the
               wind whispering through time.

 FEMALE                          Save us, Anderson.

               Anderson can feel the seconds ticking away, his carefully
               planned operation interrupted in an unfathomable way.

 ANDERSON                          I have to get out of here.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 80. 

               She grips his hand.

 FEMALE                          Save us.

               It is beyond pitiful, this frail little woman, pleading.
               And her eyes, she won't let him go.  She is beginning to
               weaken, to sway on her feet.

               A sudden realization floods over Anderson.

 ANDERSON                          You let me get here, didn't you?
                         You stopped giving them information,
                         so they couldn't track me.

               The Precog female is fading fast.  She tries to reach out
               for him and her legs give way.

 FEMALE                          Save -- 
  	       And what can Anderson do but catch her before she falls?  
	       What can he do but throw her over his shoulder, and in the 
	       fading light of the flare, make a run for freedom.

 INT. TUDICIAL CENTER 
               Lisa has been staring at the judge's monitor and the tv screen
               for over an hour.  The two versions of Anderson murdering
               Witwer play over and over.

 LISA                               (wearily, to herself)
                         Help me, Paul.

               She hits freeze-frame on the judge's monitor, at a moment
               during his confrontation with Witwer when Anderson's FACE
               fills the screen.

               Lisa looks with deep urgency into her husband's eyes.

               And it is his EYES, finally, that tell her everything.  Lisa's
               hand rises to her open mouth.

 LISA (CONT'D)                          They're blue.

               She keeps the image on freeze-frame, and turns and looks at
               the tv, which shows Precrime's disc over and over, the 1-800
               number scrolling along the bottom.

               When the same close-up of Anderson flashes onto the tv screen,
               she leans close to it and squints.

               Anderson stares right back at her.  And for the first time,
               Lisa sees that the tapes are not exactly identical.  His
               eyes...

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 81. 

 LISA (CONT'D)                          And now they're brown.

               For the first time in days she allows herself a small smile.

 INT. PRECOG CHAMBER 
               Power has been restored to Precrime Headquarters.  Witwer
               walks slowly through the ruins of the Chamber.  EMT teams
               work on Ennis Page and the other dazed personnel Anderson
               has left in his wake.

               Technicians cluster around the two remaining Precogs, the
               brothers.  Their eyes are closed and they are limp.  Their
               lips move soundlessly as if in conversation with each other.

               Lieutenant Glaser is with him, but when Witwer speaks it is
               almost to himself.

 WITWER                          Why didn't the Precogs know he was
                         coming to do this?

               The Lieutenant has no reply.  Witwer runs both hands through
               his hair.  It has begun to wear him down, the ticking of the
               clock ...

 WITWER (CONT'D)                          The next time he shows up it'll be
                         to kill me.

 LIEUTENANT GLASER                          We won't let that happen, sir.

               Witwer takes in the chaotic scene around him, then gives the
               Lieutenant a withering look.

 WITWER                          You won't, huh?

               When the Lieutenant tries to speak to him, Witwer walks away
               and goes over to the technicians working on the Precogs.  He
               stares at the Precogs.

 WITWER (CONT'D)                               (to a technician)
                         When can we get these things
                         operational?

 TECHNICIAN                          They're a hive mind, sir.  It takes
                         three for their predictive abilities
                         to be fully operational.

               Which Witwer does not want to hear.  Witwer leans very close
               to the technician.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 82. 

 WITWER                          These two are all I have to find the
                         man who is about to murder me.  Hook
                         them up, and flood them with whatever
                         kind of fucking chemicals you have
                         to.  They are a machine, and I need
                         that machine at my disposal.

               The Precogs's lips stop for a microsecond, and then begin
               their silent movements again.

 INT. ENNIS PAGE'S HOUSE - ALEXANDRIA -- NIGHT 
               Ennis Page is a man unglued.  He sits on a tidy little sofa,
               in a tidy 1950's style living room.  But his movements have
               become untidy.  He puts a very tiny pill on his tongue.

               When he drinks from a glass of water, it dribbles down his
               chin onto his shirt.  Not like Ennis, at all.

               When his doorbell RINGS, he slowly looks up, then looks down
               at the floor again.  He doesn't answer it.  It RINGS some
               more.

               And then Lisa is standing there before him

 LISA                          Your IdentiScan is off, Ennis.  I
                         could just walk in here.

 PAGE                          I forgot.  To turn it on.

               She sits down beside him.

 LISA                          You don't look surprised to see me.

               She glances at the bubble pack of pills on the table beside
               him, three gone.

 LISA (CONT'D)                          I need your help.

               Unexpectedly, tears well up in Ennis's eyes.

 PAGE                          He took one of my babies.

 LISA                          He's desperate, Ennis.  He had to.
                              (beat)
                         We have to help him.

               Lisa holds the Precog disc in front of his eyes.  He closes
               them against the sight, as if it were an evil talisman.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 83. 

 LISA (CONT'D)                          It's a fake Ennis.

               Ennis's eyes open again.

 LISA (CONT'D)                          This is the first disc.  You delivered
                         it to Director Anderson.  He reviewed
                         it.  And then he stole it, and went
                         on the run.

               Ennis tries to think through his fear and haze.  His words
               slur.

 PAGE                          I delivered ... a fake .. to him?

 LISA                          But he thought it was real, and ran
                         with it.

               The pills, his tidy world coming apart -- Ennis is losing
               it.

 LISA (CONT'D)                          An hour later, you delivered a second
                         disc of the same event.  Witwer
                         reviewed it.  It was real.  (Beat)
                         How do I know this?

               Ennis just wants her to go away.  He wants it all to go away.
               Tears stream down his face.

 LISA (CONT'D)                          Director Anderson had his eyes
                         changed.  They were blue.  Now he
                         has brown ones.

               Ennis is sliding away.  Lisa takes hold of him.  Makes him
               listen, dammit.  She points to the disc in her hand.

 LISA (CONT'D)                          This disc, the fake one, shows a
                         blueeyed Anderson murdering Witwer
                         two days from now.  He doesn't have
                         blue eyes anymore.  The person who
                         faked this disc had no idea he would
                         change his eyes.

               Lisa shakes him.

 LISA (CONT'D)                          Listen!  But the second disc has to
                         be real, because he has brown eyes
                         when he murders Witwer.
 (MORE) 
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 84. 

 LISA (CONT'D)                               (beat)
                         Somebody tried to frame him with a
                         fake.  And somehow it all became real.
                         Why, Ennis?  How could this happen?

               Ennis gives her a look that's on the other side of
               comprehension.

 LISA (CONT'D)                          You handle the discs.  How did a
                         fake one get delivered?

               Ennis's eyes roll back into his head.

               PAGE Coffee ...

 LISA (CONT'D)                          You want-- ?

 PAGE                          He spilled coffee everywhere ...
                         Everywhere ...

 LISA                          What coffee?  What are you -- ?

               But Ennis sags unconscious.  She shakes him hard, even slaps
               him, but Ennis is out.  She lets him drop down on the sofa.

               From outside the house, somewhere high in the clouds, comes
               the WHINE of a hovercraft.

               Lisa looks once more at Ennis, then gets out of there

 INT. ROOM - THE SPRAWL -- NIGHT 
               A small, dreary room, invisible with insignificance.  Which
               is just the kind of room you want if you've stolen a Precog.

               The female Precog lies on a cot.  Anderson sits on a metal
               folding chair watching her.

               Her eyes slowly open and look at him

 FEMALE                          My brothers aren't here.

 ANDERSON                          You didn't even look around.  You
                         knew.

 FEMALE                               (beat)
                         We can sense each other.  You must
                         save

	       Anderson cuts her off with a curt shake of his head

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 85. 

 ANDERSON                          Stop.  I saved You.  It was the best
                         I could do.

               She turns away and looks at the yellowing paper on the wall.
               There is a fading pink cabbage rose.  She traces the outline
               of it with her thin finger.

               She turns back to him.

 FEMALE                          Thank you, Anderson.

               It is deeply eerie for him, chatting with a Precog.

 ANDERSON                          What am I going to do with you?

               Her eyes grow very serious.

 FEMALE                          Name me, Anderson.

 ANDERSON                          What?

 FEMALE                          Give me a name.  I've never had one.

               Anderson rises, moves around the small room.  He is shamed,
               embarrassed.

 ANDERSON                          Listen.

               She turns to the wall.

 ANDERSON (CONT'D)                          Listen to me.
                              (beat)
                         Listen to me ... Rose.

               It is heartrendingly touching, the smile she gives him when
               she faces him again.

 FEMALE                          Rose.

 ANDERSON                          Rose.  They shifted your precognition
                         so you would locate me.

 ROSE                               (beat)
                         Yes.  And it hurt us, physically.
                         Did you know that?  The helmets, the
                         controls.  It hurts.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 86. 

 ANDERSON                               (guiltily)
                         I didn't know.

               For a long moment he can't say anything.  But there are things
               he needs to understand ...

 ANDERSON (CONT'D)                          When they shifted you to find me,
                         you didn't reveal everything.  That
                         I was going to break into Precrime.

 ROSE                          We saw our chance.  You would need
                         to shut us down, you would have to
                         come.  We wanted you to come.

 ANDERSON                          You used me -- to save you.

 ROSE                          I have been used all my life,
                         Anderson.

               Anderson can't meet her eyes.

 ROSE (CONT'D)                          No one cared that we were human.
                         From a human mother.  Taken at birth.
                         Hooked to machines.
                              (beat)
                         We have been alive, Anderson.
                         Enslaved, for the greater good.

               Her words are unbearable, for both of them.  She traces the
               outline of the wallpaper rose again.

 ROSE (CONT'D)                          But now I have a name.  And I know
                         the man who has named - me will not
                         allow me to be enslaved again.

               Anderson looks at her, then goes to the window, carefully
               watches the street below.

 ANDERSON                          Rose.  What's going to happen to us?
                         Can you see that?

 ROSE                          I'm weak.  And away from my brothers.
                         I see glimpses and hints of things
                         nearby.  But it's all ... scattered.
                              (beat)
                         I'm tired of the future, Anderson.

               She lies on the bed, watching as Anderson comes back to her.
               He sits carefully on the side of her bed.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 87. 

               Then be reaches out, and gently touches her cheek

 ANDERSON                          You didn't know I was going to do
                         that, did you?

               She is almost too overwhelmed to speak

 ROSE                          No.  Oh, Anderson.  It was lovely.

               And now it is Anderson who is overwhelmed

 INT. ENNIS PAGE'S HOUSE DAWN 
               If he were not already dead, it would've killed Ennis Page
               to see the state of his living room.  Precrime officers
               everywhere.  Blood on the rug.  A gun beside the sofa.

               Witwer stands in the corner of the room witching the Coroner
               crab walk Page's body.  It WHIRS and CLICKS as it probes and
               takes samples from various sites.

               The holographic doctor waits patiently as the Coroner crab
               makes its determinations.

               Lieutenant Glaser talks quietly to Witwer

 LIEUTENANT GLASER                          Who else could it've been?

               The crab probes the ragged hole in Page's head

 LIEUTENANT GLASER (CONT'D)                          He grabbed a Precog so he could commit
                         an undetected murder.

 WITWER                               (beat)
                         Page worshipped the system.  He fell
                         apart.  Shot himself.

               The Lieutenant rolls his eyes.

 LIEUTENANT GLASER                          Anderson.

               Witwer doesn't say anything.  He just stares at the body The
               crab finishes.  The holographic doctor unfolds his arms and
               turns his head to Witwer.  He is only a computer interface,
               but even so, it seems as if there is surprise in his
               digitalized voice.

 HOLOGRAPHIC DOCTOR                          Director Witwer.  This event is a
                         positive homicide.

                         Two Investigation is in order.

               No one says anything as the holographic doctor dematerializes
               and the Coroner crab walks across the floor and puts itself
               back in its box.

               At last, someone moves.  It is Witwer.  He lifts his arm,
               pulls back his shirtsleeve, and stares long and hard at his
               watch.

 INT. WITWER'S OFFICE -- DAY LATER 
               Lisa sits biting her lip as Witwer watches two monitors play
               the two versions of Anderson's murder of Witwer.  Lisa points.

 LISA                          There.

               She reaches down and freezes on a close-up of Anderson on
               the two monitors.

 CLOSE ON - THE MONITORS 
               On the left monitor Anderson has blue eyes, on the right he
               has brown.

 LISA                          The one on the left, the first disc
                         -it's a fake.  He doesn't have blue
                         eyes anymore.

               Witwer stares for a long time.

 WITWER                          A fake.

 (BEAT)                          But the Precogs predict the infallible
                         truth.  They don't emit fake discs.

               And now Lisa smiles.  She has set her lawyerly mind to the
               solution.  It is her moment

 . 
 LISA                          Exactly.  You can't tamper with the
                         Precogs, induce them to make fakes

                         But that doesn't mean someone couldn't
                         have made a fake disc on their own
                         and inserted it into the delivery
                         system.

               The simplicity of it is inconceivable.  Witwer speaks
               carefully, trying to process it

 WITWER                          Bypass the Precogs and slip a fake
                         disc in with that day's real ones...

 LISA                               (excited)
                         We're all programmed to believe
                         anything we see on a Precog disc.
                         The system has never been wrong ...

               Witwer stares at the proof before him.  -- the different
               colored eyes of Anderson.  He ejects both discs and holds
               them in his hands.

 LISA (CONT'D)                          You have to call off the hunt.  He
                         was set up.

               Witwer looks at the two discs he is holding

 WITWER                               (long beat)
                         It's gone too far, Lisa She shakes
                         her head, shocked at his response

 LISA                          He was set up!  You both were.  If
                         Paul kills you, you're both out of
                         the picture.

 WITWER                          Who wants us out?  Of what picture?

 LISA                          Jesus, Ed. Stop this thing!  And
                         then we can investigate Witwer's
                         mouth opens and closes.  He tries
                         again.

 WITWER                          Ennis Page was murdered last night.

               The blood drains from Lisa's face

 WITWER (CONT'D)                          Everything points to Paul.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 90. 

 LISA                          He's not a murderer.

 WITWER                          I think he is.  A murderer ... and a
                         future murderer.
                              (beat)
                         Lisa.  What does it matter that the
                         first disc is a fake ... if the second
                         one's real?

               Witwer's hands close tight on the discs.  Lisa stands there,
               motionless.  Then she turns, and leaves his office, abruptly.
               He watches her go.

 INT. ROOM - THE SPRAWL -- DAY 
               Rose sits in a chair near the window.  She is chewing lightly
               on a cracker.  Her face shows wonder -- at the cracker's
               texture and taste.  She holds it up and admires its shape.

               Anderson's mood is less wondrous

 ANDERSON                          Rose.  Listen to me.  I'm going to
                         leave you here.  I have to keep
                         moving.

 ROSE'S SMILE ABRUPTLY VANISHES 
 ROSE                          No.  You must save my brothers.

 ANDERSON                          It's impossible.  There's no time.
                         I've done what I can do!

               Rose waits for him to finish.  She looks out the window at
               the street scene.

 ROSE                          Come here, Anderson.

	       He does, reluctantly.

 ROSE (CONT'D)                          Do you see that boy in the blue hat
                         walking with his mother?
                              (beat)
                         In sixty seconds he will walk beneath
                         those workers installing a window on
                         the tenth floor of that building.

 ANDERSON'S POV - THE BOY AND THE WORKERS 
               Two men struggle to lift a large window in place.  Way below
               the little boy in the blue hat walks on along the sidewalk
               holding his mother's hand.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 91. 

 ROSE (CONT'D)                          They'll drop the window, killing
                         him.  It is impossible to save him.

               Anderson turns to her, shocked And then he runs for the door,
               hurls it open, and disappears down the hall.

               Rose listens to his FOOTSTEPS crashing down the stairs

 EXT. THE STREET. 
               Even as Anderson rushes out of the boarding house, the WORKERS
               have lost their grip on the window.

               The little BOY in the blue hat and his MOTHER walk unwittingly
               toward disaster.  They do not appear to hear the MEN'S cries.

               The WINDOW falls end over end above the boy's head.  The
               sunlight sparks off of the glass, so that from a distance it
               looks like a star falling from the sky.

               A WOMAN across the street sees what is happening, and cries
               out.

               But what Anderson does is run.  He runs faster and harder
               than humanly possible.  He does not care if he is recognized
               or hit by a passing taxi.  He is going to get to that boy.
               He has to get to that boy ...

               ANDERSON rams the BOY from behind just as the corner of the
               window frame kisses the boy's blue hat.  He knocks the boy
               to safety as glass and metal SMASH into the sidewalk.

               The mother does not even have time to scream.  She is on the
               ground, stunned, But Anderson has saved the boy.

               He rolls away, and gets to his feet.  Before anyone can put
               together what has happened, Anderson has ducked into an alley,
               and is gone.

 INT. THE ROOM - LATER 
               Anderson enters the room again, out of breath, some small
               cuts on his face and hands.  He stands across the room staring
               at Rose.

               Rose considers him.  When she speaks her voice is near and
               distant at the same time.  For Anderson, it is as if the
               words are coming from a place inside his own head.

 ROSE                          It was impossible to save that boy
                         -- but you did, Anderson.  It's in
                         you.  It's what you are.

               Anderson sits on the floor and leans back wearily against a
               wall.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 92. 

 ANDERSON                          You knew it wasn't impossible.  That
                         I'd get there.

               Rose reveals nothing.

 ROSE                          You are a man who saves others.
                              (beat)
                         Save my brothers.

               Anderson almost laughs.  Her persistence is unbelievable

 ANDERSON                          I'm in a lot of trouble right now.

 ROSE                          My brothers are in more trouble.
                         They've moved them to ... an awful
                         place.

 ANDERSON                          Rose.  Ed Witwer -he's in the most
                         trouble of all.  Who saves him?

               Rose suddenly grimaces in pain, and grips the side of her
               head.  She curls into a fetal position.

               Anderson goes to her, touches her thin shoulder.  Her eyes
               roll into the back of her head.

               Whose pain is she feeling?  Her own?  Someone else's?
               Anderson doesn't want to think about it.

 INT. PRECOG ENGINEERING LAB -CHEVY CHASE, MD -- NIGHT 
               Because Anderson has destroyed the Precog Chamber, the two
               Precog brothers have been brought here.

               The room is makeshift, uncomfortable ... a place for
               experiments.  The brothers are strapped into chairs.  They
               are helmeted.

               But unlike before, large bore needles have been placed in
               their jugular veins.  Connected to the needles are long twists
               of IV tubing.  There are several IVs running at high drip
               rates.

               Witwer has his back to all this.  He stands with Dr. Resfield,
               watching a technician working the keyboard on a huge
               mainframe.

               Dr. Resfield, a man not given to squeamishness looks back at
               the Precogs, uneasy.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 93. 

 DR. RESFIELD                          We're not really set up for this
                         type of 

               He stops talking when he looks into Witwer's hollow eyes. Witwer 
               is somewhere beyond the influence and reach of words.

 INT. BOARDING HOUSE ROOM -- MORNING 
               Anderson tries to get Rose to drink some water.  Her skin is
               translucent, unhealthy, glistening with sweat.

 ANDERSON                          Rose.  Try to drink.

               She pushes the cup away.  She closes her eyes, as if even
               the dim light of the room causes her pain.

 ROSE                          Your wife.  We have to get her here,
                         Anderson.

               She opens her eyes.  Anderson doesn't like the feel of this.

 ANDERSON                          Why?

 ROSE                          I don't know ...

 ANDERSON                          What are you seeing?

 ROSE                          Glimpses, Anderson.  Please.  We
                         have to get her here.

 ANDERSON                          You're scaring me, Rose

               She covers his mouth with her hand

 ROSE                          Stop talking.  It uses me up.

               For a long time, Rose says nothing, Her gaze is locked onto
               a distance beyond the room.  At last, she speaks.

 ROSE (CONT'D)                          In three minutes your wife will take
                         a walk ..

 DISSOLVE TO: 
 INT. JUDICIAL CENTER - ALEXANDRIA -- LATER 
               Lisa sits in her office.  But she can't stand it, the sitting
               and waiting.  She has to move.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 94. 

               She gets up and hurriedly leaves her office

 INT. JUDICIAL CENTER -- MOMENTS LATER 
               Witwer walks past Lisa's SECRETARY toward the open door of
               Lisa's office.

 SECRETARY                          Sir?  I'm sorry, she stepped out for

                         Sir?

               Witwer stares into the empty office.  There is a clock on
               Lisa's desk.  His eyes fix on it.

 EXT. JUDICIAL CENTER ALEXANDRIA 
               Lisa moves quickly down the steps of the white marble
               building.  She takes a deep breath, then heads down Jefferson
               Boulevard toward the city.

               A sleek black TRANSPORT with two Precrime officers in it
               follows her from a discreet distance.

               In the sky above, the ubiquitous Precrime hovercraft

 INT. CITY STREET ALEXANDRIA 
               Lisa walks down the street.  She hugs herself, barely aware
               of her surroundings.  She passes by stores, restaurants,
               payphones, video kiosks ... oblivious.  People push past
               her.

               On a street corner, as she waits at a red light, the payphone
               beside her begins to RING.  If she hears it, she gives no
               indication.  A KID reaches for it, listens, hangs up.

               She walks on.  Stores.  Restaurants.  An art gallery.  As
               she comes abreast of another PAYPHONE, it suddenly starts to
               ring.  This time Lisa glances at it.  But again, walks on.

               The TRANSPORT weaves through traffic, nearby She walks past
               the K.L. Lawrence Graphics Museum.  And another restaurant.
               And a PAYPHONE.  And this time, finally, when it, too, RINGS,
               she turns and looks hard at it.

               A man begins to walk over to it.  Lisa almost knocks him out
               of the way to get to it.  She grabs at the receiver.

 LISA                          Hello?  Hello?

 ANDERSON'S VOICE                          I need you.

               Lisa's forehead sags against the side of the payphone.  She
               basks in the sound of him.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 95. 

 ANDERSON'S VOICE (CONT'D)                          It's 1:03.  Set your watch, exactly.

               Lisa pushes the buttons on her digital watch as she listens
               LISA Okay.

 ANDERSON'S VOICE (CONT'D)                          This is what you have to do ...

               We now hear ANDERSON continue in VOICE OVER as we follow
               Lisa through a SEQUENCE OF EVENTS ...

 EXT. THE LAWRENCE MUSEUM 
               Lisa walks up the steps of the museum

 ANDERSON (V.O.)                          At 1:07 hang up the phone and enter
                         the Lawrence Museum.

 INT. GRAPHICS GALLERY 
               Lisa walks quickly through a display of 19th century magazine
               advertising.

 INT. GRAPHICS GALLERY 
               The two Precrime officers walk into a room filled with Chinese
               graphics.

 ANDERSON (V.O.)                          At 1:13 the two Precrime officers
                         following you take a wrong turn into
                         a different room, losing sight of
                         you for ten seconds.

               The officers start toward the entrance way to another room,
               then hesitate uncertainly, and go for another entrance way.

 EXT. THE LAWRENCE MUSEUM 
               Lisa hurries down the steps

 INT. A SUBWAY STATION 
               Lisa boards the "A" MagLev train

 ANDERSON (V.O.)                          An undercover transport officer will
                         have received emergency orders to
                         follow you.
 (MORE)                          He's wearing a red tie.  He has short
                         blond hair.



----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 96. 

 INT. THE SUBWAY CAR 
               The blond transport officer with the red tie sits at the far
               end of Lisa's car, watching her.

               At the next stop Lisa gets off.  He follows, not too far
               behind.

 INT. SUBWAY STATION 
               Lisa starts up the stairs.  She looks at her watch, then
               makes herself pause a few moments, to keep within Anderson's
               time frame.  She starts up again.

 ANDERSON (V.O.)                          As you come around the bend, cry out
                         and turn around and slap the
                         officer...

               Lisa does this, and the officer reels back, surprised. At the
               same moment two big men rushing to catch a subway come into
               view, and see this happening.  Lisa starts to run.  When the
               undercover officer tries to stop her, the two men grab the
               officer, and they get into a fight.

               Lisa escapes.

 INT. A TAXI - THE SPRAWL 
               Lisa looks at her watch, then taps the window for the driver
               to stop.  She gets out.

 ANDERSON (V.O.)                          Stay on Ninth street.  Underneath
                         Ninth street is the main power feed
                         for The Sprawl.  It'll mess up the
                         navigational beacon on the hovercraft.
                              (beat)
                         Keep switching taxis.  But stay on
                         Ninth.

               She hails another taxi.  She holds her hand over the
               IdentiScan before it can read her.  The taxi driver looks at
               her, sees her smile, sees the prepaid cash card she holds
               out to him.

 LISA                          Two hundred dollars if you don't
                         scan me.

               It's The Sprawl -- stranger things have happened.  He grabs
               the card, and jerks his head for her to get in.  They take
               off.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 97. 

 EXT. NINTH STREET LATER 
               Lisa gets out of the taxi and looks briefly into the sky.
               It is dense with holographic billboards, skim-jets,
               dirigibles.  Somewhere in all that is a Precrime hovercraft.

               And the neighborhood around her is definitely downscale.

 ANDERSON (V.O.)                          The hovercraft will try to drop
                         altitude, but the air traffic will
                         slow it down.
                              (beat)
                         Precrime loses you.  You'll have to
                         walk two miles.  Don't get scanned.

 EXT. THE SPRAWL 
               Lisa walks hurriedly down a side street.  She stands out in
               her white dress -- a spot of vulnerable color in world of
               black.

               Too vulnerable to pass up.  A MAN in a gray overcoat slides
               out from between two buildings in front of her.  He is not
               coy about his intent.  He comes straight at her, all business.

               Lisa freezes in place.  She looks at her watch.  The man
               grabs her by the shoulder.  When she starts to scream, he
               claps his hand over her mouth, hard.

 MAN                          You bite me, bitch, I'll pull your
                         teeth out.

               Her eyes look around frantically.  He starts to drag her
               backwards into the dark.

               ANDERSON leaps into view, and slams the man's head into a
               light post.  It takes a lot of slamming before lie loosens
               his grip on Lisa.  His legs at last collapse under him.

               Anderson scoops Lisa off the ground.  She hugs him hard.

               Then pulls back from him.  She gives him a look.

 LISA                          Cut it a little close there,
                         honeybunch.

 ANDERSON                          Rose got the street wrong.  She's
                         getting weak.

 LISA                          Rose?

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 98. 

 INT. THE BOARDING HOUSE -- LATER 
               Rose sits up in bed silently watching Lisa and Anderson
               together.

               Lisa needs to touch him.  She keeps a hand on his arm, brushes
               back a loose look of his hair.  Rose is mesmerized by her
               actions.  She drinks in everything, every bit of life.

               Anderson and Lisa are deep in conversation.  They speak to
               each other as if Rose were hardly present in the room.

               Anderson is trying to process everything Lisa has told him.

 ANDERSON                          Two discs.  One fake.  One real.

 LISA                          I don't think there were supposed to
                         be two.  Whoever planned it, wasn't
                         counting on two.

               They are silent for a long time.  Rose watches them work it
               through.

 ANDERSON                          An infallible system.  Every disc
                         ever generated has been true ...

 LISA                          Somebody wants you out of the way --
                         so they make a fake disc.  Who ever
                         doubts the discs?

 ANDERSON                          I never doubted it.  I saw it.  And
                         believed it, absolutely.  I was
                         certain I was going to murder Witwer.

               Anderson is shaking.  Lisa wraps her arms around him.  His
               voice is a stunned whisper.

 ANDERSON (CONT'D)                          I saw the fake, and believed so much
                         in the system, that I saw myself as
                         a murderer.
                              (beats)
                         And the Precogs picked up those
                         thoughts ...

 LISA                          And generated the second disc.  The
                         real one.

 ANDERSON                          A self-fulfilling prophesy.  I
                         believed it was true.  And that made
                         it true.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 99. 

               Anderson and Lisa turn and look at Rose.  She lies curled on
               the bed, her face to the wall.

 ANDERSON (CONT'D)                          Rose.  If all this is based on a lie
                         -the fake disc -- then do I really
                         kill Witwer?

 ROSE                               (beat)
                         We see what we see.  I'm sorry,
                         Anderson.  It's been predicted.

               Such a small voice, delivering a message of such finality

 INT. WITWER'S OFFICE -- MIDNIGHT 
               Lieutenant Glaser tries to get through to Witwer.  Witwer's
               back is turned to him.

 LIEUTENANT GLASER                          We can't take chances, sir

               Witwer doesn't move or answer.

 LIEUTENANT GLASER (CONT'D)                          It happens in less than three hours.
                              (beat)
                         We put you in a hovercraft and keep
                         you airborne -- until after the event.

 WITWER                          The event.

               Lieutenant Glaser shifts uncomfortably

 LIEUTENANT GLASER                          I've been ordered to get you onto
                         the craft.  By force if necessary.

 WITWER                          The event is inevitable, Lieutenant.

	        Witwer doesn't turn around.

 WITWER (CONT'D)                          The Precogs are never wrong.  The
                         event will take place.  I'm a
                         believer.  Aren't you?

 LIEUTENANT GLASER                          I don't leave this room without you,
                         sir.  The Security Panel insists.

 CUT TO: 
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 100. 

 INT. THE BOARDING HOUSE SIMULTANEOUS 
               Anderson and Lisa keep working it, peeling away the layers.
               Rose lies silent.

 ANDERSON                          Nobody could slip a fake disc past
                         Ennis Page Lisa shakes her head.

 LISA                          He was the weak link in the perfect
                         system.

 ANDERSON                          Obsessive compulsive niners can't
                         allow changes in the routine

 LISA                          Something threw him off.
                              (beat)
                         He tried to tell me.  It didn't make
                         any sense.  Something about "spilled
                         coffee."
                              (beat)
                         Someone was in his office with him.
                         And coffee spilled ...

               We stay CLOSE ON Anderson and Lisa as Rose's voice cuts in.

 ROSE (V.O.)                          We were always treated as if we
                         weren't alive.  As if we weren't
                         there.

               The camera pulls back and they are watching her as she
               continues to speak.

 ROSE (CONT'D)                          Even now.  You forget that I'm here.
                         You talk between yourselves.  And
                         when you need me to see into the
                         future, then you turn to me.

 ANDERSON                          Rose.  What is it?

 ROSE                               (beat)
                         We weren't just lost in the future.
                         We were in the Chamber, too.  Our
                         eyes were open.  In the present.

               And then Anderson gets it.  He kneels beside her bed

 ANDERSON                          Your eyes were open.  What did you
                         see, Rose?

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 101. 

 ROSE                          Who would I have told?  Who ever
                         talked to us?  Who cared that we
                         could talk?

 ANDERSON                          Rose.  Who spilled the coffee?
                         Straight ahead ...

               Rose stares stright ahead ...

 MEMORY HIT 
               Rose sits in her chair in the Precog Chamber.  Her brothers
               sit in their usual places on either side of her.  The
               technicians tend to them.

               Rose's eyes are open.  She sees everything in the room.  The
               technicians, the machines ... and across the room a large
               window where she can see Ennis Page working the mainframe
               computer.

               Rose watches through the window ...

               As the computer emits discs, Page gathers them

 ROSE (V.O.)                          Ed Witwer entered Page's office.

               Witwer carries a mug of coffee.

               Ennis Page goes red in the face, stares at the coffee.  Speaks
               to Witwer, angrily, pointing to the coffee.  We can't hear
               the words.

 ROSE (V.O.) (CONT'D)                          Page was so upset at the sight of
                         the coffee.

               Witwer goes to put the coffee down on a small table.  It
               tips, and spills.

               Page looks like his head will explode.  He pulls a neatly
               folded white handkerchief out of his back pocket and drops
               to his hands and knees and begins to obsessively blot at the
               coffee stain on his spotless rug.

 ROSE (V.O.) (CONT'D)                          Ed Witwer took a disc from his pocket,
                         reached over Page and put it in one
                         of the open cases.

               Witwer closes the case.  He looks through the window into
               the Precog Chamber, but the only one watching him is Rose --
               and what does she matter?

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 102. 

               Page rises angrily from cleaning the rug.  Witwer shrugs in
               apology and leaves the room.  Page stares after him.

 BACK TO SCENE 
               Rose is weeping.  She looks at Anderson and Lisa.

 ROSE (CONT'D)                          I didn't understand what I'd seen.
                         And I had no one to tell ...

               Lisa puts her arms around Rose Anderson tries to comprehend
               what he has heard.

 ANDERSON                          Ed ...

               Lisa turns, and speaks softly to her husband.

 LISA                          The perfect system -brought down by
                         a cup of coffee.  My god.

 ANDERSON                               (long beat)
                         He set into motion his own death.
                         He didn't know it would go this far.
                              (to Rose)
                         What makes me leave this room?  If I
                         stay here I won't kill him.  Right?

               But Rose and her brothers have already answered that question
               for him.

 CUT TO: 
 INT. WITWER'S OFFICE 
               Lieutenant Glaser looks at his watch.  Witwer is still in
               his chair, turned away from him.

 WITWER                          You see, if you think you can put me
                         on a hovercraft and save me, then
                         you don't believe in the infallibility
                         of the Precog system.

               Lieutenant Glaser has his orders.  He begins to approach.

               And as he does, Witwer swivels his chair around, and lifts
               the weapon he has been holding and silently shoots Lieutenant
               Glaser in the forehead.

 WITWER (CONT'D)                          And what I do not want around me,
                         are nonbelievers.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 103. 

               Witwer steps over the body as if it doesn't exist, and walks
               out of the office, locking the door behind him.

 EXT. THE PRECOG ENGINEERING LAB - CHEVY CHASE, MD -- LATER 
               Witwer gets out his car and looks at the two story concrete
               building that houses the lab.  The lights are out in all the
               windows except the back section of the second floor.  There,
               the lights burn brightly.

               Witwer sees Precrime officers posted at intervals around it.
               He smiles as if he knows something they don't.  He looks at
               his watch.  It is a cool night, but his face is slick with
               sweat.

               He walks to the entrance of the building.  An OFFICER 1s
               startled to see him.

 WITWER                          Things quiet?

 OFFICER                          Sir.  Should you ... be here?

 WITWER                          There's been a development.  A body's
                         been found in the Sprawl.

 OFFICER                          Anderson's?

 WITWER                          They're checking it out.  I need to
                         see what the Precogs have seen.

               Witwer is IdentiScanned.  The door opens and he goes in.

 INT. THE LAB 
               Dr. Resfield looks up as Witwer strides into the lab, carrying
               a tv under his arm.  Witwer is the last person he wants to
               see.

 WITWER                          Borrowed this from the technicians'
                         lounge.  You don't think they'll
                         mind, do you?

 DR.RESFIELD                          You shouldn't be here, Director.

               Dr. Resfield's eyes cut to a large digital clock on the wall,
               the red numbers ticking off time in seconds.

               Witwer looks for a plug, finds one.  Plugs in the tv.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 104. 

 WITWER                          No, no.  This is exactly where I
                         should be.

 DR. RESFIELD                          You're under a lot of strain,
                         Director.

               Witwer finds what he's looking for -- the continuous loop of
               his murder by Anderson.  "Call Now!  Call Now!"

 WITWER                          And tv's so good for that -- soothes
                         the mind.

               Witwer turns his sweaty face to Resfield and gives him a
               bright smile.  The scientist looks like he wants to run out
               of the room.

               Witwer takes him by the elbow and guides him toward the
               Precogs.  Two technicians hover over the Precogs adjusting
               IV's and turning dials on the Precogs's organic helmets.

               The Precogs wince and shiver with each turn of the dial.
               But they are no longer violently seizing -- they are too
               weak for that.

 WITWER (CONT'D)                          Bring me up to speed, Doc.

 DR. RESFIELD                          We're getting nothing from them.

 WITWER                          And that's because ... ?

               Witwer still grips him by the elbow.

 DR. RESFIELD                          I don't know.

 WITWER                          Do you think they know where Anderson
                         is?

 DR. RESFIELD                          It's impossible to tell.
                              (beat)
                         We've done everything.  Maybe even
                         too much.

 WITWER STARES AT THE PRECOGS 
 WITWER                          They know how to find Anderson for
                         me.
 (MORE) 
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 105. 

 WITWER (CONT'D)                               (beat)
                         They're the perfect machine, Doctor.
                         You just have to know which button
                         to push.

 INT. BOARDING HOUSE - THE SPRAWL 
               Rose looks like she's on fire.  Anderson wets another towel,
               wrings it over the sink.  Lisa takes it, and wipes down Rose's
               face and arms .

               Rose's lips are moving soundlessly.  Her eyes are shut tight.
               She begins to writhe in bed.

 ANDERSON                          Jesus Christ.

 LISA                          Come on, Rose.

 ANDERSON LOOKS AT HIS WATCH 
 ANDERSON                          One hour.  We hold it together for
                         an hour, Witwer lives -- and I'm not
                         a murderer.

 LISA                          She won't last an hour.

               It suddenly looks much worse than that.  Rose's body contorts
               horribly and she arches up off the bed.  Lisa can't control
               her.

               Anderson reaches for her, wraps her in his arms, trying to
               hold and comfort her.

 ANDERSON                          Rose!

               She begins to wail as she thrashes in his arms.

 ROSE                          He's killed him, Anderson!

               Rose stiffens into a seizure posture, then her body goes
               slack.  Anderson eases her back on the bed.  He stares at
               her, stricken.

               Her voice barely leaves her now

 ROSE (CONT'D)                          You didn't save my brother.

               Anderson reels at her words.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 106. 

 ANDERSON                          Did he kill both of them, Rose?
                         Rose!

               Rose manages to speak, one last time.  Her whispered words
               damn him.

 ROSE                          Does it matter, Anderson?

               Anderson rises.  Looks down at Rose.

               It matters.  He starts to move, quickly.

               Lisa takes hold of his arm.

 LISA                          If you leave this room...

	       Anderson kisses her.

 ANDERSON                          Then I'm a cop, just trying to do
                         hisjob.

               He reaches for his duffel bag.

               When the door closes behind him, Rose turns her head slightly
               and looks.  And then her eyes drift closed, as she goes to a
               place deep within her own mind.

 EXT. A STREET - THE SPRAWL - MOMENTS LATER 
               He passes by several cars on the street.  But they're all
               auto-drive, they won't do him any good.

               So he smashes a store window within forty-five seconds a
               city police transport zooms up, lights flashing.  Two city
               officers leap out of the transport.  They approach the
               smashed-in store window, weapons drawn.  Which is a mistake.
               Anderson rises into view behind them, and sonically blasts a
               small crater in the sidewalk they are standing on.

               As they trip and fall, he is already spraying them down with
               BindFoam.

               Their second mistake is they left the engine running to power
               the bank of Nits -Tracker lights on the car's hood and roof.
               Anderson screeches off through the choking predawn streets
               of The Sprawl, a beacon of light in the darkness.

 INT. THE LAB 
               The DIGITAL CLOCK races through time.  Witwer reaches his
               hand up and touches the vanishing numbers.

               The camera pulls back, and we see Dr. Resfield and the two
               technicians bound and gagged in a heap in the corner.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 107. 

               And when we see the lab in its entirety, there sprawled on
               the floor in front of his chair is one of the Precog brothers.
               A small rise of blood comes from a torn place in the back of
               his skull.

               The other Precog sits very still in his chair.  He is still
               connected to everything -- his helmet is in place, the TVs
               drip into him.  His eyes are open, and when Witwer moves,
               the Precog's eyes follow him.

               Witwer can feel them on him.  He turns around.

 WITWER                          Is he coming?  No?  Yes?  Maybe?
                              (beat)
                         I think yes.

               The Precog looks at him.

 WITWER (CONT'D)                          And you think yes.

               Witwer points to the tv screen, running Anderson's murder of
               Witwer.  Witwer smiles triumphantly.

 WITWER (CONT'D)                          Infallibly, immutably yes.

               The Precog looks at him.  Witwer's smile vanishes, and
               suddenly strides across the room, and claps his hand over
               the Precog's eyes.  Then he turns, and stares again at the
               clock.

 EXT. THE PRECOG ENGINEERING LAB 
               Three officers stand thirty feet apart in front of the
               building, facing outward toward the parking lot, weapons
               cradled in their arms.

               Behind them is a line of yew bushes.  AS we watch, the officer
               on the left is yanked off his feet backward into the bushes.
               Several moments pass, and the same thing happens to the
               officer on the right.

               The officer guarding the front entrance casually looks right.
               Then he looks hard.  He grips his weapon tight, and swings
               left.  No one there, either.

               ANDERSON drops him hard, from behind.  The officer crumples
               onto the cement.

               But Anderson's not done with him.  Anderson lifts him up,
               struggles to drag him forward toward the entrance.

               Anderson holds him upright in place.  The man's head lolls
               backward.  Which is.  Perfect for what Anderson needs to do.
               Anderson reaches his fingers towards the man's closed eyes.
               He pulls up on the eyelids.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 108. 

               An IdentiScan over the entrance clicks on and reads the man's
               eyes.  Access granted, the doors HISS open.  Anderson enters
               the building, dragging the officer with him.

 INT. THE LAB 
               Anderson enters the lab.  The very building sickens him.
               What he sees sickens him even more.

               The remaining Precog sits strapped into his chair.  Witwer
               sits beside him in the other Precog chair, the dead brother
               at his feet.  Witwer wears the dead Precog's helmet.  His
               hand is in his lap, holding a gun.

               He grins when Anderson appears.  He takes off the helmet,
               drops it on the floor.

 WITWER                          I figured, since I can see the future,
                         too, maybe I could get a little disc
                         action going.
                              (beat)
                         Just kidding.

               Anderson stares at his old partner.  Then he looks up at the
               digital clock.  Five-seventeen AM.  Witwer looks too, then
               turns back to Anderson.

 WITWER (CONT'D)                          You find you been doing that a lot
                         this week?  Looking at clocks?
                              (beat)
                         Three minutes to go.

               Anderson turns to the tv.

 ANDERSON                          There's never anything good on, you
                         know?

               Now Witwer smiles.

 WITWER                          There.  That's the old Paul.

 ANDERSON                          You're not the old Ed. You've lost
                         it.

               Witwer rises from the chair, the gun in his hand.

 WITWER                          You lost it.  You went weak in the
                         knees, partner.

 ANDERSON                          I'm not your partner.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 109. 

               Witwer looks at him sadly.

 WITWER                          The air went out of you when Frank
                         D'Ignazio killed himself.

 ANDERSON                          He was guilty.  I accepted that.

 WITWER                          No you didn't.  The doubts were
                         creeping in on you.  The lab trying
                         to engineer more Precogs ... Malcolm
                         pressuring you to expand ...

               Witwer reaches out and gently touches the remaining Precog
               brother's cheek.

 WITWER (CONT'D)                          Belief is the basis of the system.
                         It was your job to be the ultimate
                         believer.

               Witwer is breathing hard.  He lifts a hand and wipes the
               sweat from his face.

 WITWER (CONT'D)                          And when Frank died, you faltered.
                         I'm a cop, I see into the hearts of
                         men.
                              (beat)
                         And the thing about you is, you
                         wouldn't have just walked away.

 ANDERSON                          Never been my style.

	      Witwer gives him the flicker of a smile

 WITWER                          Precrime needs to grow.  You would
                         have stood in its way.  The Security
                         Panel wouldn't have understood that.
                         What you're capable of.  What a
                         bulldog you are.
                              (beat)
                         Look what you've been doing to us
                         all week.  Amazing.  You're the best.

 ANDERSON                          So you took matters into your own hands.

 WITWER                          I understood the threat.  I understood
 YOU 
               Anderson looks at the dead Precog

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 110. 

 ANDERSON                          You killed a Precog.  You ended the
                         system you wanted to protect.

 WITWER                          Wrong.  This lab will make more.
                         Believe it, Paul.

               They look at the CLOCK.  Five-nineteen.

 ANDERSON                          Knowing the exact moment of your
                         death -it's made you crazy, Ed.

               Witwer looks at the tv.  The TV REALITY is almost in synch
               with what is happening in the room.

               Witwer lifts his gun -- and then realizes something is
               terribly wrong.

               Anderson is standing there before him just as he is on the
               disc -- except there is a major difference.

 WITWER                          You sonofabitch!

               Anderson lifts up both hands

 WITWER (CONT'D)                          You didn't bring your gun!

 ANDERSON                          That's right.  No gun.

 WITWER                          You see?!  That's exactly what I'm
                         talking about.  You don't Believe!

               Anderson just looks at Witwer, raging at him.

 WITWER (CONT'D)                          The system is infallible.

               ANDERSON Doesn't Seem to be Witwer reaches behind him and
               pulls a second gun from out of his belt.

 WITWER (CONT'D)                          I guess that's why I've always carried
                         two.

               He tosses the gun to Anderson.  It clatters at Anderson's
               feet.

 ANDERSON                          You can't have it both ways.  You
                         don't want to die.  That's why you
                         lured me here -- to kill me first.

 ANDERSON (CONT'D)                               (beat)
                         But it you don't diet the system is
                         flawed, and you couldn't live with
                         that.

               Witwer SHOOTS him once, in the right thigh.  Anderson cries
               out, falls to the concrete floor.

 WITWER                          Pick it up

               Anderson speaks through his teeth ANDERSON It doesn't happen.

               Witwer looks frantically at the tv, at the clock.

               He reaches over and opens the dripmeter on a piggy back IV
               feeding into the Precog's main line.  A thick, yellow fluid
               begins to flow toward the Precog's jugular vein.

 WITWER (CONT'D)                          You're killing him, partner.

               And what choice, finally, does Anderson have?  He reaches
               for the gun.

 ANDERSON                          Let's not do this, Ed Witwer trains
                         his gun on Anderson.  Anderson trains
                         his gun on Witwer.

 ANDERSON (CONT'D)                          Oh, Ed ...

               Witwer lowers his gun.  And stands there between Anderson
               and the doomed Precog.

               The yellow liquid has almost reached the Precog's jugular.

               Anderson shoots Witwer, once in the heart.  Witwer is thrown
               back across the room, against a wall, beneath the clock.

               Anderson drags himself to the Precog, and rips the yellow IV
               out of the main line.  The yellow drips onto the floor,
               mingling with Witwer's red.

               Anderson crawls to his friend, and cradles him.  Witwer
               whispers something, and Anderson leans close to hear him.

 WITWER                          Now do you believe?

               Anderson pulls away from Witwer, and lets him take his last
               breaths alone.

 DARKNESS 
               And then, slowly emerging from the mists of darkness, a pale,
               beautifully proportioned FACE.

               It is Rose's face.  The camera pulls back and we see that
               she is lying on a grassy hillside.  Her brother is lying
               beside her.

               They are looking up at the night sky, at a sky filled with
               stars.

               Rose stares up into the sky, and speaks in a soft voice to
               her brother.

 ROSE                          James.  Can you guess what I'm
                         thinking?

 NO.

 DARKNESS 
               And then, slowly emerging from the mists of darkness, a pale,
               beautifully proportioned FACE.

               The oval face is female, a woman of indeterminate age, her
               features as fragile as porcelain.  Her eyes are closed in
               sleep, or in death ... or in something in between.

               Now TWO MORE FACES emerge out of the darkness.  They are
               male, and they float into position on either side of the
               female.  They are just as ethereally beautiful, just as pale,
               and like the female their eyes are closed.

               The ghostly lips of the female begin to twitch.  Her features,
               which have been expressionless, suddenly contort, mask-like,
               into the face of a woman in fear.  Her eyes open.

               The male face on her right contorts too.  His features warp
               into an angry snarl -- the mask of a man enraged.  His eyes
               open.

               The male face on her left takes on the expression of a young
               boy, a boy who is terribly frightened.  His eyes open wide.

               As if they are lost in the same terrible waking dream, a
               sudden and unnerving exchange begins ...

 FEMALE                               (frightened woman)
 JOHNNY, PLEASE MALE RIGHT                               (mocking man)
                         "Johnny, please.  Johnny please."

 FEMALE                          You're scaring me.

 MALE LEFT                               (child's voice)
 DADDY, DON'T. DADDY 
 MALE RIGHT                               (considering)
                         I don't like you any more, Carol.

 FEMALE                               (imploring)
                         Put the scissors down.  You're scaring
                         me.  Please.

 MALE RIGHT                          Oh, Carol.

 FEMALE                          Johnny!  Stop!

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 2. 

 MALE RIGHT                          Don't grab at me!  Let

 MALE LEFT                          Daddy!  No!

               All we see are three faces on the screen mouthing words but
               we can imagine a terrible struggle taking place before us: a
               man with scissors lunging at his wife, her anguished scream,
               the whimpering cries of their son.

               And then there is silence, and it is over, and the three
               faces instantly return to their impassive porcelain state.
               Their eyes slowly close.  They do not move.

               So that when they do move again, it is startling.  In abrupt
               unison, the EYES flash open.  Three pairs of eyes stare
               straight at us, accusing.

               Three mouths open, but speak, in rasping tones, as one.

 ALL THREE                          Murderer!

               The faces linger a moment, the weary eyes slowly close, and
               the dark reaches forth, and takes them.

 DISSOLVE TO: 
 EXT. SUBURBIA DAY 
               Morning in America.  Just look at it.  America in the
               midfifties, the suburban landscape stretching endlessly into
               the sun drenched distance.  White house upon white house.
               Emerald lawns, glistening with dew.

               In each driveway, a big Chevy, or a Ford, muscled with chrome,
               long tailfins that taper like the fins on rocket ships.

               Kids burst out of the houses, and zoom down sidewalks on
               trikes.  Mothers in bright dresses stand in doorways,
               watching.  The smiling mothers wave to one another, then go
               back into their houses.

               Dogs bark, birds sing in trees of just the right height,
               boys and girls laugh and ring the bells on their trikes.  It
               is a delicious world, where dogs and birds and children are
               safe.

 INT. A HOUSE 
               A family room with all the trappings of the era: a flagstone
               fireplace, a console TV, a man's leatherette Barca-Lounger,
               a pipe stand holding two pipes on a nearby table, boxes of
               children's games neatly stacked on a wall shelf.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 3. 

               A young mother, CAROL, her hair -in a pony-tail, stands at a
               picture window in a corner of the family room, staring mildly
               at the scene outside.

 CAROL'S POV - A LITTLE GIRL 
               A little girl bounces a red ball on the sidewalk.  The ball
               gets away from her, and rolls into the street.

               At the same moment, a two-toned CHEVY, lush and huge, rounds
               the corner.

               The girl sees the car coming, but still goes after the ball.

 THE FAMILY ROOM 
               Carol sees what is about to happen -- but she doesn't cry
               out, or bang on the window, or run for the front door.  She
               watches.  And smiles a little.

 OUTSIDE 
               The girl careens gleefully into the middle of the street.

 INSIDE THE CHEVY 
               The driver -- a man in a loose fitting dark green suit, white
               shirt, thin brown tie -- sits behind the steering wheel of
               the car.

               Disturbingly, the man's hands are not on the steering wheel.
               Not only that, he is holding the morning newspaper up in
               front of him, reading, oblivious to the scene before him.

               Through the windshield, we see the little girl in the road
               in front of him, going for her ball.

               CAROL Watches, her smile in place.

 OUTSIDE 
	       The little girl picks up her red ball, as the Chevy bears 
	       down on her.

 INSIDE THE CHEVY 
               An alarm suddenly CHIRPS.  The car automatically brakes to a
               halt.  The man looks around the edge of his paper to see
               what is happening.

 THE STREET 
               The car has stopped, inches from the girl.

               The girl giggles as, the man in the car gives her a big wink.
               She waves, then runs back to the sidewalk with her red ball.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 4. 

               The man goes back to his newspaper, and the car, entirely on
               its own, starts up again.  The car rounds a corner, and
               disappears.

 INSIDE THE HOUSE 
               Carol turns away from the window.  She startles when she
               sees her husband, JOHNNY, is there behind her.  He is in his
               pajamas.  How long has he been there, watching her?

 JOHNNY                               (gruff)
                         Why'd you let me sleep so long?

 CAROL                          It's Saturday, Johnny, you always --
                              (beat)
                         Why are you staring at me like that?

               He takes a step toward her.  He stands there, his thick black
               hair tousled with sleep, scratching his stubbled jaw,
               considering her.

 JOHNNY                          I'm unhappy that you let me sleep so
                         long.

               He takes another step toward her.  She doesn't move a muscle.
               A little BOY suddenly enters the room.  Johnny turns, looks
               at his son, looks back over his shoulder at his wife.  Then,
               without a word, he begins to walk out of the room.  On his
               way out, Johnny's eyes flick to Carol's sewing basket, which
               sits beside a sewing machine.  It is not the sewing that has
               caught his attention, but a large pair of garment SCISSORS
               which lie across a fold of colored cloth.

 EXT. THE HOUSE -- MOMENTS LATER 
               Johnny stands on the front porch, scratching.  He walks down
               his front walk, and bends over to pick up the newspaper.
               Carol stands in the doorway, watching him.

               A SHADOW slides over Johnny, cast from above.  The air fills
               with the piercing WHINE of an engine.  Johnny looks up,
               alarmed.

               In the sky above him, just beyond the tips of the suburban
               trees, is a black PRECRIME POLICE HOVERCRAFT.

               The children, the mothers, Carol in the doorway -- everyone
               freezes in place, as Johnny is cast into an inexplicable
               drama.

               Racing SOUNDLESSLY down the street toward him, are SLEEK
               TECHNOLOGICAL MARVELS, lethal and efficient looking -- they
               seem to be cars -- but they are so different from the fat
               Fords and Chevies in the driveways that it is hard for us to
               process them.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 5. 

               Helmeted police with mirrored visors erupt out of the cars.
               More police drop from the hovercraft in harnesses.  Their
               uniforms are black, seem actually to absorb light.  Their
               left hands are bare, their right hands are encased in some
               sort of complicated glove.

 CLOSE 
 ON - A GLOVE 
               The glove is a weapon of some kind, the elongated index finger
               ending in an open barrel.

               Clearly, this is not, as it first seemed, the past -- not
               America in the 1950's.  It is the neo-past, the retro world
               of America 2040, where the familiar of yesterday is
               intermeshed with hypertechnology.

               And all of that hypertechnology is focused on JOHNNY, as he
               makes a run for the house, sheets of newspaper scattering
               behind him.  He bursts up the front porch, shoving Carol out
               of the way.

               Eight Precrime police officers assemble in the yard. From a
               backpack, one of them quickly removes an instrument with a
               handle grip and an ovoid screen.  It is a holographic scanner.

               He activates it, scans the OFFICER in front of him, and an
               IDENTICAL POLICE OFFICER takes three-dimensional form.

               The two real officers circle the house, repeating the maneuver
               a dozen times.

               In less than a minute, a decoy force of men -- three
               dimensional, standing in place, but shifting and turning
               like living beings -- has been created.  An overwhelming
               police deterrent presence has been established.

 INSIDE THE HOUSE 
               The Precrime police overwhelm the interior of the house,
               too.  It is impossible to tell which officers are real, and
               which are scanned holographs.  The juxtaposition of the
               futuristic cops in a 1950's style house is disorienting.

 INSIDE A BEDROOM CLOSET 
               Johnny, in his pajamas, crouches beneath a rack full of his
               wife's dresses.

 UPSTAIRS HALLWAY 
               Two OFFICERS, standing back-to-back, hold their gloved hands
               out in front of them, palm out.  When the first officer points
               his palm toward a door at the end of the hallway, his glove
               BEEPS softly.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 6. 

               The officer looks at his PALM.  A red thermal IMAGE appears
               on a small flexible screen -- the heat outline of a crouching
               man.  The first officer flicks his helmeted head to the second
               officer.

 THE BEDROOM 
               The room is packed with police -- how many are real?

 THE CLOSET 
               Johnny squirms, his pajamas saturated with sweat.  He calls
               out through the door.

 JOHNNY                          I didn't do anything!

 OUTSIDE THE CLOSET 
               Every OFFICER in the room lifts his gloved hand and points
               his index barrel at the closet door.  The effect is deeply
               accusatory.

               An OFFICER speaks, his VOICE electronically manipulated to
               be as menacing as possible.

 OFFICER 1                          Come out of the closet on your hands
                         and knees.

               Nothing happens.  Two officers aim their barrels at the
               perimeter of the door.  In repeated, small SONIC BLASTS, the
               closet door is blown off of its frame, revealing Johnny among
               the dresses.

               Johnny starts to rise, and BAM, a section of floorboards is
               blasted away beneath his feet.

 OFFICER 1                          Hands and knees!

               Johnny trips among the splintered floorboards, and drops.
               He stays on his hands and knees, and approaches.  He lifts
               his head and looks up at the officer.

 JOHNNY                          I didn't... 

		Another OFFICER 2 bends down with a DEVICE -- the words
		"IdentiScan" on its side -- and blips a red laser light 
		into each of Johnny's, eyes, reading his irises.  The 
                officer nods affirmatively to the other officer.

 OFFICER 2 POSITIVE FOR JOHN PALMER. 
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 7. 

 OFFICER 1                               (to Johnny)
                         John Palmer, if you were being
                         arrested for any other crime, I would
                         now read you your rights.
                              (beat)
                         But you are under arrest for the
                         future murderer of your wife, Carol
                         Palmer.  You have no rights.

               Johnny, on his hands and knees, goes limp.

 EXT. THE HOUSE -- LATER 
               In the background, Johnny is guided into a Precrime police
               vehicle as the neighbors look on.  Carol and her son stand
               in the doorway, stunned.

               TWO OFFICERS remove their helmets.  The first man is tall,
               sandy-haired, good eyes, deeply blue; This is PAUL ANDERSON,
               late thirties, Director of the Precrime Division, Washington
 D.C. 
               The second man is ED WITWER, Anderson's second in command,
               late thirties, big like Anderson, good face, strong in the
               shoulders, short brown hair.

               The two men are deeply comfortable together.  They can speak,
               or not.  It doesn't matter -- they still communicate.  Two
               good cops, good together.

               They walk side-by-side around the house, dematerializing the
               holographic decoy cops.

 WITWER                          Thought we might a had a runner.

               Anderson seems tired, takes a moment to answer.

 ANDERSON                          Yeah, a runner.

 WITWER                          A little chase -- that'd been good.

 ANDERSON                          Fifty cops on the scene takes the
                         chase out of them.

 WITWER                               (smiles)
                         But only eight of us were real.

               Witwer dematerializes the last decoy.

 ANDERSON                          We ever get a runner, I'd be too old
                         to give chase.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 8. 

 WITWER                          You'd chase.  You'd love it,.  Man.

               They get to the front of the house and watch the Precrime
               vehicle holding Johnny zoom SOUNDLESSLY away.

 ANDERSON                          I love it more Johnny boy doesn't
                         get to murder his wife.

 WITWER                               (beat)
                         It's a beautiful world.

 EXT. SAME SCENE -- LATER 
               The children play on their trikes.  The wives talk among
               themselves.  The birds sing, the dogs bark.

               The little girl bounces her red ball again.  She stops a.
               minute, when two pieces of newspaper blow past her,
               unexpectantly littering the orderly suburban landscape.

 INT. A BEDROOM - SUBURBAN VIRGINIA (OUTSIDE WASHINGTON) DAY 
               Decorated in a 1950's style.  Anderson lies in bed beside
               his wife, LISA, a pretty, green-eyed brunette.  It is early
               morning, they are both awake.  Her hand caresses his chest.
               Maybe they will make love.

               Lisa's hand stops suddenly on the center of Anderson's chest.

 LISA                          Jesus, Paul.  Your heart's hammering.
                              (playfully)
                         I excite you that much?

               He turns to her, and the grim set of his jaw makes her smile
               vanish.

 ANDERSON                          I used to love being a cop.  

 LISA                          You're still a cop.  I'm a factory
                         worker.  We don't catch murderers.
                         We process them.

               Lisa takes a long breath.  She's been down this road before.
               She speaks reassuringly.

 LISA                          You're the best homicide cop in the
                         country.

	       ANDERSON snorts disdainfully.

 ANDERSON                          Great -- except there's no such thing
                         as homicide.  What I do best doesn't
                         exist anymore.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 9. 

 LISA PAUL.                               (beat)
                         You're the Director of a perfect
                         system.  A Cop with a perfect record

 ANDERSON                          The Precogs have a perfect record.
                         They identify the accused -- I just
                         put on my monkey suit and go round
                         them up.

               Lisa hugs him, kisses the back of his neck.

 LISA                          And then I prosecute them.  And they
                         go to jail.  And lives are saved.
                         Thousands of lives.
                              (beat)
                         And that's a cop's dream.

               Anderson is silent for a time.  He sighs, then smiles, and
               turns to his wife, takes her in his arms.

 ANDERSON                          No.  You're a cop's dream.

 INT. THE BATHROOM -- LATER 
               Anderson steps out of the shower, and begins to towel himself
               dry- He glances out a casement window.  He tilts his head,
               curious, then wipes at the steam on the window.

 ANDERSON'S POV LISA 
               Lisa stands in the backyard in her nightgown, talking on a
               cell phone.  She hangs up, moves quickly back into the house.

 ANDERSON 
               Cocks his head, then goes back to toweling off.

 INT. KITCHEN -- LATER 
               Checkered linoleum floor.  Appliances out of the 1950's.

               Except there are little differences.  When Lisa puts a skillet
               of eggs on the stove, the heating element is not an electric
               coil, or gas but a shimmering field of light.

               Lisa is dressed in a blue jersey skirt and a brief jacket.
               Anderson wears a gray suit, thin blue tie, white shirt,
               wingtipped shoes.  He doesn't look up from the newspaper as
               he speaks.

 ANDERSON                          Who called?

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 10. 

               Lisa keeps her back to him as she flips the eggs.  She touches
               her long brown hair.

 LISA                          No one.  I called about my hair.
                         Getting it done this afternoon.

               Anderson looks like he's about to say something else, when
               suddenly someone RAPS on the back screen door.  Anderson and
               Lisa both turn and smile.

 ANDERSON                          Come on in, neighbor.  Want some
                         coffee?

 OUTSIDE THE DOOR 
               FRANK D'IGNAZIO, 65, white-haired, robust, hesitates before
               coming in.  A thin METALLIC ARM with a red laser light arches
               quickly down from above the doorway, shines into each of his
               EYES, scanning the irises.  The arm lifts out of view, the
               screen door UNLATCHES.

               Frank enters the kitchen, carrying a basket of tomatoes.

 FRANK D'IGNAZIO                          Brought these for your supper.

 LISA                          Oh, Frank.  That's so sweet.  Thank
                         you.

 FRANK D'IGNAZIO                          Sweet, nothing.  I gotta get rid of
                         these things.  One plant, and I'm
                         invaded by tomatoes.  When I was a
                         kid ...

               Anderson laughs, claps his friend and neighbor on the back,
               teases him.

 ANDERSON                          Before all this genetically engineered
                         crap ...

               Frank gives him an ornery look, then a smile.

 FRANK D'IGNAZIO                          Yeah well, it's true.  It used to be
                         a challenge to grow things.  An art.
                         Now you put one plant in the ground
                         -- then jump the hell out of the
                         way.

               Anderson gestures for Frank to sit down.

 ANDERSON                          Coffee?

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 11. 

 FRANK D'IGNAZIO                          Nah, thanks.  Can't stay.  You guys
                         are rushing off to work anyway.

               Lisa sets the eggs down in front of Anderson.

 LISA                          You and Ellie come for supper then.

 ANDERSON                          We'll barbecue.

               Frank nods and pushes on the screen door.

 FRANK D'IGNAZIO                          You betcha.  We'll bring some more
                         tomatoes -- a new batch will have
                         grown by then.

               They all laugh, Frank exits, Anderson goes back to his paper.

 EXT. DRIVEWAY -- LATER 
               Anderson waves to Lisa.  Her big Studebaker drives off down
               the tree-lined street and away.

               Anderson approaches his Chevy.  He doesn't take out a key to
               unlock it.  There is no lock.  He slides in behind the wheel.
               Doesn't take out a key for the ignition -- there is no
               ignition.

               A thin METALLIC ARM arches down from the sun visor, scans
               Anderson's EYES, identifying him.  A seat harness wraps around
               him, and the car STARTS.

               Anderson picks up a folder marked "Precrime" and begins to
               read through the papers.  The Chevy backs out of the driveway
               and takes him to work.

 EXT. INTERSTATE 95 - ALEXANDRIA, VA -- LATER 
               A vast spread of corporate and government buildings -- the
               spillover from Washington D.C. across the Potomac River into
               Virginia.

               Beyond the white of Washington is "The Sprawl" -- the massive
               unzoned city that has spread uncontrolled on the outskirts
               of the Capitol.  It is impenetrable and uninviting, especially
               to those comfortable in the utopian suburbs.

               Anderson's Chevy moves in a sea of fifties-type cars.
               Occasionally, an ultramodern vehicle zips past them.  In the
               sky above is another sea -- of advertising dirigibles,
               holographic billboards, hovercrafts, skim-jet transports.
               On one of the holographic billboards giant words begin to
               flash: "I LIKE MIKE!"

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 12. 

               Then a picture of the smiling President appears.  Then the
               words: "RE-ELECT PRESIDENT MIKE BILLINGS FOR ANOTHER FOUR
 YEARS! KEEP THE PAST IN OUR FUTURE!" 
 INSIDE ANDERSON'S CHEVY 
               Through his windshield, Anderson glances at a holographic
               road sign.

               THE ROAD SIGN reads: "FBI Headquarters 1 mile.  CIA
               Headquarters 1.5 miles.  PRECRIME Headquarters 2 miles."

               Anderson goes back to his papers.

 INT. PRECRIME HEADQUARTERS 
               Anderson sits in a too large office in a too large chair.
               He abruptly rises and begins to pace.  The room is large,
               but he paces like a lion confined in a cage.

               He punches an intercom.  A female VOICE responds.

 INTERCOM VOICE                          Yes, Director Anderson?

 ANDERSON                          Where's Ennis Page?  Why hasn't he
                         delivered this morning's Precog discs?

               Ed Witwer opens the door to the office., and casually walks
               in.

 INTERCOM VOICE                          I'll find him, sir.

               Ed shakes his head, smiles.

 WITWER                          Bullying the staff again, Director
                         Anderson?

 ANDERSON                          Screw you.

               Anderson turns away and stares out a large window.  Witwer
               joins him.

 ANDERSON (CONT'D)                          Was that fun for you, yesterday?

 WITWER                          The Johnny Palmer bust?

 ANDERSON                          Yeah.

 WITWER                          It was okay.  We got our man.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 13. 

               Anderson takes a long breath.

 ANDERSON                          When do we not get our man?

               They turn as Ennis PAGE, 44, a thin, tight little man with
               burr cut hair, knocks and enters the room.  He carries a
               black BRIEFCASE marked:

               "Zone 218 - Washington/Alexandria, VA." The case is cuffed
               to his wrist.

 PAGE                          Sorry I'm late, sir.  Precogs put
                         out a heavy national volume this
                         morning -- four for our zone.

 ANDERSON (DISTRACTED)                          Put the case on my desk, Ennis.

               Page hesitates, doesn't do it.  Anderson moves quickly to
               Page.

 ANDERSON (CONT'D)                          What was I thinking.

               Anderson leans over the BRIEFCASE.  A small panel recedes, a
               red laser scanner clicks on, scans Anderson's eyes, BEEPS
               affirmatively, then clicks off.  The cuff on Page's wrist
               falls open.

               Now Page puts the case on Anderson's desk.  Page hesitates.
               Anderson and Witwer know just what he's going to do.  Page
               reaches down, unable to resist straightening a pile of papers
               strewn on Anderson's desk.

               Anderson and Witwer exchange knowing smiles.  When Page looks
               up they try to cover, but are not quick enough.  He frowns
               tightly, and heads for the door.

               Anderson calls after him.

 ANDERSON                          Thanks, Ennis.  

               Witwer turns to leave, too.

 WITWER                          Now that's a guy who really cares.

               Witwer grins to himself as he walks out of the office.

               Anderson takes a deep breath and goes to his desk, and opens
               the briefcase.  Four small bright DISCS sit in rows.  He
               removes one, places it in a VIDEO MONITOR that lifts into
               view from the center of his desk.  He sits back, weary, and
               watches.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 14. 

 VIDEO SCREEN 
               A young black woman stands in a hallway.  She stares at a
               door, gun in hand.  She opens the door, enters a bedroom.

               She glides toward a bed, where a man lies sleeping.  She
               lifts the gun and fires it into his sleeping form.

               ANDERSON pops the disc, jots down some notes, pops in a new
               disc.

 VIDEO SCREEN 
               A white woman stands at a stove, cooking.  A man comes up
               behind her slowly, silently, a necktie taut between his hands.
               He raises the necktie toward her neck

 ANDERSON 
               He's not watching the screen.  He is out of his chair now, 
               looking out the window.

 INT. PRECRIME MAIN LOBBY 
               A tour of Precrime is in progress, like the public relations
               tours run by present-day FBI.  The TOUR GUIDE, a pretty,
               smartly uniformed woman in her twenties, leads a group of
               adults and children, all with glowing nametags, through the
               building.

 TOUR GUIDE                          Welcome to the main headquarters of
                         Precrime.  Smaller Precrime branches
                         are scattered throughout the United
                         States.

               The group follows the guide slowly through the lobby.

 TOUR GUIDE (CONT'D)                          Precrime was established in 2030,
                         with the harnessing of the remarkable
                         talents of the Precognitive mutants.

               She points cheerfully to a stubby little man, MR. HARRIS.

 TOUR GUIDE (CONT'D)                          Mr. Harris, can you tell me how many
                         Precogs there are?

 MR. HARRIS                          Three.  Uh, right?

 TOUR GUIDE                          That's exactly right!  A lot of people
                         assume there are Precogs in every
                         branch office.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 15. 

 TOUR GUIDE (CONT'D)                          But there are only three Precogs,
                         right here in this building.  And
                         the information they give us, we
                         send out to all the other branches.
                              (beat)
                         And what is that information -what
                         do the Precogs do?

               An eager boy, TIMMY has the answer to that one.

 TIMMY                          They protect us.

               The guide tousles his hair.

 TOUR GUIDE                               (chipper voice)
                         That's right, Timmy.  Because of the
                         Precogs, you're going to grow up
                         murderfree.  Isn't that something?

 MR. HARRIS                          They ever wrong?  The Precogs ever
                         screw up when they predict a murder?

               The guide laughs tolerantly.

 TOUR GUIDE                          Never, sir.  It's an infallible
                         system.  The Precogs predict a
                         homicide, and our Precrime police
                         then apprehend that future murderer
                         before the event occurs.  And right
                         next door is the Judicial Center,
                         where we prosecute the
                         future murderers.

 TIMMY                          Can we see the Precogs?

 TOUR GUIDE                          No, I'm sorry.  That part of the
                         building is not open to the public.
                              (beat)
                         Now, if you'll just step this way
 ... 
               She waves the group on toward an elevator.

 INT. THE PRECOG CHAMBER 
               The chamber is an elaborate, hypertech hospital, constructed
               for the maintenance of three beings -- the Precogs.  They
               are triplets -- two of the Precogs are male, one is female.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 16. 

               Technicians swarm all over them like worker bees.  The bodies
               of the Precogs are being tended to: exercised, cleansed,
               groomed.

               The head of each Precog is encased in a complex, ornate HELMET
               that seems to be an amalgam of organic tissues and bright
               metallics.  The helmets pulse slightly, and the surfaces
               seem to flow and shift, like oil on water.

               A network of micro-thin cables that are actually strands of
               light, rise Medusa-like from each helmet, then centralize
               into a single strand, and connect to a massive mainframe
               computer.

               The Precogs appear to be in suspended animation, or in comas.
               They are absolutely still and limp -- except for their faces.
               Their faces are in constant motion, the lips mouthing scenes
               from murders only they can see.  Life for a Precog is an
               endless cycle of death.

 CLOSE ON - THE FEMALE PRECOG 
               we recognize her fragile and perfect FACE from the opening
               scene of the movie.  She floats in a glowing nutritive bath.
               Like her brothers, she seems to be eternally young, or
               eternally old.

               The technicians lift her from her bath.  She is dried, dressed
               in a robe, then guided into an over-sized, throne like chair.
               Her brothers are guided into their thrones, on either side
               of her.

               Not once are their helmets removed.  What they feed into the
               mainframe is too valuable.  It must be gathered twenty-four
               unrelenting hours a day.

 INT. A ROOM 
               Ennis Page sits in a room just off the Precog Chamber.  He
               can see them through a large window.  He works a large
               computer console, the gathering point for the information
               the Precogs constantly feed the computer.

               Perhaps every ten seconds, a small DISC is released by the
               computer, and mechanically gathered, sorted, and placed -under
               Page's watchful eye -- into a black case.

               ANDERSON is in the room standing quietly behind Page.  As
               Director, Anderson is authorized to come and go, but from
               his fussy movements, it's obvious Page sees anyone else in
               the room as an intruder in his special domain.

               Anderson turns and looks through the window at the Precogs.

 ANDERSON                          What would they think about if we
                         unhooked them?

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 17. 

               Page looks up from his work.

 PAGE                          They don't think, sir.  They just
                         see.

               Anderson is silent.

 PAGE (CONT'D)                          They're not even alive, really.

               Anderson contemplates the scene, nods to Page's words, then
               turns and walks out of the room, as Page looks on.

 INT. THE PRECOG CHAMBER 


               The female Precog sits in her chair.  Her eyes are open.
               She faces the window that looks into Page's main frame room.
               In the window we see Anderson leaving the room.

               The female Precog's eyes drift closed.

 DISSOLVE TO: 
 INT.COURTROOM - JUDICIAL CENTER -- DAY 
               A trial is in progress.  The defendant is Johnny Palmer.  He
               sits, ashen, at a table, his DEFENSE ATTORNEY beside him.

               There are no jurors in the Juror BOX.  There is a JUDGE, 55,
               and stern.  There are a few people in the public seats.

               The Precrime prosecuting attorney is Lisa Anderson.  She
               wears a black robe, and addresses the Director of Precrime,
               Anderson, who sits in the witness stand.

 LISA                          Director Anderson, do you swear that
                         the disc you now present to the court
                         is the only and authentic disc of
                         the future murder of Carol Palmer by
                         her husband, John Palmer?

               It is a ritual that they both have acted out hundreds of
               times.  Anderson gives the rote answer as he holds up the
 DISC. 
 ANDERSON                          Yes.  This is the only and authentic
                         disc of the event seen by the
                         Precognitive mutants and recorded by
                         the Precrime Division.  This is the
                         immutable evidence of the infallible
                         system.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 18. 

 LISA                          The murder of Carol Palmer will occur
 ... ? 
 ANDERSON                          In one week -- June 16th, 2040 at
                         10:33 in the morning.

               Lisa steps back.  The judge reaches out and Anderson hands
               him the disc.  The judge inserts it into a special video
               machine on his desk.  Anderson steps down, his ritual part
               in this trial completed.

               A huge MONITOR comes to life behind the judge.  He does not
               turn around to watch -- he has his own monitor.

               Johnny Palmer watches, eyes wide.  We now see, in detail,
               what we previously heard the Precogs act out in the beginning
               of the movie.

 THE MONITOR 
               The Palmer's family room.  Johnny reaches into Carol's sewing
               basket for the scissors.  Carol stands defenseless in front
               of him.  Their son cowers in a corner of the room.

 CAROL                          Johnny, please --

 JOHNNY                          "Johnny, please.  Johnny please."

 CAROL                          You're scaring me.

 JOHNNY'S SON DADDY, DON'T. DADDY 
               Johnny approaches his wife with deadly menace.

 JOHNNY                               (considering)
                         I don't like you any more, Carol.

 CAROL                               (imploring)
                         Put the scissors down.  You're scaring
                         me. Please.  

               We cut away from the monitor and stay on JOHNNY PALMER'S FACE 
               as he sits at the defense table.  He winces at each terrible exchange.

 JOHNNY (O.S.)                          Oh, Carol.

 CAROL (O.S.)                          Johnny!  Stop!

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 19. 

 JOHNNY (O.S.)                          Don't grab at me!  Let go...

 JOHNNY'S SON (O.S.)                          Daddy!  No!

               Johnny Palmer cries out as the MONITOR goes blank.

 JOHNNY                          I didn't do it.  I'm innocent!  It
                         didn't happen!

               The JUDGE hits his gavel.

 JUDGE                          How does the defense plead?

               The defense attorney glances at his watch, then quickly
               rattles off the words to his part of this judicial ritual.

 DEFENSE ATTORNEY                          The defense acknowledges the
                         infallibility of the system.  We are
                         Guilty.  We throw ourselves at the
                         mercy of the court.

 JOHNNY                          No! No! The Precogs are wrong!  No!

               The court guards are on him in an instant.  They lead him
               out of the courtroom.

 INT.A BOARDING HOUSE - THE SPRAWL -- DAY 
               Anderson pushes down a tight hallway thick with police and
               enters a disheveled room.  The fifties interior is drab: a
               Formica table, bad curtains, a frayed Lazy Boy positioned in
               front of a TV.

               Ed Witwer is already on the scene.  He stands a few feet
               from the BODY of a man, gunshot wound to the head, a handgun
               on the floor nearby.

 WITWER                               (to Anderson)
                         Looks like the old days.

               Anderson nods to his former partner.  Anderson leans over
               the body.

 ANDERSON                          That would be bad news for an
                         infallible system.

               Witwer is suddenly bored.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 20. 

 WITWER                          We know it can't be a murder -- the
                         Precogs would've seen it.  Why do
                         you insist on coming to these things?

 ANDERSON                          Keeps the system honest.  And besides,
                         I like to pretend I'm a cop.

               Anderson turns to an officer.

 ANDERSON (CONT'D)                          Who's got the Coroner?

               Another OFFICER steps forward with a large blue case.

 OFFICER                          Right here, sir.

               The officer places the case beside the corpse, and opens the
               latches.  Inside the case is a large metallic APPARATUS: the
               "Coroner."

               It comes to auto-life, and begins to unfold itself - It rises
               crab-like, and steps out of its case.

               Except for his mouth, the doctor doesn't move.  His projected
               image stands beside the body, his arms folded behind his
               back.  He is the interface, the way the humans communicate
               with the crab apparatus.

 ANDERSON                          Hi DOC.

 HOLOGRAPHIC DOCTOR                          Hello, Director Anderson.

               The coroner crab begins to walk the body, which is face down
               on the floor.  It moves slowly, hesitating as it crawls the
               body's back to insert various razor thin probes and core
               samplers through the shirt and into the spinal cord.

 WITWER                          This a homicide, Doc?

 HOLOGRAPHIC DOCTOR                          I'm presently analyzing neurohormones,
                         Assistant Director Witwer.  I have
                         not concluded my examination.

               The crab engulfs the back of the head, probes the wound.

 HOLOGRAPHIC DOCTOR (CONT'D)                          I'm detecting carbonization of skull
                         fragments around the entry wound.

               Witwer whispers to Anderson.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 21. 

 WITWER                          Bingo.  The guy put the gun to his
                         own head.

 HOLOGRAPHIC DOCTOR                          I have not determined that yet,
                         Assistant Director.

               Witwer grins.

 WITWER                          You have good ears for a ghost, Doc.

               The coroner crab steps away from the body.

 HOLOGRAPHIC DOCTOR                          Please rotate the corpse to the
                         lateral supine position.

               Two officers turn the body face-up.  The crab inches close
               to probe the face.  Disconcertingly, it lifts the eyelids,
               and examines the interior of the mouth, so that for a moment
               the manipulation makes the corpse seem alive.

               Then the crab moves down the trunk and the legs At last, it
               comes to a standstill.  The holographic Doctor closes his
               eyes as if in thought.

 WITWER                          Can you imagine if this was a
                         homicide?  Who even knows how to
                         hunt down a killer any more?

               Anderson gives him a hard look.

 ANDERSON                          I know how, dammit.  You know how.

 WITWER                          Easy, partner.
                              (beat)
                         But you know what I'm saying.  The
                         state legislatures are pushing to
                         stop funding for training homicide
                         detectives ...

 ANDERSON                          God bless the Precogs.

               The Doctor opens his eyes.

 HOLOGRAPHIC DOCTOR                          This event is a negative homicide.
                         A mortal wound was generated by a
                         .22 calibre bullet self-delivered to
                         the parietal 'portion of the skull
                         on June 10th, 2040, at 11:57 pm,
 (MORE) 
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 22. 

 HOLOGRAPHIC DOCTOR (CONT'D)                          Eastern Standard Time.  This event
                         is a positive suicide.

               The holographic doctor begins to shimmer, then disappears
               back into the coroner crab.  The crab crawls back into its
               case, folds its probes and legs tight to its metal body, and
               shuts down.

               Witwer turns to Anderson.

 WITWER                          It's time to stop coming to these,
                         partner.

               Anderson watches as the med techs lift the body onto a
               stretcher.

 ANDERSON                          Yeah.  You're right.

 INT. A BANQUET - WASHINGTON, D.C. -- NIGHT 
               Anderson, in black-tie, with Lisa in a shimmering blue gown
               at his side, moves through a huge room filled high level
               government officials and politicians.

 ANDERSON                          A little bit of me dies every time I
                         come to one of these things.

 LISA                          It's only a party, Paul.

 ANDERSON                          I'd never have let them appoint me
                         to Precrime if I'd have known this
                         was going to be part of it.

 LISA                          You're exactly what Precrime needed.
                         An amazing homicide cop and a real
                         person in an unreal job.

 ANDERSON                          Exactly.  

 LISA 			 The public loves the
                         Precogs.  But they give people the
                         creeps, too.  You're something they
                         understandp a regular cop running
                         things.

               Anderson sighs as he looks around the elegantly appointed
               banquet hall.

 ANDERSON                          Let's invite all these irregular
                         assholes over for a barbecue.  Burgers
                         and beer - think they'd come?

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 23. 

               A barrel-chested man with a great shock of pepper gray hair,
               SENATOR MALCOLM, 58, takes hold of Anderson's elbow from
               behind.

 SENATOR MALCOLM                          I'd come, Mr. Director.  And I'd
                         make all the other assholes come
                         with me.

               Lisa reddens, Anderson gives an embarrassed cough.  The
               Senator laughs and claps him on the back.

 SENATOR MALCOLM (CONT'D)                          Nice job this morning.  Another
                         negative homicide.  The Precogs never
                         let us down.

               Mrs. Malcolm smoothly occupies Lisa, while the Senator eases
               Anderson in the opposite direction 

 SENATOR MALCOLM                         I have a dream, Paul.

 ANDERSON                          I know you do, Senator.

 SENATOR MALCOLM                          Hundreds of Precogs.  Not just
                         predicting murders, but predicting
                         all crimes.  Burglary, arson, assaults
 ... 
 ANDERSON                          How about jaywalking?  Littering?
                         Now there's a crime.

               The Senator smiles through his teeth.

 SENATOR MALCOLM                          I don't want a police state, you
                         know that.  But we have an opportunity
                         here, and

 ANDERSON                          No sir, we don't have that
                         opportunity.  There are only three
                         Precogs.  They're a lucky accident
                         of nature.  There are no more.

 SENATOR MALCOLM                               (beat)
                         We can make more.  Just give me your
                         support.  Help me increase funding
                         for the Precog Engineering Project.

 ANDERSON                          Precogs aren't sheep or pigs.  Seeing
                         into the future is a gift, a
                         nonreproducible event.
 (MORE) 
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 24. 

 ANDERSON (CONT'D)                          There was only one Mozart, and there
                         are only three Precogs.

 SENATOR MALCOLM                          Fuck Mozart.  The people want to be
                         safe.  They want that more than they
                         want food or love.

               He gestures at the room full of glittering partygoers.

 SENATOR MALCOLM (CONT'D)                          Look at us -it's 2040 and we've
                         wrapped ourselves up in the 1950's
                         like a big security blanket.  Why?
                         Because we want to feel like they
                         felt.  Safe.

 ANDERSON                          Senator, a world filled with hundreds
                         of Precogs is not my idea of a safe
                         place.

               The Senator gives it one last shot.

 SENATOR MALCOLM                          Sure could use your help, Paul.

 ANDERSON                          I decline, Senator.  I'm sorry.

 SENATOR MALCOLM                               (icily)
                         Don't think I'll come to your barbecue
                         after all.

               The senator moves off.  Anderson stands stiffly among the
               sea of black-ties and exquisite fifties dresses.

 INT. PRECOG ENGINEERING LAB - CHEVY CHASE, MD DAY 
               Anderson walks through the lab with a tall, pale man, DR,
               RESFIELD, 60, the head scientist.  It is not a place that
               warms Anderson's heart.

               Biotechnicians work at long stainless steel tables dissecting
               and examining protoplasmic tissue masses.  Other technicians
               peer through massive microscopes.  Still others use robotic
               arms to manipulate radioactive organics behind leaded-glass
               barriers.

 DR. RESFIELD                          You don't get out here much.

 ANDERSON                          Not my sort of place.

               Dr. Resfield emits a dry little laugh.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 25. 

 DR. RESFIELD                          The head of Precrime squeamish?

 ANDERSON                          When it comes to needles and scalpels,
                         yeah.

 DR. RESFIELD                          I promise we won't use any on you.

 ANDERSON                          What do you use them on?

 DR. RESFIELD                               (beat)
                         On bits of this and that.

               Anderson looks at him.  The doctor pauses outside a thick
               door.  An IdentiScan device quickly reads their eyes, and
               the door opens with an electronic hiss.

               Anderson looks around the lab.  Technicians lower mesh
               cylinders into some sort of chemical VAT.  Another technician
               turns a dial, and an electric charge courses through the
               roiling liquid.

 ANDERSON                          What's happening here?

 DR. RESFIELD                          We're in an interesting phase.

 ANDERSON                          What's in the cylinders?

 DR. RESFIELD                          Neurotissue.

 ANDERSON                          From ...?

 DR. RESFIELD                          A fusion of sources.  From the
                         Precogs' deceased mother.  From the
                         Precogs themselves.

 ANDERSON                          A fusion of ... ?

 DR. RESFIELD                          In lay terms, we mated sperm from
                         the brothers with ova from the mother
                         and sister to create new growth.

               The CYLINDERS shudder as the voltage is increased.

 DR. RESFIELD (CONT'D)                          And then we add mutating variables.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 26. 

               Anderson stares into the roiling vat.  Dr. Resfield waits
               for more questions.  But it is clear from Anderson's
               expression he has already learned enough.

 INT. ANDERSON'S OFFICE -- DAY 
               Anderson sits in his office reviewing Precog discs for
               premurders in the local Washington area. We stay on him as he
               watches the monitor.  He pops the disc, jots down some notes,
               slides in the next disc.

               Anderson's mouth slowly opens.  He leans close to the monitor,
               his face ashen.

 EXT. FRANK D'IGNAZIO'S BACKYARD -- LATER 
               Frank is on his hands and knees, working his vegetable garden.
               He whistles softly under his breath as he trowels the rich
               soil.

               He sits up as he hears someone open the garden gate.  He
               lifts his straw hat in greeting, gives a smile.  It's
 ANDERSON. 
 FRANK D'IGNAZIO                          What are you doing, playing hooky?

               Anderson tries to smile.  But it won't come.  He looks around
               the abundant garden.

 ANDERSON                          It's great out here, Frank.. You got
                         the touch.

               Frank straightens with a grimace.

 FRANK D'IGNAZIO                          I got the arthritis, is what I got.

               Anderson reflexively looks up at a high WHINING sound from
               over head.  Frank follows his gaze.  A Precrime HOVERCRAFT
               glides into position overhead.

               Frank stares, then lowers his eyes to the ground.  He takes
               a long sad breath.

 FRANK D'IGNAZIO (CONT'D)                          Ah shit, neighbor.
                              (beat)
                         Goddamn Precogs don't miss a beat,
                         do they?
                              (beat)
                         Can we do this inside?  Ellie's not
                         home.

               Anderson's voice is full of pain.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 27. 

 ANDERSON                          Sure, Frank.  Yeah.

 INT. FRANK'S KITCHEN -- MOMENTS LATER 


               Frank wanders the kitchen, trying to focus on his situation.
               Anderson has trouble meeting his friend's eyes.

               Through a window we can see black suited police officers
               with mirrored helmets swarming outside Frank's house.

 FRANK D'IGNAZIO                               (distracted)
                         I thought I'd buried it all.
                         Thirty-five years -- all those minutes
                         and days to bury it.
                              (beat)
                         But suddenly you see the man who
                         murdered your daughter walking the
                         streets -- my God it throws you.

               Frank stops pacing.  He stares at a kitchen drawer.

 ANDERSON                          He'd served his time, Frank.  I know
                         it's not fair.  It's way beyond not
                         fair ...

               Frank looks.  At Anderson bitterly.

 FRANK D'IGNAZIO                               (yells)
                         God damn the Precogs.  You know?
                         Why couldn't they have been around
                         to save my girl?
                              (softly)
                         Now they're catching me.

               Frank reaches into the drawer and pulls out a small handgun.

 FRANK D'IGNAZIO (CONT'D)                          I really shoot the bastard, huh?
                         When?

 ANDERSON                          Next Wednesday, at noon.

 FRANK D'IGNAZIO                          Good.

               Anderson's cop eyes are all over the gun.

 ANDERSON                          It's not in you, Frank, to kill
                         anybody.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 28. 

 FRANK D'IGRAZIO                          Tell it to the Precogs.  It's set in
                         stone now, right?

               Frank puts the gun on the kitchen counter.  Anderson relaxes.

 FRANK D'IGNAZIO                               (almost inaudible)
                         I don't want to be a part of this
                         world anymore.

 ANDERSON                          I know, Frank.

               Frank gives Anderson a look -- no, friend, you don't know.
               Then Frank looks hard at the gun on the counter.

 FRANK D'IGNAZIO                               (beat)
                         So.  Tell me, Paul.  Do the Precogs
                         see everything?

 ANDERSON                          No.

 FRANK D'IGRAZIO                          Then they won't have seen this.

               Frank suddenly snatches up the gun and presses it to his own
               head.  On Anderson's anguished FACE, at the SOUND of the gun
               going off.

 EXT. FRONT YARD -- LATER 
               Anderson stands with his old partner, Witwer, on Frank's
               front porch.  Behind them, through an open door, we see Lisa
               comforting Ellie D'Ignazio in the living room.

               Anderson is deeply shaken.  Witwer tries to talk him through
               it.

 WITWER (GENTLY)                          We had to bring him in.

               Anderson doesn't respond.

 WITWER (CONT'D)                          He was a future murderer.

 ANDERSON                               (angrily)
                         You blame him?  The guy killed his
                         daughter!

               Witwer lets the implication of his words sink in.

 ANDERSON (CONT'D)                          Yeah.  I know.  I know.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 29. 

               Anderson turns and watches as they wheel Frank's draped body
               into the back of an ambulance.  Anderson's bitterness erupts.

 ANDERSON (CONT'D)                          I hate the Precogs, Ed. I believe in
                         them absolutely and I hate them
                         absolutely.  Jesus.

               Witwer listens to him.

 ANDERSON (CONT'D)                          And that goddamn lab trying to grow
                         more of them.  Put a Precog in every
                         home, you know?  So we can have more
                         Franks - people shooting themselves --
                         over who knows what?

               Witwer kneads Anderson's shoulder, talks to him in soothing
               tones like you'd calm an agitated horse.

 WITWER                          Precrime did the job it was supposed
                         to do.

               The two men can hear Ellie sobbing inside the house.

 WITWER (CONT'D)                          You know it.  And you believe in it.

 ANDERSON (BEAT)                          Yeah.

 WITWER                          It's not easy.  It beats us down.
                         Ellie in there -- no doubt she hates
                         you right now.

               Anderson turns to Witwer.

 ANDERSON                          That's why I got into this business
                         -- to be hated.

               Anderson almost manages a small smile.  Witwer puts his arm
               around him.  Walks him away from the scene.

 WITWER                          They hated us when we were regular
                         cops.  Now we're Precrime, and they
                         still hate US.  It's one of the little
                         perks of law enforcement nobody knows
                         about.

               Their quiet laughter is tinged with sadness.  Anderson looks
               into his partner's good, open face.  Then they both look
               away, their understanding of each other complete.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 30. 

 INT. ANDERSON'S BEDROOM -- LATE NIGHT 
               Anderson stares out the window at Frank's house, illuminated
               by the moon.  It's a mournful sight.

               Lisa rises on an elbow and watches him from the bed.

 DISSOLVE TO: 
 INT. PRECRIME HEADQUARTERS-ALEXANDRIA-DAY - ONE WEEK LATER 
               Ennis Page, in the mainframe room just off the Precog Chamber,
               picks up a black BRIEFCASE marked: "Zone 218 Washington /
               Alexandria, VA." He approaches the door, and his eyes are
               scanned.  The door opens with a HISS.

               We follow Page as he walks through doors and corridors until
               he reaches a long hallway leading to the Director's office.
               Anderson's secretary, Angela, looks up on Page's approach.
               She nods.  He nods.

               He walks around her desk.  His eyes are scanned, and the
               door to Anderson's office opens.

               ANDERSON looks up, wearily.

 INT. ANDERSON'S OFFICE -- LATER 
               Anderson inserts a disc into the video monitor, almost
               absently.  As we have seen him do before, he swivels his
               chair away from the monitor, and stares at Washington D.C.
               across the Potomac.  Hovercrafts and transports skim through
               the sky above the Washington Monument.

               The camera stays on Anderson's back as the sound from the
               Precog disc begins.  He hears his own voice speaking in
               strained, agitated tones.

 ANDERSON (O.S.)                          Let's not do this, Ed.

               Anderson slowly swivels around and stares with disbelief and
               horror at the monitor.

 THE MONITOR 
               shows Anderson and Witwer in a room, a few feet apart pointing
               guns directly at each other.  Their eyes intense and panicked.
               Who murders whom?

               Ed's eyes cut to a huge digital clock on the wall as the red
               seconds tumble away.

 ANDERSON                          Oh, Ed ...

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 31. 

               Witwer lowers his gun.  He stands unresisting before

               Anderson.

               Witwer sees his own death in Anderson's wild eyes, has always
               seen it.

               Anderson FIRES his weapon, puts a bullet straight into
               Witwer's heart, throwing him back against a wall.  Witwer
               slumps, dying, beneath the huge digital clock, which reads:

 5:20 AM. 
 BACK TO SCENE 
               Anderson stares as the monitor fades to a blank.  His hand
               goes to his mouth.  His body begins to shake.  He hugs
               himself, but he can't stop the shaking.

               The DISC pops out of the side of the monitor.  It is a small
               SOUND, but it has Anderson up and out of his chair as if it
               were a gunshot, He reaches for the disc but cannot touch it.
               His legs suddenly weaken, and he drops to one knee beside
               his desk, like a man in need of prayer.

               There is a single thought that screams through his brain.
               It is an almost visible thing, filling the room, blackly.
               Anderson whispers the sickening words that shape his fate.

 ANDERSON (CONT'D)                          I kill you.
                              (beat)
                         Oh god, I kill you.

               As Anderson pulls himself up, and tries to reach again for
               the disc ...

 CUT TO: 
 INT. THE PRECOG CHAMBER 
               In an image just like the scene in the beginning of the movie,
               the three FACES of the Precogs hover in the misty darkness.
               Their closed eyes open in SUDDEN UNISON.  They speak as one.

 ALL THREE                          Murderer!

               After a long moment, the eyes close again, and the Precogs
               fade into the mists ...

 CUT TO: 
 INT. ANDERSON'S OFFICE 
               Anderson looks up sharply at the SOUND of a knock on his
               door.  Every normal sound seems grotesquely AMPLIFIED, the
               traffic outside, his own breathing.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 32. 

               His senses are on overload.

               The door begins to open.  A stockinged leg is the first thing
               Anderson sees.  His secretary, ANGELA.

 ANGELA                          Sir?

               She hesitates before fully entering the room, Anderson grabs
               at the incriminating disc.  He sees his EYES reflected in
               its alloy surface.  He pushes the disc deep into his pants
               pocket.

               Somehow he finds his voice.

 ANDERSON                          Come in.  Angela.

               She looks at him, uncertain.  Then she places a small stack
               of papers on his desk.

 ANGELA                          Need you to sign these.  And your
                         eleven o'clock starts in five minutes.

 ANDERSON                          My ... eleven.

 ANGELA                               (beat)
                         Budget coordination with the FBI.
                              (beat)
                         You okay, sir?

               Anderson runs his hand through his hair, can't think fast
               enough.  He sees her glance at the black Precog disc case.
               He shuts it, awkwardly, and it auto-locks.

 ANDERSON                          Have Page take this.

               Angela steps back, disturbed.

 ANGELA                          But sir, the procedure

 ANDERSON (SNAPS)                          I make procedure.  Call him.
                              (long beat)
                         I'm not okay, Angela ... you're right.

               My head and stomach.  I'm going down to the clinic.  Or maybe
               just home.

               Angela looks relieved at the explanation.

 ANGELA                          Yes sir.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 33. 

               He moves past her.  His FINGERS fidget against the hidden
               disc in his pocket.

 ANDERSON                          I'll speak to Witwer, put him in
                         charge for the rest of the day.

               He hesitates at the door, turns to look at his office, and
               at his view of Washington.  Then he is gone.

 INT. OUTSIDE WITWER'S OFFICE -- MOMENTS LATER 
               Anderson looks in the door Of Witwer's empty office.  He
               takes a step inside.

               Witwer's booming voice sounds from behind him, startling
               him.

 WITWER                          Breaking and entering.  That'll get
                         you five to ten, hard.

               Witwer immediately scans his old partner's ashen face.

 WITWER (CONT'D)                          What's wrong?

               Anderson can hardly bear to meet his friend's eyes.  He
               REACHES into his pocket, as if to lift the disc into the
               light.  If he could just do that, show it to Witwer.

 WITWER                          Paul?

               Anderson's hand comes out of his pocket, EMPTY.

 ANDERSON                          Take over for me today?

 WITWER                          You sick?

 ANDERSON                          Yeah.

               Witwer makes a show of backing away.

 WITWER                          Don't give it to me.  You probably
                         have that Trans-10 virus going around.
                         A stomach thing.  I hate stomach
                         things.

               Anderson Almost smiles.

 ANDERSON                          Ed.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 34. 

 WITWER                          Yeah?

               Witwer looks at him.  Anderson almost reaches out for him.

 ANDERSON                          Run the place, okay?

 WITWER                               (smiles)
                         Sure.  Right into the ground.
                              (beat)
                         Go on home before I call Infectious
                         Control and have them spray you down
                         with something.

               Anderson moves unsteadily down the hallway.  Witwer calls
               out.

 WITWER (CONT'D)                          You want me to do the discs, or hold
                         them for you to review when you get
                         back?

 ANDERSON                          Can't let them back up.  Do 'em.

 WITWER                          Call you later.  Take it easy, all
                         right?

               Witwer lifts his hand in farewell, Anderson fixes on that
               last image -- Witwer waving goodbye.

 INT. PRECRIME UNDERGROUND GARAGE -- LATER 
               Anderson, sweating now, leans against a thick cement pillar
               and pulls out a cell phone.  He hits a button.

 INTERCUT BETWEEN ANDERSON / LISA AT THE JUDICIAL CENTER 
               Lisa sits in a meeting.  Her phone CHIRPS softly.  She glances
               at the display, then rises to take it.  She goes to a corner
               of the room.

 LISA                          Paul?

 ANDERSON                          Listen to me.

               Lisa presses her phone close to her ear.

 LISA                          I can hardly hear you.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 35. 

 ANDERSON                          I'm underground.  Weakens the signal
                         so it can't be picked up.

               Alarm moves across her face.

 LISA                          But we're on Secure

 ANDERSON                          Listen, dammit!  I'm going to murder
                         Ed.

               The Precogs picked it up.

               On Lisa -- can she have heard right?

 LISA                          Paul.  Paul His crackling voice
                         faintly comes through the phone.

 ANDERSON'S VOICE                          ... home.

               Lisa's phone goes dead.

 BACK TO ANDERSON 
               Anderson looks down a long row of parked Precrime ground
               transports.  They are sleek and menacing, the black shells
               lumpy with dangerous gadgetry.  In the distance, a POLICE
               OFFICER, holding an armful of equipment, opens the back of
               one of them.

               He looks up at Anderson's approach.  He puts his equipment
               down, and salutes.

 POLICE OFFICER                          Hello, sir.

               Anderson nods, moves close.

 ANDERSON                          What's your name, officer?

 POLICE OFFICER                          Bob, uh, Robert Smythe.

 ANDERSON                          These the new Python transports?

               The young officer turns and looks at the transport with pride,
               is about to speak, when Anderson touches a palm-sized Nova
               stun gun to the base of his neck.

 ANDERSON (CONT'D)                               (sincerely)
                         Sorry, Officer Smythe.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 36. 

               The officer buckles.  Anderson catches him, rolls him gently
               into the back of the transport.

               Then Anderson quickly reaches into the transport, and begins
               stuffing equipment into a duffel bag: a helmet and black
               uniform, the weapon-glove, a folded rifle, a holographic
               scanner, and other equipment whose function we can only guess
               at.

               Anderson looks up at a sound, echoey FOOTSTEPS.  They
               approach, then fade away.

               Anderson places the officer's hands and legs together, then
               aims a nozzled cylinder at them.  He shoots a spray of blue
               BindFoam chemical restraint, sticking the man to the floor
               of the transport in an adhesive glob.

               Then he leaves the scene, running.

 INT. ANDERSON'S CHEVY 
               Anderson grips the wheel of his Chevy, driving down 1-95.
               The fact that he can't control his car -- that the steering
               wheel has no function, his speed is predetermined, and his
               direction is guided by satellite -- is maddening now.

               From inside the cars that glide along beside him people turn
               and look curiously at the man who is actually gripping his
               steering wheel.

               Anderson slams it with his fist.  Through his windshield
               Anderson sees a four year old boy in the driver's seat of a
               passing red and black Ford.  His mother sits in the
               passenger's seat, blithely reading.  The boy mimics Anderson,
               gleefully slams his steering wheel too, then laughs.

               Anderson turns and looks the other way, into the distance,
               at the "Sprawl,' the vast unzoned city attached to Washington
               D.C. You can see it in his face: a man could lose himself in
               there.

 EXT. POTOMAC PARK 
               Anderson stands on an embankment.  He holds the Precog disc
               in his hand, ready to throw it into the river.

               He stands like that ... and then slowly lets his hand drop.
               He doesn't do it.

 INT. ANDERSON'S HOME - SUBURBS -- LATER 
               Lisa enters the house, in a rush.  Every shade is drawn.
               Paul Anderson sits in an overstuffed chair, absolutely
               motionless, like a man who has died suddenly.

 ANDERSON                          Don't move.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 37. 

               Lisa doesn't get it.  She continues toward him.

 ANDERSON (CONT'D)                          Stop!  Moving heats you up, makes it
                         easier for them to pick you up on
                         their thermals.

               She looks at him, scared, stops in her tracks.  She is
               suddenly suffocating.

 LISA                          It's a hundred degrees in here.

 ANDERSON                          I turned the furnace all the way up.
                         Your hair dryer.  The oven.  If they
                         come, it'll buy me twenty seconds.
                         Maybe thirty.

 LISA                          Nobody's coming for you.

               Anderson stares at her.

 LISA (CONT'D)                          On the phone -- what you said.  It's
                         impossible.

               She shakes her head in disbelief.  Anderson speaks, choking
               on the words.

 ANDERSON                          I'm going to kill Ed Witwer.

 LISA                          It's not true.

               Anderson's right hand hangs over the side of his armchair.
               We see the bright DISC cupped in the palm.  He seems about
               to reveal it to her, but doesn't, yet.  He keeps staring at
               her intently.  Something is holding him back.

 LISA (CONT'D)                          You're upset.  You've been unhappy.
                         There's a lot of pressure on you.
                         And then Frank ...

 ANDERSON                          One week from today.  Tuesday, June
                         25, at five-twenty in the morning.
                         I shoot him, Lisa.

 LISA                               (beat)
                         You need to take time off.

               Anderson laughs harshly.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 38. 

 ANDERSON                          You don't have to worry about that.

               She steps toward him.

 LISA                               (gently)
                         I want to hold you.

 ANDERSON                          If you love me, stand there.  And
                         don't move.

               Tears well in her eyes.

 ANDERSON (CONT'D)                          I saw the disc, Lisa.  I shoot him.
                         In the chest.  And he dies.  I've
                         watched a thousand murders.  This
                         time I star in one.

 LISA                          Something's wrong.  You wouldn't do
                         it.

 ANDERSON                          The Precogs are never wrong.  They
                         emit a single disc.  "The immutable
                         evidence of the infallible system."

               The room is terribly hot, his words -- she begins to sway
               unsteadily.

               Anderson focuses on her.  Her face.  Her hair ...

 LISA                          We'll figure this out.  We'll review
                         the system.

 ANDERSON                          There is no review.  There's only
                         the disc.  It Shows My guilt.  There's
                         no defense.

               Her long hair.  He stares.

 LISA                          You can't run.  Please, let's --

               A SOUND outside.  They both turn.  A deep silence.  The
               furnace churns out heat.  And Anderson looks at Lisa's hair
               ... and finally understands.

               Slowly, and very carefully, Anderson slides the DISC back
               into his pocket.  He rises from his chair.  For the first
               time he goes to her, reaches out, and touches her hair.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 39. 

 ANDERSON                          Last week.  It was strange.  I watched
                         from the bathroom window.  You went
                         out in the backyard to make a call.

               She looks at him.

 ANDERSON (CONT'D)                          An appointment, you said.  For a
                         haircut that afternoon.

               Lisa's hand jumps to her hair.

 ANDERSON (CONT'D)                          You didn't get your hair cut.  You
                         went to the trouble of calling first
                         thing in the morning.  It was that
                         important ...

               She reaches for him.  He pulls away.

 LISA                          Stop it!  Paul, please.  You're
                         panicking.  Everything's going to
                         look wrong.  You're going to distrust
                         everybody and everything now.

               Lisa implores him.

 LISA (CONT'D)                          You can't distrust me.
                              (beat)
                         It was Ed I called.

               Anderson cocks his head.

 ANDERSON                          Ed.  why outside?  Why lie about it?

 LISA                          Stop being a cop and listen to me!

               A booming, electronically altered VOICE suddenly penetrates
               the walls of the house from outside.

 VOICE (O.S.)                          Director Anderson!  There is no
                         escape!

               Anderson, betrayed, glares at his wife.  She's frantic.

 LISA                          Your birthday's tomorrow!  We wanted
                         to...

               But be's already on the move, running for the upstairs.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 40. 

 VOICE (O.S.)                          Drop to your hands and knees and
                         stay there.  Precrime is entering
                         your house!

               Lisa screams, as her front door is sonically BLASTED off its
               hinges, and a swarm of Precrime officers in mirrored helmets
               hurtle in.

 LISA                          Paul!

	       They move past her and spread through the rooms and up the 
               stairs like a disease in fast motion.

 UPSTAIRS 
               Helmeted officers hold their gloved right bands palm out,
               scanning rooms for thermal presence.

               An OFFICER 1 steps out of a small room.  He speaks, his voice
               electronically altered.

 OFFICER 1                          He's got a hair dryer going.  Screwed
                         up my reading.

               The others nod.

 OFFICER 2                          We're not picking up shit.

               They rush into rooms, with increased urgency.  We follow
               OFFICER 1 as he moves counter to the group and down the
               stairs.

               He hesitates as he moves through the living room, which is
               awash in personnel.  Lisa stands against the wall, pale and
               shaken.  He looks at her for a long beat, then steps over
               the shattered door and out into the sunlight.

 OUTSIDE 
               Everywhere else in the neighborhood it is green and calm.
               But Anderson's house looks like a wasps's nest someone has
               kicked.  Four Precrime hovercrafts are suspended above it,
               engines WHINING.  Black Python transports are all over the
               street out in front, and more keep coming.

               And everywhere on foot, there are Precrime police.  OFFICER
               I approaches a Python ground transport.  Another officer
               guards it, weapon out, his head turning right to left.  He
               settles on OFFICER 1's approach and raises his weapon.

               OFFICER 1 doesn't even break stride.  He walks right up to
               the guard -- and then right through him.  A holograph decoy.
               OFFICER 1 enters the Python.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 41. 

 INSIDE THE PYTHON 
               OFFICER 1 removes his helmet -- it's Anderson.  And then
               comes the moment of truth -- have they cancelled his
               IdentiScan access to Precrime vehicles yet?

               A little scanner arm arches down from the visor, and flashes
               a red beam into his eyes.  Anderson presses his lips together.
               The Python turns on, and a generated voice greets him.

 VOICE                          Paul Anderson 0256 clear.

               Anderson grips the steering wheel.  But his time, since it
               is a law enforcement.  Vehicle, the steering actually works.
               Anderson pulls out.

               FROM ABOVE, as the Python transport slips away from the chaos.

               THEN HIGHER, and we see that the direction the Python is
               headed will take it from the green of the suburbs, through
               the white of Washington, and into the dark of The Sprawl.

 INT. PRECRIME HEADQUARTERS -- DAY 


               Ed Witwer sits alone in an antechamber.  He stares at an
               oversized oak door, then looks down at the floor.

               He runs both hands through his hair.  He is tired, his eyes
               weary, lost.

               A voice comes over the intercom.

 VOICE                          Enter now please, Assistant Director
                         Witwer.

               Witwer pulls himself together, and opens the door.

 INT. A CONFERENCE ROOM 
               Witwer takes a seat at the end of a long table.

               Powerful men sit at the other end of the table.  SWANSON,
               sharp-boned, the FBI Director.  CRONIN, awl-like eyes, the
               CIA Director.  Senator Malcolm.  Chief Justice POLLARD, whose
               face reveals nothing.  Vice-President ALMER, whose tongue
               darts across his dry lips unsettlingly.  Unpleasant looking
               men in an unpleasant mood.

               Cronin looks up from a printout he's been reading and stares
               at Witwer.

 CIA CRONIN                          The central question is: Why does
                         Anderson want to kill Witwer?

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 42. 

               Cronin holds up the printout.

 CIA CRONIN (CONT'D)                          We checked your finances.  His
                         finances.  Nothing irregular, you
                         don't steal from him, he doesn't
                         steal from you.  You haven't done
                         anything that he might have
                         discovered, and vice versa.

               Swanson holds up another sheath of papers.

 FBI SWANSON                          Personnel checks reveal no ambitious
                         coups planned by you to topple him.
                              (beat)
                         He's done nothing to you, or you to
                         him.

               Witwer presses his lips together.

 VICE-PRESIDENT ALMER                          You fucking his wife?

 WITWER                          No.

 FBI SWANSON HIS MOTHER? HIS BROTHER? 
               Witwer gives him a bad look.

 FBI SWANSON (CONT'D)                          Okay.  There we are.

 JUSTICE POLLARD                          So, you are friends, partners, and
                         soul mates.  Anderson has no motive.

 WITWER                          I can't think of one.
                              (beat)
                         Maybe JUSTICE POLLARD The Precogs
                         are mistaken?

               Witwer looks away.  Jesus, he wants out of this room.

 JUSTICE POLLARD                          You don't believe that, do you?

 WITWER                               (barely audible)
                         No.  The Precogs are infallible.

               Senator Malcolm is impatient with all this.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 43. 

 SENATOR MALCOLM                          You're goddam right.  So, gentlemen
                         -screw the motive.  We got a
                         pre-murderer on the run, and a nasty
                         little PR problem.

               The very powerful men level their unpleasant gazes on Witwer.

 VICE-PRESIDENT ALMER                          And here is our solution.  You are
                         now Director Witwer.

               Witwer shakes his head, starts to protest.  Almer silences
               him with a raised finger.

 VICE-PRESIDENT ALMER (CONT'D)                          Precrime must demonstrate its
                         willingness to go after one of its
                         own.  Total impartiality.

 WITWER                          Now look--

               Cronin talks right over him.

 CIA CRONIN                          The public must believe that every
                         future murderer is pursued with equal
                         vigor.

 FBI SWANSON                          Therefore, Precrime will put in charge
                         the man best suited to the job.  And
                         who would pursue a murderer harder
                         ... than his intended victim?

 JUSTICE POLLARD                          You went after Anderson yesterday
                         -because it was right, and because
                         you believe.

               Almer speaks with a tight irony.

 VICE-PRESIDENT ALMER                          And your belief will certainly grow
                         stronger with each tick of the clock.

               Witwer looks at the men with thinly-veiled hatred.  But he
               does not deny their words.

 JUSTICE POLLARD                          Haw long will it take, Director?

               Wiltwer takes a long breath, concentrates his mind on the
               task he can't avoid.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 44. 

 WITWER                          He knows Precrime, of course.  And
                         the streets -- he's rusty, but he'll
                         remember how to work them.  It'll
                         come back to him fast.  He's ... the
                         best.

               Witwer almost smiles.  Justice Pollard's not smiling.

 JUSTICE POLLARD                          We're not here to praise Caesar --
                         we're here to bury him.

               Witwer looks at Pollard, then lifts a finger and touches his
               right eye.

 WITWER                          He can't avoid iris identification.
                         Every door he opens, every ATM he
                         uses, or taxi or transport he boards
                         -- he'll get scanned.
                              (quietly)
                         It won't take long to find him.  

	       The eyes that look back at Witwer are unblinking.

 EXT. THE SPRAWL NIGHT 
               The unzoned city is full of 1950's iconography, but it all
               feels different than it did in the suburbs.  Where the burbs
               were Ike, the city is Joseph McCarthy.

               The fat Ramblers and Studebakers have a little grime on them.
               The women's dresses are tighter and more urgent, the men's
               suits have some shine at the elbows.  You look over your
               shoulder here, move faster, and smile a lot less.

               And some streets you don't go on at all.  Anderson's Python
               moves down one of them.  He stops under a blackened suspension
               bridge, gets out.  He's still in uniform.  He holds a duffel
               bag.

               He starts to walk away from the Python, then hesitates.
               He's left the door open.  He shakes his head at his
               sloppiness.  Goes back and shuts the door.  Walks away again.

 INSIDE THE CAR 
               He's left a small DEVICE on the passenger's seat.  Digital
               numbers shoot by in reverse.  Something CLICKS.

 OUTSIDE THE CAR 
               Anderson continues walking away.  He doesn't look back as
               the Python is engulfed in a miniature sun of heat and flame.
               It's not a gasoline powered vehicle -- so it doesn't explode.
               It just ceases to exist.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 45. 

 EXT. ORANGE DRY CLEANERS - -- NIGHT LATER 
               Through a smeared window Anderson sees racks of suits and
               dresses hanging in clear plastic bags.  He gets to work on
               the door.

 INT. ANDERSON'S HOUSE -- NIGHT 
               Lisa lies in her bed, alone in the dark.  She listens to an
               almost inaudible sound, a high WHINE.

 EXT. ANDERSON'S HOUSE 
               A Precrime HOVERCRAFT floats high above her house, a dark
               moon in the low clouds.

 EXT. ORANGE DRY CLEANERS -- EARLY MORNING 
               A worker stands in the back of the store puzzling over the
               clean clothes piled on the floor.  It almost looks like a
               nest, like someone slept there

 EXT. SUBWAY LATER 
               Anderson, in a blue suit and fedora, carrying his duffel
               bag, stands on a subway platform.  He takes out a cell phone,
               dials a number.  He looks up at the SOUND of a train.

               The approaching MagLev train has a lit sign on its front
               car: "33rd Street Express."

 CUT TO: 
 INT. PRECRIME HEADQUARTERS 
               Search and Command room.  Witwer moves up and down the aisles,
               past technicians who man computers and holographic tracking
               displays.

               A Precrime TECHNICIAN 1 suddenly sits upright.  Witwer picks
               him out of the crowd and zeroes in.

 TECHNICIAN                          It's Anderson.

               Witwer grabs a phone, punches a button

 WITWER                          Paul! 
                The technicians scramble to pinpoint Anderson on a
               Glowing holographic MAP.

 CUT TO: 
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 46. 

 EXT. SUBWAY STATION 
               Anderson, holding his phone, is IdentiScanned along with
               everyone else as he steps onto the train.

 CUT TO: 
 INT. PRECRIME HEADQUARTERS 
               Another TECHNICIAN 2 calls out to Witwer.  Witwer covers his
               phone mouthpiece.

 TECHNICIAN 2                          He's been Scanned.  He's on the 33rd
                         Street Subway!

               TECHNICIAN 1 Calls from the other side of the room

 TECHNICIAN                          His cell phone tracks for The Sprawl.
                         We got him on the Subway, too!

 CUT TO: 
 INT. SUBWAY CAR 
               Anderson sits on a seat in the rear of the car.

 ANDERSON                          Why am I going to kill you,Ed?

 INTERCUT:ANDERSON ON THE SUBWAY /WITWER AT PRECRIME 
 WITWER                          There's no motive

 ANDERSON                          My wife calling you before breakfast?

 WITWER                          We were planning a surprise party.
                         It was going to be today.
                              (beat, ironic)
                         Happy birthday, partner.

 ANDERSON                          This party's no fun, Ed. It's a hell
                         of a surprise, though.
                              (beat)
                         I'm having trouble trusting people,
                         Ed, I gotta tell you.

               At Precrime, they upload a MAP DISPLAY of the Express train's
               route.  We see a blue light moving -- the train.  And two
               separate red dots along its route.

               An OFFICER points at the dots, and speaks to Witwer in a low
               voice.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 47. 

 OFFICER                          The train makes two stops, here and
                         here: 20th, then 33rd Street.

               Witwer covers the Mouthpiece

 WITWER                               (to the officer)
                         Split the units, go to both

 OFFICER                          We'll never make 20th 

		Witwer waves him away -- do your job.  Now.

 ANDERSON                          You there, Ed?

 WITWER                          I'm here.  You gotta come in, Paul .

 ANDERSON                          I'm a Cop, Ed. I need a motive.

 WITWER                          Come in.  We'll figure this thing
                         out together.

 INT. THE SUBWAY TRAIN 
               Anderson looks out the window into the tunnel dark.  He talks
               to Witwer.

 INTERCUT: ANDERSON/WITWER 
 WITWER                          It'll get ugly if you keep running.
                         And your eyes, Paul -- every move
                         you make a Scanner will pinpoint you
                         for us.

 ANDERSON                          I saw a news flash.  You're the new
                         Director.  Is that the point of this?

 WITWER                          Fuck you.

               Anderson smiles.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 48. 

 ANDERSON                          Didn't think so.  But it has to be
                         something, Ed.

               Witwer looks at the DISPLAY MAP.  We see the blue train
               nearing its first stop, 20th street.  We see two waves of
               lighted green dots -- Precrime units heading for 20th and
               33rd.

 WITWER                          Paul.  Come in.

               Anderson sees an overhead light come on in the train: "Next
               Stop 20th Street.

 ANDERSON                          If I come in, it puts me close to
                         you.  If I get close ... I may kill
                         you.  I can't risk that.
                              (beat)
                         Anyway, they'd force you to lock me
                         up.  And that'd be it -- I'd never
                         get my chance to solve this thing.

               Witwer needs to keep him talking

 WITWER                          You're kinds liking this, in a way,
                         aren't you?  The action ...

 ANDERSON                          And you get to be a real cop again.
                         We get to flex our muscles.

               Anderson's train is just finishing off-loading passengers.
               The doors close and the train begins to pull out as the first
               helmeted Precrime officers flood the platform.

               One of them points.

 CLOSE ON: A TRAIN WINDOW 
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 49. 

               Anderson is visible through the window, talking on his cell
               phone.

 CUT TO: 
 INT.PRECRIME HEADQUARTERS 
               Witwer stares at the map.  The train has stopped at 20th
               street.  But Anderson's still talking.  He isn't getting off
               -- he's going on to 33rd Street, the last stop.

               Technician 2 presses his earphone close, listens, then calls
               over to Witwer.  Witwer covers his mouthpiece.

 TECHNICIAN 2                          We have visual verification -- he's
                         still on the train.

               Witwer gives him a thumb's up.  We STAY ON Witwer as he
               listens to Anderson, and watches his train move toward 33rd
               on the MAP.

 ANDERSON'S VOICE                          I want to tell you something, partner.
                         You listening?

               Witwer nods.  Now the MAP shows all the Precrime units
               swarming toward the 33rd Street subway station.

 WITWER                          Yeah.

 ANDERSON'S VOICE                          I gotta do this.  I have to figure
                         this thing out.
                              (beat)
                         But listen to me now.  If it was you
                         running, I'd come after you, Ed.

               Witwer stares at the MAP, at all the units he's sent after
               his friend.

 ANDERSON'S VOICE (CONT'D)                          You're a cop.  And I'm a future
                         murderer.

                         Do your job, Ed. Come after me hard.
                         Because, Jesus Christ, I wouldn't
                         sleep or eat until I had tracked you
                         down and put a gun to your head.

 CUT TO: 
 INT. PRECRIME HEADQUARTERS 
               Witwer watches on the MAP at all the little symbols merging
               together, like a gameboard -- but this game ends in a reallife
               confrontation between one man and an army of them.

 WITWER                          You wouldn't shoot a cop would you,
                         Paul?

	       He looks urgently to the phone technician

 TECHNICIAN 1                          He's still on the line.

               Witwer presses his ear to the phone.  He can hear the subway
               make its STOP.  Then he hears a chorus of mechanized VOICES
               -the voices of the Precrime police, the SCREAMS of panicked
               passengers

 VOICES ON ANDERSON'S PHONE                          Police.  Everyone down on your hands

               Anderson begins to shimmer, then dematerialize ghost-like,
               into nothingness.  He was a holographic decoy.

               What is actually there on the train seat is Anderson's cell
               phone.  Rigged to its mouthpiece is a tiny digital voice
               recorder.

 DISSOLVE TO: 
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 51. 

 EXT. STREET - THE SPRAWL -- NIGHT 


               Every city has its underbelly.  If you lifted the fat dark
               underbelly of The Sprawl this is where you'd end up.

               The streets here feel like alleys, clotted and tight.  There
               are streetlights, bright ones -- but the light dies at its
               source, never makes it through the sour air down to the
               ground.

               The retro fifties look comes apart here.  The people that
               you see -- and you only catch quick glimpses of them, they
               move like rats -- wear black mostly, tight fitting
               tech-fibers.

               ANDERSON'S caught one of the rats, a thin bald guy in black.
               Anderson has him pinned up against a wall.  They're having
               some kind of exchange -- which consists of the guy answering
               none of Anderson's questions, and Anderson pressing him harder
               against the wall.

               Finally, the guy does something odd.  He lifts a finger and
               pulls down Anderson's right lower eyelid.  Anderson lets
               him.  Then the guy does the same on the left.  Has a long
               look.  And then nods.  Anderson releases him, and they go
               off together.

 EXT. AN APARTMENT BUILDING -- LATER 
               An oppressive brick thing on a side street.  The facade is
               crumbling.  Nothing good happens in a building like this..

               The guy leads Anderson to the building, then scurries off
               into the night.

 INT. ROOM -- LATER 
               A stained overstuffed chair in the corner, a dreary little
               kitchen with crusted dishes in the sink.

               But jarringly, in the center of all this, is a make-shift
               hypertech medical setup: a gleaming operating table, an array
               of lasers, scalpels and surgical equipment, an anesthesia
               console.

               Anderson sits in a chair facing DOC.  DOC is a big man with
               delicate fingers.  He sneezes, then blows his nose hard into
               a handkerchief.

 DOC                          Got a cold.

               Anderson looks at him uneasily.  It's not just DOC -- it's
               the whole setup, the needles and scalpels, the medical thing,
               which Anderson truly does not care for.  Doc sneezes again,
               then looks up at his patient.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 52. 

 DOC (CONT'D)                          Don't worry.  I could cut open your
                         chest, sew a dead cat in there, and
                         you'd never get an infection.  Not
                         with the spectrum antibios I'll be
                         shooting into you.

 ANDERSON                          I'm not here for cat surgery, Doc.

               Doc chuckles.  Then he waits, expectantly.

               Anderson hands him a tiny opalescent card.  A preset cash
               card.  DOC slides it into small console, watches the numbers
               flash up.  He frowns, sighs.

 ANDERSON (CONT'D)                          It's all I could safely move

               He waits.  Doc's not thrilled, but finally, he nods.

 DOC                          Yeah.  All right.

               Time to got down to business.  Doc walks over to a large
               medical cabinet and opens the door.  It's full of EYES, and
               parts of eyes -- 611 !  A cryo-jars.

               Anderson tightens.

 DOC (CONT'D)                          You understand what I told you then.
                         I can't just give you new irises.
                         The Scanners will read the scar
                         tissue.  Alarms will go off.

 ANDERSOIN                          I'm a cop, I know

 DOC                          I gotta take your eyes out.

               Anderson knows this, too, wishes Doc would shut up ANDERSON
               Yeah.

 DOC (CONT'D)                          And put in new ones.

 ANDERSON                          Yeah.  I get it, DOC.

               Anderson rises up out of his chair and goes over to the
               operating table.  He lies down.

 ANDERSON (CONT'D)                          Do me quick before I run out of here.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 53. 

               Anderson lies there, blinking up at the ceiling.  He listens
               to Doc preparing instrument trays.  It's a bad sound.

 EXT. THE SPRAWL -- DAY 
               The suspension bridge where we saw Anderson vaporize the
               Python transport.  Witwer stands watching as a Precrime
               techno-unit sifts through the white ashes.

               Witwer lifts his face to the acrid breeze coursing off the
               Potomac.  It's a pose a track dog might hold, nose up, testing
               the air for a scent.

 INT. BOARDING HOUSE ROOM - THE SPRAWL -- DAY 
               We can't see anything at first, because Anderson can't see
               anything either.  He's in a deep post-surgical haze.  DOC'S
               voice comes to him.  It's warped and ugly.

 DOC'S VOICE                          Don't take the bandages off for twenty
                         four hours.  You'll go blind if you
                         do.

               Anderson makes an affirmative grunt. Now we see his
               surroundings, even though Anderson still can't.  He lies in
               a grungy bed, his head and eyes swathed in white dressings.
               Doc stands over him.

 DOC                          You're in a room.  I had you moved
                         here, a couple miles from my place.
                         If they find you, they don't find
                         me.

               Anderson grunts weakly.

 DOC (CONT'D)                          A guy will come in, feed you once.
                              (beat)
                         I juiced up the nano-reconstruction
                         around your new eyes, 'cause I know
                         you're in a hurry.

 ANDERSON                               (Fuzzily))
                         Nano-re ...construction.

 DOC                          Organic microrobots that reconstruct
                         nerves and blood vessels.  It'll
                         feel like fleas chewing on your
                         eyeballs.  Don't scratch.

               Anderson is already reaching his hands for his bandages.
               Doc forces them away.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 54. 

 DOC (CONT'D)                          I'm giving you a bonus, might come
                         in handy.  Feel this.

               Doc takes an air-syringe out of his pocket and touches it to
               Anderson's hand.

 DOC (CONT'D)                          It's a temporary paralytic enzyme.
                         Someone spots you, you duck into an
                         alley, shoot this under your chin.

               Doc presses the tip into the soft underpart of Anderson's
               chin.  Anderson jumps.

 DOC (CONT'D)                          The enzyme turns your facial muscles
                         to mush.  You won't look like the
                         same man.

 ANDERSON                          Jesus.

 DOC                          You tighten up again in about thirty
                         minutes.  Hurts like nothing you
                         ever felt.  It's vicious, but
                         effective.  I'll put it in your bag.

               Finally, Doc takes a small clock out of his pocket and places
               it on a dresser beside Anderson's bed.

 DOC (CONT'D)                          I'm setting up a timer.  When it
                         buzzes tomorrow, take off your
                         bandages, and get the hell out of
                         here.

               Anderson, groggy, starts to say something else, but then he
               hears a door open and close, and Doc is gone.

 EXT. THE SPRAWL -- NIGHT 
               The Precrime presence mounts on the streets.  A couple of
               units move past the boarding house, but they don't stop.

 INT. BOARDING HOUSE ROOM -- DAY 
               Anderson sits in a chair, his dressings like a blindfold.
               He looks like a hostage.  He is sweating.  Keeps reaching
               for his dressings to scratch, then forces himself not to.

               He speaks to someone we don't yet see.  The guy DOC said
               would come.

 ANDERSON                          I'm hungry, but sick to my stomach.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 55. 

 ANDERSON (CONT'D)                          Guess I should eat.  
				(Beat) 
			 You gonna help feed me?

               Now the camera moves and we see who it is that has been sent
               to help Anderson.  It's the rat guy, the thin bald man
               Anderson had roughed up the day before.  The guy has a bowl
               of hot soup in his hands.  He stares contemptuously at
               Anderson.

 ANDERSON (CONT'D)                          So how do we do this, pal?

               The rat guy doesn't say a word.  He simply tips the hot soup
               and it splatters down into Anderson's lap.  Anderson cries
               out in pain and surprise.  The guy walks out of the room.

 CLOSE ON- THE TIMER 
               Twenty hours gone by.  Four more to go.

 EXT. THE SPRAWL 
               Precrime cops are shaking down any of the rats they can catch,
               looking for leads, looking for anything.

 INT. THE BOARDING ROOM 
               The TIMER shows one hour to go.  Anderson sits in a chair,
               squirming miserably.  His dressings are wet with sweat, and
               frayed and dirty at the edges where he has tugged and plucked
               at them.

 ANDERSON                               (to himself)
                         Fuck.

               He is this close to ripping the dressings off

 EXT. THE BOARDING HOUSE -- DAY 
               A Precrime transport stops.  Two officers get out.  One of
               them sets up a large thermal scanner on the sidewalk, and
               does a read on the boarding house.  The other does a read on
               a pawn shop and bar next door..

               The OFFICER 1 doing Anderson's boarding house, calls to the
               other officer.

 OFFICER 1                          Got 27 warm bodies in this place.
                         What should it take, three or four
                         Spiders?

 OFFICER 2                          Do four.  Speed things up, so we can
                         go eat.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 56. 

               The Officer 1 opens the back of the transport, and takes out
               a box.  He removes four round BALLS.  They are silver, as
               big as billiard balls.

               He goes up to the boarding house, gets IdentiScanned, and
               the front door opens.  He rolls the balls down a dark hallway.

               Then he goes back out to the transport, and leans against
               it, bored.  He holds up an electronic clipboard and waits
               for the data to come in.

 INT. THE BUILDING 
               The BALLS roll about eight feet, then suddenly come to
               autolife as they spin.  They open like flowers -- flowers
               with legs.

 CLOSE ON : A BALL 
               A fist-sized Spider takes shape.  On its head is an IdentiScan
               lens mounted on a thin metallic antenna.

 INT. A ROOM 
               An OLD WOMAN sits at a card table eating a bowl of something
               unidentifiable.  She looks up with annoyance as she sees a
               spider scuttling across the floor toward her.  It makes a
               CLICKING sound on the floor as it comes.  She's poor, living
               in The Sprawl -- she knows the drill.  She continues to eat
               as the SPIDER crawls up the leg of the card table.  She barely
               watches as it moves past her bowl and toward her hand.

 OLD WOMAN                          It's nice to have a little company

               She smiles toothlessly at her joke The Spider hops onto her
               am and inches up, then moves across her shoulder.  It grips
               her cheek lightly, as the IdentiScan antenna reads her eyes.

               Then it leaps off her and onto the floor and CLICKS away
               across the linoleum.

 EXT. THE BOARDING HOUSE 
               The Precrime officer lifts his clipboard and checks a column
               with his laser pen, and waits for the next one.

 INT. ANDERSON'S ROOM 
               Anderson sits in his chair.  He cocks his head, listening.
               His body tenses.  Something feels wrong.

               The TIMER shows ten minutes to go.  Blindfolded for a day
               and a night, Anderson has no idea how much time he has left.
               Three seconds, four hours?

               A flattened SPIDER squeezes under his door.  Anderson tenses
               as it CLICKS across the floor toward him.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 57. 

               He knows that sound.

               Anderson stumbles up and out of his chair.  He starts to
               grab at his dressings, remembers Doc's warning, and stops
               himself.  The SPIDER waits for him to settle, then CLICKS
               toward him again.

               Anderson moves around the room, avoiding the Spider.  He is
               dripping with sweat, starting to breathe hard.  The Spider
               comes faster.  Anderson crashes into a table, brings it down.
               Falls across the bed.

 EXT. THE BOARDING HOUSE 
               The Officer 1 squints at his clipboard.  One of the Spiders
               is taking too long.  He adjusts his thermal scanner, and
               sees the heat outline of a man bouncing around a room.

               The other Officer 2 finishes reading the pawn shop and the
               barroom, then wanders over to Officer 1. They both watch the
               screen.

 OFFICER 1                          Stinking drunk.

 OFFICER 2                               (beat)
                         Or a guy who doesn't want to get
                         read.

 INT. ANDERSON'S ROOM 
               Anderson forces himself to sit still, because he knows the
               consequences.  The Spider advances, starts up his leg.

               The TIMER has not buzzed.  Anderson can't touch his dressings.
               The Spider moves across his shoulder and onto his face.  It
               WHIRS and HUMS trying to adjust its antenna against the
               dressings.

 EXT. THE BOARDING HOUSE 
               The officers eye the thermal scanner, as they reach for their
               mirrored helmets, getting ready to go in.

 INT. ANDERSON'S ROOM 
               The Spider crawls all over Anderson's head, trying to get
               past the dressings for a read.

               Anderson has no choice.  None.  He starts to lift at his
               dressing.  The Spider senses his cooperation, freezes in
               place.

               Anderson wants to scream.  He unwraps his head, tugs the eye
               pads away from his eyes.  He rips them off.  The Spider sits
               on his shoulder, waiting.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 58. 

               Anderson's eyes are tightly closed.  He opens them

 ANDERSON'S POV - BLINDING LIGHT 
               Light brighter than a magnesium burn, brighter than a nuclear
               flashpoint.  Light to buckle the knees and push the brain
               beyond endurance.

               And though all this the faraway sound of a BUZZER going off.
               The TIMER has finally sounded.  Anderson's open eyes are
               streaming with tears, but he has survived the moment.

 ANDERSON'S POV - THE ROOM 
               It comes into slow focus The Spider, all business, reads his
               eyes.  Then, as if nothing unusual has occurred, it jumps
               off his shoulder, and crosses the floor.  It flattens, scoots
               under the door, and is gone.

 EXT. THE BOARDING HOUSE 
               The officers see that the Spider has gotten its read.  They
               pull off their helmets.

 OFFICER 1                          Let's eat.

               They start putting their equipment back into the transport.

 INT. ANDERSON'S ROOM 
               Anderson stares at himself in a dusty mirror.  His new eyes
               are tender and bloodshot.  And they are not blue, like the
               ones he was born with, but a deep brown.  Anderson is exactly
               the same, and utterly different.

               He grabs his duffel bag, and gets the hell out of there.

 INT. PRECRIME HEADQUARTER'S -- DAY 
               Lisa, looking drawn and scared, sits in Witwer's office.
               Witwer isn't looking too well, either.

 WITWER                          They told me to move into Paul's
                         office.  I said fuck you very much.

               Lisa nods.

 WITWER (CONT'D)                               (softly)
                         I don't want to do any of this, Lisa.

 LISA                          I know.  I know that.
 (MORE) 
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 59. 

 LISA (CONT'D)                               (beat)
                         Everybody's got their reasons for
                         wanting you in charge.  So do I --
                         you won't bring him in dead.

 WITWER                          Yeah.  But if he shoots a cop ...
                              (beat)
                         Which is what he does four days from
                         now, isn't it?

               Witwer's eyes imp involuntarily to a CLOCK on his desk.

 LISA                          He'd never hurt you.

 WITWER                          I know that.  But the other thing I
                         know is -- the Precogs are never
                         wrong.

               The words are leading them no place good.  They stop talking,
               and just sit there.

 INT. THE SPRAWL 
               Anderson stands on a street corner waiting in line with
               several people waiting for the N0.6 Turbo Tram.

               The double decker Tram comes.  People get off, then the line
               starts to move forward as people get on.

               Anderson fidgets.  He's last in line.  Each person gets
               IdentiScanned as he boards.  Anderson's putting his new eyes
               to the test.  If the scan goes wrong, he's positioned himself
               to run.

               The woman ahead of him, gets scanned, pays her fare.
               Anderson's turn.  Anderson goes up the steps, and a red beam
               reads his eyes.

               The Tram DRIVER glances at a monitor beside his steering
               wheel, then nods at him.

 DRIVER                          Welcome aboard, Mr. Symington.  Plenty
                         of seats in the back.

               Anderson nods, moves casually to the back.  But his jaw
               muscles are flexing hard, working off the tension.

 INT. A WEALTHY HOME - SUBBURIAN WASHINGTON -- NIGHT 
               Senator Malcolm releases a self satisfied little belch as he
               finishes off a late night whiskey in his panelled den.  He
               wanders about admiring himself in the many political photos
               adorning the cherry wood walls.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 60. 

               He's feeling cozy and safe, the way rich people can afford
               to.  No IdentiScan Spiders would ever be sent under his doors.
               No intrusions of any sort, nothing that a coiffed secretary
               or a loyal wife wouldn't announce before hand.

               Which is why he doesn't immediately understand the small
               SOUND at ear level, coming from just behind him.  It's a
               metallic CLICK-CLICK.  He turns amiably.  His eyes instantly
               widen, and his knees buckle when he sees he's looking into
               the barrel of ANDERSON'S cocked gun.

 ANDERSON                          Time to upgrade your alarm system,
                         Senator.

               Senator Malcolm tries to regain his composure.  His fear
               embarrasses him.

 ANDERSON (CONT'D)                          Your work-up of Witwer.  The Security
                         Panel would've done one.
                              (beat)
                         Why do I kill Witwer?

               The Senator finds his voice.

 SENATOR MALCOLM                          There's no motive.

 ANDERSON                          There's, always a motive.

               Anderson presses the gun to the Senator's forehead.  He slides
               the barrel tip back and forth across the Senator's sweaty
               skin.  It makes a greasy red mark.

 ANDERSON (CONT'D)                          I could've come to anyone on the
                         panel.  But I picked you.
                              (beat)
                         Of all the shits on that panel, I
                         like you least of all.  So if this
                         gun goes off, I'll feel bad, but
                         not, you know, devastated.

               You can almost see a thought dawning on Senator Malcolm.

               And then, shockingly he spits in Anderson's face, and turns
               and walks to the other side of the den.  His tone is mocking.

 SENATOR MALCOLM                          What the fuck was I worried about?
                         You can't kill me.  The Precogs
                         would've seen it.

               Anderson realizes this, too, lowers his gun.  The Senator is
               even laughing now.  For a moment Anderson does nothing, then
               he moves toward the Senator again.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 61. 

               The Senator stands his ground smugly.

 SENATOR MALCOLM (CONT'D)                          Witwer's clean.  You're clean.
                         There's nothing.  No motive.  Kind
                         of like something Kafka would've
                         cooked up.
                              (beat)
                         You like that, cockroach?  You're
                         fucked and you'll never know why.

               The Senator is laughing hard now.  Anderson lets him.

 ANDERSON                          Tell you something about the Precogs,
                         Senator.  They're great on murder.
                         But it's the little things they fail
                         to see.

               Anderson hits the Senator so hard it bounces him across the
               floor and into the cherry wood panelling.  Several of his
               beloved photos crash down onto him.

 ANDERSON (CONT'D)                          Little things like that, for instance.

               Anderson steps over him, and walks out of the room

 INT. PRECRIME HEADQUARTERS -- DAY 
               Search and Command room.  Witwer stands there amidst all of
               the technology speaking to a group of Precrime officers.

 WITWER                          He hasn't shown up on one goddamn
                         IdentiScan in three days.

               No one says anything, and then LIEUTENANT GLASER, 30, speaks
               up.

 LIEUTENANT GLASER                          He's found a room -- he's going to
                         sit it out.

 WITWER                          Yeah, except for holding a gun to
                         senator Malcolm's goddman head in
                         his own goddman house last night,
                         Anderson's sitting it out!
                              (beat)
                         Why hasn't he been scanned?

               The officers look at their shoes.

 WITWER (CONT'D)                          Why is he invisible?  He's moving
                         around but he isn't being seen.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 62. 

               Lieutenant Glaser tries again.

 LIEUTENANT GLASER                          Hes beating the scanners

 WITWER                          No one beats the scanners.

               Witwer reaches up, wearily, rubbing his face and eyes with
               his hands.  The fingers dragging across his eyes stop.  Then
               his hands drop away, and he looks at his men.

 WITWER (CONT'D)                          He's done his eyes

 LIEUTENANT GLASER                          But the scarring always

 WITWER                          He went the whole way.  The crazy
                         bastard had his eyes removed.  New
                         ones sewn in.

 LIEUTENANT GLASER                          That takes weeks to heal.

 WITWER                          If you're prepared to go blind, a
                         street surgeon'll juice up the repair
                         cycle.  They don't give a fuck about
                         risk.

               Witwer's eyes flick to a digital CLOCK on the wall.  It's
               something he can't help doing now.

 WITWER (CONT'D)                          He's going to do what it takes to
                         stay free -- if it blinds him, maims
                         him, or kills him.

               Witwers admiring smile makes his men very uncomfortable .

 INT. KITCHEN - THE SUBURBS -- DAY 
               A mother places a carton of milk on a table in front of her
               teenage son.  He pours it into his cereal bowl, then puts
               the carton down in front of him.

               There's a flexible Vid-Screen on the side of the carton,
               about the size of a playing card.  AS the sleepy kid watches,
               the disposable Vid-Screen sparkles to life.

               Nothing unusual, they always do that.  For advertisements,
               lost kids, or in this case crime bulletins.

               A good one.  The kid straightens up.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 63. 

 THE VID-SCREEN 
               A fully rotating mug shot of PAUL ANDERSON fills the screen,
               followed by vital statistics and details of the precrime
               he's been charged with.

               The kid watches for a while, then gets bored, and pulls the
               Dexi-Pops cereal box over and starts reading the back of
               that.

 INT. A LIVING ROOM - THE SPRAWL -- DAY 
               A big man in a tee shirt lies on a couch, a bowl of popcorn
               perched on his belly.  He stares at a TV monitor that's the
               size of a twin bed.

 TV 
               Anderson's face fills the monitor.  The TV image is so big
               that Anderson overwhelms the room with his video presence.
               It's like God coming to pay a visit -- even if you want to
               avoid Him you can't.

               The big man with the popcorn tries to do just that.  He surfs
               through a zillion channels, but Anderson's visage is
               omnipresent.

 EXT. THE SKY - THE SPRAWL -- DAY 
               Anderson's face fills the skies, too.  Witwer and Precrime
               have pulled out all the stops.

               Advertising dirigibles float by with Anderson's image on it.
               Holographic billboards with Anderson hover in the air.  There
               are so many Andersons in the sky he seems to be part of the
               weather, a special type of cloud.

               People on the streets look up, briefly interested, then go
               about their business.

 EXT. A STREET - THE SPRAWL 
               One person who is paying deep attention to all this is
               Anderson himself.  He stands on a street corner, wearing
               dark glasses and a fedora, staring at a public video kiosk.

 VIDEO KIOSK 
               The mug shot of Anderson disappears and is replaced by a
               Precrime SPOKESWOMAN.

 SPOKESWOMAN                          The United States Supreme Court has
                         issued a special injunction allowing
                         the unprecedented public viewing of
                         former Precrime Director Paul
                         Anderson's future murder of Edward
                         Witwer, the current Director.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 64. 

 ANDERSON                          His mouth slowly opens.  He steps
                         back against a wall and slides his
                         hand into his pants pocket.  He looks
                         at the Precog DISC in his cupped
                         hand, then quickly puts it away.

               He stares at the kiosk as people on the street begin to gather
               around excitedly.

               CROWDS OF PEOPLE look into the sky, in store windows, at
               other video kiosks.  They have the enthralled anticipation
               of a mob at a public guillotining.

 SPOKESWOMAN                          She continues her declamation

 SPOKESWOMAN (CONT'D)                          The video you are about to see,
                         generated by the Precognitive mutants,
                         is the immutable evidence of the
                         infallible system.
                              (reassuring smile)
                         Citizens are urged to call
                         1-800-PRECRIME with any information
                         that may lead us to the whereabouts
                         of Paul Anderson, future murderer.

 ANDERSON                          Shakes his head in confusion and
                         disbelief.  But he has the Precog
                         disc ...

               The OLD GUY him nudges him

 OLD GUY                          This oughtta be good, huh?

 VIDEO KIOSK 
               And there it is, Anderson and Witwer standing there pointing
               guns at each other.  The whole thing just as we saw it before.
               All the way through to the fatal moment.

 ANDERSON                          Oh, Ed ...

               Anderson shoots him.  Witwer slumps, dying.  The video stops.
               And then begins to play all over again, right from the start,
               the 1-800-PRECRIME number scrolling along the bottom of it.
               "Call now!  Call now!  Call now!

 ANDERSON (CONT'D)                          Moves quickly through the crowds.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 65. 

 INT. BAR - THE SPRAWL -- NIGHT 
               Ennis Page sits on a bar stool at the far end of a bar so
               full of cigarette smoke it doesn't seem capable of supporting
               life.  But it supports the kind of life Page is interested
               in.

               An emaciated woman with a feral smile slides onto a stool
               beside Page.  He gives one shake of his head, and she slides
               away again.  His eyes cut to a group of females.  He waits
               for the next approach.

 CLOSE ON: PAGE 
               as a HAND reaches over his shoulder and places a Precog disc
               on the bar in front of him.  Page makes a sound and tries to
               jump away, as if the disc is something lethal.  Which it is,
               in a way.

               Anderson presses him back down on his stool.  Sits next to
               him.  Page stares at him, scared.  Anderson looks straight
               ahead as he speaks.

 ANDERSON                          "Ennis Page engages the services of
                         prostitutes because his relationships
                         with them compound his feelings of
                         selfloathing."
                              (beat)
                         Direct quote from your psychological
                         profile -- the kind of shit I had to
                         know as your former boss.

 ANDERSON (CONT'D)                          "Page is an obsessive-compulsive
                         Type Nine." Another quote.  Niners
                         are great for the kind of work you
                         do -- keeping all those Precog discs
                         in order.

               You can almost see Page's heart slamming in his chest.  He
               tries to hide it with tough talk.

 PAGE                          I fuck whores and I'm orderly, so
                         what?

 ANDERSON                          Something's out of order, Ennis.
                         Deeply out of order.

               Page looks unhappily at the disc on the bar PAGE You got a
               disc Anderson picks it up, holds it tight in his fist

 ANDERSON (CONT'D)                          Not A disc.  The disc.  When I went
                         home sick, I stole it.
 (MORE) 
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 66. 

 ANDERSON (CONT'D)                          I took it with me, Ennis.  I wasn't
                         sick, I was running with the evidence.
                              (lets that sink in)
                         So how is it that Precrime has one,
                         too?

 PAGE                               (utterly baffled)
                         You can't make copies 

	       Anderson waits.  Lets Page work through it.

 PAGE (CONT'D)                          It's the basis of the system.  The
                         immutable evidence.  Copies are
                         impossible.
                              (beat)
                         You went home.  A little later, I
                         came in with a disc for Mr. Witwer
                         to review.  I wasn't halfway out the
                         door when he cried out.

               Anderson is barely breathing, he's listening so hard.

 PAGE (CONT'D)                          He was in shock.  He showed me.  It
                         was you shooting him.  Then all hell
                         broke loose.  He had to send the
                         Precrime units to your house.

 ANDERSON                          Ennis -- you gave out the same disc
                         twice.  Less than an hour apart.
                         The one I stole.  And then another
                         one.  Of the same event.

 PAGE                          It's impossible.  The Precogs can
                         only move forward to new events.
                         Into the future.  They never repeat.

               Anderson looks around.  Patrons are beginning to look over
               in his direction, eyes lingering.  He rises.

               Page seems in a daze.  As an obsessive-compulsive niner, the
               concept of an untidy system is disorienting.

               Anderson starts to say something to the man, then doesn't.

               On the way out Anderson gets IdentiScanned.  An automatic
               DIGITAL VOICE calls out after him.

 DIGITAL VOICE                          Have a nice night, Mr. Symington

	       Anderson leaves the dark of the bar for the deeper dark of The Sprawl.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 67. 

 INT. A STREET - THE SPRAWL -- DAY 
               A YOUNG GUY with a sparse moustache walks up to a payphone.
               He picks up, the receiver and immediately gets IdentiScanned.
               A light goes on, he's about to dial.

               Anderson appears out of nowhere, shoulders him out of the
               way.  The young guy drops the receiver and stumbles back
               onto the sidewalk.  Anderson grabs the hanging receiver.

 YOUNG GUY                          Hey!  Hey, you can't... 

	       He reaches for Anderson, then thinks better of it.  Anderson 
	       is twice his size and very menacing in dark glasses.

 YOUNG GUY (CONT'D)                          I'm gettin' a cop.

               The guy scurries off.  Anderson dials quickly.

 INTERCUT ANDERSON/LISAS OFFICE 
               Lisa, walking down a hallway in the Judicial Center, stops
               to answer her BEEPING cell phone.  She leans against a wall,
               as lawyers and judges pass by.

 ANDERSON                          It's me.

 LISA                          Paul.

               Lisa grips the phone and turns to the wall

 ANDERSON                          Your phone will be bugged.  So we
                         can't meet, we can't do anything.
                         Just listen.  Nowing you're listening
                         is enough.

               Lisa nods, as if he's right there.  He is right there, for
               her.  This is all she's got.

 ANDERSON (CONT'D)                          When Precrime stormed the house, I
                         thought you'd called them.  Betrayed
                         me.

 LISA                          No.

 ANDERSON                          I know.  Witwer sent them.  He saw
                         the disc and had to do his job.
                              (beat)
                         Tell me you forgive me.  Please.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 68. 

 LISA                          Of course, I forgive you.

               There's no time left.  He has to get off the line and start
               moving again.  A vast weariness enters his voice.

 ANDERSON                          All these people I need to forgive
                         me.
                              (beat)
                         Do you think Frank forgave me?  All
                         I could do for him was send him
                         gardenias.
                              (long beat)
                         I love you.

               Lisa almost cries out when he hangs up.  She flattens herself
               against a wall.  She stays like that for a long moment,
               pulling the sound of her husband's voice, his words, deep
               inside of herself.

               And then she gets a look, as one of those words registers
               profoundly.

 LISA                               (whispers to herself)
                         Frank hated gardenias.

 EXT. EAST END CEMETERY - ARLINGTON -- LATER 
               A public cemetery along the Potomac.  There's not much land
               left for new graves.  A funeral is taking place.  A lot of
               mourners in dark 1950's suits and dresses.  The service is
               nearing its end.

               Frank D'Ignazio's newly dug grave is nearby.  Lisa stands
               there, looking at the temporary marker, and the flowers and
               wreaths piled up against it.

               Two rows over, they are lowering the casket into the ground.

               High in the sky, a PRECRIME HOVERCRAFT, everpresent in Lisa's
               life, floats in the low clouds with a barely audible WHINE.

               Lisa rests a floral arrangement against the pile of flowers.
               Her hand drifts near a white GARDENIA WREATH.  There is a
               small envelope tucked beneath a blossom.  She takes it.

               Then she rises and begins to walk back to her car.

               The funeral is over, and the mass of mourners, many wearing
               dark glasses, fan out toward a long line of cars.

               One of the MOURNERS brushes past Lisa.  She looks up and he
               tips his dark glasses down onto his nose and stares over
               them at her.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 69. 

               It's Anderson.  Isn't it?  She looks into his eyes.  And
               it's jarring, the blue eyes gone, that they're brown now.
               But it's him, he's there, and she wants to reach out for
               him.  Knows she can't.

               He's already moving on.  He's risked everything for a look.
               He slips into the black sea of mourners, she goes to her car
               -neither of them ever breaking stride.

               The Precrime craft hovers, unaware

 INT. LISA'S CAR 
               Lisa opens the envelope as her car drives her down the
               Alexandria-Washington ConnectWay.

               A Precog DISC falls into her hand.  Her mouth opens -- she's
               never held one before.

               And there is a NOTE with it It READS:

               "The Precogs generated duplicate discs.  This is the first.
               Precrime has the second.  Duplicates.  Why?"

 EXT. A CONVENIENCE STORE - THE SPRAWL -- DAY 
               Anderson has to eat bad food quickly, and on the run.  He
               gathers up a wrapped sandwich, a bag of donuts, something to
               drink.

               He waits in line.  He doesn't like to be in a line, waiting.
               The woman ahead of him argues about change.  He presses his
               lips together.

               And then he glances at the mirrored surface of a hidden camera
               DOME attached to the ceiling.  It gives him a fish eye
               reflected VIEW of what's happening behind him.

               Precrime police are happening behind him.  He doesn't stop
               to ponder, as two Python transports zoom up outside the store.

               Anderson vaults the counter, knocking the customer and the
               clerk to the floor.

 INT. BACK ROOM 
               Anderson plows over a guy filling a trash can.  He hears the
               mechanically altered COMMANDS of a Precrime officer calling
               from the store.

 VOICE                          Paul Anderson.  Drop to your hands
                         and knees!

               Anderson crashes out into an alley, and clambers up a fence.
               SONIC BLASTS shatter the air around him.  Chunks of brick
               fly off the walls on both sides.  But he is full of
               adrenaline, and there is no stopping him.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 70. 

 INT. A TURBOTRAM - THE SPRAWL -- LATER 
               A different part of the city.  Anderson hunkers low in the
               back seat of a tram.

               He looks up, as the DRIVER swears

 DRIVER                          What the hell --

               Anderson stands up, looks down the aisle, through the
               windshield.  Precrime transports are heading straight at the
               tram, going the wrong way on a one way avenue.

               They've even taken radio control of the P.A. system on the
               tram.

 VOICE                          Paul Anderson.  Drop to your hands
                         and knees!

               Anderson can't believe it -- how are they suddenly pinpointing
               him?  The passengers turn in unison like cattle, and stare
               at him, terrified.

               Anderson grabs his duffel bag and kicks at the back exit
               doors, smashing them open, and tumbles out onto the street.

               He rolls, and is up on his feet in a second, reaching into
               his bag for a glove.  He pulls the weapon onto his right
               hand, as he whirls around sizing up his predicament.

               Precrime transports have begun to seal off both ends of the
               street.  He looks up.  He is surrounded by skyscrapers and
               buildings -- he is walled in, at the bottom of an urban
               canyon.

               People freeze against the sides of buildings, run into
               doorways where they can.  Passengers in trans and taxis or
               cars stay there, pressed against their windows watching.

               Nothing moves, except the Python transports, closing in.
               The lead officer speaks, with that menacing electronically
               altered VOICE.

 VOICE (CONT'D)                          Lower your weapon, or we will
                         neutralize your threat potential.

               The Precrime police are out of the transports now, advancing
               at either end of the city street in phalanxes of men.

               Anderson eyes the side of the black granite office building
               closest to him.

 ANDERSON'S POV - A HIGH PRESSURE HYDRANT 
               The large red hydrant sits a few inches out from the building.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 71. 

               Anderson almost smiles as he begins to walk slowly toward
               it, his weapon pointing harmlessly at the pavement.

 VOICE (CONT'D)                          Do not move!

               Anderson is up on the sidewalk now, two feet out from the
               building, right beside the high pressure hydrant.

               He stops, looks up, looks down, looks at the police advancing.
               It is a moment for prayer.  Anderson doesn't have a moment.

               He spreads his feet and fires a massive SONIC BLAST down at
               the sidewalk.  The effect on the underground water main is
               immediate.

               A GEYSER of water two feet in diameter erupts straight up
               from the sidewalk, lifting the tumbling Anderson fifteen
               feet into the air right alongside the building.

               The stunned police officers try to take aim, but Anderson's
               bouncing at the top of the geyser.  And they can't fire,
               anyway, because officers workers stare at the excitement
               from every window in the building.

               All this in a time span of seconds.  The world spins crazily
               for ANDERSON, but he manages to grip hold of a metal support
               beam holding the building's sign, one story up.

               The police try to see what he's doing, but the torrent of
               water from the water main break obscures his moves.

               He pulls himself onto a ledge, steadies himself, slides along
               it toward a second story window.  The office building gawkers
               lurch backward from the window as Anderson blasts it to
               sparkling dust and leaps inside.

 INT. OFFICE BUILDING 
               The building covers almost an entire city block.  Anderson,
               dripping wet, runs from one end of it to another, blasting
               through doors, shoving terrified workers out of the way.

               He is like a wide receiver running the length of the field,
               jumping obstacles, slamming through, over, and around whatever
               he must to get to his goal.

               And then he reaches his goal -- the windows overlooking the
               avenue next block over and parallel to the one where Precrime
               ambushed him.

               He spots a double-decker TurboTram moving slowly in the stream
               of traffic.  It pulls to the curb below to pick up passengers.

               Anderson blasts out the window and leaps onto the roof of
               the bus.  It is a bone-jarring landing.  He loses
               consciousness for a second, rolls the length of the roof,
               and slides off it onto the pavement.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 72. 

               He lies there, trying to rouse himself.  Traffic brakes to a
               stop automatically as car and truck sensors read his form in
               the road.  No one wants to touch him.  A single car horn
               SOUNDS, and then a chorus of them.

               Anderson rouses, struggles to his feet, and takes off in a
               limping run.

 INT. SUBWAY STATION LATER 
               Anderson, out of breath and in pain, leans against a post at
               the far end of the passenger platform.  There are tracks on
               either side of him, one marked "Uptown" and the other
               "Downtown. "

               He feels a blast of air and looks to his right and sees that
               the Downtown train is coming in.  And on his left, too, the
               Uptown train rounds the bend and comes into view.

               Which MagLev train will lead him to safety?  Which one won't
               they pinpoint?  He runs up to a teenage KID who has his arm
               around his girlfriend.  They step back, startled.  He's got
               a flat top hair cut, she wears a pleated skirt and saddle
               shoes.

               The trains pull in.

 ANDERSON                          Pick one for me!

 KID                          What?

 THEY TRY TO WALK AWAY 
 ANDERSON                          Point to the train I should take.
                         Please.

 KID                          I don't know.

               The girl lifts a nervous finger and points.  The Uptown.  He
               runs to board it, as they run in the opposite direction to
               the Downtown.

 INT. SUBWAY CAR 
               He sits at the back of the half empty train watching the
               dark rush by.  A train chosen arbitrarily -- it's impossible
               they could find him.

               A station Stop.  He starts to get off, is actually on the
               platform, then steps back onto the train.

               The rushing dark again.  When the MagLev eases to a halt at
               the next station he gets off this time.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 73. 

 INT. STATION 
               He walks toward the exit stairs with a handful of people.
               He eases back and lets them go up first.

 THE STAIRS 
               Precrime officers crouch around the bend, silently snatching
               people out of the way as they come into view.  They wait
               -but Anderson does not come.  And he does not come.

               On signal, the Precrime officers rush down the stairs.

 DOORWAY ABOVE THE STAIRS 
               ANDERSON hangs high above the doorway near the ceiling,
               adhered by one arm there by a blue glob of adhesive BindFoam.

 ANDERSON'S POV - THE OFFICERS 
               as they run below him down the stairs.  They go out of sight,
               he can hear them rushing along the platform searching for
               him.

               The strain of hanging by one arm is killing him.  He reaches
               up.  With a laser knife, and cuts away at his coat sleeve,
               releasing himself from the glob.  He drops to the stairs,
               and instantly slips up them.

               He surprises a helmeted OFFICER, just around the bend.  He
               slams HIM against the wall, yanks off his helmet, and holds
               the laser knife against his throat.

               The OFFICER 1s clearly terrified.  He speaks hoarsely through
               Anderson's choking grip.

 OFFICER                          Don't kill me!  Jesus.  Please.

               Anderson looks at the panicked officer.  Anderson closes his
               eyes trying to put it together.  He opens them.

 ANDERSON                          But the Precogs would've predicted
                         me killing you.  You'd know whether
                         I do or not.

               The officer looks at him with eyes begging for mercy.
               Anderson suddenly gets it.  He tightens his grip on the man.

 ANDERSON (CONT'D)                          They shut down the system.  Haven't
                         they?  They've shut down the Precogs.

               The officer nods.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 74. 

 OFFICER                          They're off homicides.  They're
                         redirecting them to help us locate
                         you.

               Which is how they knew where he'd be every time.

               Anderson chops quickly at the base of the man's skull,
               knocking him out.  And then he runs, because what else can
               he do?

 INT. JUDICIAL CENTER -- DAY 
               Lisa stands in a long hallway outside a door, labeled:
               COURTROOM 17.  She holds a briefcase in one hand.  Down the
               hall, other courtrooms are in use, but not this one.  She
               enters the dark and vacant Courtroom 17.

 INT. COURTROOM 17 
               Lisa sits at the judge's bench in the empty courtroom.  The
               lights are dim.

               She takes a small, battery-powered tv out of her briefcase.
               She turns it on.

 TV 
               The murder of Witwer by Anderson is being shown over and
               over in a continuous loop.  Flashing at the bottom is the
               hotline number: "1-800-PRECRIME." Then- "Call Now!  Call
               Now!

 BACK TO SCENE 
               Now Lisa takes out the Precog disc Anderson gave to her -the
               first disc.

               She places it in the specialized monitor on the judge's bench.

               The tv and the judge's monitor sit side by side.  The tv
               plays the version of the murder from the second disc; the
               judge's monitor plays the version from the first disc.

               She stares intently, her eyes flicking back and forth from
               one version to the other.  They seem absolutely identical.
               When the judge's monitor goes blank, she starts it over again.

               Lisa stares, watching her husband murder his best friend,
               endlessly.

 EXT. A GAS STATION - ALEXANDRIA -- DAY 
               A gas station right out of the fifties.  An attendant in a
               uniform and cap whistles while he wipes down the windshield
               of a sky blue Rambler.

               In the background, Anderson walks toward a men's room.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 75. 

 INT. THE MEN'S ROOM 
               Anderson looks at himself in the mirror.  He reaches out and
               touches one reflected eye, which is a deep brown.  It is
               still startling to him, the color of his eyes.

               Then he reaches into his duffel bag and takes out the air
               syringe Doc gave to him.  He looks at it nervously.  It is
               filled with 5 cc's of an opaque green liquid.

               He touches the tip of it to the soft center under his chin.
               He closes his eyes.  Then he screws up his courage, and hits
               the plunger.  The liquid is pneumatically delivered with a
               searing HISS.

               Anderson screams out in agony, slams back against the wall
               of the bathroom.  His hands reach up for his face -- which
               looks like it's boiling from within.

 ANDERSON'S FACE 
               The skin on both cheeks begins to pucker.  The muscle tone
               around his chin goes soft, and begins to sag like an old
               man's.  That is the effect -- like he is aging fifty years.
               His forehead wrinkles, the skin under his eyes droop.  Healthy
               pink is replaced by bloodless gray.

 AND MOTHER OF GOD DOES IT HURT 
 EXT. THE MEN'S ROOM 
               The ATTENDANT knocks nervously on the door

 ATTENDANT                          You all right in there?

               When the door opens, an unhealthy looking old guy with a
               fedora hat pulled low comes slowly out of the bathroom.
               Anderson nods, and walks past the attendant, who watches
               after him uncertainly as he wanders off.

 INT. PRECRIME HEADQUARTERS - ALEXANDRIA -- LATER 
               The perky tour guide we met earlier takes another group around
               the headquarters.  There may be a massive campaign to find
               Anderson, but the Precrime public relations machine continues
               to run without interruption.

               There are ten people in the group, and the physically
               transformed Anderson is among them.  They all wear glowing
               nametags.  Anderson's reads, "Mr. Symington." He keeps his
               hands in his pockets, and his head low.

               We have heard the tour guide's spiel before

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 76. 

 TOUR GUIDE                          Welcome to the main headquarters of
                         Precrime.  Smaller Precrime branches
                         are scattered throughout the United
                         States.

               She is about to go on when she looks over at Anderson.  He
               is fidgeting uncomfortably.

 TOUR GUIDE (CONT'D)                          Are you ... all right, Mr. Symington?

               Anderson moves up close to her, a little too close.  He
               whispers to her, embarrassed.  She gives him a professional
               smile, and points in the distance past the elevators.

               Anderson nods, and heads off.  She calls after him.

 TOUR GUIDE (CONT'D)                          We'll wait right here for you, sir!

 INT. A STAIRWELL 
	       Anderson runs down a back stairwell to a lower floor.

 INT. A BASEMENT CORRIDOR 
               Anderson stands outside a door marked: "Housekeeping." Above
               the doorway is an IdentiScan device.

               Anderson reaches into his coat and carefully removes a small
               cryo-jar.

 CLOSE ON: THE CRYO-JAR 
               Imbedded in the clear gelatinous coolant are two eyeballs
               -the irises a luminous blue.

 INT. SEARCH AND COMMAND -- MOMENTS LATER 
               The operations room in Precrime.  The technicians sit at
               their computers and holographic tracking displays.

               Witwer paces among them.  His eyes keep flicking to the
               digital clock on the wall.  Then they cut back to the men
               and machines that are telling him nothing.  Witwer does not
               look well at all, When a TECHNICIAN leans close to his
               computer monitor,Witwer almost leaps across the room to get
               to him.  He looks over the man's shoulder.

 WITWER                          What is it?

 TECHNICIAN                          Must be a glitch ...

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 77. 

 WITWER                          What?

 TECHNICIAN                          Anderson just got IdentiScanned.

               Witwer grips the back of the technician's chair.  The
               technician types the data through again.

 TECHNICIAN (CONT'D)                          It's him -- he's been scanned.

 WITWER                          Where is he?

               The technician looks up at Witwer.

 TECHNICIAN                          But he's had his eyes done.  Right?
                         Sir?  Tries to think it through.

 WITWER                               (barely audible)
                         He had to have.

               The technician's computer flashes the next piece of
               information.  When he speaks, it's the last thing Witwer
               wants to hear.

 TECHNICIAN                          Jesus Christ, sir.  He's in the
                         basement of this building.

               All eyes turn to Witwer.  The unspoken question hangs in the
               air.  Anderson's come to murder Witwer?

 INT. PRECRIME HEADQUARTERS 
               Throughout the building, every available Precrime Officer
               begins to receive orders to mobilize toward the basement.

 INT. THE PRECOG CHAMBER 
               Four officers stand guard in the chamber.  They listen to
               the orders coming in on their earpieces.  Three of the guards
               rush out of the room, one stays behind.

               The three Precogs sit in their oversized chairs, the female
               in the middle, the males on either side of her.  Their eyes
               are open ... and they are deeply alert.

               Two technicians tend to the Precogs.  At the back of the
               chamber, through a large window, we see Ennis Page sitting
               at the huge mainframe.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 78. 

 INT. SEARCH AND COMMAND 
               A ring of Precrime officers three men deep stand guard around
               Witwer.  Witwer looks like he wants to kill them all.

 WITWER                          This is ridiculous.

               Lieutenant Glaser replies forcefully

 LIEUTENANT GLASER                          Standing orders from the Security
                         Panel, sir.

 WITWER                          If he wants to get to me, he'll get
                         to me.

 LIEUTENANT GLASER                          No, he won't, sir.

               Witwer looks at the confident young officer almost pityingly.
               Then his eyes flick to the wall clock.

 INT. THE BASEMENT 
               Armed Precrime officers clog the corridors, conducting
               defensive searches of one room after another.  All they are
               coming up with so far are some very startled housekeepers.

 INT. THE PRECOG CHAMBER 
               In the chamber are one guard, two technicians, and three
               Precogs.  And all of them are left in sudden darkness, as
               the power is cut.

 INT. SEARCH AND COMMAND 
               The officers around Witwer reach for their maglite
               flashlights.  The Search and Command room suddenly looks
               exceedingly vulnerable.

               A technician calls out from the darkness

 TECHNICIAN                          Don't worry, air -emergency generators
                         will kick on in five seconds.

               The green glow from a roomful of wristwatches makes the room
               seem alive with fireflies.  Five seconds go by.  Then ten
               more.

 WITWER                          Explanation, please!

 TECHNICIAN                          Uh, sir.  It seems ... he got the
                         generators, too.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 79. 

               There is a long moment of silence.  And then Witwer begins
               to laugh.

 INT. THE PRECOG CHAMBER 
               The room is utterly dark and silent.  The silence is broken
               by the SOUND of something rolling across the floor.  Somebody
               speaks, probably the guard.

 VOICE                          Shit.

               An explosion of light fills the room in STROBE-LIKE blasts.
               And leaping through the light is ANDERSON.  The temporarily
               blinded guard and technicians have dropped to their knees.
               Anderson stun guns them quickly.

               The strobes fade, and Anderson sets a zirc-flare on the floor.
               We see that the enzyme is wearing off -- his facial features
               are returning to normal.

               He is oblivious to the Precogs in their chairs.  It is the
               equipment he is after.

               Through the observation window we see ENNIS PAGE watching in
               horror as Anderson severs the light cables connecting the
               Precog helmets to the mainframe.

               Anderson aims a sonic blast at the observation window, blowing
               it out and knocking Page unconscious.  Then he reaches into
               the room and destroys the mainframe itself with a series of
               blasts.

               Anderson is so intent on destruction he does not sense a
               PRESENCE behind him.  Perhaps it is because the movement is
               so completely devoid of malice it is beyond detection.

               A HAND, the fingers pale and slender, reaches out and takes
               hold of his hand.

               Anderson whirls around, weapon out.  And there before him,
               is the FEMALE Precog.  He looks at her, then beyond her to
               the other Precogs who are lolling in semiconsciousness in
               their chairs.

               Her helmet is off.  She is young, but her close-cropped hair
               is silver white.  And when she speaks, her voice is like the
               wind whispering through time.

 FEMALE                          Save us, Anderson.

               Anderson can feel the seconds ticking away, his carefully
               planned operation interrupted in an unfathomable way.

 ANDERSON                          I have to get out of here.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 80. 

               She grips his hand.

 FEMALE                          Save us.

               It is beyond pitiful, this frail little woman, pleading.
               And her eyes, she won't let him go.  She is beginning to
               weaken, to sway on her feet.

               A sudden realization floods over Anderson.

 ANDERSON                          You let me get here, didn't you?
                         You stopped giving them information,
                         so they couldn't track me.

               The Precog female is fading fast.  She tries to reach out
               for him and her legs give way.

 FEMALE                          Save -- 
  	       And what can Anderson do but catch her before she falls?  
	       What can he do but throw her over his shoulder, and in the 
	       fading light of the flare, make a run for freedom.

 INT. TUDICIAL CENTER 
               Lisa has been staring at the judge's monitor and the tv screen
               for over an hour.  The two versions of Anderson murdering
               Witwer play over and over.

 LISA                               (wearily, to herself)
                         Help me, Paul.

               She hits freeze-frame on the judge's monitor, at a moment
               during his confrontation with Witwer when Anderson's FACE
               fills the screen.

               Lisa looks with deep urgency into her husband's eyes.

               And it is his EYES, finally, that tell her everything.  Lisa's
               hand rises to her open mouth.

 LISA (CONT'D)                          They're blue.

               She keeps the image on freeze-frame, and turns and looks at
               the tv, which shows Precrime's disc over and over, the 1-800
               number scrolling along the bottom.

               When the same close-up of Anderson flashes onto the tv screen,
               she leans close to it and squints.

               Anderson stares right back at her.  And for the first time,
               Lisa sees that the tapes are not exactly identical.  His
               eyes...

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 81. 

 LISA (CONT'D)                          And now they're brown.

               For the first time in days she allows herself a small smile.

 INT. PRECOG CHAMBER 
               Power has been restored to Precrime Headquarters.  Witwer
               walks slowly through the ruins of the Chamber.  EMT teams
               work on Ennis Page and the other dazed personnel Anderson
               has left in his wake.

               Technicians cluster around the two remaining Precogs, the
               brothers.  Their eyes are closed and they are limp.  Their
               lips move soundlessly as if in conversation with each other.

               Lieutenant Glaser is with him, but when Witwer speaks it is
               almost to himself.

 WITWER                          Why didn't the Precogs know he was
                         coming to do this?

               The Lieutenant has no reply.  Witwer runs both hands through
               his hair.  It has begun to wear him down, the ticking of the
               clock ...

 WITWER (CONT'D)                          The next time he shows up it'll be
                         to kill me.

 LIEUTENANT GLASER                          We won't let that happen, sir.

               Witwer takes in the chaotic scene around him, then gives the
               Lieutenant a withering look.

 WITWER                          You won't, huh?

               When the Lieutenant tries to speak to him, Witwer walks away
               and goes over to the technicians working on the Precogs.  He
               stares at the Precogs.

 WITWER (CONT'D)                               (to a technician)
                         When can we get these things
                         operational?

 TECHNICIAN                          They're a hive mind, sir.  It takes
                         three for their predictive abilities
                         to be fully operational.

               Which Witwer does not want to hear.  Witwer leans very close
               to the technician.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 82. 

 WITWER                          These two are all I have to find the
                         man who is about to murder me.  Hook
                         them up, and flood them with whatever
                         kind of fucking chemicals you have
                         to.  They are a machine, and I need
                         that machine at my disposal.

               The Precogs's lips stop for a microsecond, and then begin
               their silent movements again.

 INT. ENNIS PAGE'S HOUSE - ALEXANDRIA -- NIGHT 
               Ennis Page is a man unglued.  He sits on a tidy little sofa,
               in a tidy 1950's style living room.  But his movements have
               become untidy.  He puts a very tiny pill on his tongue.

               When he drinks from a glass of water, it dribbles down his
               chin onto his shirt.  Not like Ennis, at all.

               When his doorbell RINGS, he slowly looks up, then looks down
               at the floor again.  He doesn't answer it.  It RINGS some
               more.

               And then Lisa is standing there before him

 LISA                          Your IdentiScan is off, Ennis.  I
                         could just walk in here.

 PAGE                          I forgot.  To turn it on.

               She sits down beside him.

 LISA                          You don't look surprised to see me.

               She glances at the bubble pack of pills on the table beside
               him, three gone.

 LISA (CONT'D)                          I need your help.

               Unexpectedly, tears well up in Ennis's eyes.

 PAGE                          He took one of my babies.

 LISA                          He's desperate, Ennis.  He had to.
                              (beat)
                         We have to help him.

               Lisa holds the Precog disc in front of his eyes.  He closes
               them against the sight, as if it were an evil talisman.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 83. 

 LISA (CONT'D)                          It's a fake Ennis.

               Ennis's eyes open again.

 LISA (CONT'D)                          This is the first disc.  You delivered
                         it to Director Anderson.  He reviewed
                         it.  And then he stole it, and went
                         on the run.

               Ennis tries to think through his fear and haze.  His words
               slur.

 PAGE                          I delivered ... a fake .. to him?

 LISA                          But he thought it was real, and ran
                         with it.

               The pills, his tidy world coming apart -- Ennis is losing
               it.

 LISA (CONT'D)                          An hour later, you delivered a second
                         disc of the same event.  Witwer
                         reviewed it.  It was real.  (Beat)
                         How do I know this?

               Ennis just wants her to go away.  He wants it all to go away.
               Tears stream down his face.

 LISA (CONT'D)                          Director Anderson had his eyes
                         changed.  They were blue.  Now he
                         has brown ones.

               Ennis is sliding away.  Lisa takes hold of him.  Makes him
               listen, dammit.  She points to the disc in her hand.

 LISA (CONT'D)                          This disc, the fake one, shows a
                         blueeyed Anderson murdering Witwer
                         two days from now.  He doesn't have
                         blue eyes anymore.  The person who
                         faked this disc had no idea he would
                         change his eyes.

               Lisa shakes him.

 LISA (CONT'D)                          Listen!  But the second disc has to
                         be real, because he has brown eyes
                         when he murders Witwer.
 (MORE) 
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 84. 

 LISA (CONT'D)                               (beat)
                         Somebody tried to frame him with a
                         fake.  And somehow it all became real.
                         Why, Ennis?  How could this happen?

               Ennis gives her a look that's on the other side of
               comprehension.

 LISA (CONT'D)                          You handle the discs.  How did a
                         fake one get delivered?

               Ennis's eyes roll back into his head.

               PAGE Coffee ...

 LISA (CONT'D)                          You want-- ?

 PAGE                          He spilled coffee everywhere ...
                         Everywhere ...

 LISA                          What coffee?  What are you -- ?

               But Ennis sags unconscious.  She shakes him hard, even slaps
               him, but Ennis is out.  She lets him drop down on the sofa.

               From outside the house, somewhere high in the clouds, comes
               the WHINE of a hovercraft.

               Lisa looks once more at Ennis, then gets out of there

 INT. ROOM - THE SPRAWL -- NIGHT 
               A small, dreary room, invisible with insignificance.  Which
               is just the kind of room you want if you've stolen a Precog.

               The female Precog lies on a cot.  Anderson sits on a metal
               folding chair watching her.

               Her eyes slowly open and look at him

 FEMALE                          My brothers aren't here.

 ANDERSON                          You didn't even look around.  You
                         knew.

 FEMALE                               (beat)
                         We can sense each other.  You must
                         save

	       Anderson cuts her off with a curt shake of his head

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 85. 

 ANDERSON                          Stop.  I saved You.  It was the best
                         I could do.

               She turns away and looks at the yellowing paper on the wall.
               There is a fading pink cabbage rose.  She traces the outline
               of it with her thin finger.

               She turns back to him.

 FEMALE                          Thank you, Anderson.

               It is deeply eerie for him, chatting with a Precog.

 ANDERSON                          What am I going to do with you?

               Her eyes grow very serious.

 FEMALE                          Name me, Anderson.

 ANDERSON                          What?

 FEMALE                          Give me a name.  I've never had one.

               Anderson rises, moves around the small room.  He is shamed,
               embarrassed.

 ANDERSON                          Listen.

               She turns to the wall.

 ANDERSON (CONT'D)                          Listen to me.
                              (beat)
                         Listen to me ... Rose.

               It is heartrendingly touching, the smile she gives him when
               she faces him again.

 FEMALE                          Rose.

 ANDERSON                          Rose.  They shifted your precognition
                         so you would locate me.

 ROSE                               (beat)
                         Yes.  And it hurt us, physically.
                         Did you know that?  The helmets, the
                         controls.  It hurts.

 ANDERSON                               (guiltily)
                         I didn't know.

               For a long moment he can't say anything.  But there are things
               he needs to understand ...

 ANDERSON (CONT'D)                          When they shifted you to find me,
                         you didn't reveal everything.  That
                         I was going to break into Precrime.

 ROSE                          We saw our chance.  You would need
                         to shut us down, you would have to
                         come.  We wanted you to come.

 ANDERSON                          You used me -- to save you.

 ROSE                          I have been used all my life,
                         Anderson.

               Anderson can't meet her eyes.

 ROSE (CONT'D)                          No one cared that we were human.
                         From a human mother.  Taken at birth.
                         Hooked to machines.
                              (beat)
                         We have been alive, Anderson.
                         Enslaved, for the greater good.

               Her words are unbearable, for both of them.  She traces the
               outline of the wallpaper rose again.

 ROSE (CONT'D)                          But now I have a name.  And I know
                         the man who has named - me will not
                         allow me to be enslaved again.

               Anderson looks at her, then goes to the window, carefully
               watches the street below.

 ANDERSON                          Rose.  What's going to happen to us?
                         Can you see that?

 ROSE                          I'm weak.  And away from my brothers.
                         I see glimpses and hints of things
                         nearby.  But it's all ... scattered.
                              (beat)
                         I'm tired of the future, Anderson.

               She lies on the bed, watching as Anderson comes back to her.
               He sits carefully on the side of her bed.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 87. 

               Then be reaches out, and gently touches her cheek

 ANDERSON                          You didn't know I was going to do
                         that, did you?

               She is almost too overwhelmed to speak

 ROSE                          No.  Oh, Anderson.  It was lovely.

               And now it is Anderson who is overwhelmed

 INT. ENNIS PAGE'S HOUSE DAWN 
               If he were not already dead, it would've killed Ennis Page
               to see the state of his living room.  Precrime officers
               everywhere.  Blood on the rug.  A gun beside the sofa.

               Witwer stands in the corner of the room witching the Coroner
               crab walk Page's body.  It WHIRS and CLICKS as it probes and
               takes samples from various sites.

               The holographic doctor waits patiently as the Coroner crab
               makes its determinations.

               Lieutenant Glaser talks quietly to Witwer

 LIEUTENANT GLASER                          Who else could it've been?

               The crab probes the ragged hole in Page's head

 LIEUTENANT GLASER (CONT'D)                          He grabbed a Precog so he could commit
                         an undetected murder.

 WITWER                               (beat)
                         Page worshipped the system.  He fell
                         apart.  Shot himself.

               The Lieutenant rolls his eyes.

 LIEUTENANT GLASER                          Anderson.

               Witwer doesn't say anything.  He just stares at the body The
               crab finishes.  The holographic doctor unfolds his arms and
               turns his head to Witwer.  He is only a computer interface,
               but even so, it seems as if there is surprise in his
               digitalized voice.

 HOLOGRAPHIC DOCTOR                          Director Witwer.  This event is a
                         positive homicide.

                         A mortal wound was generated by a

                         left occipital portion of the anterior
                         skull, on June 16th, 2040, at 1:24
                         am, Eastern Standard Time.  A Phase
                         Two Investigation is in order.

               No one says anything as the holographic doctor dematerializes
               and the Coroner crab walks across the floor and puts itself
               back in its box.

               At last, someone moves.  It is Witwer.  He lifts his arm,
               pulls back his shirtsleeve, and stares long and hard at his
               watch.

 INT. WITWER'S OFFICE -- DAY LATER 
               Lisa sits biting her lip as Witwer watches two monitors play
               the two versions of Anderson's murder of Witwer.  Lisa points.

 LISA                          There.

               She reaches down and freezes on a close-up of Anderson on
               the two monitors.

 CLOSE ON - THE MONITORS 
               On the left monitor Anderson has blue eyes, on the right he
               has brown.

 LISA                          The one on the left, the first disc
                         -it's a fake.  He doesn't have blue
                         eyes anymore.

               Witwer stares for a long time.

 WITWER                          A fake.

 (BEAT)                          But the Precogs predict the infallible
                         truth.  They don't emit fake discs.

               And now Lisa smiles.  She has set her lawyerly mind to the
               solution.  It is her moment

 . 
 LISA                          Exactly.  You can't tamper with the
                         Precogs, induce them to make fakes

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 89. 

 LISA (CONT'D)                               (beat)
                         But that doesn't mean someone couldn't
                         have made a fake disc on their own
                         and inserted it into the delivery
                         system.

               The simplicity of it is inconceivable.  Witwer speaks
               carefully, trying to process it

 WITWER                          Bypass the Precogs and slip a fake
                         disc in with that day's real ones...

 LISA                               (excited)
                         We're all programmed to believe
                         anything we see on a Precog disc.
                         The system has never been wrong ...

               Witwer stares at the proof before him.  -- the different
               colored eyes of Anderson.  He ejects both discs and holds
               them in his hands.

 LISA (CONT'D)                          You have to call off the hunt.  He
                         was set up.

               Witwer looks at the two discs he is holding

 WITWER                               (long beat)
                         It's gone too far, Lisa She shakes
                         her head, shocked at his response

 LISA                          He was set up!  You both were.  If
                         Paul kills you, you're both out of
                         the picture.

 WITWER                          Who wants us out?  Of what picture?

 LISA                          Jesus, Ed. Stop this thing!  And
                         then we can investigate Witwer's
                         mouth opens and closes.  He tries
                         again.

 WITWER                          Ennis Page was murdered last night.

               The blood drains from Lisa's face

 WITWER (CONT'D)                          Everything points to Paul.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 90. 

 LISA                          He's not a murderer.

 WITWER                          I think he is.  A murderer ... and a
                         future murderer.
                              (beat)
                         Lisa.  What does it matter that the
                         first disc is a fake ... if the second
                         one's real?

               Witwer's hands close tight on the discs.  Lisa stands there,
               motionless.  Then she turns, and leaves his office, abruptly.
               He watches her go.

 INT. ROOM - THE SPRAWL -- DAY 
               Rose sits in a chair near the window.  She is chewing lightly
               on a cracker.  Her face shows wonder -- at the cracker's
               texture and taste.  She holds it up and admires its shape.

               Anderson's mood is less wondrous

 ANDERSON                          Rose.  Listen to me.  I'm going to
                         leave you here.  I have to keep
                         moving.

 ROSE'S SMILE ABRUPTLY VANISHES 
 ROSE                          No.  You must save my brothers.

 ANDERSON                          It's impossible.  There's no time.
                         I've done what I can do!

               Rose waits for him to finish.  She looks out the window at
               the street scene.

 ROSE                          Come here, Anderson.

	       He does, reluctantly.

 ROSE (CONT'D)                          Do you see that boy in the blue hat
                         walking with his mother?
                              (beat)
                         In sixty seconds he will walk beneath
                         those workers installing a window on
                         the tenth floor of that building.

 ANDERSON'S POV - THE BOY AND THE WORKERS 
               Two men struggle to lift a large window in place.  Way below
               the little boy in the blue hat walks on along the sidewalk
               holding his mother's hand.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 91. 

 ROSE (CONT'D)                          They'll drop the window, killing
                         him.  It is impossible to save him.

               Anderson turns to her, shocked And then he runs for the door,
               hurls it open, and disappears down the hall.

               Rose listens to his FOOTSTEPS crashing down the stairs

 EXT. THE STREET. 
               Even as Anderson rushes out of the boarding house, the WORKERS
               have lost their grip on the window.

               The little BOY in the blue hat and his MOTHER walk unwittingly
               toward disaster.  They do not appear to hear the MEN'S cries.

               The WINDOW falls end over end above the boy's head.  The
               sunlight sparks off of the glass, so that from a distance it
               looks like a star falling from the sky.

               A WOMAN across the street sees what is happening, and cries
               out.

               But what Anderson does is run.  He runs faster and harder
               than humanly possible.  He does not care if he is recognized
               or hit by a passing taxi.  He is going to get to that boy.
               He has to get to that boy ...

               ANDERSON rams the BOY from behind just as the corner of the
               window frame kisses the boy's blue hat.  He knocks the boy
               to safety as glass and metal SMASH into the sidewalk.

               The mother does not even have time to scream.  She is on the
               ground, stunned, But Anderson has saved the boy.

               He rolls away, and gets to his feet.  Before anyone can put
               together what has happened, Anderson has ducked into an alley,
               and is gone.

 INT. THE ROOM - LATER 
               Anderson enters the room again, out of breath, some small
               cuts on his face and hands.  He stands across the room staring
               at Rose.

               Rose considers him.  When she speaks her voice is near and
               distant at the same time.  For Anderson, it is as if the
               words are coming from a place inside his own head.

 ROSE                          It was impossible to save that boy
                         -- but you did, Anderson.  It's in
                         you.  It's what you are.

               Anderson sits on the floor and leans back wearily against a
               wall.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 92. 

 ANDERSON                          You knew it wasn't impossible.  That
                         I'd get there.

               Rose reveals nothing.

 ROSE                          You are a man who saves others.
                              (beat)
                         Save my brothers.

               Anderson almost laughs.  Her persistence is unbelievable

 ANDERSON                          I'm in a lot of trouble right now.

 ROSE                          My brothers are in more trouble.
                         They've moved them to ... an awful
                         place.

 ANDERSON                          Rose.  Ed Witwer -he's in the most
                         trouble of all.  Who saves him?

               Rose suddenly grimaces in pain, and grips the side of her
               head.  She curls into a fetal position.

               Anderson goes to her, touches her thin shoulder.  Her eyes
               roll into the back of her head.

               Whose pain is she feeling?  Her own?  Someone else's?
               Anderson doesn't want to think about it.

 INT. PRECOG ENGINEERING LAB -CHEVY CHASE, MD -- NIGHT 
               Because Anderson has destroyed the Precog Chamber, the two
               Precog brothers have been brought here.

               The room is makeshift, uncomfortable ... a place for
               experiments.  The brothers are strapped into chairs.  They
               are helmeted.

               But unlike before, large bore needles have been placed in
               their jugular veins.  Connected to the needles are long twists
               of IV tubing.  There are several IVs running at high drip
               rates.

               Witwer has his back to all this.  He stands with Dr. Resfield,
               watching a technician working the keyboard on a huge
               mainframe.

               Dr. Resfield, a man not given to squeamishness looks back at
               the Precogs, uneasy.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 93. 

 DR. RESFIELD                          We're not really set up for this
                         type of 

               He stops talking when he looks into Witwer's hollow eyes. Witwer 
               is somewhere beyond the influence and reach of words.

 INT. BOARDING HOUSE ROOM -- MORNING 
               Anderson tries to get Rose to drink some water.  Her skin is
               translucent, unhealthy, glistening with sweat.

 ANDERSON                          Rose.  Try to drink.

               She pushes the cup away.  She closes her eyes, as if even
               the dim light of the room causes her pain.

 ROSE                          Your wife.  We have to get her here,
                         Anderson.

               She opens her eyes.  Anderson doesn't like the feel of this.

 ANDERSON                          Why?

 ROSE                          I don't know ...

 ANDERSON                          What are you seeing?

 ROSE                          Glimpses, Anderson.  Please.  We
                         have to get her here.

 ANDERSON                          You're scaring me, Rose

               She covers his mouth with her hand

 ROSE                          Stop talking.  It uses me up.

               For a long time, Rose says nothing, Her gaze is locked onto
               a distance beyond the room.  At last, she speaks.

 ROSE (CONT'D)                          In three minutes your wife will take
                         a walk ..

 DISSOLVE TO: 
 INT. JUDICIAL CENTER - ALEXANDRIA -- LATER 
               Lisa sits in her office.  But she can't stand it, the sitting
               and waiting.  She has to move.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 94. 

               She gets up and hurriedly leaves her office

 INT. JUDICIAL CENTER -- MOMENTS LATER 
               Witwer walks past Lisa's SECRETARY toward the open door of
               Lisa's office.

 SECRETARY                          Sir?  I'm sorry, she stepped out for
                         a few minutes.
                              (beat)
                         Sir?

               Witwer stares into the empty office.  There is a clock on
               Lisa's desk.  His eyes fix on it.

 EXT. JUDICIAL CENTER ALEXANDRIA 
               Lisa moves quickly down the steps of the white marble
               building.  She takes a deep breath, then heads down Jefferson
               Boulevard toward the city.

               A sleek black TRANSPORT with two Precrime officers in it
               follows her from a discreet distance.

               In the sky above, the ubiquitous Precrime hovercraft

 INT. CITY STREET ALEXANDRIA 
               Lisa walks down the street.  She hugs herself, barely aware
               of her surroundings.  She passes by stores, restaurants,
               payphones, video kiosks ... oblivious.  People push past
               her.

               On a street corner, as she waits at a red light, the payphone
               beside her begins to RING.  If she hears it, she gives no
               indication.  A KID reaches for it, listens, hangs up.

               She walks on.  Stores.  Restaurants.  An art gallery.  As
               she comes abreast of another PAYPHONE, it suddenly starts to
               ring.  This time Lisa glances at it.  But again, walks on.

               The TRANSPORT weaves through traffic, nearby She walks past
               the K.L. Lawrence Graphics Museum.  And another restaurant.
               And a PAYPHONE.  And this time, finally, when it, too, RINGS,
               she turns and looks hard at it.

               A man begins to walk over to it.  Lisa almost knocks him out
               of the way to get to it.  She grabs at the receiver.

 LISA                          Hello?  Hello?

 ANDERSON'S VOICE                          I need you.

               Lisa's forehead sags against the side of the payphone.  She
               basks in the sound of him.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 95. 

 ANDERSON'S VOICE (CONT'D)                          It's 1:03.  Set your watch, exactly.

               Lisa pushes the buttons on her digital watch as she listens
               LISA Okay.

 ANDERSON'S VOICE (CONT'D)                          This is what you have to do ...

               We now hear ANDERSON continue in VOICE OVER as we follow
               Lisa through a SEQUENCE OF EVENTS ...

 EXT. THE LAWRENCE MUSEUM 
               Lisa walks up the steps of the museum

 ANDERSON (V.O.)                          At 1:07 hang up the phone and enter
                         the Lawrence Museum.

 INT. GRAPHICS GALLERY 
               Lisa walks quickly through a display of 19th century magazine
               advertising.

 INT. GRAPHICS GALLERY 
               The two Precrime officers walk into a room filled with Chinese
               graphics.

 ANDERSON (V.O.)                          At 1:13 the two Precrime officers
                         following you take a wrong turn into
                         a different room, losing sight of
                         you for ten seconds.

               The officers start toward the entrance way to another room,
               then hesitate uncertainly, and go for another entrance way.

 EXT. THE LAWRENCE MUSEUM 
               Lisa hurries down the steps

 INT. A SUBWAY STATION 
               Lisa boards the "A" MagLev train

 ANDERSON (V.O.)                          An undercover transport officer will
                         have received emergency orders to
                         follow you.
 (MORE)                          He's wearing a red tie.  He has short
                         blond hair.



----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 96. 

 INT. THE SUBWAY CAR 
               The blond transport officer with the red tie sits at the far
               end of Lisa's car, watching her.

               At the next stop Lisa gets off.  He follows, not too far
               behind.

 INT. SUBWAY STATION 
               Lisa starts up the stairs.  She looks at her watch, then
               makes herself pause a few moments, to keep within Anderson's
               time frame.  She starts up again.

 ANDERSON (V.O.)                          As you come around the bend, cry out
                         and turn around and slap the
                         officer...

               Lisa does this, and the officer reels back, surprised. At the
               same moment two big men rushing to catch a subway come into
               view, and see this happening.  Lisa starts to run.  When the
               undercover officer tries to stop her, the two men grab the
               officer, and they get into a fight.

               Lisa escapes.

 INT. A TAXI - THE SPRAWL 
               Lisa looks at her watch, then taps the window for the driver
               to stop.  She gets out.

 ANDERSON (V.O.)                          Stay on Ninth street.  Underneath
                         Ninth street is the main power feed
                         for The Sprawl.  It'll mess up the
                         navigational beacon on the hovercraft.
                              (beat)
                         Keep switching taxis.  But stay on
                         Ninth.

               She hails another taxi.  She holds her hand over the
               IdentiScan before it can read her.  The taxi driver looks at
               her, sees her smile, sees the prepaid cash card she holds
               out to him.

 LISA                          Two hundred dollars if you don't
                         scan me.

               It's The Sprawl -- stranger things have happened.  He grabs
               the card, and jerks his head for her to get in.  They take
               off.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 97. 

 EXT. NINTH STREET LATER 
               Lisa gets out of the taxi and looks briefly into the sky.
               It is dense with holographic billboards, skim-jets,
               dirigibles.  Somewhere in all that is a Precrime hovercraft.

               And the neighborhood around her is definitely downscale.

 ANDERSON (V.O.)                          The hovercraft will try to drop
                         altitude, but the air traffic will
                         slow it down.
                              (beat)
                         Precrime loses you.  You'll have to
                         walk two miles.  Don't get scanned.

 EXT. THE SPRAWL 
               Lisa walks hurriedly down a side street.  She stands out in
               her white dress -- a spot of vulnerable color in world of
               black.

               Too vulnerable to pass up.  A MAN in a gray overcoat slides
               out from between two buildings in front of her.  He is not
               coy about his intent.  He comes straight at her, all business.

               Lisa freezes in place.  She looks at her watch.  The man
               grabs her by the shoulder.  When she starts to scream, he
               claps his hand over her mouth, hard.

 MAN                          You bite me, bitch, I'll pull your
                         teeth out.

               Her eyes look around frantically.  He starts to drag her
               backwards into the dark.

               ANDERSON leaps into view, and slams the man's head into a
               light post.  It takes a lot of slamming before lie loosens
               his grip on Lisa.  His legs at last collapse under him.

               Anderson scoops Lisa off the ground.  She hugs him hard.

               Then pulls back from him.  She gives him a look.

 LISA                          Cut it a little close there,
                         honeybunch.

 ANDERSON                          Rose got the street wrong.  She's
                         getting weak.

 LISA                          Rose?

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 98. 

 INT. THE BOARDING HOUSE -- LATER 
               Rose sits up in bed silently watching Lisa and Anderson
               together.

               Lisa needs to touch him.  She keeps a hand on his arm, brushes
               back a loose look of his hair.  Rose is mesmerized by her
               actions.  She drinks in everything, every bit of life.

               Anderson and Lisa are deep in conversation.  They speak to
               each other as if Rose were hardly present in the room.

               Anderson is trying to process everything Lisa has told him.

 ANDERSON                          Two discs.  One fake.  One real.

 LISA                          I don't think there were supposed to
                         be two.  Whoever planned it, wasn't
                         counting on two.

               They are silent for a long time.  Rose watches them work it
               through.

 ANDERSON                          An infallible system.  Every disc
                         ever generated has been true ...

 LISA                          Somebody wants you out of the way --
                         so they make a fake disc.  Who ever
                         doubts the discs?

 ANDERSON                          I never doubted it.  I saw it.  And
                         believed it, absolutely.  I was
                         certain I was going to murder Witwer.

               Anderson is shaking.  Lisa wraps her arms around him.  His
               voice is a stunned whisper.

 ANDERSON (CONT'D)                          I saw the fake, and believed so much
                         in the system, that I saw myself as
                         a murderer.
                              (beats)
                         And the Precogs picked up those
                         thoughts ...

 LISA                          And generated the second disc.  The
                         real one.

 ANDERSON                          A self-fulfilling prophesy.  I
                         believed it was true.  And that made
                         it true.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 99. 

               Anderson and Lisa turn and look at Rose.  She lies curled on
               the bed, her face to the wall.

 ANDERSON (CONT'D)                          Rose.  If all this is based on a lie
                         -the fake disc -- then do I really
                         kill Witwer?

 ROSE                               (beat)
                         We see what we see.  I'm sorry,
                         Anderson.  It's been predicted.

               Such a small voice, delivering a message of such finality

 INT. WITWER'S OFFICE -- MIDNIGHT 
               Lieutenant Glaser tries to get through to Witwer.  Witwer's
               back is turned to him.

 LIEUTENANT GLASER                          We can't take chances, sir

               Witwer doesn't move or answer.

 LIEUTENANT GLASER (CONT'D)                          It happens in less than three hours.
                              (beat)
                         We put you in a hovercraft and keep
                         you airborne -- until after the event.

 WITWER                          The event.

               Lieutenant Glaser shifts uncomfortably

 LIEUTENANT GLASER                          I've been ordered to get you onto
                         the craft.  By force if necessary.

 WITWER                          The event is inevitable, Lieutenant.

	        Witwer doesn't turn around.

 WITWER (CONT'D)                          The Precogs are never wrong.  The
                         event will take place.  I'm a
                         believer.  Aren't you?

 LIEUTENANT GLASER                          I don't leave this room without you,
                         sir.  The Security Panel insists.

 CUT TO: 
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 100. 

 INT. THE BOARDING HOUSE SIMULTANEOUS 
               Anderson and Lisa keep working it, peeling away the layers.
               Rose lies silent.

 ANDERSON                          Nobody could slip a fake disc past
                         Ennis Page Lisa shakes her head.

 LISA                          He was the weak link in the perfect
                         system.

 ANDERSON                          Obsessive compulsive niners can't
                         allow changes in the routine

 LISA                          Something threw him off.
                              (beat)
                         He tried to tell me.  It didn't make
                         any sense.  Something about "spilled
                         coffee."
                              (beat)
                         Someone was in his office with him.
                         And coffee spilled ...

               We stay CLOSE ON Anderson and Lisa as Rose's voice cuts in.

 ROSE (V.O.)                          We were always treated as if we
                         weren't alive.  As if we weren't
                         there.

               The camera pulls back and they are watching her as she
               continues to speak.

 ROSE (CONT'D)                          Even now.  You forget that I'm here.
                         You talk between yourselves.  And
                         when you need me to see into the
                         future, then you turn to me.

 ANDERSON                          Rose.  What is it?

 ROSE                               (beat)
                         We weren't just lost in the future.
                         We were in the Chamber, too.  Our
                         eyes were open.  In the present.

               And then Anderson gets it.  He kneels beside her bed

 ANDERSON                          Your eyes were open.  What did you
                         see, Rose?

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 101. 

 ROSE                          Who would I have told?  Who ever
                         talked to us?  Who cared that we
                         could talk?

 ANDERSON                          Rose.  Who spilled the coffee?
                         Straight ahead ...

               Rose stares stright ahead ...

 MEMORY HIT 
               Rose sits in her chair in the Precog Chamber.  Her brothers
               sit in their usual places on either side of her.  The
               technicians tend to them.

               Rose's eyes are open.  She sees everything in the room.  The
               technicians, the machines ... and across the room a large
               window where she can see Ennis Page working the mainframe
               computer.

               Rose watches through the window ...

               As the computer emits discs, Page gathers them

 ROSE (V.O.)                          Ed Witwer entered Page's office.

               Witwer carries a mug of coffee.

               Ennis Page goes red in the face, stares at the coffee.  Speaks
               to Witwer, angrily, pointing to the coffee.  We can't hear
               the words.

 ROSE (V.O.) (CONT'D)                          Page was so upset at the sight of
                         the coffee.

               Witwer goes to put the coffee down on a small table.  It
               tips, and spills.

               Page looks like his head will explode.  He pulls a neatly
               folded white handkerchief out of his back pocket and drops
               to his hands and knees and begins to obsessively blot at the
               coffee stain on his spotless rug.

 ROSE (V.O.) (CONT'D)                          Ed Witwer took a disc from his pocket,
                         reached over Page and put it in one
                         of the open cases.

               Witwer closes the case.  He looks through the window into
               the Precog Chamber, but the only one watching him is Rose --
               and what does she matter?

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 102. 

               Page rises angrily from cleaning the rug.  Witwer shrugs in
               apology and leaves the room.  Page stares after him.

 BACK TO SCENE 
               Rose is weeping.  She looks at Anderson and Lisa.

 ROSE (CONT'D)                          I didn't understand what I'd seen.
                         And I had no one to tell ...

               Lisa puts her arms around Rose Anderson tries to comprehend
               what he has heard.

 ANDERSON                          Ed ...

               Lisa turns, and speaks softly to her husband.

 LISA                          The perfect system -brought down by
                         a cup of coffee.  My god.

 ANDERSON                               (long beat)
                         He set into motion his own death.
                         He didn't know it would go this far.
                              (to Rose)
                         What makes me leave this room?  If I
                         stay here I won't kill him.  Right?

               But Rose and her brothers have already answered that question
               for him.

 CUT TO: 
 INT. WITWER'S OFFICE 
               Lieutenant Glaser looks at his watch.  Witwer is still in
               his chair, turned away from him.

 WITWER                          You see, if you think you can put me
                         on a hovercraft and save me, then
                         you don't believe in the infallibility
                         of the Precog system.

               Lieutenant Glaser has his orders.  He begins to approach.

               And as he does, Witwer swivels his chair around, and lifts
               the weapon he has been holding and silently shoots Lieutenant
               Glaser in the forehead.

 WITWER (CONT'D)                          And what I do not want around me,
                         are nonbelievers.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 103. 

               Witwer steps over the body as if it doesn't exist, and walks
               out of the office, locking the door behind him.

 EXT. THE PRECOG ENGINEERING LAB - CHEVY CHASE, MD -- LATER 
               Witwer gets out his car and looks at the two story concrete
               building that houses the lab.  The lights are out in all the
               windows except the back section of the second floor.  There,
               the lights burn brightly.

               Witwer sees Precrime officers posted at intervals around it.
               He smiles as if he knows something they don't.  He looks at
               his watch.  It is a cool night, but his face is slick with
               sweat.

               He walks to the entrance of the building.  An OFFICER 1s
               startled to see him.

 WITWER                          Things quiet?

 OFFICER                          Sir.  Should you ... be here?

 WITWER                          There's been a development.  A body's
                         been found in the Sprawl.

 OFFICER                          Anderson's?

 WITWER                          They're checking it out.  I need to
                         see what the Precogs have seen.

               Witwer is IdentiScanned.  The door opens and he goes in.

 INT. THE LAB 
               Dr. Resfield looks up as Witwer strides into the lab, carrying
               a tv under his arm.  Witwer is the last person he wants to
               see.

 WITWER                          Borrowed this from the technicians'
                         lounge.  You don't think they'll
                         mind, do you?

 DR.RESFIELD                          You shouldn't be here, Director.

               Dr. Resfield's eyes cut to a large digital clock on the wall,
               the red numbers ticking off time in seconds.

               Witwer looks for a plug, finds one.  Plugs in the tv.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 104. 

 WITWER                          No, no.  This is exactly where I
                         should be.

 DR. RESFIELD                          You're under a lot of strain,
                         Director.

               Witwer finds what he's looking for -- the continuous loop of
               his murder by Anderson.  "Call Now!  Call Now!"

 WITWER                          And tv's so good for that -- soothes
                         the mind.

               Witwer turns his sweaty face to Resfield and gives him a
               bright smile.  The scientist looks like he wants to run out
               of the room.

               Witwer takes him by the elbow and guides him toward the
               Precogs.  Two technicians hover over the Precogs adjusting
               IV's and turning dials on the Precogs's organic helmets.

               The Precogs wince and shiver with each turn of the dial.
               But they are no longer violently seizing -- they are too
               weak for that.

 WITWER (CONT'D)                          Bring me up to speed, Doc.

 DR. RESFIELD                          We're getting nothing from them.

 WITWER                          And that's because ... ?

               Witwer still grips him by the elbow.

 DR. RESFIELD                          I don't know.

 WITWER                          Do you think they know where Anderson
                         is?

 DR. RESFIELD                          It's impossible to tell.
                              (beat)
                         We've done everything.  Maybe even
                         too much.

 WITWER STARES AT THE PRECOGS 
 WITWER                          They know how to find Anderson for
                         me.
 (MORE) 
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 105. 

 WITWER (CONT'D)                               (beat)
                         They're the perfect machine, Doctor.
                         You just have to know which button
                         to push.

 INT. BOARDING HOUSE - THE SPRAWL 
               Rose looks like she's on fire.  Anderson wets another towel,
               wrings it over the sink.  Lisa takes it, and wipes down Rose's
               face and arms .

               Rose's lips are moving soundlessly.  Her eyes are shut tight.
               She begins to writhe in bed.

 ANDERSON                          Jesus Christ.

 LISA                          Come on, Rose.

 ANDERSON LOOKS AT HIS WATCH 
 ANDERSON                          One hour.  We hold it together for
                         an hour, Witwer lives -- and I'm not
                         a murderer.

 LISA                          She won't last an hour.

               It suddenly looks much worse than that.  Rose's body contorts
               horribly and she arches up off the bed.  Lisa can't control
               her.

               Anderson reaches for her, wraps her in his arms, trying to
               hold and comfort her.

 ANDERSON                          Rose!

               She begins to wail as she thrashes in his arms.

 ROSE                          He's killed him, Anderson!

               Rose stiffens into a seizure posture, then her body goes
               slack.  Anderson eases her back on the bed.  He stares at
               her, stricken.

               Her voice barely leaves her now

 ROSE (CONT'D)                          You didn't save my brother.

               Anderson reels at her words.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 106. 

 ANDERSON                          Did he kill both of them, Rose?
                         Rose!

               Rose manages to speak, one last time.  Her whispered words
               damn him.

 ROSE                          Does it matter, Anderson?

               Anderson rises.  Looks down at Rose.

               It matters.  He starts to move, quickly.

               Lisa takes hold of his arm.

 LISA                          If you leave this room...

	       Anderson kisses her.

 ANDERSON                          Then I'm a cop, just trying to do
                         hisjob.

               He reaches for his duffel bag.

               When the door closes behind him, Rose turns her head slightly
               and looks.  And then her eyes drift closed, as she goes to a
               place deep within her own mind.

 EXT. A STREET - THE SPRAWL - MOMENTS LATER 
               He passes by several cars on the street.  But they're all
               auto-drive, they won't do him any good.

               So he smashes a store window within forty-five seconds a
               city police transport zooms up, lights flashing.  Two city
               officers leap out of the transport.  They approach the
               smashed-in store window, weapons drawn.  Which is a mistake.
               Anderson rises into view behind them, and sonically blasts a
               small crater in the sidewalk they are standing on.

               As they trip and fall, he is already spraying them down with
               BindFoam.

               Their second mistake is they left the engine running to power
               the bank of Nits -Tracker lights on the car's hood and roof.
               Anderson screeches off through the choking predawn streets
               of The Sprawl, a beacon of light in the darkness.

 INT. THE LAB 
               The DIGITAL CLOCK races through time.  Witwer reaches his
               hand up and touches the vanishing numbers.

               The camera pulls back, and we see Dr. Resfield and the two
               technicians bound and gagged in a heap in the corner.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 107. 

               And when we see the lab in its entirety, there sprawled on
               the floor in front of his chair is one of the Precog brothers.
               A small rise of blood comes from a torn place in the back of
               his skull.

               The other Precog sits very still in his chair.  He is still
               connected to everything -- his helmet is in place, the TVs
               drip into him.  His eyes are open, and when Witwer moves,
               the Precog's eyes follow him.

               Witwer can feel them on him.  He turns around.

 WITWER                          Is he coming?  No?  Yes?  Maybe?
                              (beat)
                         I think yes.

               The Precog looks at him.

 WITWER (CONT'D)                          And you think yes.

               Witwer points to the tv screen, running Anderson's murder of
               Witwer.  Witwer smiles triumphantly.

 WITWER (CONT'D)                          Infallibly, immutably yes.

               The Precog looks at him.  Witwer's smile vanishes, and
               suddenly strides across the room, and claps his hand over
               the Precog's eyes.  Then he turns, and stares again at the
               clock.

 EXT. THE PRECOG ENGINEERING LAB 
               Three officers stand thirty feet apart in front of the
               building, facing outward toward the parking lot, weapons
               cradled in their arms.

               Behind them is a line of yew bushes.  AS we watch, the officer
               on the left is yanked off his feet backward into the bushes.
               Several moments pass, and the same thing happens to the
               officer on the right.

               The officer guarding the front entrance casually looks right.
               Then he looks hard.  He grips his weapon tight, and swings
               left.  No one there, either.

               ANDERSON drops him hard, from behind.  The officer crumples
               onto the cement.

               But Anderson's not done with him.  Anderson lifts him up,
               struggles to drag him forward toward the entrance.

               Anderson holds him upright in place.  The man's head lolls
               backward.  Which is.  Perfect for what Anderson needs to do.
               Anderson reaches his fingers towards the man's closed eyes.
               He pulls up on the eyelids.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 108. 

               An IdentiScan over the entrance clicks on and reads the man's
               eyes.  Access granted, the doors HISS open.  Anderson enters
               the building, dragging the officer with him.

 INT. THE LAB 
               Anderson enters the lab.  The very building sickens him.
               What he sees sickens him even more.

               The remaining Precog sits strapped into his chair.  Witwer
               sits beside him in the other Precog chair, the dead brother
               at his feet.  Witwer wears the dead Precog's helmet.  His
               hand is in his lap, holding a gun.

               He grins when Anderson appears.  He takes off the helmet,
               drops it on the floor.

 WITWER                          I figured, since I can see the future,
                         too, maybe I could get a little disc
                         action going.
                              (beat)
                         Just kidding.

               Anderson stares at his old partner.  Then he looks up at the
               digital clock.  Five-seventeen AM.  Witwer looks too, then
               turns back to Anderson.

 WITWER (CONT'D)                          You find you been doing that a lot
                         this week?  Looking at clocks?
                              (beat)
                         Three minutes to go.

               Anderson turns to the tv.

 ANDERSON                          There's never anything good on, you
                         know?

               Now Witwer smiles.

 WITWER                          There.  That's the old Paul.

 ANDERSON                          You're not the old Ed. You've lost
                         it.

               Witwer rises from the chair, the gun in his hand.

 WITWER                          You lost it.  You went weak in the
                         knees, partner.

 ANDERSON                          I'm not your partner.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 109. 

               Witwer looks at him sadly.

 WITWER                          The air went out of you when Frank
                         D'Ignazio killed himself.

 ANDERSON                          He was guilty.  I accepted that.

 WITWER                          No you didn't.  The doubts were
                         creeping in on you.  The lab trying
                         to engineer more Precogs ... Malcolm
                         pressuring you to expand ...

               Witwer reaches out and gently touches the remaining Precog
               brother's cheek.

 WITWER (CONT'D)                          Belief is the basis of the system.
                         It was your job to be the ultimate
                         believer.

               Witwer is breathing hard.  He lifts a hand and wipes the
               sweat from his face.

 WITWER (CONT'D)                          And when Frank died, you faltered.
                         I'm a cop, I see into the hearts of
                         men.
                              (beat)
                         And the thing about you is, you
                         wouldn't have just walked away.

 ANDERSON                          Never been my style.

	      Witwer gives him the flicker of a smile

 WITWER                          Precrime needs to grow.  You would
                         have stood in its way.  The Security
                         Panel wouldn't have understood that.
                         What you're capable of.  What a
                         bulldog you are.
                              (beat)
                         Look what you've been doing to us
                         all week.  Amazing.  You're the best.

 ANDERSON                          So you took matters into your own hands.

 WITWER                          I understood the threat.  I understood
 YOU 
               Anderson looks at the dead Precog

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 110. 

 ANDERSON                          You killed a Precog.  You ended the
                         system you wanted to protect.

 WITWER                          Wrong.  This lab will make more.
                         Believe it, Paul.

               They look at the CLOCK.  Five-nineteen.

 ANDERSON                          Knowing the exact moment of your
                         death -it's made you crazy, Ed.

               Witwer looks at the tv.  The TV REALITY is almost in synch
               with what is happening in the room.

               Witwer lifts his gun -- and then realizes something is
               terribly wrong.

               Anderson is standing there before him just as he is on the
               disc -- except there is a major difference.

 WITWER                          You sonofabitch!

               Anderson lifts up both hands

 WITWER (CONT'D)                          You didn't bring your gun!

 ANDERSON                          That's right.  No gun.

 WITWER                          You see?!  That's exactly what I'm
                         talking about.  You don't Believe!

               Anderson just looks at Witwer, raging at him.

 WITWER (CONT'D)                          The system is infallible.

               ANDERSON Doesn't Seem to be Witwer reaches behind him and
               pulls a second gun from out of his belt.

 WITWER (CONT'D)                          I guess that's why I've always carried
                         two.

               He tosses the gun to Anderson.  It clatters at Anderson's
               feet.

 ANDERSON                          You can't have it both ways.  You
                         don't want to die.  That's why you
                         lured me here -- to kill me first.

 ANDERSON (CONT'D)                               (beat)
                         But it you don't diet the system is
                         flawed, and you couldn't live with
                         that.

               Witwer SHOOTS him once, in the right thigh.  Anderson cries
               out, falls to the concrete floor.

 WITWER                          Pick it up

               Anderson speaks through his teeth ANDERSON It doesn't happen.

               Witwer looks frantically at the tv, at the clock.

               He reaches over and opens the dripmeter on a piggy back IV
               feeding into the Precog's main line.  A thick, yellow fluid
               begins to flow toward the Precog's jugular vein.

 WITWER (CONT'D)                          You're killing him, partner.

               And what choice, finally, does Anderson have?  He reaches
               for the gun.

 ANDERSON                          Let's not do this, Ed Witwer trains
                         his gun on Anderson.  Anderson trains
                         his gun on Witwer.

 ANDERSON (CONT'D)                          Oh, Ed ...

               Witwer lowers his gun.  And stands there between Anderson
               and the doomed Precog.

               The yellow liquid has almost reached the Precog's jugular.

               Anderson shoots Witwer, once in the heart.  Witwer is thrown
               back across the room, against a wall, beneath the clock.

               Anderson drags himself to the Precog, and rips the yellow IV
               out of the main line.  The yellow drips onto the floor,
               mingling with Witwer's red.

               Anderson crawls to his friend, and cradles him.  Witwer
               whispers something, and Anderson leans close to hear him.

 WITWER                          Now do you believe?

               Anderson pulls away from Witwer, and lets him take his last
               breaths alone.

 DISSOLVE TO: 
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 112. 

 DARKNESS 
               And then, slowly emerging from the mists of darkness, a pale,
               beautifully proportioned FACE.

               It is Rose's face.  The camera pulls back and we see that
               she is lying on a grassy hillside.  Her brother is lying
               beside her.

               They are looking up at the night sky, at a sky filled with
               stars.

               Rose stares up into the sky, and speaks in a soft voice to
               her brother.

 ROSE                          James.  Can you guess what I'm
                         thinking?

 JAMES                               (beat)
 NO. 
               James smiles.  And then, after a long moment, so does Rose.

 THE END
